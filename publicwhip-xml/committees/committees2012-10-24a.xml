We have received correspondence relating to today's meeting from the Department of Education and Skills.  We asked the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish whether the teachers' unions wanted to participate in today's examination.  It did not accept our invitation and its views will be encompassed in the presentation to be made by the congress at our meeting on Thursday, 1 November 2012.  Documents relating to today's meeting comprise correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; regarding the payments of allowances, correspondence from 22 October 2012 from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; regarding his opening statement, and further correspondence from him.</p><p>  In respect of the work programme next week, I understand the D&aacute;il will not be sitting next week, although that decision must be made tomorrow.  The main speakers on Wednesday are Deputies Connaughton and McCarthy, while the main speakers on Thursday are Deputies Nash and Donohoe.  Are those two sittings agreed?</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery to turn off their mobile phones because the interference causes difficulty with the transmission of the meeting.  That interference was particularly noticeable yesterday.  Yesterday, we had an ongoing issue with the transmission of the meeting due to mobile phones.  We were getting messages from the media telling us that they could not reproduce for transmission what was going on here.  Those who are looking at these hearings find it difficult to use the material afterwards because of the interference caused by mobile phones.</p><p>  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

The unions would prefer to be represented by their congress, which will happen in the course of the hearings.  They did not want to be represented individually.  We must respect this because what they say may impact on some of the negotiations that take place outside of this room.  They can either come themselves, which they chose not to, or be represented in the further discussions we will have with congress, which is a fair point.  I would not like it to be understood that they refused to come; this is not the case.  It is just the way they are represented in other Departments is different from how they are represented in the Department of Defence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400004#C01100"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to be here today.  Together with my colleagues I am happy to assist it in its examination of public sector allowances in so far as they relate to the education sector.  As requested by the committee, the Department has supplied detailed information on allowances in the education sector.  It might be helpful if I present an overview of this material and put a context around allowances as paid in the sector.</p><p>  In its analysis, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took a cross-sectoral approach to allowances payable in Departments and state agencies.  Leaving these aside, in broad terms the sector can be divided into the school sector, the institute of technology sector, the university sector, and the VEC sector.  The overall pay bill inclusive of allowances for these four areas is &euro;5.116 billion.  Of this overall figure allowances, however defined, account in aggregate for approximately &euro;639 million or 12.5% of the overall pay allocation.</p><p>  Allowances paid to teachers account for approximately &euro;616 million or 96% of the overall amount paid as allowances in the education sector.  This equates to 16% of the overall teacher pay bill of &euro;3.83 billion.  These allowances are paid in various combinations to virtually all of the approximately 58,000 teachers in the system.  In the range of allowances paid to teachers, four are dominant in terms both of scale and amount.  It might be of assistance, therefore, if I give some insight into these.  The four allowances in question are those payable for qualifications, substitution and supervision, posts of responsibility, and the 35 year service allowance.</p><p>  Teachers have been in receipt of qualifications allowances since the Ryan report on teacher pay in the late 1960s.  In large measure, this report used the qualification allowance as a mechanism for making recommendations on teacher pay, which would avoid public service-wide repercussions.  Until the introduction of a cap on the overall amount payable in December 2011, the amount of this allowance was linked to the nature of the qualification held by the teacher and ranged from &euro;5,539 for a teacher with an honours degree and higher diploma in education to &euro;6,638 for a teacher with a higher diploma in education and a doctorate.  Following the introduction of the cap, the overall qualification allowance payment for new beneficiaries was restricted to &euro;4,426.   More recently and following the review of allowances, qualification allowances for new entrant teachers were abolished.  As part of this measure a new pay scale is being put in place for these new entrants, with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the existing teacher pay scale.</p><p>  The origin of the allowance for substitution and supervision was the protracted industrial dispute over the period from 2000 to 2002.  The ultimate negotiated settlement to this dispute involved putting in place a new regime for the delivery of substitution and supervision with an associated allowance, which in current terms is &euro;1,592 per annum.</p><p>  Allowances paid for posts of responsibility are broadly analogous to promotion posts in other areas of the public service.  Such allowances relate to four types of post, namely, principal, deputy principal, assistant principal and special duties post.  It is very debatable whether these are allowances in the commonly understood meaning of the term.  That said, we will review this post structure and look at issues such as the feasibility of a grade-based structure as opposed to the current arrangement.  There is no doubt this raises issues, such as the fact that a principal's allowance reflects school size and that principals assume that role at various stages in their career as a teacher.</p><p>  The fourth largest allowance payable to teachers is the 35 year allowance.  This becomes payable to teachers ten years after reaching the maximum point of the pay scale and is comparable to a long-service increment, paid in many areas of the public service.</p><p>  In teaching there are a range of other allowances and the details have been provided to the committee.  Outside the teaching area there is a very wide spectrum of allowances principally in the university and institute of technology areas.  These are payable across a wide spectrum, and at &euro;22 million they account for 1.7% of the &euro;1.29 billion total pay bill for those sectors.</p><p>  Committee members have in their possession the various business cases established by the Department as part of the review of allowances conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition, the material provided by the Department provides further detail on the categories of allowances grouped by business case as requested by the committee.  These categories are, in turn, disaggregated in a more detailed spread sheet provided for the assistance of the committee.</p><p>  Following the review of allowances, the Government has approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.  In terms of the teaching profession, the impact of the Government decision will apply to new entrant teachers only.  The Department will shortly issue circulars giving effect to the Government decision.  Allowances already paid to currently employed teachers are not directly affected by the Government decision.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has recently directed that line Departments should open discussions with individual union groups on the removal of certain allowances from current beneficiaries.  The process, which is one of negotiation, has commenced.  This process will involve the examination of more than 80 allowances currently paid in the education sector.

I will begin my questions to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on something he said at the end of his statement.  I am interested in what is meant by current beneficiaries of allowances.  Recently the Minister made an announcement that 88 allowances for current beneficiaries in the public sector were to be reviewed.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; spoke about 80 allowances in the education sector alone.  Are we discussing the same process?</p></speech>

With allowances for which a prospective case for retention in the hands of new beneficiaries was not advanced, logically there is a question mark with regard to those allowances in the hands of current beneficiaries.  That is the logic of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform position.  There is a reality which that scale of allowances will have to have with regard to timescales and negotiations.  We envisage starting the process in the very near future with a focused number of such allowances.  We have not made a final call on those yet.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of this but the objective is to commence the element in the near future and achieve some finality by the February deadline.</p></speech>

The business cases for many of the allowances initially submitted began with an indication that the allowance is considered core pay and under the Croke Park agreement it would not be discussed for current beneficiaries but rather for new entrants.  Decisions were made in that respect.  If it is not a new process, will the Department return with new terms under which to make the case?</p></speech>

There is a range of examples, including the Gaeltacht and island allowances.  There may have been circumstances when they first came into being and in our judgment they no longer obtain.  With a range of other allowances they were deemed effectively to be part of core pay.  To define core pay, we took a general view that if an allowance is generic - paid to everybody within a grade - it is much more likely to be categorised as part of core pay.  If an allowance is paid to a subset of people for particular duties and so on, it would not be as clearly part of core pay.  The business cases were divided into those which should legitimately be retained and those which should not be retained in future.  The exercise now under way relates to the second category, for which there was not a case prospectively, and we are now commencing a process of seeking to negotiate their removal from current beneficiaries.</p></speech>

It arose from the lengthy industrial relations dispute from 2000 to 2002.  Prior to that, supervision and substitution had been undertaken on a kind of grace and favour basis by teachers.  At second level in particular, teachers withdrew that grace and favour basis and we had to move to the position of giving schools money to employ supervisors for pupils outside classes.  Arising from that we entered into detailed discussions with the unions and agreed a scheme whereby they would take responsibility for 37 hours of supervision and substitution in return for a payment.  Where teachers did not opt into the scheme, we give the schools a grant to employ supervisors.  That is the basis and it applies in a different way in primary and post-primary schools because of the nature of the primary school day, where there is full class contact time, as opposed to secondary level, where there is typically 22 hours of class contact time.  The supervision could be yard supervision before or after school but it could also apply to classes where a teacher is unavailable.</p><p>  It was subject to a Comptroller and Auditor General review with regard to the 2007 and 2008 school year.</p></speech>

For that they would make themselves available for duties such as yard supervision at a primary school during their lunchbreak on a given day.  In a secondary school where a teacher's absence resulted in a free class, another teacher would come in to watch over the class.</p></speech>

For many years it was seen as the job of a teacher that, where a colleague was sick, for example, another teacher would supervise the class, or a teacher provided yard supervision for, say, one lunchbreak every three weeks depending on the number of teachers.  What was the change in circumstances that led teachers to think that supervision was no longer part of their job?</p></speech>

One might argue the rights and wrongs of this view, as indeed I probably would.  It was given on what they would have described it as a grace and favour basis.  That came to a crunch in a particularly bitter industrial dispute back in the early 2000s, which many will remember.  Industrial action meant teachers withdrew from the duty.  The State then was obliged to bring in outside people to undertake the supervision work.  It was a real challenge to government pay policy.  Ultimately, the negotiated settlement was one where an allowance was put in place for substitution and supervision work.  It was technically optional for a teacher to decide whether he or she would undertake the work and receive the allowance but the majority of teachers bought into the scheme.  It had the benefit, from the point of view of the State and the system, of providing a better substitution and supervision service that was no longer reliant on a principal asking a teacher to do something on an almost voluntary basis.  There was now greater certainty but undoubtedly there was a cost attached.</p></speech>

Has that work been called in?  The Comptroller and Auditor General queried whether those hours are being used.</p></speech>

Following the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and as part of the Croke Park agreement in its initial negotiation, we extended, from two to three, the allowable number of periods per week during which teachers could be called upon.  The effect means it is significantly more likely that the 37 hours will be called on in full.  School budgets for alternative substitution have also been restricted.  We are more optimistic about it now.</p></speech>

These teachers are supervising and substituting for other teachers who are not present.  If the full 37 hours per year are being used, why do we have 41,500 teachers?  There seem to be many hours of absenteeism.</p></speech>

We can talk separately about teachers' sick leave.  I am not sure that we have the figures in front of us at the moment.  To be fair and from recollection, sick leave is not out of kilter in any significant way with absentee or sick leave rates elsewhere in the sector.</p><p>  There are two dimensions to the allowance: the provision of substitution and supervision.  The latter arises for a multiplicity of reasons such as preschool and lunch breaks.  Even if one has a teacher who is delayed in the morning, whatever the circumstances, and arrives at 10 a.m. rather than 9 a.m., there will be a call for substitution and someone must take the class.</p></speech>

I think the first day of uncertified sick leave is not covered.  We have also taken action where there were high levels of permissions for uncertified leave days.  They were reduced to a maximum of seven per year.  A number of different changes have made an impact on teacher absences.  The substitution arrangements are permitted only for particular absences such as certified leave and maternity leave.</p><p>  There is another aspect which makes the teaching profession different from other professions.  If a civil servant is absent from his or her job, he or she does not have to supervise and manage a class.  There is a need for someone to be physically present when a teacher is not available.  The same does not apply to other areas of the public sector.  I am not saying that the work of other areas of the public sector is not important.  It is just that it is possible for a Civil Service unit, for example, to split its work up for a day, but with teaching, someone needs to be present for a class or else that class must be split up.  To be fair, in schools where we do not provide substitution, classes are sometimes split up.  It is one of the strategies such schools use.  The Department does not want them to do that or at least only in very limited circumstances.</p></speech>

Is it not accepted under the salary at that point?  The Department could have said that it was expanding the contract and not taking the grace and favour approach, that these were part of core responsibilities and part of core pay.</p></speech>

Looking back to 2000, one of the teacher unions - ASTI, I think - was seeking a 30% increase in pay.  It is inconceivable in today's terms.  There was a significant dispute and a real concern, on the part of the Government, that if anything was conceded over and above the general pay settlement, it would effectively unravel the Government pay policy at the time.  Whatever was conceded at the time, it would not have been tactically prudent to have conceded a salary increase.  That was the genesis of the ultimate settlement, travelling by way of an allowance.</p></speech>

Some 80% of the education budget is locked into pay and we cannot consider it in the cuts we are trying to make.  Is this not a concession the Department could make, potentially saving &euro;100 million?  Before 2002, until ten years ago, it was part of the responsibilities of teachers and they were not paid in addition.  The Department could say that it is going to look at it again because it is covered as part of salary and other allowances in the system.  Most teachers receive some form of an allowance according to the matrix provided in Appendix B.  The Department could explain that this is the situation we are in and that we must go back to the way things were ten years ago.  The Department seems to have decided not to pursue that.</p></speech>

We can change teacher allocations and not replace teachers who retire.  Just because pay makes up a certain percentage of the budget does not mean there cannot be reductions in the pay budget without touching pay rates.  It is an important point.  The measures introduced in recent years, as well as the Government measures relating to pension-related deductions and pay, teacher and other education personnel allocation decisions resulted in reduced numbers working in the education sector.</p><p>  On Deputy Eoghan Murphy's second point, we have a position where a number of teachers do not want this to be part of their core functions.  Some 5% have decided not to do it and we have an issue in that respect when considering a future approach.  If we bring this back within the pay structure, we would require them to undertake duties they are not happy to do.  Typically, we would have to bring the amount into the salary.  We have done so for new entrants as we have slightly changed the conditions attaching to the supervision and substitution.  This applies to more than 95% of new entrants who, given that they are starting their careers, are opting for supervision and substitution.  We consider the starting salary for new entrants to be the first point of the new scale plus supervision and substitution.  In the case of existing teachers, we have had discussions in the context of the Croke Park agreement about supervision and substitution and the agreement is that teachers will agree to make themselves more available under the Croke Park discussions on hours.</p></speech>

In negotiating new contracts, I would not be so worried about the 5% or less given that the majority of the workforce accepts this is something that must be done.  They are happy to do it.</p><p>  In the provision for the teachers coming in, the allowance and the extra hours they have decided to take on, the Comptroller and Auditor General was concerned that the figure of 37 hours was not being met.  The assumption is that there was not a need for the 37 hours but now the Departments suggests there is a need for 49 hours.</p></speech>

We reduced it significantly.  Initially, the Government removed the category of official school business and then allocated a few million because schools found it very difficult to cope.  Many school management bodies indicated there would be difficulties in keeping schools open in January 2009 if a small amount of substitution was not available.  We reduced the categories in order to ensure the 37 hours is maximised at second level.</p></speech>

We reduced uncertified sick leave, whether someone could pay for a substitute to come to the school.  We made it much tighter when schools are bringing in substitutes that are separately paid in order to encourage schools to use their allocation of 37 hours.  The schools report to us that teachers have undertaken 37 hours.  If funding is available for the grant at the end of the year, we offset that against the following year.  We have a number of mechanisms to ensure this is the case.</p></speech>

The Department has increased the number of hours for which teachers are available but perhaps they are not being called on to fill the hours.</p></speech>

The allocation of 37 hours is a post-primary phenomenon only and it was needed at post-primary level because we do not have the class teacher occupying the class for the full day.  There is no doubt the regime of substitution and supervision as it existed at primary school level in 2002 was a great deal more satisfactory than what obtained at second level.  We have a concept of the common basic scale for teachers' pay at both levels.  Primary and second level teachers have been remunerated equally for many decades.  In 2000, there was a real issue of whether we would seek to apply an allowance only to the second level sector, thereby breaking the common basic scale and, probably in perception terms, be seen to reward unions that had embarked on industrial action while we did nothing at primary level.  That was a tactical issue at the time.  The tactical call of the Government was to maintain the common salary scale and structure for both and, in the process, get greater certainty on primary level, albeit where needs were not as great.  I entirely acknowledge the point of Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  When we look at this, we ask what is the extra provided at both levels.  There is no question that the extra has greater tangibility at second level but these were the factors at the time, leading to the approach we took.</p></speech>

Individual schools make their own call on whether the needs for supervision are greater than the needs for substitution.  There can be different balances within schools.  Schools may have circumstances such that they do not need a great deal of yard supervision.  In that context, a greater amount of the fund is available in that school for substitution purposes.</p></speech>

I thank them for helping us in our consideration of allowances.  We all know it is a complex area.  I think this is one of the most straightforward areas.  In truth the word "allowances" has been applied to qualifications, supervision, posts of responsibility and management duties.  In my opinion the word "allowances" is a misnomer, they are a payment for work being done.  Other areas may not be as clear.  Generally, a school principal must be paid more than the normal teacher's salary and the fact that it has been called an allowance means we must discuss it at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, but it is part of pay.  There are probably historical reasons for calling it an allowance.</p><p>  Of the total 58,000 teachers working in schools, some are in receipt of much higher allowances.  I wish to comment on the appendix A which sets out sample positions.  In example No. 4, this teacher on a basic salary of &euro;59,000, has an honours HDip, a PhD qualification, a supervision and substitution allowance and is a principal of a large post-primary college and secretary to the board of management for which he receives an allowance of &euro;53,186.  The allowances are 47% of the total gross salary of &euro;112,545.  Would there be many principals or teachers with salaries of more than &euro;100,000?  Is that a real case?</p></speech>

What we were trying to do is take a spectrum.  One is looking at a school of 1,500 to 2,000 pupils.</p></speech>

There may be a few such cases.  Have the officials a figure for the number of teachers earning more than &euro;100,000?  We regularly table questions on salaries in the public service and we get the figures in the response.</p></speech>

The State Examinations Commission is under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  However the Department formally ran the examinations directly.  There is a process of advertising and inviting application.  People are selected.  There are more applicants than places for supervision, which is more attractive.

Schools are allowed to have unqualified teachers.  Since that time we are looking at the implementation of section 30 of the education Act.  We are looking at the extent to which teachers are unqualified.  A number of teachers are in the process of registering with the Teaching Council to ensure they are registered.  Other teachers are seeking to upskill themselves to become qualified teachers.  In simple terms, the table shows there are 709 teachers who do not have an allowance.</p></speech>

Let us be clear that this has happened in schools.  Anyone who does not realise that this is the case is not aware of what is happening.

I do not have the details with me but we find that it tends to be in respect of the more short-term, incidental substitutions that school principals are contacting retired colleagues.  In the context of long-term substitutions, schools have tended to go with individuals who are not retired.  This would be in respect of more planned substitutions relating to maternity leave or long-term sick leave.  It can be very difficult, either the evening before or on a particular morning, to get someone to act in substitution.  That is, perhaps, where the situation arises.</p></speech>

Teachers are not paid anything extra in respect of such meetings.  There was an agreement, which preceded that concluded at Croke Park, under which teachers were required to make themselves available for a number of these meetings on an after-hours basis.  As part of the Croke Park agreement, we negotiated with the teachers' unions an additional quantum of hours - some 33 per annum - which can be utilised at the discretion of schools, in an after-school space, to get teachers to meet parents and so on.  Previously, schools might have been closed to facilitate parent-teacher or planning meetings.  The need to close schools for these meetings to take place should have diminished greatly.  The type of closures to which I refer should be much less a feature of the system because the quantum of hours negotiated as part of the Croke Park agreement is used for that purpose.</p><p>  The eventual outcome of the benchmarking review was to allow the allowance structure to stand.  I do not believe there was any massive focus on whether allowances should be integrated into pay.  Clearly, this could be done in respect of some of these allowances.  As stated, however, I believe the outcome was to allow them to stand.</p></speech>

We got this document last week.  It is a list of all the allowances and in all the Departments.  On going through it, it becomes immediately obvious that the Department of Education and Skills is the winner.  It is No. 1 in terms of the number of allowances, followed by the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is noticeable that many of the larger Departments have very few allowances compared with the Department of Education and Skills.  My general question is how did the Department end up having a list of 300 or 400 allowances?  I ask the witnesses to explain the historical origins of the processes involved in the Department with regard to the introduction of a very intricate and piecemeal system of allowances dating back to the foundation of the State.</p></speech>

The allowances for teachers date back several decades.  Responsibility allowances and qualifications allowances were introduced in 1920.  Gaeltacht and teaching through Irish allowances were introduced in 1922 following Independence to attract teachers to schools in the Gaeltacht and to those where instruction was given through the medium of Irish.  The children's allowance, which is applicable although it has not been for new entrants for a long time, was introduced in 1926.  Teachers in each sector had separate salary scales and though the scales were relative to each other, the salaries of teachers in secondary schools were highest, those of vocational teachers were second and those of primary teachers were lowest, approximately 9% lower than those of secondary teachers.</p><p>  Moving on to the findings of the Ryan tribunal in 1968, parity in regard to basic salary of all teachers was introduced then, following the report of the teachers' salaries tribunal.  A new salary structure was introduced following its recommendations, including a common basic incremental salary scale and common qualifications allowances and allowances for posts of responsibility.  That is the main part of the history.  The tradition of the separate payments for qualifications and for posts of responsibility and principalships all date back to that time.</p><p>  The other big allowance we have talked about in detail involving a cost of the &euro;118 million is the supervision and substitution allowance which dates back to 2000 to 2002 and the dispute then.  I can talk the Deputy through the various changes there have been since then in those allowances but in terms of the history lesson-----</p></speech>

Many of the allowances are quite obscure.  One could be dealing with an allowance for a particular VEC or an allowance for a meteorological reading.  Many of the Departments did not behave like that.  They did not create an allowance, they dealt with matters in terms of core pay.  The way the Department has dealt with this historically has been completely different from that of many other Departments.  What the Department has ended up with is a pretty complicated piecemeal system that is archaic but Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; would probably not agree with me on that.</p></speech>

We talked about the supervision and substitution allowance.  Apart from that, we would not say we are any different from any other sector in terms of the variation in the small allowances we have.  The reason the spotlight is on the educational allowances is that those four big groups of allowances make up such a big proportion of teacher pay.  It is done like this in many countries.  The reason we have additional allowances for responsibility for positions of deputy principal, principal and so on, relate back to the nature of teaching, the long incremental scale and the fact that teachers can take up responsibilities at different stages in their carers.  Traditionally it was considered that this was better.  That has remained the case.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is now examining this.  The most effective way to do that was to give people allowances rather than create a separate salary scale for principal or deputy principal because that would mean that after only five years a teacher might move up to a principal post whereas another teacher might only do so after 25 years, and there are differences.</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, in the 1920s there was a two-year diploma in the colleges of education.  Qualification and requirements in that respect have increased.  A four-year honours bachelor degree is now required for entry into the teaching profession.  Therefore, requirements for entry into the profession have increased over time.  We have sought to ensure that teachers upskill and we consider that to be very important.  All international evidence shows that the outcomes from education depend on the effectiveness of the teaching of teachers.  We very much support the upskilling of teachers and the qualifications allowance can be seen in that context as well.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said the vast majority of them are pensionable if the person stays in that position, and if it is foreseeable that someone would stay in it.  I do not believe that in the case of many of these allowances that are pensionable one could foresee that somebody would stay in that position, for example, the warden of Trinity Hall allowance, the personal medical consultant on-call allowance and the transport liaison officer in the VECs allowance.  That amounts to &euro;300,000.  I am not sure one can make that deduction.  How would Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; make that call with regard to a pensionable allowance?

Only about 2% of our pay bill comprises these smaller allowances.  That is not atypical of the public service.  In terms of the warden of Trinity Hall, and I know there is a specific person, that is not pensionable and that allowance is personal to the holder.  When that holder departs from the job that allowance will not be in place.  We have worked through a lot of processes with university allowances.</p><p>  The transport liaison officer, TLO, allowance is pensionable.  We are in an industrial relations process currently with the chief executive officers of vocational education committees because that responsibility has ended.  We are in the middle of the various industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  We hope to have an outcome of a hearing on that in November and therefore we cannot talk in too much detail about that.  There are a couple of legal cases around that also but we are working on ceasing that where we can.</p></speech>

It was introduced in 2001 for teachers in the two VECs who are wholly or mainly employed in the teaching of apprentices.  It was introduced due to the fact that the main bulk of apprenticeship instruction is delivered by academic staff in institutes of technology but in these two cases it was delivered in those settings.</p></speech>

What is the process?  Is it senior officials dealing with the unions in many cases?  What is the typical process with regard to the origin of these allowances?  Is it done by ministerial order or legislation? How have these arisen since the foundation of the State?  Was it someone within the Department dealing with the unions in particular?</p></speech>

In terms of the ones that go to teachers, there is a structure called the Teachers' Conciliation Council which is an industrial relations forum to deal with teacher issues of an industrial relations nature.  That is probably the forum where a claim would first be initiated and behind that forum there is adjudication and ultimately, arbitration which can be binding in its effect.</p><p>  To come back to why it would happen, sometimes it would be a good idea to give an allowance as opposed to the alternative.  An example might serve this question.  If there is, say, a general operative grade and the generality of people are engaged in work of a broadly similar nature but a particular need arises which is by any standards significantly above what would be sought from others - let us say somebody is working a piece of elaborate machinery - essentially one has two choices.  If that payment is integrated into the rate for the grade, everyone gets it and that would be folly.  One would not want to do that.  One might have a second choice which would be to create a new grade.  That leaves one with a situation where there would be a huge multiplicity of grades.  There are negatives in that as well because people might have a restricted concept of what their work is and so on.  In some circumstances the solution, assuming the case is bona fide, would be to pay by way of allowance, which essentially visits the benefit on the individual who is doing the work rather than creating an artificial lift, so to speak.  That is probably-----</p></speech>

I disagree.  It is a recipe for disaster.  In terms of any deviation from his core purpose with regard to work there is an avenue that is acted upon by a union, in some cases by a particular VEC, to start negotiations with the Department to seek an additional payment or allowance.  That is how it appears to me.  I understand Mr. Burke's point but I disagree with it.  What his Department, his predecessors and different Departments have done is created an avenue for the creation of allowances that in some cases can no longer be justified.  Historically speaking, I would come at this from a different perspective.  It is convoluted, archaic and does not stand up to modern times with regard to the way government should be run.  I am not taking away from the job people do within the education sector but administratively and fiscally, this list does not make sense.</p><p>  With regard to the Croke Park agreement, the Department is negotiating approximately &euro;16 million out of the &euro;600 million and therefore we are talking about a limited number of these allowances being in play.

I am aware of some of the changes happening in schools in my constituency as a result of it.

We touched on this already.  There are also additional working hours in the higher education sector.  This results in increased teaching and lecturing time and the effective elimination of school closures.  We are doing a verification exercise with the schools and hope to have the result in the near future.</p><p>  We estimate that teachers are working 2 million additional hours, thereby reducing the amount of school planning and the number of staff meetings during tuition time, and reducing the incidence of school closures.  We have a costing for that but I will not refer to it now.</p><p>  Within higher education, flexibility in the organisation of working time has been a very significant issue.  Lecturing staff are available to deliver an additional two hours of lectures per week, resulting in a saving of 150,000 hours.  Under the terms of the agreement, there is a new revised contract for academic staff in the universities, which provides for additional time and facilitates teaching and learning in the universities.  There are 100,000 additional hours.</p><p>  The reduction in budgets in the face of the increase in student numbers has enabled the institutions to live within funding, although they are extremely challenged in this regard.  We have reduced the number of posts of responsibility in schools by approximately 6,000, effectively by filling them only in very rare cases.  We put in place some very effective redeployment arrangements.  This means that, as pupil-teacher ratios have increased, or other teacher allocations have decreased, we have been able to redeploy.  This has been working very effectively at second level, resulting in the redeployment of 262 teachers, the surplus at the start of the 2011-12 school year.</p><p>  We have very effective redeployment arrangements at primary level.  There were some in place already but we have managed to enhance them.  We have introduced a number of key initiatives.  The single student grant scheme is an example of a shared service being introduced.  There is much common procurement, especially in higher education.  We are moving on to consider shared services.  I could elaborate further but what I have said suggests the high level of activity.</p></speech>

There can often be one-way traffic when we are discussing the Croke Park agreement.  It is healthy at the outset to list some of the examples of change management in the sector in these difficult times.  It is important to acknowledge this.</p><p>  Let me return to the issue of supervision and retired teachers re-entering the classroom.  This is a bugbear of the taxpayer and every new young teacher.  What is the official position of the Department on supervision?  I understand that if a teacher rings a school principal at 8.55 a.m. to say he or she will be out for a day owing to sickness, the principal is obliged to find a teacher quickly.  In this instance, there is a little more justification for ringing a former teacher down the road, although I do not accept it.  What are the actual criteria of the Department and what does the circular state?</p></speech>

That does not include retired people.  The schools are asked to draw from this list in the first instance.  It is only in circumstances where this is absolutely impossible that a retired person can be called in.  This is preferable to calling an unqualified person and the approach is reasonable.  The unqualified person would be last to be called.  There is no doubt that this position has been espoused strongly because issues arise as to the capacity to legislate in this area.  It would be legally tricky.  I would not underestimate the impact of retired staff being classified as new entrants.  Effectively, in financial terms, the incentive for people who are retired to return to school to do supervisory work has been diminished considerably.  The main measure is probably the very strong exhortation of schools in this regard.  One should not underestimate the peer-pressure dimension.  Given that so many young teachers are looking for jobs, schools would be quite brave to bring back retired staff if there were a number of young teachers available locally and perhaps known to the principals.</p></speech>

The Secretary General should outline the reason the cost of substitution has grown so much in recent years from an estimation by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2007 of approximately &euro;50 million to approximately &euro;118 million in 2011.  The second and more important question is what guarantees are in place that these hours are being met?  Does this not remain the responsibility of school management?</p></speech>

It is approximately at the same level and while there actually have been some reductions in the substitution and supervision allowance, we also have more teachers.  However, the spend is approximately the same.  Arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we tightened the reporting requirements from schools in respect of both the use of the hours by teachers and the use of the grant by the school where teachers were not opting in to the substitution and supervision scheme.  These arrangements have become a lot tighter following the review.  Moreover, in the year in which the review took place, the Department had not tightened up on substitutions to the same extent.  We reduced the availability of substitution in certain instances.  We reduced its availability for official school business, in particular, which has put the onus back on schools to ensure the 37 hours are maximised.</p></speech>

I meet a great number of public servants and teachers in my clinic who tell me they feel very aggrieved that allowances are being discussed when, in their view, their allowances effectively are core pay.  Those responsible in the public sector, both at political and Civil Service level, never really grappled with the issue of rectifying core pay and therefore, we have this complex, convoluted system of allowances.  What work is under way in the Department to streamline allowances?  For example, I refer to the qualification allowance.  One takes it as a given that one expects all teachers to be qualified.  The Secretary General has outlined to the committee that the Department is weeding out unqualified teachers and that work is ongoing in that regard.  Why can the qualification allowance not form part of core pay?  Does it not constitute core pay?</p></speech>

It is more difficult to do this for existing teachers because they have a range of allowances.  It would not be on our priority list for abolition for that reason.  There is a range of payments and individuals may already have their doctoral degrees.  I acknowledge not many have doctoral degrees, but they may have a masters degree.  Consequently, to seek to have a standard amount, we would be obliged to move to a middle amount, which would involve decreasing some and increasing others.</p></speech>

However, we are not yet at the stage where we even have an agreed approach on which we could have discussions with the unions.  It is a highly complicated issue because someone may have moved to be a principal after a small number of years and, therefore, the question arises of placing them at an advantage, if one has in place a scale for principals.  However, we certainly are looking at the matter.</p></speech>

People get other allowances which should not be called allowances for taking on additional responsibilities and acquiring additional qualifications.  One gets them in the private sector also.  Then there are the others which potentially drag down the system, although I acknowledge they might only account for a relatively small proportion.  I was looking through some of them which can be found in the supplementary business case submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I refer to Nos. 86 to 89, the eating on-site allowances.  Is this literally an allowance people are being given for eating in their workplace where there is no canteen facility?  I note that in the case of maintenance staff in County Dublin VEC, 69 staff are getting it.  While it is not pensionable, it is costing us &euro;34,224.  In the case of the DIT, 170 staff are getting the eating on-site allowance, at a cost of &euro;80,750.  There is a much smaller amount recorded for the caretaker in County Mayo VEC of &euro;1,496.  Workshop attendants in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology also are mentioned.  The delegates should explain what is the eating on-site allowance.</p></speech>

Consequently, they would be required either to go out somewhere else or to return to base and lose time.  In the VEC sector and among other employers in the education sector where this is done, it usually is parallel to or a follow-on from the local authority sector, in which such a practice may have been approved by Labour Court or in arbitration judgments and so on.  In general, they have arisen from a decision or an adjudication, rather than an agreement.</p></speech>

Not to speak for him, I refer to the concept espoused by Deputy Deasy to the effect that some allowances have sprung up.  The committee needs to try to get a handle on whether there is an element of some local sectors within the education system perhaps being more proactive in the pursuit of allowances than others.  This is a subject to which members may need to return.  However, I find it hard to believe it is just one caretaker in a single VEC who does not have somewhere to eat lunch.

It would not be usual for the administrative side of the VEC to push this issue.

In fact, the education sector has a very limited number of such allowances, certainly in money value terms.</p></speech>

I refer to allowances paid in the VEC and institute of technology sectors, namely, the junior caretaker allowance, the senior caretaker allowance and then another junior caretaker allowance.  The witnesses should explain what are these allowances for which there are total annual costs of &euro;25,000, &euro;15,000 and &euro;29,000.</p></speech>

Much of this has its history in the fact that this pertains to general operatives and higher order attendants who are relatively low-paid staff.  While the Deputy should not hold me to the precise details, at some point one of these groups of staff received a pay determination that leapfrogged them ahead of another group.  Thereafter, use was made of the joint labour committee mechanism.</p> <p>There were mechanisms put in place to give allowances across multiple sectors and adjust for that without creating a <i>scala mobile</i>of people moving up pay scales all the time.  That is from where those allowances tended to come.</p></speech>

First, the allowances are badly named.  I accept there may be a historical reason but if one were to tell the taxpayer that maintenance staff get a dirt money allowance, it does not exactly instil confidence.  Second, the taxpayer would wonder what additional duties are involved in this allowance which would not be part of the day-to-day job of maintenance staff.  The dirt money allowance and the eating-on-site allowance, for example, are a reflection of a system, particularly when the country had the money, that failed to put in place proper and more simple pay structures.  As a result, we have this convoluted system.</p></speech>

In the Department of Defence the interaction between unions and management worked well and it provided an interesting partnership dynamic.  That is what the committee is doing in examining these allowances.</p><p>  Up to 90% of teachers, 58,000, in primary, secondary and the vocational education committee schools, are claiming two allowances.  It strikes me that the bulk of this is actually core pay.  What is the percentage of teachers with honours degrees?  Teaching is one of the more noble professions.  Having a good body of teachers is key to the future.  Everyone will agree that, on reflection, one of the people who made a significant impression on us when we were growing up was a good teacher.  Having a good body of teachers cannot be undervalued.</p><p>  However, we need to have an allowance system that is evolving.  For example, with growing obesity among young people, there does not seem to be an allowance to encourage teachers to get involved in sporting activities in school.  In many cases, sports coaching in school is done by teachers staying back after school with no allowance.  I feel the teachers&rsquo; representative bodies are not putting forward realistic proposals for these allowances and the sporting case is one example of this.</p><p>  Many of these allowances should go but it must also be realised many of them are core pay.  Around the whole debate about the Croke Park agreement and allowances, there has been a terrible lack of common sense.  When we discussed allowances with the Department of Defence, we noted many of them were outdated.  In the case of the Department of Education and Skills, some of them go back 90 and 100 years.  I would like some of these allowances to be redirected into areas such as tackling obesity through sporting activity.</p><p>  We have tremendous teachers and schools.  We should use the Croke Park agreement as a vehicle to achieve a fit-for-purpose sector.  It should not be about going for the headline figures in allowances which in many cases are not material amounts anyway.  They may look good for the media but they show very little.  I want to see value for money for the taxpayer, parents and children.</p><p>  The qualifications allowance makes up 44% of all allowances.  Along with the supervision and two management allowances, they make up 95% of all allowances.  In essence, this is core pay.  While the Department may see it is a management position, these allowances have done a disservice to those working in the public sector.  There are also allowances that should go.</p><p>  Is there any allowance to encourage teachers to get involved in sport for children?  Why is physical education not part of the primary school curriculum?  When schools take on a substitute teacher, they seem to take on retired teachers.  Why can they not take on unemployed teaching graduates?  Is there a monitoring system in place to ask schools to explain why they took on a retired teacher instead of an unemployed graduate as a substitute teacher?</p><p>  Where does the Department stand on the arbitration process on the allowances submitted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  There is much brouhaha around the Croke Park agreement.  It must be accepted these allowances are part of core pay.  The exercise the committee is conducting should remove those allowances that are outdated or unnecessary.  However, those involved in core pay should be re-analysed as reimbursements.  Allowances should also be updated to deal with the modern schooling environment.  Can allowances be redirected to provide, for example, information and communication technology or second foreign language teaching?   I want to see these allowances becoming fit for purpose.  I want to see the public sector churning.  We have tremendous talent within the teaching profession which I have seen with my own children&rsquo;s experience of it.</p></speech>

It is individual teachers and it is the culture in individual schools led by principals.  Individual teachers make the difference by running the team or whatever.  We have some substitution available for that during the school day but much of this activity takes place outside the school day and we are indebted to those teachers.</p></speech>

I want a school system that is fit for purpose.  Children are going into a world in which ICT is very important.  Sport is also very important for a range of reasons, including individual social skills and general fitness and the future costs to the health system.  Has the Department considered ensuring schools allocate some of their budgets to recruit PE teachers?</p></speech>

I do not say we do not have an interest; we have a keen interest in ensuring health promotion and so on.  A number of areas in the curriculum are vital but individual schools also have to have their own take on these things.  For example, in the junior cycle reform, on some of the short courses, schools may decide to focus on particular aspects of the curriculum but we cannot control from Athlone, Tullamore or Dublin what individual schools do.  We have an enabling framework in place.  Our aim is an increasingly enabling curriculum with schools making choices and teachers being empowered within that.  To be fair, the teachers and the principals do this and we have all seen great examples of teachers doing activities outside schools as well as compulsory activities such as parent-teacher meetings.  I refer to the engagement with children.  That is very important.</p></speech>

There may be genuine cases where it is not possible or feasible to bring in an unemployed, newly-qualified teacher, which should be the priority.  Can the Department put a monitoring and control process in place?</p></speech>

A number of things are about to happen in the not too distant future.  We are moving to a situation where schools will only be empowered to pay qualified registered teachers.  We have issued circulars relating to the requirement that schools prioritise unemployed teachers and so on.  There is an inevitable progression to getting into a greater publication space in due course in regard to these matters but we also need to be conscious in doing that.  We do not want to pillory schools that have no other choice on a Monday morning, such as schools in a remote location, that cannot get anyone and if they do not get the retired person in-----</p></speech>

The substitute teacher issue would be rectified by putting a process in place whereby at the end of every month, the principals give a reason they employed a specific teacher.   The Department sees the payments going through.  That would be transparent and it would give comfort to the principals.  I ask the officials to take this on board.</p></speech>

It is helpful for these discussions because it is all about the detail, as I have learned during the three days we have been examining allowances.

Officials present the choices and other people make the decisions.  It is not the case that they or their predecessors set out to create a system such as this independent of the fact that Ministers head up Departments.  They are present to respond to questions regarding the implementation of this and give their views.  I say that in response to comments made earlier.</p><p>  I refer to the different examples in appendix A of the documentation and a theme other colleagues and I have been probing during these sessions, namely, the allocation of allowances per income cohort.  I ask the officials to give us an understanding of where the recipients of the allowances are.  I would like to double check one issue, which is the payment of degree allowances.  When I look at this sheet in five years, the payments for the qualifications will be gone for new teachers who are being hired at the moment.  Am I correct in that assumption?</p></speech>

As one moves up the scale, stripping out what in truth are not allowances but promotion posts, having regard to the fact that qualifications will no longer be a feature of the landscape, yes, the reality is that the proportion of allowances accounted for in one's overall pay diminishes as one goes up.  They are progressive in that.</p></speech>

I will ask for two small pieces of additional work that the witnesses might share with us.  I ask them to produce a table similar to appendix A showing how things might look in five years when more of our new teachers are within the system.  I also ask them to produce this sheet and break out the principal's allowance and extra officeholder's allowances from the analysis.  This will allow us to see clearly where the allowances are going by income and by tier for school staff.</p></speech>

I would add, looking at the examples and percentages, that although it goes up from 15% in the example, in fact the average allowance in the teaching cohort as a whole is 16%, but because of the allowances coming in with increased responsibility we wanted to give worked examples showing the different types of increased responsibility.</p></speech>

I say we should take that piece out in order to understand the situation now and for the future.  A conclusion that could come out of our work is greater clarity on where exactly the allowances go.  I would be grateful if the witnesses could share that with us.</p><p>  Having clarified that, I wish to return to a point Mr. Burke made earlier in the session.  He talked about the pros and cons of dealing with additional work through allowances as opposed to moving people on to new salary scales.  I ask him to outline again the merits and demerits of that general policy choice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400016#P01300"><p>The first thing to say is that we would all like a situation in which people are very flexible in the type of additional work they will take on, but in the best of all worlds there are limitations on that and ultimately there are legitimate limitations.  I was using the example of a general operative.  Let us say we have thousands of those and we want one of them, or a number of them, to do kango hammer duties or something that is significant, additional and onerous, for which we acknowledge additional recompense is required or is justified.  Let us take it we have made those leaps and concluded that this warrants more.  My thesis is that to consider upgrading the pay of all general operatives so that anyone we ask to do this would now have to do it would be folly.  We do not want to do that.  It would be very costly - needlessly costly.  That is one route.  We rule that out.  The second possible route is to create a new grade of general operative kango hammer.  We do not want to do that either because there would genuinely be a lot of public criticism and we would be having another session of this kind in ten years' time in which the Deputy would be asking us how come we have 10,000 grades in the public service - and he would be right.  So that would be very foolish.  I am working on the premise that the payment is actually merited based on additionality and so on.  The third approach is to pay something called an allowance.  "Allowance" is not a great word now, and maybe it needs to be called something else.  Maybe it is a supplementary pay scale, or whatever.  In policy terms and - to use a phrase that was mentioned earlier - in common sense terms it can often be the best way of doing things.</p></speech>

When we come to redeployment, which is a challenge we are being faced with now and which we are managing quite well with teachers, for grades in the public service it is very difficult.  If there is a temporary allowance for a type of work, it is easier to redeploy somebody so that they do not do that work and they no longer receive a temporary allowance.  However, if they have moved into a specific grade with a specific definition, it makes redeployment more challenging.  I am not saying it would not be possible, but we are actually in the business at the moment - and will be for the foreseeable future - of looking at redeployment as a major issue.</p></speech>

Appendix A gives real-life examples and provides a micro-view of where the allowances go, while appendix C gives the macro-view.  I want to ensure I understand this table.

Before I do, let us look at row 65 of that document where we have the kango money allowance.  This goes to the heart of the difficulty we face, which is that one has an approach that covers a head of department allowance and then under the same "allowance" heading, one finds the kango money allowance.  Three people within the education sector are in receipt of that allowance.  Do we still need allowances like this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Crosby" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400017#Q02000"><p>Tool allowances remain quite common for general operative grades across local government, health and education.  Again, those are three individuals in a particular university.  The university has probably christened it a kango hammer allowance because that is what they are doing but it is a variant on the tool allowance concept that is still widely used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400017#Q02100"><p>If we were to draw a curve of the number of people in receipt of an allowance and the cash value of the allowance - perhaps we should do this as part of our report - we would find the high value allowances which lots of people are drawing and then it would tail off and leave a very long tail of lots of allowances that only a few people claim, like many of those here.  That long tail is where much of the difficulty lies.  It creates a perception among taxpayers and those who comment on this that a very large amount of allowances are being claimed.  However, they are being claimed by very few people.  Is there not an alternative way of tackling something like, for example, the kango money allowance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.412" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400017#Q02200"><p>The better way is that instead of having differentiated kango hammer and power drill allowances, one would have a greater grouping of allowances and, by definition, less of them.  That is something that might be more understandable to the public.  I see the Deputy's point that there is a difficulty with the public perception of some of this.  Probably the biggest element and what accounts for the vast bulk of the money is allowances that are very proximate to core pay.  If the preponderance of a grade are all drawing a certain type of allowance, the reality is that for that grade, because that allowance pretty much obtains for everyone, it is about getting as close to core pay as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102400017#Q02300"><p>That is why I spent the majority of my time trying to tease out matters.  If we were to assume that a principal's allowance is not really an allowance, which is the point made by Mr. Burke and which I accept, and we stripped that out from our analysis, we would see a situation where the vast majority of the allowances, given that the degree allowance will change, will be received by people who are not at the top of the teaching apex.  They are not principals, assistant principals and so on.  They are either in the classroom or doing additional duties within third-level colleges.  It is not just a question of perception.  One concern I would have is that where there is a kango or dirty money allowance, it could create the feeling that if I do something else, I am entitled to an allowance for it, for example, if I wielded another kind of hammer.  I do not want to feed into the clich&eacute; of this debate.  I am just using it as an example to make the point.</p></speech>

If the Croke Park agreement means anything, it must mean much greater preparedness to go outside the lines of demarcation.  As a public service we should require this in any event and therefore allowances, or any extra payment mechanism which obtains for the future, should logically only apply in a situation of real stretch where there is something significantly additional that almost takes a person's activity out of the realm of his or her grade so to speak.</p></speech>

A point on which we should deliberate is whether the existence of some of these allowances runs opposite to the spirit the Croke Park agreement is trying to develop, as Mr. Pykett said.  I am on the board of management of my local school.  My children are in a primary school and I am also involved with secondary schools in my constituency.  We have fantastic teachers and more than many others, they deal at the front line with the social consequences of the trauma the country is in.  There is a great degree of sensitivity among them to the discussion we are having at present and I understand why.  I hope anybody watching this will have seen us try to understand the allowances and make points grounded in data.  We have tried to tease through this.

Earlier I stated the vast majority of allowances are pensionable.  The vast majority of allowance payments are pensionable.  Many of the smaller allowances are not pensionable, as members will see from the information.  I do not want anyone to misunderstand.  Overall, the allowance spend is mostly pensionable but quite a few of the smaller allowances are not.</p></speech>

This is the point on which we must move the debate forward.

The Bill has now commenced its legislative passage through the Oireachtas, with Committee Stage to be dealt with shortly by the Select Committee on Education and Social Protection.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Gerry Craughwell, president, Mr. John MacGabhann, general secretary, Mr. Declan Glynn, assistant general secretary, Ms Bernie Judge, education research officer, Mr. Paul Whelan and Ms Ciara O'Donnell, executive committee, Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI; and Mr. John Stewart, national adult literacy co-ordinator, Ms Olive Phelan, adult literacy learner and Mr. Denis McBride, National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA.  Apologies have been received from the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, which had sought to join us in our discussions on this issue but for which the date of the meeting was not suitable.</p><p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by this committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled, thereafter, only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Gerry Craughwell of the Teachers Union of Ireland to make his presentation.</p></speech>

The TUI position in this regard was set out in its submissions to the 1992 Green Paper on Education and the National Education Convention 1993.  The TUI submission to the round table discussions in 1994 set out arguments for local democratic education structures based on political, economic, social, equity, effectiveness and efficiency principles.  Further information in this regard is available for members to read in the TUI's submission to the joint committee.</p><p>  The TUI submission to the National Education Convention states:<blockquote>We see the provision of a free, co-educational, non-selective, multi-denominational service as a duty of the State.  We believe that this can best be done through a network of local educational authorities...which (would) subsume the role of VECs.</blockquote>Subsequently, the TUI supported the rationalisation of vocational education committees, VECs, recommended by the Commission on School Accommodation Needs, which led to the order for the amalgamation of the town VECs with their counties in January 1997.  In that process, teachers had to adapt and accommodate to change.  Similar flexibility and change will be required of teachers in the current process of establishment of education and training boards, ETBs, and the extension of their further education and training role, consequent on the establishment of the envisaged new further education and training authority, SOLAS.<br /><b></b>No group of teachers has experienced more change than vocational teachers.  It is important this is recognised and managed appropriately, having regard to the concerns and perspectives of the teachers and the Teachers Union of Ireland, the recognised trade union representing the vast majority of staff employed by VECs.  With regard to the treatment of staff of vocational education committees transferring to education and training boards, the TUI is gravely concerned with the diminution and-or elimination of existing contractual and statutory rights and entitlements and considers that the approach of Government in this regard is unwarranted, excessive and unjustified.  The TUI notes that in relation to contracts other than contracts of employment, the education and training board steps into the position of the dissolved VEC and is liable for the performance of any existing contracts.  No such protection is afforded to contracts of employment, however.  With the limited exception provided in section 63 for the staff of institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology, Part 1 of the Bill,<b></b>section 4, provides for the repeal of all VEC Acts and statutory instruments commencing in 1930 and up to 2005.  In so doing, fundamental rights conferred on staff by statute have been removed, including, most specifically, rights in respect of suspension, dismissal-removal from office and continuation of payment of wages during a period of suspension.</p><p>  The support of the TUI for the rationalisation of VECs is not unconditional.  In the 1990s, the union's support was enabled by appropriate safeguards set down for staff at the time.  It is interesting to examine the guarantees made available to serving staff at that time <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i> those now being made available under the current Bill.  The stated purpose of the 1997 order in respect of the amalgamation of the Borough of Wexford Vocational Education Committee area and County Wexford Vocational Education Committee area is also provided in our written submission to the joint committee.</p><p>  The structure described in section 55 of the current Bill represents a radical departure from the order mentioned in the Wexford case and from previous legislation where a teacher was moved from one legal entity to another.  Section 55 appears to ignore entirely the purpose and intent of the European Union directives dealing with transfer of undertakings.  In the preamble to Directive 98/50/EC, referring to the Social Chapter adopted on 9 December 1989, it is stated that the completion of the Internal Market must lead to an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in the European Community.  The Council Directive makes it clear that it is necessary to provide for the protection of employees' rights in the event of a change of employer.  The purpose of the directive is to ensure the employees retain their jobs, seniority and continuity and conditions of service.</p></speech>

We seek clarity in respect of the groups from which the additional four persons under the remaining subsection of section 28 would be drawn.  Specifically, we request that recognised trade unions and staff associations be included among the nominating groups.  We welcome the provisions in respect of the filling of casual vacancies on the boards and the disqualification from ongoing membership of an education and training board of a person who ceases to be a member of the staff of that education and training board.  What has transpired is that a difficulty has emerged in VECs where persons resign their employment but remain as members of boards.  In our submission we query the waiver on the requirement that parents' representatives on education and training boards would be parents of children enrolled in one of the schools or centres under the aegis of a VEC.  It is incongruous that a parent on the education and training board could be required to live in proximity to the ETB but the section would facilitate a parent from any other part of the country being a member of a local education and training board on the nomination of an association.  That creates a difficulty.</p><p>  The sole category from which gender representation on education and training boards will derive assuredly is the parent representative constituency group.  We believe that the principle of gender balanced representation should be extended to each of the sub-categories from which representation is drawn.</p></speech>

The Freedom of Information Act applied to vocational education committees and we request that it apply  in the context of the establishment of education and training boards.  We look forward to the parallel legislation on the establishment of SOLAS.  We are very concerned that it had been intended to bring forward in the general scheme of an education and training boards Bill last year an amendment that could lead to the criminalisation of teachers, punitive sanctions, including custodial sentences, arising for teachers in the event of alleged unwillingness to co-operate with the Department's inspectorate.  This is highly inappropriate and a retrograde step.  We are looking to the committee to protect us against any such amendment coming forward on Committee Stage.  It has been withdrawn from the Bill but we are alarmed to read the remarks on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills at the session on 16 October.</p></speech>

I am here on behalf of the further education and training board.  There are 200,000 adult learners in further education and training services.  There is no designated seat for adult learners in the Education and Training Boards Bill, yet there are 18 seats on the board.  Higher education students are routinely represented on the board and academic councils of national authorities such as the Higher Education Authority and the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland.  Learner involvement in all aspects of education provision is a core principle of NALA's work and learners have been centrally involved in all NALA board structures for more than 30 years.  Learners have regularly been elected chairpersons of the NALA board.  The NALA board has a student sub-committee, of which I am a member, to inform all its works.  There are many types of learning and adult education.  NALA believes that learners' experiences are vital for the effective organisation of adult education and training provision and that learners should be centrally involved at all levels of the education and training boards.</p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, amended the legislation to allow for two learner representatives to sit on the board of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland.  Why are there no adult learners represented in further education and training services?  The NALA board believes it is essential for adult learners to have a designated place on the education and training boards.  A dedicated adult learners' voice on the board would improve the quality and effectiveness of services, as outlined by the Minister in the House on 5 July 2012, and make education and training boards more learner centred and inclusive.  We demand a seat and to be represented.  After all, we represent 200,000 reasons for a seat on the board.</p></speech>

I thank the TUI representatives for their initial presentation and going through it in such depth.  There will be an opportunity for us at look at it in more detail as time did not permit them to go through it all.  They have outlined serious concerns from a teacher's point of view in respect of the impact of the changes in the Bill, not just the structural changes and the amalgamation of VECs and expanding the role of the education and training boards, and how it will impact on staff currently employed by those VECs.  Some pertinent issues have been raised which the committee will be required to explore with the Minister as the Bill proceeds.</p><p>  We discussed previously how VECs deal with teachers and the increasing issue of casualisation of employment.  I am aware from a previous discussion with the TUI that up to 35% of teachers in the VEC sector are not permanent.  In respect of the establishment of the education and training boards can anything be done to address that issue, as VECs are amalgamated, and bring about more security for teachers?  It has been a growing problem for staff in the VEC sector and will have a long-term impact in terms of attracting graduates and ensuring that a viable livelihood and career is available for those who decide to enter the profession.  </p><p>  Will the representatives comment on the proposal to amalgamate the F&Aacute;S training element with the VECs under the oversight of the education and training boards?  How do they see the benefits or otherwise of the ETB proposals in bringing all that sector together?  </p><p>  I thank the NALA representatives for their presentation.</p></speech>

It was important not to rush Committee Stage.  We have completed Second Stage but it was wise for the committee to have the opportunity to meet some of the groups before starting to deal with the amendments.  In fairness to the Minister he has stated in the House that he is willing to ensure the amendments are published in time to allow the committee members to digest them and take them on board and in order that they can come back to him with any queries.  He has indicated that he will bring forward several amendments.  One amendment was referred to in the conclusion of the presentation which could have real and serious consequences if and when it comes before the committee.  This was despite it being omitted when the Bill was published.</p><p>  There is an issue with the membership of the ETBs.  When the general scheme of the Bill was published I read through the submissions on ETBs.  I noticed that many of them focused on the particular make up of the ETBs.  It was somewhat disappointing that he Minister did not take on board some of the observations.  The published Bill is more or less the same as the general scheme and this is posing some problems, especially with regard to the four community representatives.  This will affect the type of representation and experience that will be needed for ETBs.  Adult learners are in one category and there is almost a hope that adult learners will get one of those four posts but there is no guarantee.  The make-up of the board will be the subject of much focus and many amendments on Committee Stage.</p><p>  The TUI presentation focused on the role of teachers within ETBs, the repeal of all previous Acts and some of the attendant consequences.  I realise the TUI submission outlined some possible impacts but perhaps the delegation could go into a little more detail on that section.</p><p>  The Minister has indicated he will table one amendment on Committee Stage.  Will the delegation offer a view on that?  What would the likely impacts be on teachers if the amendment is taken and incorporated into the Bill?  Perhaps the TUI representatives will focus on these two issues.</p><p>  I realise NALA is seeking support for an amendment to specifically state that adult learners would have one of the four positions available.  Many groups are looking at the four final positions and the make up of the boards.  We have received representations from IBEC, which holds that the business community should have a position on the boards.  Perhaps this is a question for both organisations here today.  Is there any merit in extending the four positions or tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to categorise how each of the four positions should be divided up, whether among adult learners, union representation or IBEC and so on?  What are the views of the delegation?</p></speech>

The TUI submission is remarkably extensive and it will probably take some time to digest the variety of issues addressed.  Due to time constraints the delegation was not in a position to go through them in greater detail.  Nevertheless, I understand the sentiments expressed.</p><p>  I welcome the representatives from NALA.  I will be tabling an amendment to get an adult learner on the ETBs.  Literacy is a civil right and it is one of the greatest issues in our country at the moment.  We must complete the circle but we have no real potential to tackle the issue of literacy from all stages of education and the life cycle unless we get the life experience of an adult learner who has dealt with the issues so eloquently outlined by the NALA delegation today.  I will table an amendment and I hope it will be accepted and that NALA will have an adult learner on the ETBs.  I believe that is justified.</p></speech>

I will provide some indication of the extent of the problem at the moment.  The membership of the TUI is running to 30% of fixed term, that is to say, non-permanent teachers.  I understand that the membership of ASTI is in the same region.  At second level more than at primary level casualisation is a crisis unfolding.  Almost without exception this situation relates to teachers who come in as new recruits to the sector and who in the first instance are not getting permanent positions and in the second instance are not getting full positions.  They are getting fragments of jobs, bits and scraps, an hour here and an hour there but spread throughout the week such that other entitlements are denied them.  They hold these on sufferance for a year under a fixed-term contract. They hope to get subsequent fixed-term contracts for a period of at least four years in total and sometimes into a fifth year, to eventually scramble over the line under the fixed term legislation of 2003.  Then they get permanency but, by and large, they are getting permanency on part-time hours.  We have members living on what anyone would describe as extreme income poverty.  That is the truth of the matter.</p><p>  These people come to us day by day.  It is bizarre but we are looking to get them permanency for an impoverished part of a job.  That is the truth of our situation.  This is damaging quality.  It is producing a churn in terms of education personnel and this in turn disturbs every school which is attempting to provide a consistent service.  The child of anyone here could end up in the course of his second level education having four, five or six teachers for the same subject in the course of the six years.  This is the way things are developing.  From now on these people will spend six years without payment to get into second level teaching but after that period we want them to have at least the prospect of a decent living.  We want the schools where these teachers are appointed to have consistency.</p></speech>

We are seeing people spending, typically, six years which are unpaid but, more importantly, it gets one into a situation in which one has absolutely no security and nothing but income poverty.  What can the ETBs do in this respect?  There are a number of things that can be done.  ETBs will be given an allocation of whole time equivalent positions, as VECs are at the moment.  Each whole time equivalent position should, to the greatest extent possible, transfer to an individual as a full job, not as scraps of a job.  Some employers have become quite cynical.  What they do when they get an allocation of, for example, an additional position is to scatter that allocation across two, three or more people, giving each of them the pretence of a job as opposed to a real job.</p><p>  We have put it to the Department of Education and Skills that, as is the case at primary level, a panel system for fixed-term staff could be established for post-primary staff.  We currently do not have one, but we have a claim which is being resisted by management - not hugely resisted but resisted none the less, because it wants to retain the flexibilities that result in our members, who are new members of the profession, remaining in income poverty.  Through the ETBs, we could revise the contractual arrangements over time so that people who, for example, have a specialism such as physics, which not every school can provide, would be employed to provide the service to a number of schools.  One would have people with a roving brief.  That would address two issues: that of casualisation and that of the provision of broad curriculums in small schools.  This will become extremely important in terms of the curricular changes the Minister is proposing.  </p><p>  Deputy O'Brien raised the issue of the amendment which appeared in the heads of the Bill but does not appear here.  This is an amendment to section 13 of the Education Act, rather than any of the vocational Acts.  In discussion with the Minister and elsewhere, we have described this amendment as positively bizarre.  We understand that there is a need to protect the inspectorate in terms of the discharge of its duty if, for example, an inspector is charged with checking into financial irregularities within a school.  That is fair enough, but where an inspector comes in to do his or her normal job, which is to observe teaching and learning within a school, if it happens to be the case that there is a genuine professional discussion or argument to be had between the school, the principal or teacher being inspected and the inspector, there should be nothing in legislation that would seek to prevent that argument or discussion taking place.  There should certainly be nothing that would criminalise the teacher or teachers for engaging in that.  The word "impede" can mean anything one wishes it to mean and is far too liberal.  We suggest that if an amendment is required, it is not an amendment to section 13 of the Education Act but one to those parts of the Education Act that deal with finances.  If there is to be an amendment and if it is felt that some protection is needed for the inspectorate in the discharge of its duty, a far less heavy hand should be applied to it.  We would ask the committee to give serious consideration to and reject any proposal to reinstate a measure about which there is doubt even in the Department, because it would have already included it had there been no doubt.</p></speech>

The only way to secure an adult learner voice on the ETBs is to provide for it in the legislation.  There is no tradition of adult learner involvement in the current structures and it is our view that adult learners will lose out to other lobbying interests and powerful stakeholder groups.  Providing a dedicated seat through the legislation is the only way to give the learners the respect they deserve, particularly learners who have benefited least from education services in the past.  I was delighted to hear the support from Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, McConalogue and O'Brien for that position.</p><p>  We would not like to be involved in categorising the other seats.  We would simply say it is essential that adult learners have a guaranteed and dedicated seat within the legislation.  We are not just talking about literacy learners.  We are talking about 200,000 adult learners.</p></speech>

I have two or three different points to make.  I will start with adult learners.  NALA is making a very strong case.  Adult learners have a history of being forgotten and we omit providing for them in the legislation at our peril.  If literacy problems are not sorted out early, they will come back to bite us later on as adults and more so as a society.  When the legislation passes through the Seanad, we will advocate strongly to the Minister that this needs to be addressed.  He is a listening Minister and has a good understanding.  However, I am disappointed by the omission of such a provision.  Obviously we will do our best in this regard, because it makes no sense to me.  I commend NALA for continuing its work; it serves 200,000 people, who are only the ones getting help and not the ones we know nothing about.  I do not have a question for the NALA delegation but I would tell it to keep going.</p><p>  The delegation from the TUI presented us with a fairly serious document, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in noted.  Has the TUI met the Minister in respect of the provision of the TUI's vision of free education through local education authorities, which would subsume the role of VECs?  This is a major change which is going down the road of adopting the UK model of provision of education through local education authorities.  I am concerned about that.  I was chair of County Galway VEC at one point.  I had never previously worked in the VEC sector.  I was a primary school teacher and then worked in a voluntary secondary school and as a lecturer in literacy education at third level.  I learned to respect VECs for their diverse provision of education.  I would like to see that specialist local provision continue.  If the ETBs can take that on in a new way to do even better than the VECs, I would be supportive of that.  Could the delegation tell me how they think a local education authority model would be better?  </p><p>  I am very shocked by something I have read here, which needs to be teased out.</p></speech>

If that legislation had been introduced 40 years ago I would have been sent to jail on several occasions.  Regarding what he said about the length of time it takes to get a degree, then a teacher qualification and then a few hours teaching, that is a serious situation.  I have two children at college who want to go on to become teachers.  They are doing the three year course and, following that, they will do the postgraduate certification if it is introduced.  I have told them to have another string to their bow because they will not be able to make a living from teaching.  We struggled in teaching but we made a living from it and were able to raise our families.  I have a great fear that it will not be possible for the new teachers to do that, and that issue must be addressed.</p><p>  I take the other point made about adult education and board representation.  We will examine that and fight for it during the passage of the Bill but there are serious issues facing teachers.  Teachers in the vocational education sector have telephoned me asking if there is an hour or five hours' teaching in Dundalk or a job anywhere.  Those teachers who are looking for hours are from Meath and other areas.  I agree that this is a serious situation.</p></speech>

The dilemma is that they could go back to full-time study but if they have families that is not feasible.  In terms of helping TUI members get their educational qualifications to teach up to the highest level, is the TUI working on ensuring that teachers can do that and work at the same time to allow them get the extra qualifications they need?</p><p>  Second, regarding the issues the witnesses have raised about contracts and so on, is that a matter for the legislation or for parallel negotiations?  They might explain that.</p><p>  Third, an element of the debate is about representation on the board, with which, as a person who is elected, I am not happy.  The VECs had strong representation by local authority members.  Local authority members are elected by voters and in local elections every resident can vote.  They do not even have to have citizenship and therefore the electorate in local elections is spread among the population.  Councillors are elected and they represent local communities.  It would be inappropriate to diminish such representation - which is representation in the elected sense as opposed to carving out seats - in the new legislation, compared to the representation that applied in respect of the old VECs.  The witnesses might have a different view, but that is my position on it.  They might respond to those points.</p></speech>

A member asked about F&Aacute;S and education and training boards.  We are facing three serious changes in the VEC sector in the very near future, namely, the establishment of education and training boards, the establishment of SOLAS and the changes in respect of qualifications.  Any one of those on its own would be hugely disruptive to any organisation but the three together represent a massive change.  We in the VEC sector and the members of the TUI have always shown ourselves to be flexible, innovative and willing to take on change, and that will not change as we move forward.  I wanted to get that point across.</p><p>  On the issue of casualisation, I can give an example of a mother of three who has nine hours of teaching work a week.  She is a single mother, as her husband has left her.  That mother is struggling to survive on those nine hours of work.  We are talking about real people with real jobs and real problems.  These are people who are living in crisis.  Because of the nature of our work, with our hours spread across a five-day week, people such as this mother do not qualify for any form of supplementary welfare.  They do not qualify for family income supplement.  We are talking about serious problems.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague Mr. Declan Glynn to deal with representation on boards and with the impact of the changes on teachers, and I will ask my colleague Mr. John MacGabhann to respond to the other issues that were raised.</p></speech>

At present, teachers have contractual rights in respect of limitations of distances over which they can be transferred and we seek to safeguard those contractual rights in the new dispensation.

However, an example has just been given of a statutory right and other examples have also been given.  I am conscious that the new chairman designate of the Grangegorman Development Agency is due to appear before the committee and, consequently, it is important to proceed with this matter.</p></speech>

Moreover, this is dealt with in section 63 of the Bill because, ironically, these rights are being maintained for the staff of institutes of technology.  Consequently, the right to a sworn inquiry prior to any potential dismissal is maintained for lecturers in institutes of technology and in Dublin Institute of Technology because, decades ago, they used to be employees of VECs.  Ironically, the Bill protects the smallest grouping, who are erstwhile employees of VECs but does not protect current employees of VECs.</p><p>  To answer the other questions, in respect of the casualisation of teaching, one straightforward measure can be taken immediately, which is that when a full block of hours that constitutes a single job arises, there should be no impediment to that work being offered initially, <i>ab initio</i>, as a permanent teaching job.  Even where there are full units of work, permanent whole-time teaching jobs are not being created in the vocational education system at present.  This is despite there being no impediment to so doing and this is a highly significant issue for us.  As for the Chair's own question regarding teachers transferring out of ETBs, on the whole the differences and qualifications between vocational teachers and teachers in the voluntary secondary system are so negligible as not to be a matter of great concern.  Some decades ago, there might have been a significantly greater proportion of teachers in the vocational system who did not possess higher diplomas in education or the current postgraduate diploma equivalent, but that is not the current dispensation.  Consequently, we do not perceive this to be a particular difficulty.  As for the composition of boards, we intend to table three matters.  First, it is an 18-person board and in broad terms, the TUI believes; there should be three thirds, that is, local authority members should comprise one third, one third should come from the teacher and staff side and one third from the parents, adult learners and other groupings side.</p></speech>

I would have thought that ideally, everyone would be elected to it.  Consequently, if one resiles from having that kind of representative, it actually undermines local representation on those boards.</p></speech>

We do not detract at all from the merit of representation that is offered by local authority members.  We are not impugning it in any fashion.  Our point is that in tandem with that, there should be dedicated teacher representation on boards because that constitutes a core professional and practitioner expertise that is being lost and is not being catered for specifically.  While not everyone might agree, we think it a straightforward matter that teachers and other staff of ETBs would have the professional practitioner expertise that would enhance the composition and role of VECs, while not taking at all from the vital contribution that local authority members make.  Moreover, we support strongly the representation of adult students, including further education adult students, and adult learners generally on the VEC.</p></speech>

Anyone who comes out of the teacher training element of college - that is, the professional diploma in education - is required to do 300 hours to get full registration.  The three hours per year suggested by the Senator would take-----</p></speech>

We represented a gentleman to the point where we secured a contract of indefinite duration for him, having had to go to the Labour Court to get his rights vindicated under section 9(3) of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  When he was given his contract of indefinite duration by the employer, it was a contract for zero hours and zero pay.  One gets permanency on nothing, so 100% of nothing is nothing.  It was an absolutely cynical, but unfortunately not untypical, manipulation of existing legislation based on a misreading.  When considering education and training boards, and the provision of education, it is inescapable that consideration must also be given to the people who are concerned with its delivery.</p></speech>

The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet with the chairperson designate in public session to hear his views.  We trust that this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Monaghan and also Mr. Michael Hand who is the CEO of the Grangegorman Development Agency.</p></speech>

It was previously led by Mr. John Fitzgerald, who laid the foundations for the agency which I am trying to follow up on.</p><p>  The agency is taking over a 73 acre site which, hopefully when constructed, will revitalise an area of Dublin city that was not blessed by the Celtic tiger.  It will be merged into the Phibsborough-Grangegorman area as a seamless integral part of the area, not as a separate walled-off town.  This is also a flagship project in the stimulus project announced earlier in the year with the Government fully behind the scheme.  I am an accountant and interested in value for money.  That is the way projects are being conducted these days and how I will approach this particular project.  However, it is also about doing it well and making it relevant to the community at large.  I do not believe in corporate governance; corporate citizenship is also important.  The GDA is actively involved with the community.  For example, the agency has engaged with the community on an Educate Together scheme and other planning projects through consultation processes.</p><p>  The mental health facility is being built out.  I have visited the site more or less once a month since becoming chair and I am glad to say progress over the past several months has increased.  From discussions I have had, this project will be delivered to the Health Service Executive, HSE, for early 2013.  It will be up to the executive to put personnel in and transfer patients to the new facility.  The building is state-of-the-art and is worthy of praise when compared to the building from where patients will be moving.</p><p>  It is a bit longer into the distance as to when Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, will take up possession of its facilities at the site.  The first tranche of students, 1,000, will arrive in 2014 with the second and the largest tranche, 10,000 students, to arrive in October 2017.  Hopefully, the two quads will be built by that stage and fully in place.  The new Luas BDX line coming through Broadstone Gate will enhance transport for students and staff.  The idea is for the site to depend more on public transport.  It will not be like the UCD site but the Trinity College Dublin site, compact by its nature.  There will be 1,150 car spaces but we will not encourage people to use cars to get there.  By 2017, there will be 2,000 units on the site for student accommodation.  The project is SDZ-proofed from a planning perspective so it is part of the Dublin city strategic development plan.  This means the site can be built out over time without third party objections.  The site has won several awards from the American Institute of Architects and Society for College and University Planning.</p><p>  I am a firm believer in the scheme.  I have lived in the area for the past 30 years and seen it go up and down.  This is one project of which the local community is positive and sees making a positive contribution to the area.  The committee is welcome to attend the site and we will keep it abreast of developments there over the next while.</p></speech>

It is important the agency gets the opportunity to put on the record of the House where things stand with this project and the progress made.  I could not be more supportive of this project as it is magnificent for the area.  I am delighted the Government was able to play a role in getting this project back on track after the decisions made over a year ago.  It is a great credit to the agency to see how it has navigated its way through the different challenges that have emerged.  As someone who is always quite sceptical of the idea of having an autonomous agency to complete such a project &ndash; one person&rsquo;s agency is another person&rsquo;s quango &ndash; I have seen the benefits of an approach where a small group of people who are not embedded in any particular Department but understand how they all work can play a role in pushing a project through and dealing with the ups and downs.  It has been a real lesson to me in terms of the role a body such as the GDA can play in a project so large.</p><p>  As part of the recent planning application that was lodged, I have become aware over the past couple of days of some local concerns regarding transport on Rathdown Road and the allocation of coach drop-offs and taxi ranks.</p></speech>

When I arrived at the doorstep of an individual who worked for DIT and gave her the good news, she hugged me.  That was the first hug I got since I became a Deputy.  I thank the Grangegorman Development Agency for arranging that.</p><p>  I formerly represented the Grangegorman area on Dublin City Council at a time when a considerable number of development projects were being planned for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and elsewhere.  Many of these projects never came to fruition, with the result that a level of cynicism had developed within the local community.  Around the same time, a major redevelopment of Phibsborough shopping centre was proposed, which gave rise to concerns about the impact on traffic and transport.  </p><p>  It is an exciting prospect that all DIT&rsquo;s different educational centres, which are currently dotted around the city, will be moving to a central location on the northside.  I ask, however, that the agency bring the local community with it because it has already experienced disappointments with previous projects.  We will do what we can as local representatives to ease the process.  I ask the witnesses not to be strangers to this committee because we want to engage and provide whatever support we can.</p></speech>

First, I used to work for DIT, as did my father, who is in the Visitors Gallery, and mother.  My siblings also studied at DIT.  I saw what it did in terms of transfer, progression and access to education.  Second, I was on South Dublin County Council when it adopted the Adamstown planning scheme.  Of all that I did on the council, that is the achievement of which I am most proud because the legislation underpinning the scheme delivered much better planning than was previously on offer.</p><p>  Mr. Monahan mentioned his qualifications in accounting and taxation and his experience with local representation as a member of the visiting committee for Mountjoy Prison and Arbour Hill.  He has also studied conflict resolution and mediation skills.  What made him decide to put his name forward as chair and what is his vision for the role?</p></speech>

I put my name forward because I had been involved in that area for approximately 40 years.  I lived first on Cabra Road and then on the North Circular Road.  I was always convinced that the powers that be, including the city council, were not particularly interested in the project.  I got an opportunity to become a member of the board several years ago and I jumped at it.  One would not normally expect an accountant to be a protestor but I led marches down the North Circular Road and I had great fun contacting a radio programme to announce that we would be blocking that road.  We continued the protest for six weeks in order to get people to listen to us.</p><p>  This is an opportunity to revitalise the area.  People have seen this project stop and start many times and they do not yet believe it will happen.  My biggest challenge is to attend business meetings and local committees.  I was in Smithfield last week and was somewhat disappointed to find that the business community did not believe the project would proceed.  My job is to convince people it has to happen.  They are the only people in this country to get a project of this size on their doorsteps but they need to plan for it.  Smithfield is a wonderful facility but it is under utilised.  </p><p>  DIT currently operates from 38 sites.  If it wants to send the message that it is a successful third level education provider it needs to be on one site to provide value in the courses it offers.  It will enhance the reputation of DIT and the students who attend it.  If we cannot employ people in Ireland, at least we owe them the right to be educated properly to go abroad.</p></speech>

It is important we are able to demonstrate to anybody who is interested in vacancies of this nature that he or she can find out about them and apply for a position.  I was delighted last week when a resident from an adjoining area contacted me after seeing on the website that a post on the board was vacant.  The resident asked me how a member of the public could apply for the position and I was able to explain that one should apply through the website.  This is a mark of our emphasis on transparency.</p></speech>

Agreed.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  If they are not switched off they will interfere with the sound quality of today's broadcast and any later broadcasting of today's proceedings.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and Dara Murphy.</p><p>  Before we hear the opening statements of the witnesses, I remind members of Standing Order 57 on <i>sub judice</i>.  Members are advised not to stray into matters which are before the courts.  If a member wishes to deal with a matter currently before the courts, the principle of notice under Standing Order 57(4) should be observed in order that the Chairman is not placed in the position of deciding, without due consideration, whether the <i>sub judice</i> rule applies.</p></speech>

This opportunity is timely in light of a number of developments since we last spoke to this committee in March.  In particular, I intend to focus on our 2011 financial results, published over the summer, which highlight the significant progress that we are making towards achieving our strategic goals.  I will also talk briefly about the measures we are adopting to support recovery in our housing and commercial property markets.  In his address, our chairman will brief the committee on the progress we are making towards our ultimate objective, which is repaying our debt, and the wider contribution we are making towards economic recovery.</p><p>  Perhaps the most important measure of NAMA's performance is cashflow generation, and this remains very strong.  From inception to the end of 2011, we had generated cash receipts of &euro;6.1 billion from debtors, which was applied towards interest and loan repayment.  That cash includes not only the proceeds of asset disposals by our debtors and receivers but also recurring income, such as rent, generated by assets controlled by debtors.  The strong cash performance - we ended 2011 with cash and qualifying liquid assets of &euro;3.8 billion having repaid &euro;1.3 billion in debt during the year - has enabled us to remain firmly on course to meet our debt repayment targets.  Our results also highlight our strong continuing business performance.  This includes asset sales approvals in 2011 of &euro;5.6 billion.  Total sales approved stand at &euro;10.5 billion; &euro;6.2 billion have completed and there are more than &euro;2 billion in the pipeline.  Another &euro;2 billion of sales approvals have not completed for various reasons.  By the end of September 2012, we had also approved new credit advances for working and development capital of &euro;1.6 billion, reflecting our commitment to invest in the assets securing our loans where it makes commercial sense to do so.</p><p>  The headline result from our annual report and financial statements for 2011 is that we made a profit of &euro;247 million.  This was after providing for an impairment charge of &euro;1.27 billion in 2011, bringing our cumulative provision for 2010 and 2011 to &euro;2.75 billion, which reflects conditions in the property markets and principally the Irish market.  I would also point out, however, that at the end of 2011, we had significant unrealised surpluses on our books which aggregated to about &euro;1.8 billion.  The board has prudently decided that these surpluses should not be reflected in the agency's income statement until they are realised in cash terms.</p><p>  Our strong financial performance of 2011 has continued into 2012.  Last week, we published our financial accounts for the second quarter.  The accounts show that NAMA made a net profit of &euro;89 million during the quarter and, after taking account of an impairment charge of &euro;129 million, we achieved &euro;222 million net profit for the first half of the year.  The accounts also show that cash receipts from inception had increased to more than &euro;8 billion by the end of June.  Of this, &euro;5.2 billion was generated from asset disposals and &euro;2.9 billion related to "non-disposal" activity, reflecting intensive management of the assets securing our loans.  Cash receipts had, by mid-October, increased further to &euro;9.5 billion - &euro;6.2 billion from disposals and &euro;3.3 billion from recurring income.</p><p>  I informed the committee in March that, through our engagements with debtors, we had secured &euro;384 million in unpledged security through charges over previously unencumbered assets and the reversal of asset transfers to connected parties.  In the intervening period, we have secured an additional &euro;130 million in unpledged assets, bringing the total to &euro;514 million.  This has been achieved with consensual debtors.  We are continuing to pursue debtors to obtain further unpledged security.  In the case of debtors who are not working consensually with us, this includes going through the courts where appropriate.  To date, we have initiated cases in the Irish and English High Courts and in the US courts for the reversal of asset transfers, including residential property, shares and other assets.  We have also made two formal complaints to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation arising from a possible failure by debtors to disclose their assets and liabilities fully in their statements of affairs to the agency.  The intentional provision of false or inaccurate information to NAMA is a criminal offence.  The Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions will ultimately take a view whether to pursue these complaints.</p><p>  The impact of debtors declaring bankruptcy in the UK has also attracted recent attention, including parliamentary questions from members of this committee.  The comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in the UK compared with Ireland is not a source of concern for NAMA as the bankrupt's unsecured assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the discharge from bankruptcy.  Any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended beyond the one year period until such time as the bankrupt party co-operates.  Furthermore, our experience is that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established and that trustees under the system possess extensive powers to compel the production of both legal and banking information on a cross-border basis.  These powers have been used in cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared properties and other assets, and we are assisting the bankruptcy trustee in continuing to pursue a number of debtors who may have thought they had put themselves and their assets beyond reach.</p><p>  We are all aware that Irish banks and other banks in the Irish property market currently have little appetite for lending for Irish commercial property, and that is compounding difficulties in an already moribund market.  As part of our strategy to facilitate the investment of funds from abroad into the Irish commercial property market, we also signalled our intention earlier in the year to establish qualifying investor funds, QIFs, when tendering for investment management services.  QIFs provide NAMA with the option of assembling portfolios based on asset types and geographic regions in a way that is attractive to international investors.  We remain on course to launch at least one QIF before the end of the year.</p><p>  NAMA's initiatives complement measures introduced by the Minister for Finance in last year's budget, including concessions on stamp duty and capital gains tax and also certainty on the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  Given the importance of the property market in terms of Ireland's economic recovery, we suggest that other avenues should also be explored.  The introduction of real estate investment trusts, REIT, legislation is one option.  The Minister for Finance's statement that he will keep the possibility of introducing a REIT structure under review is welcome.  NAMA, as a market participant, is positive on the subject of REITs because of their potential as an additional monetisation channel for the Irish commercial and residential markets.  We have also, since our inception, advocated extending the recently published residential property price register to commercial property transactions in terms of sales and leases.  This would provide greater transparency.  Despite the reduced global appetite for real estate investment, we are beginning to see movement in the Dublin commercial market as evidenced by increasing buyer inquiries and transactions, reflecting both a desire among institutional investors to spread their real estate risk over wider geographic areas and improving sentiment towards Ireland and the attraction of higher yields at a time when global bond yields are declining.</p><p>  The resuscitation of the residential property market is an equally intrinsic requirement for sustained economic recovery.  Responding to this, last year's budget introduced specific and time-limited mortgage interest relief measures for first-time buyers and other categories of owner-occupier buyers in the residential market.  For NAMA's part, in May of this year, we launched a deferred-payment mortgage initiative as a means of encouraging some potential clients to purchase residential property.  On the basis of the lessons learned in the pilot phase, during which residential units with a combined value of &euro;9 million were sold, the NAMA board has agreed to extend the initiative on a phased basis in order that it applies to some 750 houses within our residential property portfolio.  In line with this decision, last week we announced the launch of the next phase of the initiative which sees its extension to a further 180 houses in 12 counties.  I am glad to report we have had more than &euro;1 million worth of sale since it has been launched.</p><p>  We do not believe there is a one-size-fits-all panacea for the problems in the residential market, largely because the factors affecting one segment of the market differ so much from the factors affecting another.  Recognising this, in the apartment market, our focus is on renting.  Since acquiring the loans, tenants have been secured for about 4,000 previously vacant apartments in Dublin and we are continuing to invest in completing unfinished apartment blocks in areas such as Sandyford in response to the strong rental market in these locations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400004#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak.  My statement is being circulated but we had to get legal clearance for some of it, which accounts for the delay.  I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  I fully endorse the CEO's concluding comments on the anger felt by the NAMA board and staff arising from the activities of an ex-employee of the agency, Mr. Enda Farrell.  I am conscious that, as a result of ongoing investigations, I am restricted in how I can discuss these matters but I wish to be helpful to the committee on the issue.</p><p>  In early August of this year, we became aware that Mr. Farrell had acquired a property belonging to a NAMA debtor and that it was being suggested that the transaction had been financially advantageous to him and had been approved within the agency.  On hearing the allegation, we immediately requested our internal auditors, Deloitte, to review the events surrounding the transaction, to ascertain whether Mr. Farrell had breached protocols and to look at how the matter had been dealt with internally.  The Deloitte review quickly established a number of important facts.  At no time had anyone within the agency authorised Mr. Farrell to purchase the property in question.  Mr. Farrell had not enjoyed any financial benefit from the transaction as the price paid was in line with an independent valuation given for the property to the vendor.  Deloitte concluded, on the basis of this, that the price paid was in line with market value so there is no question of a sale at undervalue.  Not only was the transaction not approved in NAMA, Mr. Farrell had failed to disclose the transaction to the agency at any time, either prior to or following the transaction, as he was required to do.</p><p>  As part of the review, we asked Deloitte to carry out a forensic search of Mr. Farrell's e-mail account and the search uncovered evidence that confidential data may have been taken by him without authorisation from NAMA.  As a result, NAMA and the NTMA instituted High Court proceedings against Mr. Farrell and his wife seeking a number of injunctive orders, including an Anton Piller order directing the defendants to deliver all documents, communications and materials that contained confidential information relating to NAMA.  On 3 September 2012, the High Court granted the order sought and ordered that proceedings be heard <i>in camera</i> until further order of the court.  When, at NAMA's request, the <i>in camera</i> order was lifted on 12 September and, armed with evidence that a criminal offence may have incurred, NAMA informed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its concerns and findings on the same date, referencing section 202 of the NAMA Act.  We also reported the matter to the Data Protection Commissioner.  The agency is fully co-operating with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Data Protection Commissioner.  Proceedings are before the High Court on 5 November.</p></speech>

I understand he was delayed for reasons outside his control.  Twelve or 13 members are indicating they wish to contribute.  I will be vigilant in ensuring that members pursue a line of questioning.  If they move to Second Stage statements I will bring their contribution to a speedy conclusion.  In regard to the Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche investigation, I wish to ask a number of questions which Mr. Daly may be able to clarify, given the comprehensive statement he has given to the committee.  Following the Deloitte report examination does he now know all the recipients to whom the information was leaked?  Does he know the full extent of the information revealed and is it the case that the detail of every NAMA property was released in this case?  Will he clarify if it was a master spreadsheet of all the loans acquired by NAMA and all the properties acquired by NAMA as security for loans which was leaked, or was the information less than that?  Will he also clarify for the committee the estimate of the public loss or gain to third parties on that one transaction of information?  Will he tell the committee what procedures were in place which failed to highlight the conflict of interest or the transference of information?  Will he outline if the procedures have been rectified?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400006#E00500"><p>Do we know all of the recipients of the information?  Yes, at this stage of our investigation we believe we have identified all of those.  Mr. Farrell sent 33 e-mails to his wife.  That was the way in which the information got out of NAMA because, effectively, he could not have sent it out any other way because of the IT and the other security restrictions that are in place.  His wife appears to have forwarded those 33 e-mails to Mr. Farrell's personal account.  Beyond that, we believe Mr. Farrell would have sent information to fewer than ten parties, which we have identified to date, and we do not believe there are any other to come but we are not yet finished with this investigation.  Those parties would have received partial or limited information.  In some cases it would have been Mr. Farrell's own view of the property world and would not necessarily in all cases have used NAMA data.  I should say that most of the people who did get the information are co-operating fully in the sense that they are confirming that the data they received was not copied or not forwarded or used and that it has been preserved as required by the court injunction.</p><p>  On the question of what got out, again I want to be careful because we are still in a court process and under a Garda investigation, but no sensitive financial data got out.  There is no possibility, therefore, of fraud or identity theft because we are not a bank.  We have loan accounts but we do not have bank accounts.  What Mr. Farrell took was information about 2009 valuations in NAMA.  This was NAMA data, not debtor data.  It is material that is useful to have but it is certainly not critical.  He sent that out to himself, via his wife.  He did not send it in full anywhere beyond himself.  He may have sent extracts from it; that is all I can say about that.</p><p>  Mr. Farrell also took information about loans acquired by NAMA, including the acquisition value.  That is sensitive information obviously because it is confidential data under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act.  It is historic now but the important point is that there is no evidence that he sent that anywhere beyond himself-----</p></speech>

If one was in NAMA and wanted to do this, the more obvious way would be to try to download it on to a memory stick which is totally prohibited - one just cannot do it - or to try to send it out as a file to one's own personal e-mail account.  One simply cannot do it.  Given that we obviously we have a day-to-day working relationship with companies such as Ernst &amp;amp; Young, where his wife worked, Mr. Farrell sent it to her at their corporate account.  That is how it escaped.</p><p>  We have instituted a review of IT security.  We have to be proportionate in our response because we cannot tie ourselves up in such knots that we will be back here before the committee explaining why we are not doing transactions, undertaking business and getting bureaucratic or non-commercial.  I can assure the committee that in so far as there is anything to be done - it is reasonably limited - it will be done as a consequence of that.</p></speech>

I assume, Mr. Daly has asked those parties who received that information to return it, for what it might be worth, even if it was communicated electronically.  He said an investigation was carried out on whether it may have travelled on to other people.  Is that investigation closed or is there an ongoing investigation that there may be other parties or entities within the structure that may need further examination?  Have those who received the data been excluded from other transactions dealing with NAMA?  Are they people with whom NAMA will have a difficulty in doing business in the future or has there been a prohibition on NAMA dealing with them?</p></speech>

The case mentioned is the only one of which I am aware.  The only NAMA property which any staff member could ever hope to acquire is a principal private residence and only with prior approval and if the property has been openly marketed.

I would like to take up where the Chairman left off.  Mr. Daly mentioned that one of the files which Mr. Farrell sent to himself via his wife contained information on the price paid by NAMA for loans and stated that there was no evidence that information had made its way to any third party.  Does Mr. Daly accept that information would be extremely valuable to any prospective purchaser of assets from NAMA, as it would provide such person with critical information in regard to the price paid by NAMA for the loan and would be a strong indication of the price which NAMA might accept for the property?  Would Mr. Daly accept that this would be the case if that information did get out, despite that he has no evidence that this occurred?</p></speech>

I agree that the information is sensitive.  However, at this stage it is, to a certain extent, historic information.  During previous appearances at this committee and elsewhere we were asked if NAMA's price is always the acquisition value and if we ever deviate from that, to which our response was that at the end of the day we are in the property market right now and what matters and is important is the price we get now.  The information is important although not vital.  The fact that we are now in a state of awareness that this information could be out there - we do not believe it is - makes us very careful.</p><p>  Property prices and valuations are not totally dependent on the value we placed on them in November 2009.  What is important is the current market value.  Anyone engaging with us in regard to the sale or purchase of property has his or her own way of evaluating prices and values, as does NAMA.  We do not always go back and look at the value of a property n 2009, concluding that the correct price at a particular time is a particular figure minus or plus X.</p></speech>

However, I find one matter bizarre.  NAMA engaged Deloitte to undertake a review of this case.  Mr. Daly stated in his submission that Deloitte undertook a search of Mr. Farrell's e-mail account and uncovered evidence that confidential data may have been taken by him without authorisation from NAMA.  Why, rather than referring this matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately, did NAMA go to the High Court seeking an Anton Piller order to secure documents, communications and materials from Mr. Farrell?  I assume NAMA was anxious to recover the data and information.  I hope that in doing so, nothing was compromised.  Surely it was a matter for the Garda Sioch&aacute;na when Deloitte discovered e-mails had been sent out?</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy to the chronology on this matter.  We became aware of this on 2 August.  The following day we commissioned Deloitte to carry out its investigation.  I include in this regard the property transaction.  It was during the Deloitte forensic examination of that transaction that an issue first came to light in terms of whether confidential information might have been removed from the agency.  Deloitte commenced its investigation on 6 August and commenced a forensic analysis of e-mails on 12 August.  By way of providing an idea of the scale of this task, Deloitte retrieved 164,000 e-mails sent by or to Mr. Farrell between 2005 and 2012, which was not considered an unusual amount of traffic.  In respect of the period from end 2009 to March 2012, the time during which Mr. Farrell was with the agency, Deloitte retrieved 92,000 e-mails.  These were then narrowed down on the basis of key word searches to 42,000, which Deloitte had to print, analyse, collate and read to determine the extent of the problem.  Of those 42,000 e-mails, only 33 were of concern.  I am trying to give the committee an idea of the scale of the investigation.</p></speech>

We went to court in the meantime to get the Anton Piller order to go to Mr. Farrell's house to search his premises and gain access to his computer, memory sticks and documentation.  We executed that search on 3 September.  On 12 September, when all of the work in terms of collating the information had been completed, which was when we first had strong evidence, we took the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>  From the moment we got a sniff of what might be going on, the board and management were determined that if there was a breach of confidentiality in NAMA we would take the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We also told Deloitte that there must be nothing done in terms of going to the courts or their conducting their investigation that would compromise a Garda investigation.  That was a <i>sine qua non</i>.  There has been no indication to date from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Data Protection Commissioner that anything we did has caused such compromise.  </p></speech>

Once they go into enforcement other parties become involved.  Those with whom we work consensually amount to approximately two thirds of our debtors, which is a much brighter prospect than we would have thought several years ago.  We are very forensic with regard to the overheads they can remove from a business.  In some cases these have been reduced by 75% or 50% of what they were in the good years, if I can call them that.  These are the normal overheads of a business such as paying staff, insurance and electricity costs.  We monitor very closely what they remove from the business for their own lifestyle.  We all have various definitions of lifestyle but we certainly do not sanction anybody having a personal driver or personal security.  That said, neither can we get into the day-to-day business of monitoring every penny some of these people spend.</p></speech>

Many of these people still work with other financial institutions and may be funded from elsewhere.  We cannot do much about this.  We provided figures previously and we can update them today on the total cost of overheads being removed from businesses and within this the number of individuals who take a particular salary.  Perhaps the most important figure is that all of the NAMA managed debtors, which is the bulk of them, manage approximately &euro;61 billion of debt.  The total overhead and receiver costs with regard to these are &euro;215 million to date.  The principal salaries for people in these businesses amount to &euro;15.5 million and relate to 168 individuals.  To bring this down to a salary band, the vast bulk, or 112, of these people earn between nothing and &euro;50,000.  I do not think it can be said we fund extraordinary lifestyles.  The rationale we have expounded here and elsewhere on this is that it is best commercially for NAMA and the taxpayer if these people are prepared to work with us and run their businesses, which they know.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh stated that since October 2011, NAMA policy has been that all properties should be openly marketed except in certain limited circumstances where this may not be practicable.  Will Mr. McDonagh give us a sense of how frequently and in what percentage of cases off-market sales or private deals take place, where properties are not advertised and not put up for sale in the open market?  NAMA states it is not the seller and that the debtor appoints a selling agent, but in reality NAMA calls all the shots and pulls the strings.  It is the seller and the beneficiary of the proceeds so I do not accept this argument.  Will Mr. McDonagh give us a sense of the level of activity in off-market sales and those with a proper public competitive bidding process?</p></speech>

These are completed sales which amount to just over &euro;6 billion.  Of these 3,500 properties, fewer than 200 were sold in non-open market transactions for various reasons.</p></speech>

Does he feel this option and flexibility need to be retained even though not doing so would remove any suspicion of private deals where people can benefit and where the price achieved is not necessarily the best price?  I know he stated NAMA gets an independent valuation, but no one knows what the value of property is today unless one puts it on the open market.</p></speech>

Everything is subject to independent valuation.  Looking at the sales of properties in the NAMA portfolio, of the &euro;6 billion achieved, only approximately &euro;800 million has been achieved in the Irish market, with the rest of the sales taking place elsewhere in quite liquid markets.  Therefore, there is more of a market comparator to determine whether an independent valuation is fair.  We must be satisfied we achieve fair value for properties and it is very important to us in terms of our procedures.</p></speech>

What we were made aware of from the outside source was the sale of the property at Sundays Well.  It was as a result of our own forensic examination or Deloitte's investigation into that transaction that we became aware of the leaking of confidential information.  That information did not come from outside; it came from our own analysis of the property transaction.</p><p>  Deputy Creed referred to my saying that fewer than ten e-mails had been forwarded electronically.  I can categorically assure the Deputy that the information did not get out in any other way.  As a consequence of our actions in the court, Mr. Farrell has made a sworn affidavit as to the extent of what he disseminated and in which he indicated that nothing other than what we currently have a handle on, which are the e-mails I referred to, was disseminated.

The biggest defence of this at the end of the day will be that properties will be openly marketed.  As such, the value will be the value.  Whether this applies to a property being marketed next week or in five or ten years time, that will be the situation.  We do not believe our debtors will be prejudiced.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked whether there should be a blanket prohibition on the purchase by NAMA staff of properties.  This issue was discussed by the board.  Following much consideration, we took the view that, in one circumstance, NAMA staff could purchase a property, namely, if it is to be their principal private residence, provided there was prior approval to do so and there was full visibility of it in the organisation, right to the top, and that the property was openly marketed.  There would never be a situation in which we would exempt a property from the requirement to be openly marketed.   We felt this was a proportionate response.  There are 240 people employed in NAMA and a further 500 in the participating institutions.  NAMA controls approximately 13,000 residential properties.  I know there are other properties on the market and, as such, NAMA is not the be-all and end-all in this situation.  In terms of people wishing to access a principal private residence, however, we believe our response has been proportionate.  We are comfortable with that.</p><p>  Reference was made to a particular transaction in Cork, which I think has been dealt with fairly extensively by way of response to parliamentary questions.  I do not intend to go into the detail in that regard.  In case there is any doubt, there was no question of any NAMA staff member or other member of staff connected with it being involved in that transaction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/986" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400009#H00700"><p>I appreciate that.  I would like now to move on to a separate area of questioning.  NAMA controls virtually all the main players in the construction industry that were active in the decade prior to its establishment.  Given the level of control NAMA has, in terms of activity in the construction industry, what engagement has it had with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in terms of an inventory of the availability and location of suitable properties to facilitate the efforts being made in particular by them in attracting foreign direct investment here?</p><p>  NAMA deals in the main with property of developers who were building houses.  I assume some of those developers were also involved in a range of other construction activity.  Mr. Daly referred in his opening address to the emergence of development opportunities, including the Dublin office market where demand for grade A, centrally-located office accommodation is expected to outstrip supply within a few years.  The reality in provincial Ireland, including Galway, Limerick and Waterford, where there was substantial foreign direct investment, is that there is no accommodation available for foreign direct investment wishing to locate in those areas.  The construction sector was critically involved in the provision of this advanced accommodation that could be marketed as suitable locations in this regard.</p><p>  Does NAMA have sufficient working capital to release to developers to allow them get involved in this area?  I suggest there is some headroom in Dublin and very limited headroom in Cork.  The efforts of Enterprise Ireland will soon be hamstrung by the virtual non-availability of this type of accommodation owing to the fact NAMA has not released sufficient working capital to allow development in this type of construction activity.  I acknowledge that work is ongoing on completion of unfinished estates, apartment blocks and so on.  The area of advance factory construction, however, needs to be stimulated.  Has NAMA sufficient working capital to allow this?  Is it working with Enterprise Ireland in this regard?  As I understand it, alarm bells are ringing in terms of the level of availability of this type of accommodation.</p></speech>

I regret doing so now because that sentence stated clearly that NAMA wants to be active in any area where there is an emerging business need, so that when business needs accommodation, it will be available for it, courtesy of NAMA or NAMA developers.  We are, and have been for some time, in regular communication with the IDA.  The reference in my opening statement to prime office space in central Dublin derives directly from an IDA view that there is a shortage of such accommodation which will be required in the context of foreign direct investment.</p></speech>

Has NAMA communicated with the principals of the loan portfolios in a proactive manner with regard to the information disseminated to assure them?  I have a question in respect of the expertise available to the NAMA board.  It seems there is very little expertise from developers who have knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the construction industry.  Many of these people led us into much difficulty but we must move on to restore activity in the construction sector and expertise on how and where to kick start projects and get the best return is required.  Does NAMA have that kind of critical practical expertise on its board?</p></speech>

The Chairman asked me if a number of people would be banned from transactions with NAMA in future.  We cannot say that because these parties received information they are culpable in any way or that there was malicious intent.  It does not seem that any of them actually used the information.  We do not have a ban list as such.  Every time we go to the market, even for consultancy or business services, the process is done through public procurement.  Parties would come in and make their pitch.  I would not say we would ban the parties but we are very conscious of what has happened.</p><p>  With regard to communications with debtors, two or three debtors have quite understandably been in touch to seek assurances.  We have written to them and the matter is on a holding basis.  The Data Protection Commissioner in particular is taking a keen interest in whether any personal data has emerged from this and we need to progress that engagement.  It would certainly be our intention to communicate with all of them, and I would be confident of assuring them that what has happened does not prejudice matters.  This only applies to affected debtors.</p><p>  There is a wide range of expertise on the board of NAMA, including people with experience in insolvency, asset management agencies and the property sector.  I do not regard the board as the sole repository of expertise; there are 226 staff members in NAMA and many of those have expertise in the type of areas mentioned by the Deputy.  I made the point a while ago that we are working consensually with two thirds of our debtors.  I have said before that not all 850 debtors in NAMA set out to ruin the country or themselves, although they made mistakes.  That we are working consensually with a number means we believe they have a contribution to make and they have the type of expertise mentioned by the Deputy.  In such consensual work, NAMA has access to an expert view at any time if we want it, and there is a good level of capacity in that respect.</p></speech>

There are a number of topics I wish to go through and I will try to be as brief as possible in questioning.  I understand the restrictions with regard to Mr. Farrell and those activities.  Who brought it to the attention of Mr. Daly that Mr. Farrell had bought a NAMA property?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400010#J00800"><p>It is clear from today's presentation that if it were not for the media inquiring about the issue, it would possibly not have been addressed by NAMA.  That issue led NAMA to discovering that sensitive commercial information had been taken and was released to the person's wife and potential investors in NAMA.  If there had not been a media focus on NAMA, this would never have come to light.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I cannot say for definite if it would have come to light otherwise.  I must be careful.  If Mr. Farrell was disseminating this information, I have little doubt that at some stage - it is a small country - we would have got wind of this.</p></speech>

If an e-mail lands on a desk with the prices at which NAMA purchased the properties from the banks, surely an upstanding person with the interest of NAMA and the country at heart would notify Mr. Daly that there was a rogue employee in the operation.  There should be serious questions asked about why NAMA is not ruling out working with these parties in future.</p></speech>

Of the people to whom the information was sent, some were not involved in this at all.  Mr. Farrell sent the information in that instance without any encouragement.  I will take the case of Ernst &amp;amp; Young.  The material was sent to Mr. Farrell's wife at Ernst &amp;amp; Young but there is no suggestion that the company was in any way involved or remiss in this case; it has been extremely helpful and co-operative in that regard.  With some of the other cases I am disappointed that there was no action but we cannot set up a ban list.  I hinted in my reply that we go through a procurement process and take a view of the type of people with which we wish to deal.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly has spoken about that at length.  The last time Mr. Daly was before the committee he addressed the issue of greater transparency and how the public generally wants to know the value at which these loans were bought and are sold.  He said:</p></speech>

I would not believe that there is any of this going on in NAMA by other members of staff.  I shall go back to my statement on the potential damage or potential commercial exposure.  All I can say to the Deputy is, at this stage of the investigation, we do not believe there has been commercial damage to NAMA and we do not believe that there is prejudicial damage to our debtors.  I acknowledge that there is reputational damage and none of us wants to be here today explaining it away.  As far as I can see at this stage, this is a one-off incident where somebody very deliberately set out to circumvent the controls in place at NAMA.</p></speech>

It was appallingly constructed and the neighbouring privately-owned estate is also in serious difficulties.  How many housing estates have been or will be demolished in the foreseeable future?  Does the delegation have any information on the matter?     </p></speech>

Category 4 is the worst and there were about 150 on the list, for which NAMA had exposure to 29 and Gleann Riada was one of that 29.  The Deputy is right.  We made a decision, in conjunction with Longford County Council, that the only viable solution was to demolish the estate because it was not safe and was poorly constructed.</p><p>  With regard to the remaining estates on the list of 29, we believe that the issue can be resolved with additional moneys.  We will work with the relevant local authority to get site resolution and will deal with the issues.</p><p>  The category 3 list consists of about 1,200 estates and NAMA has an exposure to about 130 of them.  My understanding is that there is possibly one of the 130, following our engagement with a local authority, that is not solvable without demolition.  It still remains part of the list.  </p></speech>

I wish it were &euro;200.  They received an annual wage of &euro;200,000.  Can Mr. Daly inform the committee whether NAMA has successfully reduced the wages for those individuals?  I know that he made a general statement but I would appreciate if he could inform the committee about those individuals.</p></speech>

Again, we allow overheads to be taken out of the business for all sorts of reasons, including paying the salaries to the principals.  In those two cases and without identifying the individuals - and this is probably what I said the last time - they are managing and working with us.  Effectively, they are managing enormous enterprises on our behalf.  The commercial reality is that it is much more advantageous for us, and ultimately for the taxpayer, to have them working with us and doing that work rather than the business of putting in property managers, receivers or whatever.  I know that it is an unpopular decision but it still represents the best outcome for NAMA.</p></speech>

We are pressed for time and I shall move on to another substantial issue.  NAMA informed the Minister and he informed me through his reply to my parliamentary question that NAMA has sold off &euro;1.9 billion in loans so far to date.  I pursued the same line of questioning on debt write-down or debt forgiveness for developers with the delegation at our last meeting.  It is clear that NAMA's stated policy is that there is no debt forgiveness for developers.  The delegation went quite far in its previous comments to the committee to state that it wants to see every cent of the &euro;72 billion of the loans recouped, and not just the &euro;30 billion that was paid for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.640" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400012#L00200"><p>I will answer that question.  I would love to sit here today and say the underlying collateral in the &euro;1.9 billion of loans was worth &euro;1.9 billion or more but it is not.  Typically, the value people paid for the loans is the value of the underlying collateral.  In those instances, the buyer of the loans pays us.  Hypothetically, in the example of the &euro;100 million par debt loan Deputy Pearse Doherty gave, if we bought it for &euro;40 million and sold it for &euro;41 million, that is effectively the value of the collateral today and what one would get if one sold the underlying collateral.  If we sell it to a third party, such as a private equity house, the third party will decide about whether to continue with the borrowing and trying to get the rest of the money back if the debtor has it.  The reality is that the debtor does not have it.  Once one sells on a contractual position, one cannot control what someone will do with it.  Our preference is to sell loans but, within the loans sold for &euro;1.9 billion, where the loan is a par debt repayment, par debt is what one gets back.  Our preference is to have a process whereby loan sales are exposed to the market and people bid on it.  </p></speech>

This means NAMA has cut its cloth and has decided it was not going to get back the full value and so it will sell off the loans.  In my example of a loan of &euro;100 million taken out from Anglo Irish Bank or wherever, purchased by NAMA for &euro;40 million and sold to a third party, there is a write-down of 59% in that case.  I am not saying that my example happened.  These are substantial write-downs by NAMA and whether the third-party pursues the developer is immaterial because it will not benefit the taxpayer.  Under section 10 of the Act, NAMA is challenged with getting back the money paid for the loan, at a minimum, but to recoup the full value of the loan, making up the &euro;72 billion the Irish State paid to the banks through recapitalisation.  At an early stage, NAMA is calling it quits on a number of these loans.</p></speech>

NAMA acquired loans from institutions where there is no additional recourse to the debtor.  In that instance, all one gets is the value of the underlying collateral.  Effectively, one never gets the difference back.  In the situations that typically arise, many of the loans can be non-recourse loans and we are also dealing with trying to get the best value for the asset.  Some people want to buy loans rather than the property because they want to make use of it for tax planning purposes.  That is part of day-to-day operations.  NAMA is not the only operation in the world selling loans.  Other banks are selling loans and exactly the same situation arises.  We are trying to maximise the return provided by the value of the collateral underneath the loan and trying to ensure we get full value for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400012#L00500"><p>I will try to finish up on this point.  When NAMA was set up by the previous Government, there was a lot of outrage.  I do not blame the officials of NAMA, who are charged with securing a return to the State.  There was outrage that developers were going to walk away with a reduction in the debt they owed to banks such as AIB, Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  It was categorically said that this would not happen, that it would not be a write-down for developers and that the loans were purchased at a reduced level, with the developers to be pursued to the end of the earth for the full amount.  What has happened with &euro;1.9 billion of loans being sold is that the developers, or at least the State, has written off a portion of that money.  It is a write-down for developers because the third-party may not pursue them, as NAMA is mandated to, in order to recoup all of the &euro;72 billion.</p><p>  It is important to be honest.  This is happening at a time when hundreds of thousands are looking for the banks to give them a write-down.  They did not cause any problems in terms of the economic crisis and cannot get leeway from the banks yet an institution of the State, NAMA, is selling loans at a write-down and crystallising a loss on the NAMA books.</p><p>  With regard to personal guarantees, for how long is NAMA pursuing personal guarantees?</p></speech>

We look for sworn statements of affairs and we consider whether the debtor is co-operating.  If the debtor is not giving us his additional assets, we will pursue him.  If the debtor co-operates with us and helps us to realise the maximum value of the loan exposure, we will look at whether he has assets left at the end.  If he has no assets left, there is no point in pursuing personal guarantees.  If he has assets left or if anything emerges, we will hold him in a period of probation in which we reserve the right to go after it.  When the debtor is working with us, we want the assets handed over if he has any.  The evidence today is that we have received over &euro;500 million worth of assets from people who did not want to give them up in the first place.  They have decided that the only way they will survive is if they hand over assets.  If the debtor has assets that have not been declared, we will conduct asset searches and go to the courts to pursue the debtor.  We are doing everything possible to get as much as possible out of this in the interest of the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Our debtors have the properties on their hands, and there is a strong private rental market.  They were asking me how long did they have to hold the properties because they could get them rented.  One of the issues was the delivery mechanism.  The housing associations must find an approved housing body which will do the long-term leasing and they then seek funding approval from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Some of our debtors and receivers were also not over enthusiastic about allowing this to happen.  Having consulted on how to speed up the process, it was decided that we would buy the property from the debtor-receiver, relieving him of that difficulty on the basis that the approved housing bodies identified they wanted properties in the areas and they had the approval of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We hope that by the end of this year that somewhere between 300 or 400 of those units could be delivered.  Once the process is set up, the delivery will be much quicker.  We hope that by this time next year the majority of the houses requested by the approved housing bodies - providing they have the funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government - will be processed and that well over 1,000 and perhaps 1,200 will be delivered through this mechanism by this time next year.</p></speech>

As I said, one of the issues is that the debtor and receiver were less enthusiastic and did not want to do a lease with the approved housing body.  We decided to buy the properties from the debtor-receiver and get them out of the picture when we would then be able to deal with the approved housing body.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh has given me a very clear answer.  Money has been made available to finish off development sites.  In my area of Dublin I see a pent-up demand for new office blocks and new apartments.  The demand for rental properties in central Dublin is very high.  Has NAMA a plan to release money or to invest in developing its brownfield sites in the short-term, as anecdotal evidence suggests there is a built up demand in silicon dock and other places in the Dublin area?  Are there concrete plans at this stage for such developments?</p></speech>

We have engaged extensively with the four local authorities in Dublin and have had a very good engagement with them.  We outlined the issues that needed to be addressed.  First, that the current planning permission was not viable and could that be addressed.  We have had a very favourable response.  The second issue was that development levies were set for boom times but were not relevant for today's market.  The local authorities have been very responsive and have looked at reducing the development levies by up to 25% to 26%, which helps the whole process.</p><p>  We reorganised NAMA earlier this year and created a new asset management division under my colleague, Mr. John Mulcahy.  We have brought a business plan to the board for that asset management division, so that subject to the planning and development levies being sorted out and an increase in demand, we would see ourselves looking at the funding of the development of potentially more than a million sq. ft of grade A office space in Dublin and up to 5,000 residential units in the next three to four years.  Where there is a proven demand, we will make money available, because it makes commercial sense to do so.</p></speech>

I would like to place my questions in the context of Mr. McDonagh's point that NAMA is much more transparent and accountable than the banks.  While I agree with that point, it is not a brilliant achievement on the part of NAMA in the light of the level of arrogance and contempt that the banks show when they come to this forum and the staggering lack of interest they seem to have in the country's wider economic plight.  One hopes NAMA will be different.  I acknowledge that the officials' comments demonstrate they are conscious of the wider picture beyond a pure commercial mandate to get in the money.  Regardless of the unfortunate circumstances that led to the establishment of NAMA - we all wish there had not been such circumstances - I emphasise that I see NAMA as an opportunity to have a State institution which is more accountable than the banks and potentially accountable to the national and the public interest to address the country's disastrous property market.  That can have a positive outcome or a not so positive outcome.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.678" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400014#N00400"><p>Absolutely.  This is what I want to ask about.  I suspect many people share my fear that the number of social housing units will be relatively paltry.  I wonder whether the officials think that is a legitimate fear.  In any case, the State will not gain from these units - the approved housing bodies will.  Is it not the case that the net objective of NAMA is to get the money back and refloat the property market?  Is it not the case that the result of NAMA will be to put many of those who got us into this mess back in business?  That is what alarms me when I hear that NAMA is employing 62 of the biggest developers in the country who have helped to wreck the economy and paying them over &euro;100,000 a year.  It might be excusable for it to employ them if they have certain skills.  Am I right to say we are paying them that money, even though, in most cases, they will regain ownership of their property portfolios at the end of this process?  Is it not the case that NAMA is holding out to them the option of being back in business if they repay their loans?  I find it problematic that we are paying them to help them to get back into business.  Have I given a fair assessment of what NAMA is doing?</p><p>  By contrast, the social dividend of NAMA's activities is minimal.  Mr. Daly has said NAMA has provided approximately 1,100 social houses and has an objective of providing approximately 4,000 such houses.  Will he clarify whether that is what we are getting?  Given that there are over 100,000 people on the property waiting list, should we not be entitled to expect more than 1,100 social houses from NAMA?  Does Mr. Daly think the State will get good value, given that the approved housing bodies which will be given responsibility for these social houses are private entities, or certainly not State entities?  Much of the money they will be using to lease the property from NAMA will be State money, in effect, that comes through private bodies in the form of rent allowance payments.</p><p>  As I understand it, the approved bodies are housing associations.  Some of them are for-profit bodies, while some of them are not-for-profit bodies.  They are not part of the State system.  They will lease the properties.  Mr. Daly has said NAMA will give them the option to buy them.  Is that right?  These properties could be used to give people social housing, with rental revenues coming back to the State in the long term, but the net effect will be the other way around.  We will be handing over properties that we currently control.  They will be out of our control.  The rental revenue will go to these bodies rather than coming back to the State.  I do not think that is good value for money from NAMA's point of view.  It is definitely not good value from the point of view of the State and its citizens.  If we keep the assets we have, a long-term rental revenue stream will come back to us.  If it is good business for them, why is it not good business for us?  Why are we disposing of them?</p><p>  I will not go into the details of the Farrell case because Mr. Daly has explained it very well.  It is obvious that he cannot elaborate on the investigation.  It can be added to other similar instances such as the case of a former senior lending officer now working for a firm which bought loans from NAMA.  As NAMA disposes of these assets to developers and property investors, is it not inevitable that it will create conditions that give rise to potential conflicts of interest and the possibility of corruption?  If we kept the commercial and housing property in State hands, we would not have that problem.  We could rationally organise the commercial property market in the interests of fostering enterprise and business, etc.  We could use the residential properties to house the 100,000 people who are on waiting lists.  Why can we not house more people?  In what sense is it good for the State for us to be disposing of this property?  It is going out of our hands.  Private investors, rather than the State, will ultimately benefit from it.  That is really the point.</p><p>  I would like to comment on the issue raised with regard to the person who worked for NAMA but is now working for one of these purchasers.  Should there not be a cooling off period of a minimum of two years before someone who has worked for NAMA is allowed to work for a company which has the potential to benefit from its engagement with NAMA?  Such a person should not be allowed to take up a job with a private entity which could possibly benefit from his or her previous involvement with NAMA, or the knowledge that person might have taken with him or her for a minimum of two years.  Would that not be a reasonable requirement?</p><p>  I would like one of the representatives of NAMA to clarify some numbers.  I understand 10,000 of NAMA's properties are rented and that 3,800 of its properties are being used for social housing.  Is that it?  How much more is there?  Why is there not more?  That is what I really want to know.  Will the officials tell us how much residential property NAMA has in total?  Does NAMA expect any more of its housing stock to be used as social housing?  We have been told that NAMA has "identified approximately 3,800 units for social housing" and has "confirmed demand for 1,200 of these houses and apartments".  Why is there a delay in meeting the demand that has been confirmed?</p></speech>

I will respond to something Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said at the beginning of his contribution.</p></speech>

In the case of approximately 1,300 of the 3,800 units, the demand has not yet been confirmed by the Housing Finance Agency to NAMA.  The housing agency has not fully analysed them.  There is no demand for approximately 450 units.  This is because the local authorities have for their own reasons stated that they are not required.  We will put approximately 600 of the 3,800 units on a list and give it to the housing agency.  They have not been chosen because either they have been rented to the private sector or they have been sold.</p><p>  This leaves a residual 1,500 properties with which we are currently active and we are examining them in terms of identifying what to do.  We expect these units to come through in the coming 12 months.  The Deputy asked why there are not more properties in NAMA.  The loan portfolio we bought had properties hanging out of it but there were different types of properties hanging out.  There are 800 debtors in NAMA.  Some of them were involved in house building and some were not.  Some were based in Ireland and others were not.  This is what is available to play with in terms of the completed stock.  We would much prefer if we could sell off all that stock and we do not mind who buys it.  However, it does not appear that there is money available from the State to buy the stock at this stage and this seems to be the only option available.  The policy decision of the Government seems to be the promotion of a long-term leasing option, but that is not something I can control.</p></speech>

It is a Government policy decision but I am keen to ascertain the facts.  Mr. McDonagh is saying that this is all we will get in terms of social housing.</p></speech>

I would not mind if all 14,000 units ended up in that situation.  It would be a big contribution.  I am as aware as anyone else of the figures, of the people on waiting lists and of the demand for housing.  I am simply saying that we cannot magic up more than what is there.  In the case of what is available, we have done our best to make as much of it available as possible.  We are keen to see a delivery of it to alleviate a difficult problem.</p></speech>

There is no reason the State could not purchase that property or write down what NAMA must hand back to the State, on the basis of NAMA transferring it to the State.  That arrangement could be made.  However, the anticipation of NAMA is that there will not be much more than that.</p><p>  I was not suggesting that there was a conflict of interest.  Frankly, I do not know any of the details and I am not making any suggestions either way but the point is that potential exists if there is not an adequate cooling off period.  There is nothing to stop it if what NAMA is in the business of doing can potentially confer significant commercial advantage on a person.</p></speech>

The reality is we have no reason to believe that the small number of people who have left NAMA since its foundation have in any way compromised NAMA or used their knowledge to disadvantage NAMA.  In an ideal world one might introduce a two year cooling off period but the reality is that, for a start, we would have to pay such people for the two years.  Is that what the Deputy wants?  Does he want people who leave to be paid by NAMA for one or two years after they go?  I think we should be proportionate.</p></speech>

It is important to realise that we all want NAMA to succeed.  The question is to try to ensure we protect the interests of the taxpayer and the State in the process.  Mr. Daly noted that 500 NAMA staff work out in the institutions or are based in the institutions.  Can we have a breakdown of these staff?  For example, how many personnel are in the NAMA unit in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC?  Is NAMA satisfied with the service it is getting from the main players, including IBRC, AIB, Bank of Ireland and any other financial institution?  Does NAMA have any service level agreements with these institutions?  Are some of the units in the institutions more efficient than others?  Has NAMA had any reason in recent times to voice concern to the institutions at the co-operation or efficiency of any of the units?</p><p>  One important factor for success in banking and financial services is confidentiality.  My understanding from reading newspapers in recent months is that some business plans belonging to some of the people NAMA is dealing with may have been leaked to the media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400016#P00200"><p>The 500 staff are not NAMA staff; they are bank staff working in the IBRC, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  We can supply the committee with accurate figures.  There are approximately 200 staff in the IBRC, 200 in AIB and 100 in Bank of Ireland.  Section 131 of the Act provides for service level agreements with all of the participating institutions which govern the way in which the institutions service NAMA and the loans they manage on its behalf.  We have a very close working relationship with and a firm hold on these NAMA units in the three institutions.  NAMA people are in the institutions as part of the teams and there is considerable oversight.  Day-to-day issues will arise in any relationship, but at this stage we do not have significant issues with the performance of the units.  One issue that arises from time to time has to do with turnaround times for credit and sales requests which we monitor very closely.  In respect of the 195 debtors managed by NAMA, the average turnaround time is about 4.7 working days, while it is a little longer in the institutions, at seven days.  We are always trying to improve on these times.</p></speech>

Both Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh signed the statement on 21 September.  The quarterly report on the accounts for the second quarter is for the period up to 30 June 2012.  On that date the amount due to NAMA on debtor loans was &euro;72.4 billion.  The NAMA book value of the loan portfolio was &euro;24.8 billion.  Are the delegates familiar with this document?  It shows that the loan book at the end of June - the most recent period for which figures are available - was valued at &euro;24.8 billion against the par value of &euro;72.4 billion.  That indicates a write-down of 66% compared to a write-down of 57% on loans taken in over a period.  I refer to the last paragraph on page 2 of the document which shows the performance of the portfolio based on acquisition value of 29%; it is 19% of the original par value.  The final sentence reads: "It should be noted that as NAMA disposes of income generating assets, the performance of the loan portfolio may deteriorate".  Are we witnessing that situation?  I know the percentage has not changed this year on the performing loans.  The delegates seem to be saying that if NAMA disposes of its good liquid assets up front, especially in the United Kingdom or the United States, it will be left with a rump and the performance of what remains may deteriorate.  This is what NAMA stated to the Minister.  This is shown in the figures because NAMA provided for a write-down of 57% on the current loan book and this figure has increased to 66%, based on NAMA's valuation of its accounts.  Do not talk about unrealised possibilities because they can be accounted for when they occur.  The accounts presented to the Minister show a write-down of 66% on what remains, which is worrying.  I have a few questions about the accounts.</p></speech>

Where they are struck off, it is necessary to get the company to restate it before one can do anything.  This is not a major difficulty but it is quite a time-consuming process.

If banks incur more than ten basis points, then they are obliged to absorb the cost.  If they incur fewer than ten basis points, then they only charge us for cost recovery.

It is possible that there could be an amount of unhealthy competition between NAMA and the IBRC which could, ultimately, be detrimental to the taxpayer.  When NAMA is pursuing debtors in the context of trying to obtain agreements, does it consider the views of the IBRC or any other financial institution which may also be owed money by those to whom I refer?  Is NAMA intent on obtaining the best deal possible for the taxpayer rather than trying to obtain such a deal for itself?  Does consideration of matters of this nature come within NAMA's remit?</p></speech>

I put the following straight question to Mr. McDonagh - has Mr. McDonagh a view on whether NAMA's single largest transaction to date that he mentioned could in some way have disadvantaged another State organisation, IBRC, owned by the taxpayer in terms of it collecting its debt?  Could NAMA's action have had excellent good news from its perspective but have had some collateral potential damage in terms of the collectability of other debts owed to another organ of the State?

I think NAMA and the IBRC are in a similar space from the point of view of the Irish taxpayer and I believe if would be better -  Mr. McDonagh cannot decide on  a policy issue, he has to work within the legislation but we are a policy committee - if the two organisations were under the one umbrella and working together rather than, on occasion, working to separate agendas.</p></speech>

My first question is on rental incomes.  Mr. McDonagh indicated that 90% of all rental income of NAMA properties is being diverted directly to NAMA.  Heretofore, I presume that a great deal of that rental income was not going directly to NAMA and that many of the accounts relating to properties, office blocks, shopping centres, etc., were held offshore in different parts of the Continent and further afield.  In respect of how many of those accounts can NAMA be assured that money was not siphoned into loan accounts that were not NAMA related that were being paid off or, even worse, put on deposit in other parts of the world?  That is the first question.</p></speech>

Clearly, some of that rental income related to properties outside Ireland.  What we did, as part of the business plan process in terms of injury of property, was identify where the rental income was coming up, identify the cost involved in maintaining the property, note what was available and then we set about capturing as much of that as quickly as possible.  As part of the process, where money was not being paid to a bank here, we asked questions as to where did the money go, what was done with it and, if it is on deposit and we could find it was, we asked that it be given back to us.</p></speech>

There were situations where people were taking the rent and they were diverting it into different accounts but once we got through the business plan process with each of the debtors we made sure that the income that was coming off NAMA properties was going towards servicing NAMA loans as opposed to what I believe the Deputy is suggesting, going towards servicing a debtor's other loans in an institution.  We set about the 80:20 principle of effectively targeting the big income first and getting that back and then working on the small amounts after that.</p></speech>

Effectively, they are not subject to receivership or whatever is the case.  Once a debtor is subject to receivership, NAMA does not pay him or her.  It would be up then to the receiver to decide whether he needed the debtor to work with him for a period after that.  That would be our call.</p></speech>

Is there further debt write-down going on within that agreement because these people will not be subject to the rigours of an administrator, a receiver or a liquidator?  Does NAMA have the autonomy, without circulating through the Department of Finance or anybody else, to further write down debt for that loan to be repaired?</p></speech>

In terms of what we do with consensual debtors, we can do a restructuring of a debtor's loans.  A debtor might owe &euro;100 million and we might have bought the loan again, to use the example, for &euro;40 million.  We might restructure that loan into what we call a tranche A type loan, a performing loan, which might be, say, &euro;45 million and then a tranche B loan, which is &euro;55 million.  The debtor would still owe &euro;100 million.  It is just the fact that we restructure his loans, and that is quite normal in banking.</p></speech>

Regarding personal guarantees, Mr. McDonagh has just alluded to the fact that some rental income was sent to places it should not have been sent to or rather than paying off the debt of the burden that is placed on citizens, personal guarantees existed predominantly within IBRC loans that had been transferred to NAMA.  To what extent will NAMA pursue those people?  Many of the people who sought bankruptcy off these islands had assets, whether they be gifted to family members, beyond the reach of NAMA to family members.  To what extent will NAMA pursue people for personal guarantees?  I am not asking for a witch-hunt but an element of fairness to ensure people are not up and running again two or three years later compared to the reality of negative equity and the generation that is carrying mortgages.  What timeframe has NAMA put on personal guarantees?  I know it is doing that extensively but I want a timeframe on that and for it to be public knowledge that these people are not being let off.</p></speech>

We go through a process with a debtor to try to get him or her to return the assets to us consensually and as I said in my opening statement, we have got back over &euro;500 million on that basis, but where people try to hide assets from us, and we suspect hidden assets, or they have transferred to third parties who will not return them, we openly say to them that we will pursue them through the courts and the evidence, which is in the public domain, is that we have done that.</p></speech>

When I worked with Merrill Lynch the New York securities exchange commission said that if anybody trading in shares, and property is very close to that, was doing the audited accounts or working at a high level they had to provide information to the groups they were working for to allow them be scrutinised to ensure insider trading was not happening.  If NAMA has organisations working for it or if they are dealing with organisations to purchase properties, whether it is in funds or anything else, I would be concerned that could be perceived as insider trading.  It would not be too much to ask for the legal firms and the accountancy firms NAMA is dealing with, and the receivers and liquidators, to ask their employees on a six monthly basis to provide information on any property related activities to NAMA.  It could be done in a confidential manner and it would give people that extra reassurance we seek.  It is just a suggestion.</p><p>  Can Mr. McDonagh give me NAMA's overall outlook on the Irish property market?  Is there anything the Government can do to assist NAMA further than what it is doing already?  To what problem would that refer?</p></speech>

If we take the residential property market, in the Dublin area, and it may be in some pockets of the Dublin area, there are positive signs.  Indeed, the latest Central Statistics Office figures out today indicate an increase in property prices in Dublin of over 2% while indicating that there is a drop elsewhere, but it is a very small drop.  That is what we would see.  On commercial property, there are some difficult areas but as we referred to earlier strong demand for buying office space will emerge in certain areas, particularly in Dublin, in the next few years.</p><p>  The other element of it is that the residential rental market is very strong.

Let me contextualise earlier questions, including that of Deputy Doherty, bearing in mind that the ultimate strategy of NAMA is to secure debt repayment and restructuring, as said by Mr. Brendan McDonagh in his opening statement.  In applying this strategy, what would NAMA consider to be a success if a developer had a debt of &euro;50 million on a shopping centre under control of the agency?  Would the &euro;50 million be recouped or repaid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012102400020#T00200"><p>I would love to say we would get the &euro;50 million back.  If we acquired the property for &euro;20 million and its value increased to &euro;50 million, we would clearly have an unsustainable property bubble of the kind that led to the problem in the first instance.  That would not be a good result.  From our perspective, however, we would like to see sustainable recovery in the property market in line with the recovery of the economy.  We would do our very best to get back the &euro;20 million we paid for the property.  If we could get more, that would be great, but it would be in no one's interest to have the value rise from &euro;20 million to &euro;50 million, which it was never really worth.  If the value increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million, for example, and the property were then sold, it would be a very good result for the taxpayer as there would be a gain of &euro;5 million.  However, the taxpayer will have lost on the other side because the banks would have had to have been capitalised in respect of the difference between &euro;50 million and &euro;20 million in the first instance.</p></speech>

The developer's debt would be controlled by NAMA but the developer would continue to manage the centre, for which work he or she would be paid a salary.  This relates to examples from this meeting.  Would all the decisions by the manager be countersigned by NAMA?  Would the developer operate independently?  I refer to the setting up of retail deals, the putting in place of leases and the management of tenants day to day.  The developer's interest would have changed fundamentally in that his relationship with his tenants would have changed quite significantly under NAMA.  As Mr. McDonagh stated, the value of the premises would have dropped from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million.  In Mr. McDonagh's opening address, he referred to the intensive management of assets in terms of securing a loan.  How is this reflected in the example?  Who would actually be running the show?</p></speech>

When one would apply to have a lease approved, one would have to go to one's bank.  We are ensuring this good practice applies.  If an owner wants to get a new tenant, he should make an application to us stating the prospective tenant will pay a certain rent per annum.  He would have to convince us this is best for the shopping centre.</p></speech>

This has always been a feature of good banking.  Perhaps during the boom, the banks stepped back and let the debtors carry out transactions without worrying as long as asset values were increasing.</p></speech>

In some cases, a landlord, or the developer, may be imposing upward-only rent reviews despite what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated in last year's budget speech.  In one case in Cork, involving Harvey Norman and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, an effort is being made to apply an increase of 2% per year.  What does NAMA do in such cases?  Next week, we will be asking the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation what it is doing.  What does NAMA do where landlords are trying to invoke upward-only rent review clauses?</p></speech>

In our guidance note, we always say that if a tenant cannot get anywhere with his landlord and believes the property in question is in NAMA, he has the option of contacting the agency directly.  We then have the relevant parties engage in the process.  As I stated, where people can prove inability to pay or where potential liability is affected, we examine the case.  There is a difference sometimes between someone with one or two shops and a multinational organisation that has signed up to a contract willingly on the basis of upward-only rent reviews.</p></speech>

In recent days, it was revealed that London-based Walbrook Capital purchased Irish Life's 17% stake in the special purpose vehicle, which owns 50% plus a share of the controlling ownership vehicle for NAMA.  Do we know anything about Walbrook Capital or the probity of its promoters, directors and owners?  Do we know about their integrity and abilities?  Do we know anything about the fact that they could become predators of the assets in NAMA's portfolio?  Have NAMA's owners a strict hands-off and brains-off policy regarding the portfolio of agency?  Are the investors passenger investors?</p><p>  I preface all my questions and remarks with the comment that I wish the delegates well and the optimum outcome in their endeavours.  In referring to the optimum outcome, I do not necessarily mean achieving top dollar because, as Mr. McDonagh explained, this is a damage-limitation exercise by a work-out organisation.  We must think of all the broader interests and, to some degree, ensure those with ability and the right attitude are not killed off.  One of the great Irish recoveries, the agribusiness recovery, pertained to Larry Goodman's group, Goodman International.  With co-operation and consensual effort, Mr. Goodman was able to earn his way out of his guarantees and return to owning his business.  That should not necessarily be precluded in this scenario if it leads to the optimum outcome for NAMA as an organisation.</p><p>  When the price of assets being transferred from the banks into NAMA was struck in 2009, there was a further fall-off in valuations.  We can see impairments mentioned in the accounts.  The juiciest parts of the portfolio have tended to be the ones that have been sold or are being sold.  The cashflow, while strong, amounting to &euro;100 million per month, or &euro;1.2 billion per year, could dry up primarily for two reasons.  The first is rent-break clauses in lease reviews and the second is the falling off and failure of tenants.</p><p>  I do not have time to ask all the questions in my head but I would like to touch on them.  The issue of upward-only rent reviews will not go away because of our lease arrangements, which are unique in Europe.  They were invented approximately 40 or 45 years ago.  In the rest of Europe, leases are much shorter, and open-market rents prevail.  We know this because Irish Life has a property fund in Paris in respect of which the break clause by Rexel will be operated, and the loan fund of 75% from PTSB will disappear, leaving shareholders holding their files and nothing more.</p></speech>

The NAMA divisions in the IBRC, AIB and Bank of Ireland comprise 200, 200 and 100 people, respectively, and I note the accounting firms also have NAMA divisions.  My concern about accounting and legal firms is that those firms which are doing work for NAMA have partners within them which also are partners in NAMA loan clients.  They may not be identical persons, but one should remember the partners are jointly and severally liable for their firm's business in their professional firms, as well as being jointly and severally liable, unless they contract out of it, for their property development and investment interests.  I am aware of firms which have partners which are partners in investment partnerships which are clients of NAMA.  Perhaps this is not direct but through crossover liabilities and exposures.  I am somewhat concerned that this is akin to the information leakage dangers in the agency.</p><p>  The break-even projection on a ten-year lifespan is grounded on the expectation of a sustained recovery in the economy and the banking sector over a medium-term horizon.  NAMA is confident that this will produce the modest recovery in Irish commercial and residential property prices that the agency will require to achieve the primary commercial objectives which have been set for it by the Legislature.  Some observers state we are bouncing along the bottom in the economy.  I suggest we are wobbling along the bottom and unless there is major debt relief across the economy in respect of the three elements of national debt, household debt and corporate debt, we could even sink further.  That is my reading of it and my question is whether the delegates agree.  Are there points I have mentioned that they think require clarification?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, this is because EUROSTAT expressed some reservations about the fact that when Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent was taken into State ownership, the majority ownership of NAMA then became State-owned.  That would have put NAMA back on the books, which everyone agrees would be something of a disaster.</p></speech>

They own 17% each, totalling 51%.  However, the crucial point is that NAMA has a veto.  Even with our 49%, we have a veto over the activities of that special purpose vehicle, SPV.  There was some media comment in recent days about Walbrook Capital regarding some criticisms made by the regulator in the United Kingdom.  However, it is clear to us that the regulator was not criticising Walbrook Capital but Barclays for one of a number of reasons.  It also is important to note this search for an investor was not conducted by NAMA but by Irish Life and the Department of Finance.  However, because of the structure in place, NAMA must approve the new investors.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned making sure that not all of what one might call the entrepreneurs were killed off in this process.  One can go back to the discussion about salaries and the discussion on the reason we are working with two thirds of the debtors.  We are not out there with a mission to kill them off.  We recognise that if this country has a viable future, development and the construction industry will be needed.  A healthy property sector will be needed, that is, not the type we had in the last decade but a healthy, sustainable property sector.  Consequently, one will not find a conflict between NAMA's objectives and endeavours to achieve an optimal outcome and the points made by the Deputy.</p><p>  On conflicts of interest between the banks and the legal firms, we undoubtedly are highly conscious of that issue.  In respect of our procurement of or engagement with any of these firms, there are all sorts of conflict issues.  I note that section 45 of the Act stipulates that NAMA must make every effort to avoid or manage conflicts of interest and that it must declare any such conflict, actual or potential, to NAMA.  This is something we very much police.  Moreover, while I am not here to speak for the legal or accounting firms, my experience is that they take this issue quite seriously.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked about the reference in my opening remarks to sustained modest recovery.  What we are talking about and the figure we have referenced consistently is a recovery over the lifetime of NAMA of approximately 10% in property prices from the 2009 base figures.  We believe it is reasonable to assume that will happen over NAMA's lifetime.  It is the aforementioned 10% that will give NAMA the outcome we talk about, that is, at a minimum, getting the senior debt repaid, plus overheads, plus carrying cost.  I hope we will get more than this.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh alluded to the point that the banks were really bad about how they disbursed their money and the loan offer documentation, that is, the security on which they advanced money, was extremely fragile, as well as being highly vulnerable to challenge.  I believe that cases are arising in which NAMA received loans and is sanitising a situation on behalf of the banks to improve and strengthen something that, had it remained within the banks, would have been highly vulnerable.  In cases in which there are personal guarantees and exposures, it is important that if this is being done, there be a sense of fairness.  I have been asked by people to examine examples in which I consider the banks advanced money on the security of secured assets, adding in personal guarantees, where cover on the valuation of the secured assets was three and four times the secured property value.  They are now relying on guarantees on foot of what was very poor disbursement and very poor conduct where they did not actually care whether there were net liabilities or net assets at the time of disbursement.  There is an absolute requirement that everything people may have had reasonably must come into the pot for collection.  One must guard against a hijacking mentality on the back of sanitised security because NAMA has taken the loans.  Does Mr. McDonagh see my point?  It is important because it is easy to go on a witch-hunt trail.</p></speech>

We have now met on a number of occasions.  As I am sure the delegates are getting tired at this stage, consequently, I will pick on something that might be a little different.  </p><p>  In his opening statement I note Mr. McDonagh points out that NAMA does not believe in a "one-size-fits-all panacea for the problems in the residential market".  I assume that consequently, because of their lack of salability, he notes that in the apartment market, NAMA's focus is on renting.  He then continues by observing that since acquiring loans, tenants have been secured for 4,000 previously vacant apartments in Dublin.</p></speech>

I understand there is a rental market of somewhere between 250,000 to 300,000 units and the Senator is correct in that if we have 10,000 units, that equates to one in 25.  As for the breakdown of figures regarding type against location and the extent of rent supplement, I do not have that information to hand but we will try to compile it and write back to the joint committee to provide it.</p><p>  As for receivers and rental markets, this is an issue we hear about a lot because people contact us about it.  In every single case about which we have been contacted and where there was a problem, it was not a NAMA receiver.  They were acting for another bank.  I acknowledge that might simply be luck but we are clear that receivers must do the job properly.  Moreover, if there are issues with the management company, there must be compliance with the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  We are very clear about all these issues and sometimes there are very difficult issues to be resolved that we simply have inherited.  We are highly conscious of making sure such issues get sorted out, although sometimes they are not easy to sort out.  As for the properties that are being made available, as I told Deputy Boyd Barrett, we have a limited amount of stock and the problem is much bigger than that.  In respect of the units NAMA has offered to make available, the term of the lease is for 20 years.  We recognise that longer-term leases are required, especially for the housing bodies as that is how they get the best value out of the property.</p><p>  The Senator spoke about REITs in terms of institutional interests and whether it would be domestic or international.  I believe it would be a bit of both.  The Senator also mentioned how her experience in this regard was not very good but, like anything, there are serious players who are institutional investors in REITs and who set up and run REITs.  There are others who are opportunists and who simply perceive it as a money-making opportunity.  One would hope the more serious players, who have experience in this regard, would be those who would do this.</p><p>  As for the Minister for Finance and the tax changes, the major point about REITs, unlike everything else, is that depending on where the REIT is located, it is all down to the distribution of income from it.  I understand that in some REITs, up to 90% of the net income must be distributed.  The issue then revolves around a policy issue on what rate of tax applies, or not, as the case may be.  These trusts are not very straightforward and different countries have set them up in different ways.  They have worked quite successfully in the United States but have been less successful in the United Kingdom.  I believe the latter is considering changing its structures again to try to get them to work better.  NAMA is willing to participate in a forum with the Department of Finance to try to design one that would work best for the industry and would be the most productive in trying to create a REIT industry in Ireland that works, as opposed to one that is in place but which does not work at all, because that would not be in anyone's interest.</p></speech>

Whatever about the possible advent of a REIT, that is one that could be tested sooner rather than later, because NAMA certainly hopes its first qualifying investor fund will be active early in the new year.  That will test the appetite of investors.</p></speech>

In the research to which the Senator referred, and it is developing in the UK as well, there is a recognition that rented accommodation will be a bigger feature of the future than it was heretofore.</p><p>  On a word of historical caution, the institutions did not interest themselves in residential mainly because they were afraid of unfavourable legislation.  Now what they are really looking for, and what this country has a good record in, is a stable environment, in other words, that when they buy they can reasonably foresee what the outturn will be.  We have that environment here and there is renewed interest in the residential sector.  That is quite important because the mortgage sector is stressed.</p></speech>

There is demand for more than 1,200 but I understand the qualification which applies, that what NAMA is dealing with is the demand from the voluntary housing associations, and they have indicated to NAMA 1,200 properties between them and local authorities.  I understand only 70 properties have been transferred to date.  Mr. McDonagh might clarify that.  What has been done to accelerate it?  NAMA stated that there would be a further 300 by year end.

There is then a lease arrangement with a voluntary body or a local authority, and NAMA receives money from a lease over a ten year period under the social housing lease arrangement.  Obviously, NAMA brings in money on behalf of the taxpayer as a public body.  Mr. McDonagh mentioned, in a reply to one of the members, that the option to buy after 15 years exists.  The taxpayer, through NAMA, takes on the liability of the loan in the case of social housing.  At what point does the wheel come around so that the taxpayers receive bang for their buck?  At what point is NAMA in a position to make good the public finances in terms of benefit to the taxpayer in State assets?</p></speech>

In terms of the social housing, our figures show that there have been 133 delivered to date.  We would wish there were many more and we would hope to have the best part of 400 delivered by year end.  This is what we are working to achieve but the issue has been to get it set up and trying to find a way to deliver it quicker.</p><p>  On the timing of the benefit to the taxpayer, the reality here is that NAMA paid bonds to the banks, the banks brought those bonds to the ECB, the ECB wants that money back and we must realise our portfolio.  Any time that we can sell an asset where we think that we will get fair value for it, we will use that to sell the asset and get the cash to pay off the bonds to the banks so that they can reduce their liability to the ECB.  I suppose the benefit to the taxpayer, as Mr. Daly outlined, is the quicker that we can get rid of what started out as almost a &euro;32 billion contingent liability to the taxpayer and get it down to zero.  Our plan is to get it down to zero by 2020.  We will only get it down to zero by 2020 through two sources: first, by keeping our costs low and taking as much rental income off the properties until they are sold and second, by selling the underlying properties or the loans themselves.  That is how it works.  I hope that explains it to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Of the &euro;32 billion in bonds, &euro;30 billion were secured bonds and &euro;2 billion were unsecured.  As I understand it, Mr. McDonagh would be confident of recouping the secured bonds.  In the case of the &euro;2 billion subordinated bonds, it is more or less an aim of NAMA to recoup them.  In that regard, there would be a concern that NAMA, and ultimately the taxpayer, could take a hit on those &euro;2 billion in bonds.  Have we any way of assuring ourselves?  To date, unfortunately - I wish it was otherwise - unguaranteed bonds in other quarters were secured and were paid up in full but in this case the liability has the potential to come back on the State and the taxpayer.  What guarantees can we get that this liability of &euro;2 billion in unsubordinated bonds will not fall back on the taxpayer?</p></speech>

There is approximately &euro;30 billion in senior bonds and &euro;1.6 billion in subordinated debt.  Our objective is to pay off the two amounts combined.  As Mr. Daly stated, we are confident that we will pay off the senior debt and we are reasonably confident we can pay off the sub-debt as well.  Sitting here today, 2020 is a long time away.  The economy is recovering and one would hope that by 2020 the economy would have recovered much better.</p></speech>

These properties are lying vacant and being vandalised.  For example, in Portarlington, there is a large factory which at one stage provided significant employment, but it lies vacant in a good location with security on it ceasing one year ago.  It is being vandalised, but NAMA and, ultimately, the taxpayer have secured the loan on it.  Nobody wants anything to be vandalised, particularly when it causes problems locally.  What steps can the agency take to secure properties such as this and lease or sell them?  Has there been engagement with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or anybody else who is interested in moving on to the properties?  Nobody wants assets to deteriorate; therefore, they should be secured.  NAMA is trying to protect its own interest in them and that of the taxpayer.  What is being done to rent or sell them?  What efforts are being made to move them on?</p></speech>

If the debtor is not co-operating for whatever reason - that sometimes can be the most difficult issue and we consider there is an issue, in respect of which we also talk to the local authority - we have to go to the District Court to get an order under section 141 of the NAMA Act which effectively allows us power of entry to secure the site.  Sometimes when people say it is a NAMA property, it is not always the case and if it not, we try to tell people that it is not our property.  However, if it is - Deputy Sean Fleming made reference to this issue - we go to the District Court to get a section 141 order to say we can have legal entry, that we are not trespassing and that we need to go in and secure the site.  If there is a problem, we have no interest in it worsening.  We believe in trying to solve it and if somebody is interested in a  particular site, whether it be a local authority or IDA Ireland, we are more than willing to talk.</p></speech>

The Deputy probably read that we were involved in the Kerry Group transaction in Naas, but it came to us.  At a minimum, we try to make sure it is aware of everything we have on the market.  Where there are special situations, we try to see if there is anything within the portfolio and bring it to the market.  We have very good liaison with it.  There is also good liaison whenever there is a difficulty with terms and conditions and moving a transaction along or speeding it up.  We regard it as part of the national effort.</p></speech>

Approximately 3,000 properties have been identified for social housing purposes.  Are some of the properties identified for social housing purposes among the 10,000 rental properties?

What funds does the agency have available for investment in capital projects?  The issue of the lack of availability of suitable properties, particularly for inward investment, is pertinent in both Limerick city and county.  I refer, in particular, to finishing fitted out units as distinct from core units and the scope NAMA has in this regard.  I am familiar with the NAMA legislation because I put it through on behalf of Fine Gael and debated it at length with the late lamented Brian Lenihan.  I know it from the cradle to the grave.  It has a number of key components.  The first is to get the banks lending, but that has not happened.</p></speech>

Over the past year or so the media commentary has been more positive and balanced.  We occasionally get a few broadsides.  At times we might think, as the Senator put it, that some of our detractors are given a platform.  He asked what we do to rebut that.  Sometimes we are constrained by confidentiality.  It works both ways.  There are times when we would love to breach it just to rebut some of the more spurious stuff that is put out there.  We try to get the facts out there.  If allegations are made against us in terms of probity or confidentiality, as the Senator knows, we chase it up and ask people to give us the facts, which we investigate.  If there is any substance to them, we will deal with them, but there has not been in one particular case, as the Senator well knows.</p></speech>

Senator Coghlan asked about the hotels that are in NAMA.  When we started off, we acquired loans with 121 hotels.  At this stage we have only managed to offload about six of them and we have 115 left.  The Senator raised the old chestnut about complaining about NAMA hotels.  I often hear people say on radio shows that a particular hotel is a NAMA hotel.  I feel like ringing in myself, except I would not want to be identified, and saying that it is not actually a NAMA hotel at all.</p></speech>

We have been quite upfront about this.  Complaints were made to the Competition Authority about NAMA hotels.  We met the Competition Authority and provided it with all the information it wanted and it then pursued the case.  We were able to prove to it that we do not support hotels that are not sustainable.  They have to wash their own face.  Sometimes the most difficult case is where that is not happening for whatever reason.  When we inherited it in 2010, we thought the hotel sector would a massive problem.  Certainly in the past year with the increase in tourism, because it is a function of volume, occupancy rates are much improved from where they were in 2010.  Mr. Hanna will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe they are now running at between 60% and 70%.  Once they get through a certain amount, they actually recover their costs.  I hope that deals with that.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara asked about the 10,000 units for social housing.  The majority of them are rented through the private sector.  We have agreed to conduct analysis and come back to the committee, breaking out the detail of the portfolio.  As houses become available, we add them to the list, as I said to Senator Hayden.  This year we have added another 300 since the 1,500 we did in June.  Once they become available, we ask if they are suitable for that.  The Deputy asked why they were rejected by the local authority.</p></speech>

Some of them then become available because they are no longer rented.  It depends on the location and the strength of the market.  If there is a very strong private rented sector there, they get snapped up very quickly, but at other times they might be in locations where it is not so strong.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked why the local authorities might reject them.  There are various reasons but the most common reason is the local authorities claiming there is already too much concentration of social housing in a particular location and for the sake of the socioeconomic mix, they do not want any more.  We do not decide that.  It is decided by the local authority with the housing associations.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am also delighted to welcome Ms Lilian Looloitai, director, Community Research and Development Services, CORDS, a voluntary organisation concerned with the development needs of the pastoral communities in northern Tanzania; our good friend, Mr. Jim Clarken, chief executive officer, Oxfam Ireland; and Dr. Nata Duvvury, co-ordinator of global women&rsquo;s studies and the MA in gender globalisation and development at NUI Galway.</p><p>  Gender equality is a fundamental human right and essential to effective poverty reduction.  Advancing the empowerment and equality of women is fundamental to the elimination of gender inequalities in access to, control of and the benefit of resources and services.  Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s overseas development programme, has placed a strong emphasis on the need to advance equal rights for men and women and actively supported work in our partner countries to combat gender-based violence, improve maternal and reproductive health services, prioritise the nutritional needs of pregnant women and infants, increase access by girls and women to education and assist women affected by or living with HIV-AIDS.  Irish Aid supports local protection programmes in some of our partner countries which are actively directed towards women in vulnerable circumstances, increasing participation by women in politics and women&rsquo;s access to and control over agricultural resources and services.</p><p>  Last August, with Mr. Jim Wells, MLA, and Mr. Jim Clarken, I visited northern Tanzania to see at first hand the work being done by our non-governmental organisations.  I am delighted we met two of our guests today there.  We were given a great insight in the work being done to overcome the obstacles, the culture and the difficulties women encountered in African societies.  Only last week a delegation from this committee visited Sierra Leone to review the delivery of the Irish Aid programme there.  We were struck by the immense challenges faced by women.  For example, gender-based violence is a serious problem.</p></speech>

The full name of my organisation is the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women&rsquo;s Empowerment.  I am grateful to Oxfam for its campaign, ending poverty starts with women, because that is the reason I am here.  UN Women is the newest agency in the United Nations system.  We were created because the United Nations recognises that what it has done over the past 60 years of its existence has not been sufficient.  That can also be said for many of the governments that comprise the UN.</p><p>  Progress has been made in some areas.  In 1946, the Commission on the Status of Women was established under the aegis of the UN.  The commission continues to meet annually to monitor the implementation of governmental commitments.  In 1979, as an outcome of the commission&rsquo;s work, governments adopted the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which provides the framework of rights for women against which we measure all our work.  There has also been a series of international conferences, the last of which was held in Beijing.  The Beijing platform for action outlines what needs to be done to advance women&rsquo;s rights and gender equality.</p><p>  However, within the UN system we recognise that we have been fragmented.  All UN agencies have worked on these issues but the results are not commensurate with the effort.  This is why member states decided in 2010 to create UN Women by pulling together four distinct existing entities, namely, the division for advancement of women, INSTRAW, UNIFEM and OSAGI, which monitored internal UN efforts to achieve gender balance and women&rsquo;s rights.  The General Assembly asked us to continue the good work of these agencies but to do it differently.  We were asked to combine what we do at the intergovernmental, normative level in terms of setting standards that governments apply to their own work with what is happening on the ground in terms of programmatic work.  UN Women was given a clear universal mandate so that, unlike many development agencies which work solely in developing countries, we work all over the world to provide programmatic support to developing countries and policy advice to developed countries, as we did last year when the Council of Europe was developing the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women.</p><p>  One of the purposes of building on these achievements was to enable UN Women to catalyse more effective work within the UN system.  We were not created to replace the work of other UN agencies but to help them do better.  We do not implement huge programmes at country level, although we are expanding our country presence, but rather we work through the UN resident co-ordinator system to support the co-ordinator and other UN agencies in becoming more effective on the ground.  Our programmes are designed to be catalytic in order that national governments as well as UN agencies can build on them and make them sustainable in so far as development and women&rsquo;s rights are concerned.</p><p>  We carry out a number of global programmes which we try to make as collaborative as possible.  We do not have unique programmes but, for example, work with FAO, IFAD and WFP on a programme for rural women, primarily in Africa but also in other regions.  We are also working with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNDP on a global programme of access to justice, and the UN statistical division, the World Bank, and the OECD on a programme to improve indicators and data on gender equality in order that they can be standardised for the entire world through the statistical commission.</p><p>  Our funding reflects this unique mandate.  We receive funding from the regular assessed budget of the United Nations as well as voluntary contributions.  The OECD countries are our primary donors but many developing countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and the Dominican Republic, also provide regular annual support to our core budget.  We are particularly grateful to Ireland as one of the leaders of the system-wide coherence effort within the UN, of which UN Women is one of the first children.  In terms of funding, Ireland has also supported UN Women from its early years and has increased its contributions over time.</p><p>  UN Women was established in recognition of the great disparities that exist for women worldwide.  This is perhaps most starkly evident in developing countries, but it is true not only of them.  Violence against women is a universal phenomenon that affects countries at all levels of income regardless of whether they suffer from conflict.  Inequality in the distribution of resources, rights and responsibilities affects the lives of many.  In the case of women, the structural basis of gender inequality compounds poverty, deprivation and discrimination.  I wish to highlight a case which we have all been following over the last month.  Malala Yousafzai is a 14 year old Pakistani girl who tried to claim the right to education and was attacked for it.  For every 100 boys out of school worldwide, 122 girls are out of school.  In many countries the situation is far worse.  Ireland has kept gender equality as a central concern in its engagement with Europe and countries in the developing world.  We commend it on this commitment and admire the fact that it brings its priorities together.  Addressing hunger is one of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and, therefore, the issue of women in rural areas has also become a priority.  If we work together we can make a big difference because rural women produce more than 55% of all food grown in developing countries and, once again, we are facing hunger problems and a spiralling food crisis.</p><p>  Our priorities involve expanding the voice of women and their contribution to their own and their communities&rsquo; well-being.</p></speech>

I appreciate very much the invitation and the opportunity to meet the joint committee.  We appreciate as NGOs in Tanzania the contribution Ireland makes through Irish Aid because we always receive support through it for our programmes.  I thank the committee on behalf of my other colleagues from Tanzania.</p><p>  I refer to the organisation I work with and gender issues.  CORDS is a local organisation which was formed in 1998.  It started to have a gender and women development programme in 2000.  It has not been easy to undertake this programme.  The Masai communities do not give opportunities to Masai women to access their rights.  We have three objectives.  One is reducing poverty through income activities.  We have been doing work on income generating activities.  This has to do with businesses and microfinance, from which we have seen many results.  We also have a non-income poverty objective.  This deals with education and the issue of capacity building for women and men because we find Masai women do not have access to education and that this has an effect from the family level to the community level.  We have many challenges, but we believe we have done a lot to promote gender rights.</p><p>  Property rights have also been a problem within Masai communities, especially with the link to gender issues.  Women are not allowed to own livestock, land and other productive resources and this has limited their access to human rights.  Education is not available because women are in the minority.  The number of Masai women in the country with a degree is very low.  We do not number more than 50.  We feel like we are a minority among men and can also see how many of them go to university to masters level.  Women are not moving that far.  If one has a degree, one probably received a scholarship and there is no family support.  The government is still not providing support.  This has also dragged down the opportunities for women.</p><p>  Decision making has been a big challenge for women in Tanzania and for us as Masai women because we are not allowed to attend meetings and talk and also to try to influence, even at the family level.  This is also a factor I need to highlight.  We do not have health facilities and services on Masai lands, but we believe as women we are the vulnerable among this vulnerable group.  Men own properties and can sell livestock and land to go to hospital.  Only men can sell livestock to take a woman or a child to hospital when they are almost dead and they probably will die on the way.  We also do not have access to mobile clinics and vaccinations.  I am not here to complain about my government, but we have hospitals only in the headquarters of the districts which are 80 km away from the people in rural communities.  Therefore, it is difficult for the majority to access them.  However, we can see how men have exposure.  They are free to move or go to towns and have a higher possibility of accessing the available hospitals compared to women.</p><p>  The only request I have for the Irish Government and the European people is to try to promote the issue of security of land within the pastoralist areas because we believe we are not secure as pastoralists.  Members will be aware of Ngorongoro National Park and Conservation Area, the Serengeti, Tarangire, Manyara and Mkomazi.  They were used to build pastoralist lands.  Therefore, we believe the government and investors are torturing the pastoralists which, at the end of the day, affects pastoralist women.  We need to have security over our own land in order that we can at least see something is being developed on our own land.  The tendency is that the government considers the Masai are not settling, but this is not true and we do not receive social services or have access to resources surrounding our own area.  I request the committee to lobby for resources and to tell our government to do something for its own people, including the people within pastoralist communities.  We also need to look at changing the role of women.  This has to be part of the international effort in our country because we can see how the government receives a number of policies and laws from outside, but they do not want to receive comments or an input from their own people.  I request the committee to continue to support partners such as Oxfam in promoting our programmes for pastoralists and the entire developing world.</p></speech>

I want to focus on gender-based violence.  We are all aware of how important an issue this is but we do not necessarily understand the significant cost violence places on development itself and that it must therefore be addressed.</p><p>  There are three ways in which violence affects development.  It impacts on household economy, because households must spend a considerable amount of money to meet the out-of-pocket expenditures that are incurred when there is an incident of violence within the household.  A study in Uganda showed that the out-of-pocket expenditure for households was $5, or 1.5% of the per capita GNI, per incident of violence.  In research just concluded in Vietnam, we found that an incident of violence incurred out-of-pocket expenditures that amounted to 21% of monthly income for women.  In India, we have calculated that out-of-pocket expenditure plus loss of income for missing work amounted to almost 30% of the monthly income of poor agricultural labourer households.  This tells us that our anti-poverty alleviation programmes can be undermined by violence and that this is extremely important to bear in mind.  </p><p>  Violence has an impact upon the participation of women.  We are all concerned that development should be on the basis of women's participation, but violence affects this.</p></speech>

Their comments indicate clearly the significant challenges which exist in the area under discussion.  Mr. Clarken's comment that a culture which demeans people is not worth saving is powerful and surely strikes a chord with any rational person.  Discrimination, the denial of basic human rights, injustice and the need, as Dr. Duvvury stated, for inclusive development are all very important points in developing and implementing policy.  I welcome the important work done by Irish Aid in so many areas.  All the witnesses referred to its work.  The fact UN Women assists 62 countries with planning programmes shows the breadth of the work being undertaken and its necessity.  I welcome this work.</p><p>  All of us as individual parliamentarians support the work of Irish Aid, and it is worth noting the first objective of Irish Aid's gender equality policy is to advance equal rights for men and women.  Particular emphasis is laid on the need to work to combat gender-based violence.  The policy's second objective is to eliminate gender inequalities in access to, control of, and benefit from resources and services.  Irish Aid has worked with many partners in many countries.  Last year Irish Aid supported Ethiopia, Tanzania and Mozambique in strengthening their health systems and providing better services to their citizens.  The work is wide-ranging and addresses not just hunger, which is very important, but also development.  Ms Looloitai referred to the difficulties faced by women, especially with regard to food production and working in agriculture.  We all would like to see a greater impetus in the role of women in agriculture and food production.</p><p>  I do not know whether I understood properly, but it was mentioned that in Tanzania, women are not allowed own land or sell livestock.  Eastern Africa was also mentioned in this regard.  Land strikes a chord with Irish people because, throughout our history, it has been in our psyche and we had difficulties for many decades.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on whether programmes can be improved or a different emphasis can be given to women in food production.  The comments made today are very important.</p><p>  I am relatively new to this area.  A report from Irish Aid referred to greater participation in education at primary level in countries where the global partnership for education exists.  Participation at primary level had increased to 60%.  I am not at all familiar with the education systems which exist in developing countries.  What is the participation rate of girls and young female adults at post-primary level or in technical education?  Is there an imbalance with regard to those who have the opportunity to participate?</p></speech>

May I say how welcome and instructive the visit of our distinguished guests is.  Some of the questions I was going to ask have been at least partially answered.  I was going to ask about the significance of cultural determinants because these are terribly important.  I do not think we can afford to be too superior in this country.  I am quite elderly, which comes as a surprise to people, but I am.  I was an exact university contemporary of Mary Robinson, with whom I am sure the witnesses are familiar.  I was very interested in the comment that ending poverty starts with women because several years ago Mary Robinson spoke in the Thomas Davis theatre in Trinity College, at an event which I believe was hosted by Oxfam, and this was the theme.  She spoke very effectively.</p><p>  Mary Robinson and I won the same prize for coming first in our subjects in university.  I was a foundation scholar but she was a non-foundation scholar because women were not allowed to be foundation scholars.  When I was an undergraduate, women had to leave the university premises by 7 p.m., otherwise they were fined.  They could not be members of the main debating societies.  Until 1882, women's property was immediately and automatically assumed into their husband's estate on the moment of marriage.  We are all travelling, perhaps at slightly different rates for different reasons, along the same road.  Therefore we cannot afford to be too superior.</p><p>  I very much welcome what Mr. Clarken said, and the former Minister, Deputy Smith, noted it also, that a culture which discriminates is not worth preserving.  He went on to say something from which I took even more heart, which is that we must not be precious.  Very often in these diplomatic circles I see a preciousness that we must respect culture because of a colonial past.  This is rubbish.  Where there is injustice, one must face it and confront it.  One does not bury one's head in the sand because of an absurd inhibition about treading on people's corns.</p><p>  We are used to the ideas of centrality, women, the family, child rearing and multi-tasking.  What I found particularly interesting, which was also discussed at the earlier conference, was the significant proportion of contribution in agricultural areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.959" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012102400007#F00200"><p>I welcome and congratulate our guests on their interesting dissertation.  We all agree with the sentiments expressed.  A number of matters spring to mind that are not purely gender-based.  There seems to be a worldwide problem of violence against the vulnerable, be they women, children or the elderly.  It appears to be a part of society.  This ugly side seems to be prevalent and is not being checked.  It continues regardless across the board in the form of female genital mutilation, a lack of education or access to job markets, etc.  As Senator David Norris stated, many countries are affected.</p><p>  The issue of the teenage girl who took a stand in Pakistan went slightly unnoticed.  Given her age, her stance was courageous and she paid a high price for it.  As other members probably have, I have submitted questions to the Minister in this regard.  It behoves the worldwide community to focus on these issues and ensure the sacrifices being made and, most importantly, the reasons they are being made do not go unnoticed.  That a child recognised the need to take such a stance on the issue of access to education is an inspiration to people of all ages everywhere.  The worldwide community should converge on the issue and offer support in every way possible, be it through diplomatic intervention or otherwise.</p><p>  Thanks to a recent visit, in the past week we have learned about land grabbing.  Given the reasons set out by Mr. Clarken and others, it is a serious issue.  People are conned out of their properties and relocated to facilitate mining or major agricultural enterprises that have nothing to do with the supposed intention of improving poor farmers' living standards but with the profit interests of large multinational corporations.</p><p>  My final point is on development aid.  It is important that we recognise that these straitened times pale into insignificance when compared with the level of deprivation and poverty obtaining in many other countries.  We need to get this message across to the Government and the population.  We must live up to our international responsibilities and we have bravely done so to date.  The efforts of aid agencies and people on the ground, including indigenous community leaders, are superhuman and should be supported.</p></speech>

The presentations have been interesting.  Each of the millennium development goals is praiseworthy, but unless we sort out the basic issue of hunger, nothing else can be done.  If someone is hungry, he or she will not be able to attend school or work.  I have limited experience of this issue in that I have visited some African countries.  This time last week we were in Sierra Leone and I have been left with particular images in my mind.</p><p>  The quality of teaching in many African countries is a significant issue.  In Dublin I chair the board of management of a primary school.  A vacancy arose unexpectedly.  Last week we received 288 <i>curricula vitae</i> from qualified unemployed teachers.  A connection could be made with teacher training colleges.  All teachers would not want to take up this major role in Africa, but a number could fulfil it.  As someone who was a teacher until three years ago, I was appalled that quite a number of teachers in Sierra Leone were involved in the rape of their students.  It is horrific that a family member would do it, but teachers are in a position of trust.  Having travelled miles to attend school to avail of an education, young girls must then face this possibility.</p><p>  To mark International Day of the Girl Child I attended an event two weeks ago.  Is this issue on our guests' agendas?  We were conscious of the number of children having babies in Freetown in Sierra Leone.  It was frightening.</p></speech>

Although we have heard many presentations on this matter, we have not heretofore been given the same level of information.</p><p>  I have two questions for the delegates.  How committed is the international community, in particular the richer countries such as the United States, Germany, France and Britain, to tackling the issue of gender equality worldwide?  Obviously, UN Women has an input in China, an important member of the United Nations.  However, we receive very little information on gender status in China.  There is much concern about the one child family policy in China.  I do not know of any woman who is a senior member of the Communist Party.  What involvement does China have in politics and civil society?  While we are conscious of what is going on in terms of gender equality in Africa and the Far East, the position in China is, for some of us, a blank spot in this regard.  Can the delegates, in particular Ms Menon, cast light on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012102400008#G00300"><p>I apologise for coming in and out of the meeting, but there is another meeting taking place with a delegation from the western Sahara.  Having left that meeting early, I have also insulted it.</p><p>  I would like to focus on NAP provision and apologise if this issue has been addressed.  It is 11 months since the Government launched its national action plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  In the delegates' view, should the monitoring group be up and running by now, with full implementation of the plan under way?  I understand the civil organisations involved in the UN Security Council resolution have proposed an alternative independent chairperson of the monitoring group, given the resignation of Inez McCormack owing to ill-health.  Perhaps Mr. Clarken might indicate if there has been a response from the T&aacute;naiste's office to that proposal?</p><p>  Earlier this week some of us attended the launch of an RTE film on the Congo from which we learned that to date 4.5 million people had been killed and of the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war and a means of breaking people in that part of the world.  The situation does not appear to be on anyone's agenda.  While we are all aware of what is happening in Syria and other parts of the world, the scale of what is happening in the Congo region, in terms of the number of people killed, has been almost forgotten.  Previously Roger Casement shone light on what was happening in the region, including people having their arms cut off and so on.  This is still going on, despite the fact that there is a huge UN presence in the region.  There have been stories told of enormous numbers of rapes being carried out about 20 km from the main UN camp.  While standing up for human rights is important, it is equally important that we do not stand idly by while this continues.</p><p>  On the last occasion the T&aacute;naiste met the committee he told us about the establishment of a new group on Saudi Arabia.  We are all aware of the role of women in society there.  I have previously tried to get information on whether women are involved in the new business council.  It is important to ensure a gender balance in these groups, in particular in those parts of the world where women are forced to take a step back.  How important is it for countries in the West which have their own views on the issues of gender balance and the involvement of women in society to take a lead in this regard?</p></speech>

On the issue of sexual violence in conflict, the important point was made that this did not only affect women.  When the United Nations undertook an investigation in Libya, it found that the incidence of sexual violence against men was higher.  This was an interesting finding.  We need to address this issue.  </p><p>  A question was also posed about the situation in Syria.</p></speech>

Mr. Brown will take the petition to President Zardari and there has already been a reaction in Pakistan.  We hope it will encourage that and other governments to do more.</p><p>  I will speak briefly on what Ireland can do.  One can relate to the issue of gender-based violence.  The next Commission on the Status of Women, which meets in March in New York, has as its priority theme violence against women.  It is a significant opportunity for a country like Ireland to showcase how it has dealt with the issue nationally.  The second element of the issue is that Ireland will at that time have the EU Presidency, so there is an opportunity to bring together the entire European Union to discuss the issues in a way that recognises violence against women is a global epidemic.  This must be dealt with in the same manner we dealt with HIV-AIDS; it is not just a problem of health, violence or women individually but a problem affecting economies, societies, politics and the lives of men, women and children.  Therefore, the method of tackling the problem must be more significant than if we are dealing with an issue just related to women, health or the provision or funding of services.  We must consider prevention, so I refer to the quality of education.  We must judge whether the standard of education deals with these kinds of issues and transforms society in the process.</p><p>  There were a couple of questions on the caste system.  I come from India but gender inequality is innate in all societies, and it is often compounded when it intersects with racism, caste systems or any other form of discrimination.  Gender discrimination has all kinds of ramifications in different societies.  We have discussed Saudi Arabia and the one-child policy in China, including the discriminatory consequences for girls.  When it intersects with other forms of discrimination, it plays out in a very different way, so tackling it cannot only be done through legislation.  Untouchability is banned in the Indian constitution, for example.  The problem must be tackled through the actions of women and men in society, which can be supported through education and campaigns etc.  It is a transformation of the mind and the way one thinks of his or her culture and tradition that must come about.</p><p>  Several of us have spoken about the opportunity Ireland will have with the post-2025 framework.  Perhaps the next six months will be crucial with regard to Europe coming from the crisis, and Ireland will have the EU Presidency at this time.  We would like to see the response to the economic crisis as one promoting people's development, gender equality and looking for solutions that are not singly technocratic but rather pro-people.  Perhaps this moment of crisis could be used to carve a new future.</p></speech>

Deputy Crowe asked if the monitoring group for the national action plan should be up and running.  It should be but is not so we urge those with influence to try to ensure that happens as soon as possible.  It is very sad about Ms Inez McCormack's personal situation and we offer our sympathies to her.  She would have been an ideal chairperson but, unfortunately, that has not been possible.  It is important that the process gets moving with some momentum.</p><p>  I was not aware of the documentary regarding the Congo.  We brought a television crew to Congo approximately three years ago and there was an outdoor exhibition in Dublin and Belfast to highlight the issue.  The statement that this is a forgotten war is correct.  With 5.4 million people killed, it is the worst conflict since the Second World War but it is still not seen on the media every day of the week.  As a result there is not sufficient focus on it and we must continue our efforts in that respect.  Oxfam works there, supported by Irish Aid, and we are grateful for that.</p><p>  I will mention the Arab world with regard to Saudi Arabia.  I recently returned from Tunisia, having met with women's groups in that country.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that the action is implemented without further delay.  It is, of course, extremely sad about Inez.  As Mr. Clarken said, we are all very understanding about that situation.  As others highlighted, there will again be a discussion at the UN Security Council on women and peace and security next Monday.  It is really important as it is more than a year since the action plan was drafted.</p></speech>

In the case of the Masai, one can have the piece of paper showing ownership of land without having access to and utilisation of that land.  We need to go beyond that.</p><p>  It was mentioned that people are selling land for a bottle of beer.  In the case of Masai, that is true in some parts but this has been tricky for village governments and at district level.  Something needs to be done.   </p><p>  I refer to the issue of pastoralism.  I think I mentioned that pastoralism is not supported as a livelihood system in Tanzania.  In the case of Kenya, it is getting support through the new constitution.  It is different from Tanzania right now.</p></speech>

Pastoralism is their way of life and an important part of the Masai culture.  We hope that when the Tanzanian Government is reviewing its constitution, that form of farming and the Masai tribe will be taken into account because they are the face of Tanzania for many tourists visiting the country.  Tourism is important to Tanzania and the Masai people are important, as we saw when we were there.</p></speech>

It was adopted unanimously in 2000 but ten years later, very little had happened.  We now have this national action plan.  No chair has been elected, although I think civil society has recommended a number of replacements for Inez.  I recommend that we write to the Minister in this regard.  The resolution is coming up at the UN again.  If a chairperson were in place, we could move forward in implementing the plan.  It is a small step.  Again, we are talking about symbolism.</p></speech>

There are many different types of pressure in different countries.  In China, it is an interesting situation.  Inequality in China is now wider than in Brazil, which was the benchmark.  There have been huge gains in many areas, including education, health and economic opportunity, but we still have some structural issues which did not exist earlier or had been combatted in certain ways, including women's rights, and which are resurfacing.  Two were touched on.  One is the role women play in decision-making, which is a universal problem.  On average, women comprise only 18% or 19% of parliaments throughout the world.  I believe it is even lower in Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank him very much for doing so.  Obviously, gender equality is a fundamental human right and an essential part of any effective poverty reduction strategy.  On foot of today's meeting, with the permission of the committee, I suggest we write to the T&aacute;naiste to ask him to highlight the importance of gender equality during Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.  It would be useful for us to ensure gender equality was included as part of the programme for our Presidency.

I would like to summarise my submission which I sent to the sub-committee in August.</p><p>  When I took over as chairman of the Parole Board July 2011, there were regular delays in reviewing the cases of prisoners.  From 2013, however, I am hopeful that all prisoners will be reviewed by the board on time.  If there are delays, the individual prisoner will be notified and informed when the review will take place.  From feedback we have received, it appears that many prisoners are not fully aware of the work of the board.  Accordingly, in the next 12 months I hope to visit all the prisons and have meetings with the relevant prisoners to inform them about the work of the board.  Only today we had a board meeting in<b></b>Arbour Hill Prison and I had a meeting with a number of prisoners about the parole process.  I hope to speak to prisoners in Wheatfield Prison and the Midlands Prison in November.</p><p>  There is no formal training of board members before they are appointed to the Parole Board.  I have introduced a system whereby the board is addressed, at most meetings, by a member of the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service or the psychology service on relevant matters.  One of the problems we have identified is that there is only a small number of fixed-term prisoners participating in the parole process.  Most of the prisoners participating are serving a life sentence.  The following initiatives might be helpful to encourage these prisoners to participate in the process.<br /><b></b>The Prisons Act 2007 provides for 33% remission for those who engage with the rehabilitation services.  This provision has been used infrequently and the Parole Board could play an important role in this area in terms of enhanced remission.<b></b>Many prisoners sentenced to life or a long prison sentence are not aware of what steps they should take to improve themselves while in prison.  The initiative of the integrated sentence management scheme is to be welcomed, but it should apply to all long-term prisoners, especially those serving a life sentence.</p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has suggested prisoners might be reviewed after four or five years by the Parole Board.  While welcoming this idea, the board could not review greater numbers of prisoners without increased resources, as well as without increased resources for the probation and psychology services which must prepare reports for it.  When a prisoner is released on remission, it is not possible for supervision orders to be made. <b></b>It is only when a prisoner is released on<b></b>parole or given temporary release that supervision orders or conditions can be made.  This is a problem which causes complications in practice.</p><p>  I will mention some points on life sentence prisoners.  It is important that such prisoners are given a sentence plan from the start of their sentence.  As mentioned, it is hoped the integrated sentence management scheme will deal with this matter.<b></b> The Parole Board only reviews life sentence prisoners after they have served a sentence of seven years, but it might be helpful for it to review them after four or five years.  However, a life sentence prisoner was recently granted parole, with the Minister's consent, after serving a sentence of 12 or 13 years.  He was a model prisoner and quite exceptional in<b></b>how he had rehabilitated during his prison sentence.  He has<b></b>offered to speak to other life sentence prisoners when we are addressing them in the next 12 months or so.<br /><b></b>Life sentence prisoners can become institutionalised if they have served 15 or 16 years or more in prison.  The Parole Board, in<i></i>conjunction with the Irish Prison Service, should give special attention to such prisoners.  If a prisoner in the United Kingdom is sentenced following a murder conviction, he or she normally receives the benefit of a tariff, or a minimum sentence which the court directs he or she must serve.  If he or she subsequently transfers to Ireland and continues his or her sentence in Ireland, he or she loses the benefit of this tariff, as Irish law applies and there is no recognition of tariffs imposed by the English courts.  The Law Reform Commission, in a report earlier this year on mandatory sentencing, recommended that courts might be given discretion to recommend a minimum sentence which persons convicted of murder might serve.  There is merit in this suggestion, but sentencing guidelines would be essential if such reforms were to be introduced.<br /><b></b>The privacy of prisoners should be respected after they have been released from prison, but quite often the press have no<b></b>regard for these issues.<b></b>On a related point, elderly prisoners and prisoners suffering from intellectual disabilities should receive special treatment in prison.  More resources are needed to assist the Probation Service when helping prisoners who are released to reintegrate into society.  If the numbers of prisoners are reduced in the prisons, with a subsequent saving of money, such savings should be transferred to the Probation Service.</p><p>  The Minister has confirmed that the Parole Board will be placed on a statutory footing and mentioned that he hopes the legislation will be introduced in<b></b>2014.  However, if this reform is introduced, there should be an appeals process from the board to a tribunal or other appropriate body.  I also have a concern that when the board is placed on a statutory footing, there could be increased demand from prisoners for legal representation.  I am in favour of legal representation in some but not all cases.  There could also be a greater number of judicial reviews of board decisions and these matters would have to be examined.</p><p>  I<i></i>welcome recent initiatives such as the community release scheme, the new incentivised regimes policy and<i></i>the new integrated management programme.  I also welcome the community integrated plan which will be developed nine months prior to the release of a prisoner back into the community.  I congratulate the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and the psychology service for all the excellent work they do.</p></speech>

My submission makes the case that there are multiple aspects of the prison system crying out for reform.  We can see this whether we look at the overall or macro aspects of the prison system, or whether we look at what happens to individual men and women in prison, in other words, when we look at the conditions in which they are held, what it is like to be in a typical cell and so forth.  In all these aspects of the prison system I stress that there are very strong models for doing things in a far better way such as, for example, in the Nordic countries.  To show how things could be done differently I incorporated an article on the position in Denmark, Finland and Norway in my submission.  The submission points to where reform is urgent in making 13 recommendations, all of which are eminently feasible.  With every one of these proposals for improvement, we can learn lessons from at least one Nordic country and usually from several of them.</p><p>  I wish to highlight four proposals for reform which relate to the shape of the overall prison system and, in particular, the way we plan the prison estate.  We could and should plan for a reduction of at least one third in the prison population.  This would merely bring Ireland closer to the rate of incarceration it consistently had up to the mid-1990s, or near to rates in Nordic countries today.  We should have at least one third of that reduced population in open prisons, as is the case in Denmark, Finland and Norway.  Ireland has only 5% of the prison population in open prisons such as Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  </p><p>  There is another side to the coin in reducing the prison population.  We should think in terms of having two thirds of all sentences served in the community rather than in prison; the rate currently stands at only about 30% in Ireland, but it is 67% in Sweden and 68% in Denmark.  We should have much smaller prisons, as is generally the case in Nordic countries.  In Ireland we are clearly incapable of operating prisons with more than about 150 prisoners without resorting to extensive, very destructive and costly segregation measures.  Every one of the nine largest prisons, including Arbour Hill Prison, has severe segregation measures and it seems these systems do not work.</p></speech>

I visit the prisons on a regular basis.  I spend most of my weekends in the prisons and I spend my time meeting prisoners, so that is the perspective I am coming from.  I would have no hesitation in saying that from that perspective, our present prison system is a total disaster.</p><p>  The mission statement of the Irish Prison Service is to provide safe and secure custody, dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.  The only word in that which is actually appropriate is "secure".  Our prisons are not safe.  There is very little dignity of care and there is very little rehabilitation for the majority of prisoners.  I refer to something in the report by the Inspector of Prisons on St. Patrick's Institution which is very instructive about the attitude towards prisoners.  He said he found that the prisoners there, who were not allowed to wear their own clothes, were wearing prison clothes which were ill-fitting, torn, had holes in them and were dirty.  To give prisoners clothes like that is a symptom of the attitude that exists towards prisoners - they are of no value.  There is no respect for the prisoners and the majority of prisoners feel that.  Even though there are some wonderful prison officers who really care and who try very hard, the system itself communicates a total lack of respect and care for prisoners.</p><p>  The most fundamental problem in the prisons is overcrowding.  Until that is addressed, it is extremely difficult to deal with the other serious issues such as rehabilitation, drug misuse and violence in our prisons.  For example, when Wheatfield Prison opened in 1989, it was a model prison.  It had 320 cells for 320 prisoners and it had constructive activity for almost all of those 320 prisoners.  Then it started putting bunk beds into the cells.  Most cells in Wheatfield are double now.  The number of prisoners rose to 500.  A new extension was opened and the number rose to more than 700, but not one single extra classroom or workshop was built.  That is a symptom of the way the prison system has been going.  We could now describe the prison system as a warehousing of prisoners.  As long as the problem of overcrowding exists, it is difficult to deal with other problems.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has repeatedly stated that it does not have control over the number of people going into prison.  I accept that, but it does have control over the number of people coming out of prison.  One thing we could do immediately, which was recommended by the Whitaker committee in 1985, is to introduce one third remission.  I would go further, but politically that may not be possible.  One third remission for good behaviour would immediately free up a considerable number of spaces.  It is not a hugely radical proposal.  In the UK, which is hardly a model of good penal policy for us, there is 50% remission, but during that 50% remission time one is under the supervision of a probation officer and can be recalled to prison if the supervision breaks down.</p><p>  Approximately 80% of the people going into our prisons have an addiction problem and for many of them, that is the reason they are there.  One way to ensure people do not go to prison is to deal with their addiction problems in the community.  There are various ways to do that.  The drug court is a small example but it is very limited.  Nevertheless, if addiction facilities within the community are better, fewer people will eventually have to go to prison.  Within the prison system itself, there are nine detox beds for 4,500 prisoners, most of whom have an addiction problem.  There are very few drug-free spaces in our prisons for those who are drug free.  I personally know about 40 people - the number grows every month - who never touched a drug before they went into prison but came out addicted to heroin.  They may be sharing a cell with a heroin user or they may be living within a drugs culture.  The boredom and monotony of prison life, because there is very little for most prisoners to do, drives people to using drugs just to escape from that boredom.</p><p>  There is a proposal - the Irish Prison Service may be thinking about this - that the medical unit in Mountjoy Prison, which is capable of accommodating maybe 50 to 60 prisoners, should be designated as a drug detox centre.  When people have completed their drug detox, the training unit would be one option.  They would move to an intensive rehabilitation programme in the training unit and from there they would be released on a phased basis, perhaps into day treatment programmes in the community.  If we could deal effectively with the addiction problems of people going into prison, we would reduce the numbers going into prison enormously. </p><p>  In regard to rehabilitation, there are excellent school and training facilities in most of our prisons but they are available only to a tiny proportion of prisoners at any one time.  The profile of prisoners is well documented.  They have low levels of literacy, are early school leavers, have few qualifications or skills, have a poor employment history and sometimes have a history of homelessness or mental health issues.  We have an opportunity in prison, particularly for those serving longer sentences of 12 months or more, to try to address some of those deficiencies, but for the majority of prisoners it just does not happen, as they do not have access.  They may have access to the school one morning per week and they may have access to a training programme one morning a week.  The statistics we get from the Irish Prison Service are hopelessly unreliable.  It will talk about 58% of prisoners attending school.  That could mean attending school one morning per week but being idle and bored the rest of the time.  It will talk about a certain number of prisoners attending a particular workshop, but if one goes to the workshop one finds that only a quarter of the prisoners who are supposed to be attending are actually there because it does not have the required number of staff due to the embargo on recruitment.  Rehabilitation in an overcrowded prison becomes virtually impossible.</p><p>  Integrated sentence management is the best thing I have heard of but, in reality and despite all the hype, it is not happening.  The Irish Prison Service will attack me on that but, basically, it is not happening.  If it is, it is happening for a tiny number of people.  It has huge potential but it is not happening.  </p><p>  Putting people into 23 hour lock-up, as a huge number are, to keep them safe is inhumane.</p></speech>

I understand that when members of the sub-committee travel to Finland, they will have an opportunity to meet Mr. Tapio Lappi-Sepp&auml;l&auml; who made a presentation at our conference last month.  The achievement of political consensus is a central part of his thesis on how the prison population can be reduced.  There can be no political consensus in the absence of a culture of acceptance that this is a real issue.  Perhaps this committee might examine how best to foster a culture in which political consensus can be achieved.  The recent report on St. Patrick's Institution highlighted cultural issues on the ground, at the highest management levels of the Irish Prison Service and perhaps within the Department.  Mr. Lappi-Sepp&auml;l&auml; emphasises that the reaching of political consensus has been of great importance in Finland.  The Minister has asked a new working group to review penal policy.  While that is to be welcomed, I am concerned that the group will not have sufficient time - it is due to report back by mid-2013 - and that its composition suggests it is heavily laden with departmental appointees, especially by comparison with the group established on foot of the Whitaker report.</p></speech>

They are all underpinned by the need to reduce the prison population without putting the public at risk, whether in terms of the extra burden of victimisation or additional costs.  Before I outline my recommendations, I would like to make the observation that discussions about crime and punishment tend to have a circular feel to them.  When I was compiling my submission, I was reminded that an Oireachtas sub-committee on crime and punishment had met and reported 12 years ago.  Some of the observations made by that sub-committee are worth repeating.  It is striking that despite the sub-committee's recommendations and the recommendations made by all committees in the last 30 years, the prison population is continuing to increase and the same kinds of recommendations are being restated.  It is probably fair to say there is a reasonable degree of consensus about what needs to be done, which is to reserve prison for the most serious offenders or those who pose the greatest threat, to minimise the harm that incarceration poses to such persons and their families and to deal with as many people as possible in the community.  The problem seems to be to obliterate the blocks in the way of progress.</p><p>  It is worth running through a couple of the recommendations made by the previous sub-committee 12 years ago.  There was consensus that greater recourse to imprisonment was not the only way in which the problem of crime could be addressed.  That consensus continues.  </p><p>  There was a real concern about fine defaulters going to prison.  It was suggested there should be a more effective and efficient way of imposing financial sanctions, recovering the moneys involved and reducing the burden on the courts and the prisons.  Approximately 1,300 fine defaulters were committed to prison in 2007.  That figure had increased to approximately 7,500 by last year.  It accounted for almost half of the total number of committals, which is a huge problem.  It was very pressing 12 years ago and is even more pressing today.  </p><p>  The idea that the number of prison places is in some way related to the crime rate was challenged vigorously by the sub-committee which drew the conclusion that the size of the prison population was, to some extent, a political calculation that lay within the power of our legislators.  It is much more difficult to change the rate of crime.  We need to recognise that these two things need to be separate.  When that lesson was learned in Finland, it had a dramatic impact on that country's penal policy.</p><p>  The sub-committee also recommended that statistical models be used to help us to understand how many prison places were required.  Such models would require a detailed understanding of sentencing practice.  There is a huge informational vacuum in that regard.  Interestingly, the sub-committee noted that as Ireland was then in the happy position of lagging behind other European countries, we had the fortune to be able to design a system that prevented some of the unintended harmful consequences of penal expansionism.  However, we did not seize that opportunity.  The prison population has increased substantially since the sub-committee reported 12 years ago.</p><p>  I have identified three areas where swift and effective action is possible.  I will run through them briefly and we can elaborate on them in our discussions.  </p><p>  First, we should support temporary release on humanitarian grounds or for vocational training purposes, which used to be part of the prison system, particularly around Christmas time when there was a willingness to allow prisoners to go home.  They almost always came back on time and if they did not, they generally returned shortly afterwards.  It was uncontroversial and attracted very little adverse media comment.  There were some years in the mid-1990s when almost one in five prisoners was given temporary release at Christmas.  Last year one in 25 prisoners was given temporary release for Christmas.  There has been a substantial change in this area.  The issue could be addressed quickly.  Clearly, there are more prisoners on remand than there were in the past.  Such prisoners are ineligible for temporary release.  In addition, there are more prisoners from overseas who might not have the community contacts that allow temporary release to take place.  The decreased prevalence of temporary release might be an indication of a punitive shift in the criminal justice system.  Temporary release is important because it is effective.  When the UCD institute of criminology followed up on 20,000 prisoner releases, it found that those who were granted occasional temporary release for vocational or family purposes were significantly less likely to be reimprisoned.  That held true up to four years after they were eventually released.  That is a clear empirical demonstration of the benefits of showing trust in people and allowing them to repay that trust with good behaviour.  Therefore, my first recommendation is that we should return to the situation where there was an openness to allowing this kind of temporary release in a structured and tailored way, rather than as a safety valve to ease overcrowding.</p><p>  The second recommendation I would like to make relates to parole.  There has been very little change in the parole making process for approximately half a century.  The Minister for Justice and Equality makes a determination on the issue of release in every single case, having received a recommendation from the Parole Board.  The process is secretive and has not been scrutinised in the way it has been in other jurisdictions.  It is encouraging that the new chairman is open to this kind of dialogue and open to reform.  The reality is that life sentence prisoners who are released on licence today will have spent a decade longer in custody than their counterparts in the early 1980s.  The average time before release now is over 17 years.  In the 1980s, it was seven years.  In almost every case the prisoner in question is someone who has committed murder.  It is not as if murders have become much more dangerous in the intervening period.  There has been a reluctance to grant parole until people have served huge quantities of time that would have been difficult to imagine 25 or 30 years ago.  The parole window could be widened without delay.  I know Mr. Costello indicated that there would be cost implications if this were done.  In Finland parole is possible after 14 days.  In Ireland the earliest possible review is after 1,460 days, the halfway point of an eight year sentence.  Why not make parole a possibility for anyone serving four years or more?  It is clear that cost implications would arise in the context of the review process, but significant savings could be made in terms of prison time.  Last year imprisonment cost &euro;65,000 per prisoner per year.  If we open the parole window a little wider, we will have the scope to reduce the prison population in a structured and substantial way.  There would be cost savings in that regard.</p><p>  My final recommendation relates to enhanced remission.  It has been mentioned that one third remission, as opposed to the standard one quarter, is possible under the prison rules for prisoners who take part in treatment programmes.  The potential of that facility to reduce the prison population has not been exploited.  If it were, it would incentivise prisoners to take part in programmes, reduce the threat they pose, reduce overcrowding, usher in a more structured approach to release and save money.  It is fair to say politicians in Ireland have often shown restraint that is not evident among politicians elsewhere in the Anglophone world, which is to be welcomed.  The debates about penal policy in England, Australia, New Zealand and the United States tend to be much more polarised and punitive.  Anything that will allow our context to continue is positive.</p></speech>

If some of what I have to say sounds as if I come from a parallel universe I should show the committee that apart from having written about crime I have also been involved with the Cork auto crime diversion project for about ten years, which is unique, in that it closed not due to a lack of money but because it ran out of car thieves to deal with.  If one can buy a company car in Cork, that has failed the national car test, for &euro;20, why does one need to rob one?</p><p>  I have experience in the field.  I am slightly older than Professor Ian O'Donnell.  While he can remember reports from 12 to 14 years ago, I can go back 32 years.  The first one which came to my notice was a group chaired by Se&aacute;n MacBride, set up by the Prisoners Rights Organisation, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello was a member.  It was treated by the Department of Justice and Equality at the time as if it was a group of subversives, though among the subversivies on the committee was Michael D. Higgins and Mary McAleese.  From the first five years in 1985, there was a report every year about the prison system and the juvenile justice system.  That can be followed up in all the subsequent years.  Every two or three years there was a report that laid out the problems and suggested what should be done and we end up with the kind of prison system described by Fr. Peter McVerry.  What all the reports share in common is that they advocate a reduction in the prison population and most see alternatives to custody as the means of achieving the reduction.  </p><p>  The second and most significant issue is that they have all largely been ignored and have all failed to have a significant impact on how the penal system operates.  Why has there been such a level of failure to act on the issue of prison reform?  It appears to me that the committee has to address the question of what it can do that other groups failed to do.  The issue is not a shortage of ideas or a shortage of information.  There is much information around how to reform prison systems.  The issue could well be a lack of political will, a fear of talk show fascism, or a culture of denial among the Department of Justice and Equality about the extent of the problems of the prison and whether prisons actually need to be reformed.  In 2006, Fr. Peter McVerry said that St. Patrick's Institution damaged inmates and their conditions had regressed over the previous 21 years.  He said that some prison officers "should be immediately dismissed" as they did immense damage to the young people.  The director of the Irish Prison Service said that the report was out of date, at best, and, at worst, inaccurate.  He rejects its findings.  After what we saw last week, which of them is right?  Those aspects need to be addressed.</p><p>  It is not that things have not happened.  A plethora of projects has been set up all over the country with the stated aims of diverting from prison, reducing offending and tackling drug use.  Many of these projects have been set up as a way to put a claim on community resources and also not to deprive communities.  Only a few of them have been systematically evaluated in terms of their effect on offending.  What they are part of is what criminologists call bifurcation.  They talk about the way in which alternatives to prison grow at the same time as the size of the prison population increases.  One of the ways in which this can be explained is that if one adds non-custodial alternatives to the current pool of non-custodial alternatives what happens is that they become interchangeable.  Dr. Paul O'Mahony, for example, has argued that one of the things about restorative justice is that it is not being used instead of prison, but instead of some other sanction, a fine, a caution, or whatever.  What happens in many of the projects with which I have had contact is that over time they find themselves working with soft-end offenders, offenders with whom it is easier to work and the long-term persistent petty criminals tend not be the people who end up in these projects.  If there are alternatives to custody the key question in evaluating their success is whether the prison population falls.  Prison does not work and these projects do not work immediately but have a much longer term effect.</p><p>  A third issue addressed in the submission is the question of cost.  It has been argued that alternatives to prison or part of their appeal is that they are cheaper than prison.  There is an argument that is not the case.  The traditional figure used for the cost of prison is the average cost of prison but the marginal cost of putting another prisoner in prison is quite low.  For example, we can double the number of people in prison without having to increase the number of beds.  That does not cost any more to get the same number of people in there.  The other issue about alternatives to custody is the way in which they are funded, the way in which they are put at arm's length by the Department of Justice and Equality.  In other words it will give money to local projects but they are run through voluntary committees.  They get people with a huge level of commitment but they raise the usual questions of who in the community gets involved and they seldom have very few young people on them.  The staff in these projects have no career structure or career progression and do not have the career security that is necessary for the work they do.  The level of  commitment given by these people to working with offenders is admirable but the level of staff burnout and staff turnover is very high.  If we want people to work with hard end offenders they must be rewarded appropriately.</p><p>  The final issue I raised is the wider question of how prison systems change.  I suggest that at least three factors are important.  One way in which prisons change is when the prisoners themselves revolt against prison conditions and then something has to be done.  The Attica prison riot is probably the most famous example.  The second is when the courts start to imprison middle class offenders, a factor of some significance in the development of open prison and other alternatives in the US.  This is unlikely here because the call for the use of prison for the corporate criminal is as old as the call for the reform of the prison system and is equally ineffective.  There may be a few tokenistic presentations but do not expect a significant increase in the number of prisoners who come to Mountjoy from Dublin 4 addresses and have to be resettled in Dublin 4 when they emerge from prison.  The third factor is an important one.  Prison reform in other jurisdictions happened when a country's judiciary has ordered the closure of prisons as a result of human rights abuses, overcrowding and ineffectiveness.  In many cases it has little impact on crime levels but when judges closed prisons it forced people to think imaginatively and urgently about what should be done.  The Massachusetts juvenile justice system still remains very important here.  It is also a fact that the decline in crime in New York, which is one of the most significant declines in the contemporary penal criminology area, was accompanied by a decline in incarceration because what it came up with is more imaginative alternatives to prison.</p><p>  It is in that context I suggest that the committee could call for the immediate closure of Mountjoy Prison.  One could be liberal about it and give them a year in which to do it.  If Mountjoy was a hospital and had the same record of failure to cure people, where patients left with more illnesses than they had going in, it would have been closed long ago.  The promise or the threat of closure would concentrate minds and lead to creative thinking about how to deal with offending behaviour.</p></speech>

The presentations were substantial and challenging.</p><p>  All of us on the sub-committee share the frustration of the witnesses at the number and extent of reports carried out in the past on the penal  system.  Professor Ian O'Donnell referred to the previous justice committee report 12 years ago gathering dust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1002" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Warner" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU12012102400007#F00200"><p>I will respond on the question regarding size.  This is a good question, because the size of a prison population is ultimately a political decision and not something that happens as a result of external factors.  Countries can decide how many people they will imprison and work to that.  I am glad the committee has made a decision to visit Finland, where it is government policy to reduce the prison population.  Finland has been doing this systematically.  After the Second World War, its prison population was very high and it has been reducing it since.  First it reduced it to other Nordic levels, but has now reduced it well below these.</p><p>  It is a question of political realism, as Professor O'Donnell said.  In September 1995, we had 2,054 people in prison, almost the same as in the previous September.  Perhaps it would be better to look at this in terms of the rate of incarceration per 100,000 of the population, because the overall population has changed over the years.  The rate has fluctuated from 98 to 100 in recent times.  For many years up to 1995 our rate of incarceration was always below 62.  Therefore, going from 62 to 98 is more than a 50% increase.  When I suggested we cut by one third, I was simply suggesting we reverse that increase so that we reduce numbers to approximately 3,000.  </p><p>  There are all sorts of considerations to be taken into account, such as the rate at which we imprison people, how long we imprison them for and  how quickly we release prisoners.  The largely forgotten Whitaker report does not state it explicitly, but if we relate what it discusses to the population of the country at the time, it refers to a rate of incarceration of 50.  We might say the country has changed greatly since then, but it has not changed greatly since 1995.  The level of crime has not changed either.  As Professor O'Donnell would probably tell us, it has dropped since then.  Therefore, we could certainly look to go well below a prison population of 3,000.</p><p>  A question was also asked about remission.  My submission went back to the Whitaker report, which suggested one third rather than one quarter remission in general, as suggested by others here.  However, they suggest 50% remission for juveniles.  This week, the Irish Penal Reform Trust spoke about 50% remission for anyone serving a sentence of under five years.  These are all good ideas.  The Whitaker report also suggested measures we see taken in Denmark, such as releasing people earlier under supervision and on certain conditions, perhaps drug treatment, education or work.  We need a whole range of initiatives.</p></speech>

I suggest a size to cater for 150 prisoners, with a maximum of 200.  We are building larger prisons currently.  Wheatfield is approaching a prison population of 1,000.  Currently it has 700, but one unit is to be doubled up and that will bring the population there to almost 900.  The Midlands Prison, if it has not already reached it, is approaching a population of 1,000.  The population of Mountjoy will be back up to 700 when it is refurbished.  Therefore, we are moving in the direction of bigger prisons all the time.</p><p>  What happens within the prisons is important.  The sub-committee has visited Wheatfield, which was built on the basis of the best physical model available in Europe at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1005" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ian O'Donnell" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU12012102400008#G00200"><p>I wish to echo the points made but I will also make a specific recommendation when it comes to the scale of the prison population.  I also wish to say something about the scale of individual institutions.  Dr. Warner remarked how the prison population in Ireland used to be low, even in relatively recent times.  The world prison population list was published initially by the Home Office in London.  It was first published in 1999.  We measure the rate of imprisonment because the population is increasing a good deal.  Our rate of imprisonment in that list was approximately 65 per 100,000.  The EU 15 average was approximately 85 per 100,000.  This meant we were 20 percentage points below average.   The latest edition of that list came out last year.  The average was approximately 100 per 100,000 and we sit on that average position now.</p><p>  Senator Bacik asked how could we produce a report that will not simply gather dust.  One way would be to have something specified with sufficient precision such that when it is returned to in several years, people will say that it either has had the desired effect or otherwise.  What might that be?  We might return to a situation whereby we are 20 points below the European average within a specified timeframe.  Much of the increase in imprisonment has been during the past five years.  It would not be outrageous to suggest that we pull our rate of imprisonment back down to 20 points below the European norm in the coming five years.  That represents a quantifiable, measurable target and a reasonable period to get there.  The increase took approximately five years and it has been somewhat uncontrolled; it seems reasonable to redress the increase in the same period.</p><p>  A question was asked about optimum prison size.  From the literature with which I am familiar my sense is that the optimum is somewhat higher than the suggestion of my colleagues, approximately the 300 mark, but certainty a good way below the prison populations in this country at the moment.  Specific points were made about remission, prisoner reintegration and structuring a sentence such that the planning for release beings on the first day of a period of imprisonment.  The issue of prisoner reintegration was something the National Economic and Social Forum devoted a full report to some ten years ago.  The report made several useful recommendations and there may be some merit in re-examining them.  Although it has not been used, given that is possible under prison rules at the moment, a remission rates of one third would be a good place to start.  If the rate of remission were increased above that level there is a possibility of a knock-on effect in terms of the sentences imposed.  Why not start with that measure?  There would be fewer ripples of disquiet.  We can do it so why not proceed and see what happens?</p></speech>

Currently, prisons have maximum numbers.  The design capacity of Cork Prison is 170 or 180 but on average there are 300 there.  One can specify the maximum size of a prison but how does one stop more and more people being put in?  It is fine to say that a prison can only take 300 people but in Ireland such a prison will have 500 in it within a coupe of years.  There are design capacities and maximum numbers stated for all the prisons but they are never enforced.  When there is a shortage of space they double, treble or quadruple up and we must stop that happening.  There cannot be rehabilitative programmes in a system that works in this way.</p></speech>

The report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust was severely criticised in some of the press.  There was reference to letting out murderers and sex offenders early.  There is a hostile attitude towards offenders generally within the population and certainly within some of the media.  There is bound to be media opposition to any such measures if they are too dramatic.  However, it might be different if they were introduced gradually.  Professor O'Donnell noted that there is provision for one third remission in the prison rules already and that could take place without anyone noticing.  That is the way to go.  If one announced it, there would be a backlash from the tabloid media and from many sectors of the population.  This might make it politically difficult to implement.</p></speech>

Lifers and sex offenders were strongly of the view that there should be enhanced remission.  The prisoners undertaking the Building Better Lives programme were frustrated that they received the same remission as prisoners that did not get off their backsides to do anything.  They were strongly of the view that there should be enhanced remission.  That could represent a compromise.  There could be enhanced remission above the 25% automatic remission and I would be in favour of it.</p></speech>

Let us suppose one is serving a fixed sentence for eight years.  One gets 25% remission and gets out after six years.  We can only review such cases after four years.  In practice, because of delays in our system, we were only reviewing such cases after five years instead of four years.  The prisoners were wasting their time because they were going to get out a few months later in any event.  That was happening in many cases.</p></speech>

In the case of life sentence prisoners, for example, their case is reviewed after seven years.  This involves an interview by two members of the board who then submit a written report to the board.  In addition, we receive reports on the prisoner from the psychology services, probation and welfare service and so on.  The position heretofore is that previous Ministers for Justice have indicated an unwillingness to release any life sentence prisoners until they have served a minimum of 15 years.  We have just received the agreement of the current Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, that a life prisoner can be released after 12 years.  The case remains, however, that no such prisoner will not be released following the seven-year review and the provision of independent legal advice to the prisoner will not change that position.  One could argue that such advice might be useful in the case of a fourth or fifth review, after the person has been incarcerated for 12 to 16 years.  In the case of the first or second review of a life sentence prisoner, however, there is no chance of parole being granted and, as such, legal representation would not add any value to the process.</p></speech>

First, the development of prison campuses is, in my view, a regressive step.  Second, Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the community return programme.  Although this seems excellent on paper, there are issues to flag.  As Dr. McCullagh pointed out, there is a risk of net widening, with prisoners on temporary release being assigned a high level of supervision which is not necessarily required.  There is also the concept of low-lying fruit, that is, the tendency to select those prisoners most likely to succeed in the programme rather than the more challenging candidates.  As I recall, the Minister indicated at the launch of the scheme that there would be no risk to society in it.  In reality, nobody can guarantee there will be no risk, but we must be prepared to take chances.</p></speech>

One does not find the same effect when it comes to opposition to the imposition of a universal social charge or increases in income tax or VAT, for example, as compared with opposition to a scheme of early prisoner release.  The argument is made that there is a broader interest than merely public opposition.  In other words, it is justified in terms of some overarching principle that is wider than the immediate concerns of the readership of the <i>Daily Mail</i> or whatever.  There must be a more far-sighted approach to the formulation of penal policy.  Why should those people who call Joe Duffy to voice their opposition to a particular measure have the power to make politicians run away from taking that action?</p></speech>

I certainly support the concept of 50% remission as a step towards resolving the problems facing the penal system.  However, I agree that there might well be a high degree of public resistance to such proposals which would, in turn, manifest itself in a significant degree of opposition in the Oireachtas.  A solution might be found by introducing some type of restorative justice process whereby perpetrators could hear at first hand about the effect of their crimes on the victims.  Giving a stronger voice to victims and obliging criminals to face up to the realities of their crimes might make any proposal for 50% remission more palatable to the public.  What are the delegates' views on restorative justice in general?  The problem this committee is facing is that very little has come of previous proposals for significant reform, with report after report left to gather dust on the shelf.  I hope we are not wasting our time here and that our deliberations will be taken on board.</p></speech>

There seems to be an appetite for it nationally.  When members of the National Crime Forum went around the country in the late 1990s trying to get a sense of the public mood on crime and punishment, the issue of restorative justice came up again and again.  There was a real sense, particularly among communities beleaguered by crime, that prison was not the only or whole solution.  People certainly wanted respite from criminality, including anti-social behaviour, but there was a view that restorative justice might be one element of a package of measures to assist communities to deal with the problems confronting them.</p><p>  The National Crime Forum was an exercise in ascertaining the public mood and on foot of its report, the National Crime Council was established.  This, however, was one of the few so-called quangos to be abolished some years ago.  The crime council is gone, the report of the crime forum is long forgotten, but the issue of restorative justice came up for discussion once again with the establishment of the National Commission on Restorative Justice.  It is an issue that certainly is worthy of debate.  In my view, it might be more relevant in terms of keeping people out of custody and diverting them from crime rather than at the reintegration stage, when they have already served a sentence.</p></speech>

McVerry indicated that some 80% of prisoners have drug addiction problems.  The rise in drug use in society generally seems to be paralleled in increased rates of criminality and incarceration.  In recent years we have seen the proliferation of many different types of drugs, both legal and illegal.  We had a very good debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il recently.  I am concerned that we are attempting to treat drug addiction and misuse in silos - education, health and so on - without any overarching approach.  Will Fr. McVerry comment on the impact of increased drug misuse on criminality, incarceration, penal policy and so on?</p></speech>

I understand that 80% of all monetary crime is related to drugs, that is, the perpetrators engage in crime in order to acquire the money to purchase drugs.  There has been a huge increase in drug misuse in recent years.  Moreover, we are seeing new drugs with increasingly psychotic effects and drugs which arouse aggression and violence in those who consume them.  A user told me the other day that crystal meth is the new drug on the block and that coming down from it causes a depression like nothing he had experienced before.  When he is coming down, he said, he would kill his granny to get another fix.</p><p>  In my experience, many prisoners would love to deal constructively with their drug problem but do not, unfortunately, have the opportunity to do so.  I am involved in a small project where, with the consent of the relevant judges, I bring people from Cloverhill Prison down to the drug treatment centre in Athy run by Sr. Consilio.  I have accompanied approximately 120 prisoners there in recent years.</p></speech>

It has been running from 1998 and it is still called a pilot project.  When do they learn how to fly?  When will these mainstreamed?  If one thinks about the range of interventions at community level, they are always pilot projects.  They do not seem to move on to the next stage whatever that is but they do not get to be mainstreamed.  Restorative justice programmes, to some extent, may be in that grey area.</p></speech>

I feel very affected by the witnesses' presentations and they have really put it up to us.  I have not been a member of this sub-committee or a public representative for very long.  I would have sat where the witnesses are sitting and like them would have an extraordinary commitment, passion and academic rigour but would have still felt a little powerless to bring about change such as the change they seek.  As I am sitting on this side I still have a sense of that powerlessness but on the other hand somebody has to have the power.  That is the way I feel right now.</p><p>  The witnesses have put it up to us.  We could take all their more extended submissions, and what is emerging from this discussion, and order the recommendations in terms of which are the most important and what should happen first in all the categories.  My colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, not unlike the witnesses, has extraordinary expertise in this area.  We could bring her expertise and the political expertise of my colleague, the Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, and the other members and we could probably get the best set of recommendations within a very strong theoretical framework.  However, the question is would that bring about any change and that is really what the witnesses are saying to us.</p><p>  I like Dr. McCullagh's suggestion about putting it up to us and that we call for the immediate closure of Mountjoy Prison.  At the very least, we should be able to say why we might not be recommending that and the other things we believe we could recommend that would bring about some change.  I am relatively new to this issue and perhaps that is not such a bad thing because I have not drilled down on this to the level all the witnesses have.  I know what happens when I do that in other areas in which I have some expertise.  I thank the witnesses for what they have said and they have really put it up to us.</p></speech>

The war on public order offences allowed people to deal with soft-end offenders because most public order offenders are not recidivists.

We had a longer visit in Mountjoy Prison and judging by the difference in its physical appearance and state of the place it has improved and it has scope for improvement.  Many of us would be very wary of recommending its closure after what happened with Thornton Hall and that crazy plan to have a super prison that would replace Mountjoy.  It is better to try to bed down reforms on the site in Mountjoy.  The prison that should be closed is St. Patrick's institution.  It has been recommended for closure so many times-----</p></speech>

The Care After Prison group put it up to us - to borrow a phrase Senator Zappone used in saying the witnesses have put it up to us - that because it is very hard to provide structured release programmes of any sort for people serving very short sentences, which they put at six months or less, that instead of considering remission and so on should we provide that people serving that length of sentence should be diverted altogether?  There is an attractiveness to that because many of these people, to return to Dr. McCullagh's point on public order offences, are in prison for those offences.  They pose a minimal risk if they have received a sentence of six months or less for a non-violent offence.  There are examples from elsewhere of diversion in that sort of case, are there not?  Are they effective?</p></speech>

On the drugs issue, there has been a huge effort in respect of resources, priority in policy and so forth in trying, not very successfully, to control drugs getting into prison.  As Fr. Peter McVerry has pointed out, very little effort has gone into the treatment side.  I point to Denmark, where as much attention is given to trying to control demand for drugs as to the supply of drugs.  Moreover, while the Danish prisons have the same sort of screening and security procedures within prison, as well as drug testing and so forth, to try to control the supply, in addition to that each prisoner who still has three months left to serve and who asks for drug treatment is guaranteed to get that within two weeks.  That is a policy.  In addition, the treatment, where it is needed, is full-time.  In one new prison I visited, namely, East Jutland Prison, about which I wrote a bit in my submission, one third of the entire prison is given over to full-time drug treatment for as long as people need.  As Fr. McVerry noted, members should compare that with the nine beds in Mountjoy Prison for our entire system.  Consequently, there must be that kind of balance between demand control and supply control.</p><p>  I wish to make one point regarding community service and the issue that has been raised.  As people have noted, alternatives to prison very often become add-ons rather then alternatives and do not reduce the prison population.  When members visit Finland, they might examine what has been attempted there.  I gather from the writings and comments of Tapio Lappi-Sepp&auml;l&auml; that this has been successful.  When they introduced community service on a large scale, they brought in what he calls a two-step solution.  The judge gives the sentence, presumably on the same basis as previously, but thereafter another body looks at it and essentially second-guesses it by stating while it is aware the judge sentenced the person to six months in prison, it will consider offering the person community service instead.  This means the alternatives are not going to people who would not have gone to prison any way and this appears to work.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to make one plea regarding conditions and regimes in general.  Members should look beyond Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution in respect of where the problems are.  While there certainly are problems in those places, the dreadful conditions, problems arising from segregation and so forth also apply to some of the prisons we built within the last few decades.  They apply to Cloverhill, Midlands, Castlerea and, as has been mentioned, Wheatfield prisons.  If one considers somewhere like Harristown wing in Castlerea, with which not many people are familiar, it houses 120 prisoners.  The people in Harristown wing are kept separate from all the facilities and activities in the rest of the prison for no apparent good reason and are further divided into four separate groups.  There is a huge level of 23-hour lock-up and of doubling up in cells and all that goes wrong with that.  Incidentally, I believe the problem with doubling up in cells is that it increases the likelihood of abuse, violence, stress and bullying.  Members also must consider some of these newer places.  It is the same in Cloverhill, where there are three inmates to a cell.  There is little activity for people in Cloverhill and in Harristown wing in Castlerea, the amount is minuscule.</p></speech>

While our time has almost expired, I note he mentioned cultural attitudes and issues when he spoke previously.  I take it he was referring to people in the Prison Service and the Department.  However, am I correct that generally speaking in society, the feeling might be that prison is for punishment, that prisoners should be locked up and the key thrown away, that it cannot be hard enough and there should be hard labour, floggings and all that stuff?  I believe Dr. McCullagh's comments also may have bordered on that subject.  If I am wrong, he should correct me but I refer to that general attitude.</p></speech>

This appears to have an impact, in that people are less interested in sensationalised news although they do have a fondness for &quot;Big Brother&quot;.  On culture, it is interesting when one breaks it down a little.  A considerable number of years ago, the Irish Penal Reform Trust produced a report on public attitudes towards people who were addicted to drugs or had a drug dependency.  When the authors teased out with members of the public whether they would prefer to send someone with a drug dependency to prison or for their drug dependency to be tackled and an alternative offered to address the reason for their criminal behaviour, I believe approximately 75% of the public opted to address the behaviour and the reason behind the criminality.  That said, this is not to advertise <i>TheJournal.ie</i> but in the public response to the Irish Penal Reform Trust's position paper during the week, not a single person was in support of it.  That was stark.  I certainly think it is an uphill effort but as Dr. McCullagh was saying, if one makes decisions and sticks to them, the tide will go back out quickly.</p></speech>

Consequently, one thing an Oireachtas committee can do is to make a strong and unequivocal statement that the prison population is too high.  It can state it is unconscionably high and must come down.  Without such a statement, all of the other measures cannot follow.  While such a statement is required for the other measures to follow, seldom is it put in such stark terms.  I believe a parliamentary committee can state matters have got out of hand and the numbers have drifted too high because of a lack of political will to pull them back down.  It can state so doing lies within our control and that getting it back down to a more appropriate level will take time, will be complex and will require taking some risks.  A statement along those lines is essential if there is to be movement to bring the numbers back down.  A statement from a committee at this level in such spare terms really would help create a context in which a downward momentum might be generated.</p></speech>

There should be a certain number that can go to Mountjoy or to Wheatfield or wherever.  Judges contemplating sending anyone to prison should be obliged to find out if there is a place in the first instance and if not, they must be conscious that someone will be released.  This actually happened in the juvenile detention system when Trinity House first opened.  It had a certain number of places and a judge in the children's court who wished to send someone to Trinity House had to telephone to ascertain whether a place was available.  If not, the judge was obliged to remand the case.</p></speech>

It would focus their minds on whether they really should send certain people to prison in the knowledge that others would be released to make way for them.</p></speech>

There was a rise, between 1999 and 2004 or 2005, of the prison population in Finland.  It drifted up as Professor O'Donnell was saying.  When I was doing my research there I asked a number of people why it happened.  None of them, neither the academics nor the prison management, could really explain it to me.  I think it was that they took their eye off the ball for a bit.  I interviewed the director general of the prison system.  He told me that around that time there was a proposal to build more prisons in response to this rise, although he was not director general at that time.  He said he was very grateful that the Finnish Department of Finance refused funding on the basis that to build more prisons would be a waste of money and that it would make more economic sense to have fewer people in prison.</p><p>  We have not dwelt much today on the economic issue but, as somebody said, our prisons are enormously costly.  There are huge savings to be made from reducing the prison population substantially, notwithstanding what Dr. McCullagh has said.  Resources can be diverted into alternatives elsewhere.  </p><p>  The other point that should be made is that open prisons cost about half what closed prisons cost in Nordic countries.  They are much more effective in terms of not institutionalising people, preparing them for release and treating them with dignity.  In or around 35% of prisoners in Denmark, Finland and Norway are in open prisons.  The figure for Ireland is 5%.  It seems a no brainer that, as well as reducing the prison population, we should aim to make that switch to open prisons.  That should be kept in mind.</p><p>  As well as reducing its prison population, Finland has made deliberate efforts to switch the proportion of those who remain in gaol to open prisons.  It has closed some closed prisons and has opened some new open prisons.</p></speech>

Civil Defence is a statutory volunteer-based organisation with more than 4,500 trained active members on its volunteer register.  The role of Civil Defence is to provide effective support to the front-line emergency services and other community supports as directed.  Civil Defence is all about volunteers and the essence of the organisation is its ethos of volunteerism.  Civil Defence was set up in 1950 to be part of the national defence structure as the necessary civil response to potential hazards that might arise during a time of war or emergency.  Following the establishment of Civil Defence, recruitment of volunteers by local authorities followed at local level.  Candidates to attend instructor courses were identified and qualified through centralised training programmes to enable them to instruct at local level.</p><p>  Arising from the Civil Defence Act 2002, the Civil Defence Board, which is a statutory authority under the aegis of the Department of Defence, was established in 2003 and is charged with the management and development of Civil Defence at national level.  However, responsibility for Civil Defence policy remained with the Minister for Defence and the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for the board.  The board is funded by way of a grant-in-aid from the Department of Defence Vote.  The grant-in-aid for 2012 is &euro;5.585 million.  Funding for Civil Defence operations at local level is shared on a 70:30 basis between the board and local authorities.  The board provides policy direction, centralised training, administrative support and guidance, technical support and centralised procurement of major items of uniform and equipment.  In July 2011, in line with the current policy of bringing back the functions of many State agencies into their parent Departments, the Government decided to bring forward legislation to dissolve the board and to transfer its functions back into the Department of Defence.  In that regard, the Civil Defence Bill 2012 was published on Monday, 22 October 2012, and is expected to come before the Oireachtas shortly.</p><p>  As the threat of a cold war and major nuclear conflict rescinded, Civil Defence development policy gradually evolved towards a more defined peacetime role for the organisation.  That development policy was strongly re-affirmed with the publication of the White Paper on Defence in February 2000.  The White Paper also provided for the decentralisation of Civil Defence headquarters and in September 2006, the organisation moved to its headquarters in Roscrea, County Tipperary.  Civil Defence also retained the use of its refurbished training range and associated facilities at the rear of its old headquarters at Ratra House in the Phoenix Park, Dublin.  Furthermore the framework for major emergency management, published by the Government in 2006, set out the structures for a co-ordinated response to a major emergency by the front-line services, acting in tandem with the support services.  The strategic development plans and training programmes for Civil Defence in recent years have very much embraced that support role to the front-line services and community support activities.</p><p>  The business of Civil Defence is about training of volunteers and emergency preparedness and the Civil Defence training unit is an integral part of Civil Defence headquarters.  The primary function of the training unit, in co-operation with local authorities, is to identify and provide the training necessary for Civil Defence volunteers at local authority level to carry out their role.  Each year, the unit produces a training programme, which outlines the training available to Civil Defence volunteers.  The training unit also provides policy and guidance documents to local authorities.  In recent years, the training unit has achieved recognition for the award of certificates by regulatory bodies such as the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC.  This has enabled volunteer students to qualify on some courses to the same professional standards as full-time front-line personnel, which is a distinct advantage to students in developing their careers outside of Civil Defence.  It is the range of disciplines and skills in which members are trained and the multidisciplined approach to training volunteers that makes Civil Defence unique in terms of response capability.  A detailed profile of core disciplines is included in members' briefing material.</p><p>  Civil Defence operations at local level are under the overall control of the city or county manager.  Day-to-day management is carried out by the Civil Defence officer, whose range of duties includes recruitment, training, the management of local operations and exercises and associated administrative tasks.  The support of a strong team of senior volunteers is vital if a Civil Defence officer is to effectively manage and develop the organisation at local level.  The national profile of Civil Defence was greatly enhanced with the comprehensive and sustained nature of the response by the organisation to the severe weather that affected all parts of the country in 2009-10 and 2010-11.  It has been widely acknowledged that the maintenance of HSE outreach services to people in isolated communities would not have been possible without the assistance of Civil Defence during those periods.  Ongoing assistance to the front-line services in responding to localised and more widespread flooding has been a feature of Civil Defence activities in recent times.  Providing assistance to the Garda in search and rescue and recovery operations for missing persons, both on land and in the water, also has become a regular feature of Civil Defence operations in all areas.  Such operations also allow Civil Defence to utilise their training in support of a multi-agency response to an incident, as would be the case in a major emergency.  A case in point is the rescue operation following the tragic sinking of the trawler, <i>Tit Bonhomme</i>, in Glandore Harbour, County Cork, in January last where almost 8,000 volunteer hours were given by Civil Defence volunteers and which has been described in more detail in members' briefing material.</p><p>  In additional to operational activities, the value that Civil Defence brings to communities all over Ireland can be clearly seen in the organisation's support of community events.  One need only look at the major role played by Civil Defence during all of the high-profile community events during the summer such as the tall ships festival in Dublin, the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway, the arrival of the Olympic torch in Ireland and the triumphant homecoming of our Olympics heroes, such as Katie Taylor.  Civil Defence volunteers also can be seen at hundreds of other community events, both large and small, throughout the country every year.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the State benefits hugely from the voluntary efforts of Civil Defence members.  Equally, there is no doubt that the need to support the front-line services to respond to climatic and other events will remain.  Civil Defence will continue to develop in accordance with the policy as set out in the White Paper, that is, to be an effective support to the front-line emergency services and to continue with its community support activities.  The decision to bring Civil Defence at national level back into the Department of Defence is a positive development for the organisation.  Civil Defence has never stood still.  It has evolved to meet the many and varied challenges that have been placed in its path.  The sustained investment in equipment and training over recent years, the experience gained in supporting the front-line services at major operations and events, allied to the move back more towards the centre of emergency response arrangements, leaves the organisation well placed to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I thank Mr. Spain and his delegation for the comprehensive presentation.  It would be remiss of all members not to acknowledge the standing of the Civil Defence organisation across the country, where the work it does is recognised in local communities and where its volunteers are clearly identified and recognised in the communities they serve.  During the inclement weather experienced nationwide in 2009 and in 2010, members saw at first hand the invaluable work Civil Defence does.  In rural Ireland, small isolated communities certainly had reason to be deeply grateful to Civil Defence for coming to their assistance in circumstances that involved real human hardship.  One cannot but be impressed by the figure supplied by Mr. Spain of 8,000 man-hours during that terrible crisis with the <i>Tit Bonhomme</i>, which shows the scale of the commitment.  Civil Defence also is to be commended on the type of training it evidently is undertaking with its volunteers,  I refer to the work it has done on pre-hospital training and the FETAC awards it has been acquiring and so on.</p></speech>

When Civil Defence comes back into the Department, we are working to put in place a forum to allow us to be able to tap into the views and experience of people such as the Civil Defence volunteers, the Civil Defence Officers Association and other relevant Departments and Government agencies.  We are conscious that these people have given us invaluable advice through the years.  Even before the Civil Defence Board was established, we would have had very close contacts with many of those organisations.  I appreciate the Deputy's point and it is our intention to have some type of forum in which we can tap into the experience and advice of the various organisations.  That is particularly true for volunteers because Civil Defence would not exist without the volunteers.  We often use the expression that Civil Defence is about volunteers, volunteers, volunteers.  We have already assured the volunteer organisation of Civil Defence that there will be a forum where we can capture their views, advice and experience.</p></speech>

Having read the board's report, I am somewhat concerned that there are approximately 4,500 "active" members.  I ask Mr. Spain to explain that to us.  It was 6,000 in 2002 when the board was established.  One would have hoped that at a time of significant levels of unemployment with people again focusing on volunteerism that there would have been a greater level of participation.  I ask Mr. Spain to outline the Civil Defence recruitment processes, age profile and gender balance in the organisation.</p></speech>

When we speak about the 4,500, we are very strict in regarding them as active members.  We have many more members on the books who may not be as active as those 4,500 people.  I believe the membership would go up to approximately 6,000 or 7,000.</p></speech>

In our register we have criteria for considering people as either active or inactive based on attending courses or events within the year.  We can definitively say that the active strength is 4,500 at the moment.</p></speech>

As Mr. Spain said in his opening statement, there is a strong extended-family tradition to membership of Civil Defence.  It tends to be father-daughter, brother-sister, etc.  While I do not have a definitive figure, the gender balance would be approximately 50:50.  There would not be a huge differentiation between the genders.  The age profile has varied.  The volunteers coming to us in more recent years would tend to be somewhat older than those who would have come to us five or six years ago.  They come to us with more experience, have driving licences and experiences from their working lives.  We tend to get more experienced and better-trained people coming to us in recent years.</p></speech>

Does the organisation have the capacity to generate some income from the participation in those types of events?  Civil Defence is described as a second-line emergency service, which is a very important role.  I wonder about the quality of emergency planning throughout the country.  I sometimes feel that local authorities and emergency planning are almost contradictory in terms.  Is Mr. Spain satisfied with the standard of emergency planning across the country?  Does it vary between counties?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1086" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Spain" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012102400004#C01100"><p>On the first point, where a local defence unit is involved with a commercial operation, it will normally make a contribution to the local Civil Defence unit and the local Civil Defence unit is allowed to retain that funding to buy equipment for itself.</p><p>  I will answer the second question on emergency planning, bearing in mind that I wear two hats as chairman of the Civil Defence Board and also in my other role in the Department of Defence with responsibility for the national Office of Emergency Planning.  The national framework for major emergencies, which was published in 2006, set out a structure whereby emergencies are dealt with at a local level, which can then escalate to regional and national levels.  So there is a structure and system in place for dealing with emergencies.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which obviously has responsibility for local authorities, is represented on the Government task force on emergency planning.  Through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the local authorities have direct input into emergency planning at the national task force level.</p><p>  We are satisfied that at exercises we have held and in various incidents that have arisen, when there is a need to escalate an incident from a local level up to a regional level, that has happened.  The framework has worked in that regard.  Examples would include some of the severe weather incidents where a local authority might have been overwhelmed by the conditions in its particular county and it was able to ratchet it up to a regional level and get the support of not just the surrounding local authorities, but also of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence people.  In addition to the local committees, there are regional committees dealing with emergency planning which meet on a regular basis and bring together all the relevant bodies, including local authorities, HSE, Garda and the Defence Forces.  There is a system in place to ratchet it up.</p></speech>

I have a question on the recruitment of volunteers.  In what way is admission to the Civil Defence advertised or how is it encouraged?  Is it done directly by the local authorities or through a national advertising campaign?  In the board's new format with, presumably, some degree of new thinking coming into the equation, would it be possible to encourage more young people by way of a "junior civil defence" - there may be a better name than that?  Not just at this committee, but at numerous Oireachtas committees, we have debated the need to encourage more young people and in particular people from disadvantaged communities, to become more engaged in their communities by way of volunteer work.  While it would not be any type of national service, the concept of the Civil Defence organisation and the responsibility that comes with it would be of enormous benefit to young people.  Perhaps some consideration could be given to some kind of civil defence junior corps comprising people of leaving certificate age.  How, where and when does recruitment occur?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1088" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Spain" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012102400005#D00100"><p>I would like to comment on that issue, following which I will ask the director general to do so.  Generally speaking, civil defence is organised in each county.  While as the Civil Defence Board we are responsible for civil defence at a national level, civil defence at a local level rests with the local county manager or city manager, as the case may be.  There is a Civil Defence officer in each county, who is an official of the local authority rather than of the board, with responsibility for civil defence in their particular county.  The local Civil Defence officer has various different methods of recruiting volunteers, some of which would be traditional and others of which would be dependent on the particular county in which he or she lives.  In general, membership of the Civil Defence force is increasing, with a waiting list in many counties of people wishing to join.  People either get involved in Civil Defence through family tradition, word of mouth or campaigns organised by a local Civil Defence officer.  For example, I recently spoke to a local Civil Defence officer at a competition who had organised a campaign over a number of weekends in various shopping centres in the area through which he met people and encouraged them to get involved.  That is one way in which people are recruited into Civil Defence.  I will hand over now to Mr. Smith, who may wish to comment further on this issue.</p></speech>

We also have a capacity problem locally in terms of accommodation and training facilities.  Centralised training is provided at the Civil Defence training unit, with people who qualify locally being trained nationally by us.  There is a capacity limitation at both ends of the equation.</p><p>  Emergency planning was referred to earlier.  The mix of skills that might be required in a coastal county would differ from those required in an inland county in which there may be lakes, rivers and so on.  The emergency planning arrangements in each local authority would differ slightly in terms of the mix of skills required by a Civil Defence officer to meet the local emergency planning arrangements which feed into local authority emergency plan.  This mix of skills requires a certain cadre of strength.  It is not just about numbers.  It is more about a mix of skills and the capacity of the officer to train recruits who are then sent on to us for training at national level.  There are, unfortunately, limitations on capacity.</p></speech>

The Civil Defence has never had a cadet corps <i>per se</i>.  The matter has never been considered within the organisation as a serious proposition.  It is not an issue which we have considered of late because, as I said, we are over-subscribed in terms of volunteers.  During the good economic times, many transition year students got involved in Civil Defence to gain experience and a certificate and so on.  Unfortunately, they leave Civil Defence when they go to college in various parts of the country.  A Civil Defence officer must focus on retaining a core strength in the force.  As such, there are a mix of young and old people involved.</p></speech>

At the time of the flooding of half of Ennis, I was chairperson of the SPC and a member of the crisis management team.  Reference was made to emergency planning.  It is only when one is faced with an emergency that one realises the level of emergency planning in place in this country and the role of the Civil Defence in terms of dealing with emergencies.</p><p>  What is the relationship between Civil Defence and the Garda Reserve, which is similar in terms of its backing up a core emergency provision?  I would view the Garda Reserve in the same light as Civil Defence in terms of the work it does.  Is there much joined-up thinking or co-operation between both organisations?</p></speech>

Obviously, the Garda Reserve exists to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The skills which Garda Reserve personnel have differ from the skills of Civil Defence volunteers.  We work closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a representative of the Garda Commissioner on the current Civil Defence Board.  We always try to facilitate the Garda in whatever way we can.  The skills of a Garda Reserve volunteer would differ from those of a Civil Defence volunteer.</p></speech>

The response was well co-ordinated.  Civil Defence has been used - we are more than happy for this to happen - as a means of young people gaining experience in civil defence and then moving on to membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service or HSE.  This is happening all the time in Civil Defence.  While we do not have a direct relationship with the Garda Reserve, similar to it, people use Civil Defence as a stepping stone to joining the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

The number of people on waiting lists varies between counties.  I am aware that in Dublin there is a particularly lengthy waiting list.

Most of the training is provided in-house by Ms McGuire and her team.  The idea behind this is that we train instructors who in turn train volunteers in the local units.  However, in certain cases we do not have the required skills in-house and would have to engage outside contractors.  I will ask Ms McGuire to comment further on that issue.  We often have to engage outside people in the search and rescue area.</p></speech>

We work closely with the fire service.  We have also engaged people from the HSE to deliver training.  Many of those who deliver training on behalf of the HSE are also Civil Defence volunteers. Another area in respect of which we have engaged outside people is missing persons searches.  This is an area in which Civil Defence is involved week in, week out, throughout the country.  We are reviving a course previously held in respect of missing person searches, in respect of which there is a group here from the UK for training.  The Garda is working with us in the provision of this training.  We also work with a group from the UK that provides rope rescue.  It is hoped that we will be able to deliver more training ourselves into the future.  We provide a great deal of casualty training in-house.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I will introduce our team by noting that to my right is Captain James Courtney, who is an Airbus 330 captain.  Mr. Kevin Humphreys is director of safety regulation and is the former chief accident investigator in the State, and Mr. Martin Purcell is our head of licensing and oversight of flight training organisations, FTOs, etc.</p><p>  I will not waste a long time but will provide members with a quick overview.  The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is a commercial semi-State agency.  Our primary functions are the safety regulation of civil aviation in Ireland, that is, all Irish carriers, whether they operate in Ireland or in Europe, the overseeing of the training of technical staff, pilots, aircrew and so on, and the provision of air traffic control services in Irish airspace and on portions of the north Atlantic as well as at the main State airports.  In addition, we regulate the airports.  We have 670 staff, who primarily are technical staff such as pilots, aeronautical engineers, air traffic controllers, experts in avionics, radio officers and so forth.  We receive no State funding and our total assets are &euro;207 million.  Last year, we made an operating profit of just under &euro;18 million.</p><p>  In respect of safety oversight, our key role and main function is the safety oversight of civil aviation in Ireland, namely, the oversight of aircraft, aviation personnel, airports and airspace from a safety perspective.  We comply with all the international and European standards and are ranked among the best in both Europe and the world in terms of the safety oversight of civil aviation.  Members will appreciate that Ireland has a long history of aviation.  A number of large leasing companies are located in Ireland, including entities such as GECAS.  One third of all aircraft that are leased in the world are leased from Irish companies.  Safety oversight is internationally benchmarked by the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO.  It completed an audit of the Irish Aviation Authority last year in which we were ranked fourth in the world, with Canada, France and the United Kingdom marginally ahead of us.  I note, however, we were significantly ahead of the United States, Germany and many of the large manufacturing nations.  Consequently, we have a very good, internationally established and highly thought of safety record in aviation.</p><p>  On efficiency, the authority has spent a lot of time in recent years trying to be as efficient as possible.  While we have one of the lowest charges in Europe, we are also ranked among the most cost-effective aviation authorities in Europe.  This is internationally benchmarked by Eurocontrol independently.  We have kept our fees for safety regulation more or less the same since 2007, and the authority has assisted the State in carrying out a number of initiatives with regard to Shannon Airport and aviation policy.  The authority also represents the State at various functions in terms of ICAO and the European Union.</p><p>  I will move to the proposed flight time limitations and will provide the joint committee with a little background, after which we will then take questions.  I thought I should address the generalities first.  The flight time limitations regulation is a European Union regulation that is implemented by the Union's safety agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  The Irish Aviation Authority oversees compliance in Ireland of the European Union standards.  While we do not set the standards, we oversee their compliance.  The current system of flight time limitations is known as Subpart Q of European Union Ops and has been in operation since 2008.  Consequently, I presume the subject of today's discussions is the new flight time limitation scheme that is currently being debated by EASA and is expected to come to fruition in the coming months.  The European Union regulation establishes two things: rules on flight and duty time limitations and rules on rest requirements for flight crews.  Subpart Q is being revised to ensure all European flight time limitations are consistent across the European Union.  The idea of this regulation is to achieve consistency among all the member states of the European Union.  As for timescale, EASA published a new scheme on 28 February, that is, its opinion on the scheme.  We expect the finalisation of the scheme by mid-2013 and expect the scheme to be implemented in the period 2014 to 2016.</p><p>  I turn to the second item the joint committee asked the authority to address today, namely, Pilot Training College, Waterford.  The IAA regulates flight training organisations in accordance with the European Union regulations for safety.  The flight training organisations, FTOs, are not bonded companies.  It is interesting they are not bonded either in Ireland or the United Kingdom.  As recently as yesterday, the United Kingdom published guidance for pilots who are in training, the essence of which is that such organisations continue not to be bonded and that it is a difficult situation.  IAA audits and oversight checks on flight training organisations relate to the safety of training organisations.  Our primary role is to ensure they are done safely, that the people are fed into the system safely and that everything is done in that fashion.  Questions have arisen concerning the financial check on licence approvals relating to this, but that relates to the resources to ensure the quality of the flight training and not to the commercial viability of the business.  We do not carry out such a check.  We examine whether such organisations have resources sufficient to maintain their simulators, aircraft and so on but we do not consider the financial viability of such a company.</p><p>  I thought I would keep my address short, if that is in order.  I will answer any question members wish, but I thought I would address the specific topics I was asked to do.</p></speech>

It is welcome because members wish to deal with a number of questions.  If I may, I will deal with both aspects of the presentation separately.  I have had an opportunity to discuss the flight time issues in respect of the EASA rules with a number of pilots and my questions will be asked from that context.  I will focus on five areas in particular.  First, there is the issue of the short call stand-by.  Pilots have indicated to me that a crew member wakes up at 4.30 a.m., starts a stand-by duty at home at 5.30 a.m. until, perhaps, 11.30 p.m.  The pilots are concerned about the length of time and state this will be 22 hours from the start of the stand-by and 23 hours after having woken up.  They believe that period is too long and has the potential to have an impact on their capacity to act safely.</p><p>  The second issue pertains to night duties.  I understand three independent scientific reports were commissioned by EASA in 2011 which concluded that flying at night should be limited to a flight duty of ten hours.  I understand that anything above that would create critical levels of fatigue and potential safety risks.  The witnesses might give their views on this issue.  The solution being put forward from the pilots' perspective is to limit night flights to approximately ten hours as a basic rule.  They also suggest that specific scientific research on night operations longer than ten hours be commenced to allow for a potential review of these rules in future, but until then, their attitude is it is not adequate.</p><p>  I refer to long work days and multiple take-offs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400004#D00300"><p>Regarding the recent events around the pilot training centre in Waterford, many members have met with the families involved who have been deeply affected.  It is a unique situation.  I believe, without setting a precedent, the IAA should find a way of assisting those involved who find themselves in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  People remortgaged their homes or borrowed from family members to do this particular training course.  I would hope there is a way of recompensing the individuals affected without setting a precedent.</p><p>  Earlier Mr. Brennan spoke of the role of the IAA in the financial checks, licence approval and quality assurance of flight training.  Should the authority have a stronger role in this regard?  Should we, as legislators, give the authority more powers to ensure the events with the Waterford training centre do not happen again?  I accept the accounts of the company involved were audited and Enterprise Ireland, a significant shareholder, should have had greater oversight.  Perhaps introducing a bond for flight training companies is the solution.  Short of all this, should the authority have a greater role in examining the commercial viability of training centres?</p><p>  I am not making any allegations under parliamentary privilege but it has been suggested that one of the directors of the flight training centre in Waterford, Mr. O'Byrne White, also sat on the board of the IAA.  Can Mr. Brennan clarify this and if there are any corporate governance concerns that may arise as a result?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400004#D00400"><p>I thank the IAA for its presentation.  One of the main issues with these proposed rules will allow for pilots to be on stand-by call for 22 hours a day.  A pilot could be asked to fly even in difficult conditions.  This can be extended by an hour in unforeseen events.  We are aware that unforeseen events can happen often in the aviation industry.  The employer can state the pilot&rsquo;s discretion is not acceptable.  I am told that in some cases pilots have been fired for refusing to work hours in which they felt they could not operate safely.  Should airport stand-by and short call stand-by have the same cap of 16 hours?</p><p>  The European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, commissioned reports have recommended a limit of ten hours to avoid critical levels of fatigue, yet the EASA has recommended 11 hours and more.  What is the authority&rsquo;s opinion on this?</p><p>  Multiple take-offs are the most stressful and tiring part of a pilot&rsquo;s job.  Research shows that fatigue builds up faster with every separate take-off a pilot performs in a shift.  Research has also shown that duty should be reduced by a minimum of 30 minutes after a pilot performs a second take-off.  EASA wants this to be after the third take-off and only by 30 minutes.  Does the IAA believe the proposal to limit this to twice weekly one hour extensions, to reduce the daily maximum flight time as of the second take-off and to reduce by 45 minutes as of the fourth take-off is a solution?</p><p>  At present pilots can have their home base changed at their employer&rsquo;s whim.  EASA wants to introduce the principle of permanence.  This is a good move but needs to be provided for in legislation.  The current proposal is that permanence should be observed.  Pilots are concerned with the soft language used in the rule and believe it needs to be strengthened.</p><p>  Does the IAA agree that there should be an upper limit on the number of hours per day a pilot should work?  Does the IAA agree that take-offs and landings significantly increase fatigue?</p></speech>

It suggested a cap should be placed on the 22 hour stand-by, particularly for the short call stand-by.  IALPA&rsquo;s medical expert regarded ten hours as the safe maximum period but EASA allow between 11 and 12.5 hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400005#E00200"><p>With regard to the Waterford training college, I am surprised there was no bonding, whether it was a requirement or not, because based on the costs associated with fulfilling the training criteria and having spoken to a parent of the one of the students, I found it remarkable that the regulatory authority did not have a protection system in place for people being trained to join the aviation ranks.  I do not know of any other third level qualification that a student could secure in the State where he or she would face such a liability.  We must consider that this qualification is not made available by the State, yet the State requires it to be carried out in this manner.</p><p>  There is a requirement on the committee to carry out an investigation into what happened in the Waterford training college debacle because there has to be lessons for the Department which should lead to it implementing changes.  My understanding is there is nothing to prevent the same happening again and potentially the same characters could present themselves via a new legal entity to offer the same service, rather like Ronseal doing exactly what it says on the tin.  The same thing, therefore, could happen again to another wave of students.  Suggestions have been made that this may well be about to happen in Waterford.  I have significant concerns that more unsuspecting students and parents, to whom Deputy Dooley referred, could wind up in that scenario.  The committee should initiate a series of hearings as soon as possible to find out what happened and to make recommendations to the Department to make sure it cannot happen again.</p><p>  I am not a legal practitioner but I wonder how a company with students in Florida managed to fold the tent without not only the Department but the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the Revenue Commissioners blowing the whistle at an earlier stage to seek court protection for the students.  I do not know of a third level institution in which a student could be treated like this while securing a nationally recognised qualification.  The students have been shabbily treated and they and their parents deserve much better.  I propose that the committee, as a matter of urgency, undertake a forensic investigation into what happened in Waterford and to bring forward recommendations to make sure it does not happen again.  The pursuit of the regulatory authority or the company by the parents and the students is a separate issue but there is an onus on us.  We must act and do something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400005#E00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the committee's deliberations and I will honour the Chairman's courtesy by being as succinct as I can.</p><p>  I had a heartbreaking meeting with a family from my area in Leinster House recently.  The son had paid &euro;60,000 to PTC.  They are an excellent local family and they are working people who earn their money in an ordinary, decent fashion.  They could not afford the fees and they borrowed a considerable amount.  What has happened to them is unacceptable, heartbreaking and wrong.  I will not name them as there is no need to do that.  The IAA provided a three year licence.  If it was the authority's responsibility to know PTC had the resources to provide quality, safe training, it is Jesuitical to separate that from commercial viability.  It either was viable to provide training or not and the authority failed to establish that.  That raises fundamental questions, including about the role of other agencies, to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.</p><p>  PTC went into liquidation on 2 October.  On 3 October, a new company was registered called Clearsky Pilot Training College Limited.  There is an allegation that the chief executive officer and some other directors of PTC are involved in the new company and it may be a reincarnation of the old sick animal, which is disturbing.  It merits a response and close scrutiny.</p><p>  I echo the appeal that was well made by Deputy Dooley.  The IAA's resources are in good nick currently.  There are exceptional circumstances in this case and the authority and other agencies cannot deny culpability even on technical terms.  Everybody in society is culpable to the extent that there should be greater vigilance.  Given the gravity of the situation and the horrendous position these young people are in, will the authority make an exception of their cases and provide compensation to them?  They should be compensated and they should get another opportunity.  It is a heart rending story.  They are innocent victims.  It is not good that people like us are splitting hairs about who has responsibility while they suffer.  They are young people of huge ability and great initiative and their families have great drive and ambition.  It is not right to respond this way.</p><p>  I await the response of the officials.  While Deputy O'Donovan called for further investigation, which is the prerogative of the committee, of which I am not a member, and this has merit, there is the immediate issue facing the students and I would like that addressed.  I thank the Vice Chairman for his indulgence.</p></speech>

There are various categories within these regulations that govern everything.  With regard to the maximum of 1,000 flight hours in 12 months, I feel obliged to point out some things that are important to realise.  First, that works out at about 19.23 hours per week.  This is not just a general limit - it is backstopped.  There are actually 14 day and 28 day limits - a maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in 14 days and a maximum number in 28 days.  For instance, if a pilot does a 16 hour duty period twice in one week, equivalent rest periods are provided for, under which the pilot does not show up until the latter half of the following week.  All of these kinds of constraint and safeguard are built in.  The FTL is about providing proper flight times and duty.</p><p>  As well as the social interest the committee considered, it might also consider talking to operators such as Aer Lingus, CityJet and Ryanair because the airline operations also need flexibility for delays and weather.  However, the limitations in flexibility are built into the proposed rules.  The rules take account of increased rest periods and reduced flight time.  In addition, EASA consultation has taken place over the past two or three years.  Some 49,000 submissions have been made to EASA on flight time limitations from pilot associations, employers and aviation authorities.  We are trying to achieve a balance so that all social interests are taken into account - those of the employers and those of the employees.  As the regulator, we would not agree with any system that we do not believe to be fundamentally safe.</p><p>  I will ask Captain Courtney to answer the specific questions on multiple take-offs shortly.  Deputy Dooley asked about PTC.  Geoffrey O'Byrne White is a director of the Irish Aviation Authority and the former chief executive of Air France-CityJet.  I understand he worked for PTC for three to four months.  PTC was only discussed on one occasion at a board meeting of the Irish Aviation Authority and he excluded himself from that at the direction of the chairman and himself.  He had no part in the discussion, nor was he party to any discussions concerning PTC ever.  I can vouch for that.  He is a man of the highest integrity.  He provides to the board expertise on how to run an airline, which is very important, as one can imagine.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Kevin Humphreys to answer the question on the scientific reports etc.  I will then ask Captain Courtney to deal with the question on multiple landings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Humphreys" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400006#F00400"><p>On the question of scientific advice, EASA commissioned a scientific report and we in the Irish Aviation Authority have forwarded a comment that we were not happy with the amount of scientific advice that was taken on board.  In its documentation EASA fully acknowledged that the scientific advice amounted to caution and there were several recommendations, but they were not actually definitive.  The Deputy spoke about fatigue.  Fatigue is not a medical matter.  It is to do with the duration of work and people's tolerance for working at night or working in the morning, so one size does not fit all.</p><p>  We have forwarded a statement today to the EASA committee, which is discussing this.  It is important to note that this is the opinion of EASA that is going forward to the EU process, so it is still not finalised.  One would imagine there will be several opportunities for it to be changed should the majority of the states wish to do so.  I should advise the committee that most of the aviation authorities in Europe have welcomed this amendment to a system called Subpart Q mentioned by Mr. Brennan, which has only been in place since 2008.  So this is a very early stage to be reviewing a process.  The purpose of this amendment is to tighten up areas in which individual states would have the flexibility to have different rules in these parts.  Rather than having one state allow a certain rest period, or having split duties whereby staff go to one destination and have to wait four hours there before they come back, all of these anomalies have been taken out to level the playing field.  Obviously more scientific advice remains to be taken.  That is all I have to say on the scientific matter.</p></speech>

Europe had not introduced regulations in this area, particularly on home stand-by, until these new regulations came into play.  In consultation with all stakeholders - authorities, pilots and airlines - it came up with what I think is a good set of regulations.  These have tightened up significantly on some of the states' existing regulations because each state effectively regulated itself in the area of stand-by.  I believe it is quite well done.</p><p>  Some people asked about the short-term call-out.  I have done stand-bys for 20 years.  I am effectively at home and not up, in uniform and ready to go to the airport, but could be sleeping at night.  A pilot is given time to prepare to go to the airport and then do his or her duty.  While that is not tiring, stand-bys done at the airport can be.  I am delighted that the regulations in that area have been considerably tightened up.  In some other states there were no regulations defining where crew members on stand-by should be.  The new regulations now clearly stipulate the type of accommodation, which must be away from the general public and have quiet areas for resting etc.  I welcome the new regulations because prior to this there were no tight regulations on the matter.</p><p>  There have been regulations on multiple take-offs and landings for as long as I can remember.  Those regulations have not changed considerably and in fact they have been tightened up, particularly those relating to night operations.  While it might look somewhat complicated from a pilot's point of view, a very good table has been produced.  This outlines every hour a pilot works and reduces it if it starts heading into night duties.  The rule associated with reducing the maximum flight time from the third sector onwards of 30 minutes is a long-standing arrangement that has never caused any issues.</p></speech>

That is very much lined up with whatever leave arrangements pilots or cabin crew have.  If the holiday period is from 1 April to 31 March, which happens in many airlines, the airlines also do the 1,000 hours, or the 900 hours that currently exist, in that period to line that up and make sure it works nicely.  It is important to point out that this new 1,000 hour limit is a welcome development that will take out some of the anomalies that exist with the current arrangements.  Again, this is a further protection that the EASA has built in to the new regulations.  It is important to point out that the new regulations are very much focused on the issue of fatigue and fatigue management.  Any new changes that were introduced were intended to tighten up that area.</p></speech>

With the new regulations, they have introduced requirements that the home base must have what they call an element of permanence attached to it.  Again, that will limit operators' abilities because if they wish to change bases regularly, as some operators do, they will now have to introduce a level of permanence, as it is called.  If an operator needs to change the base, it will have to do it with a considerable amount of notice and give staff extra days off in preparation to allow them to get to the new base.  The EASA has also introduced an additional requirement that while an operator is getting staff to the new base, this is counted as part of their duty time, which was not previously in existence.  The new regulations associated with the home base have tightened up the regulations more so than the current arrangements.</p></speech>

I would respectfully suggest to the Chairman that the committee look for the airlines' point of view as well.  As the regulator, we are trying to ensure best practice and steer the best course.  The EASA course and all the consultations have been done to that end.</p><p>  On the issue of the Pilot Training College, PTC, in Waterford and in respect of Deputy Dooley's question as to whether there should be a greater role for the IAA - he got in first with all the good questions - the Commission for Aviation Regulation currently bonds airlines and travel agents.  Our view is that there is a role for the commission going forward and I accept that case would be fine without any doubt.</p><p>  On the point picked up on by Deputy O'Reilly about the role of the IAA, our role is very clearly defined by legislation and the joint aviation requirement, JAR, rules, which are European rules.  We are specifically excluded from having a role in consumer protection so we do not have that role.  If one looks at the PTC situation, one can see it was a success.  I remember coming before an Oireachtas committee four or five years ago where a member berated me for limiting the growth these people could have and argued we were overly restrictive in applying the regulations.  I think the member in question was Deputy Eoin Ryan.  That was the tone of the argument.  The PTC was a very successful organisation which trained hundreds of pilots each year and placed them with companies like Ryanair and Aer Lingus so, <i>prima facie</i>, everything looked very good.  I will ask Mr. Purcell to outline what we have done since the PTC failed.  It is interesting to note that in the case in the UK where the flight school went under and in a number of other cases, they have done nothing like what we have done.  We have repatriated students and one of the most important things we have done is to seize their training records to ensure that where they carried out an hour's training, that was credited to them going forward.  That is the single most important issue in that regard.</p><p>  To cut to the chase, if we were to go down the road of compensating for every commercial licensed entity that failed, we would not operate for very long.  That is a fundamental line to cross.  I have full sympathy with the families and my heart goes out to them.  The Minister and I met them.  It is a dreadful situation but I would say very forcefully that the people who have not been called to account are the directors of the company.  The minute this happened, they headed for the hills, which frustrated our efforts considerably.  We could not find them and were not contacted by them.  Essentially, all the students left in Florida were left for the IAA to repatriate, and we funded that.  We had no contact with the directors.  The first thing we heard was that an administrator had been appointed and there was a plan and now we have liquidation, which is what happens in these cases.  I have no problem with being held to account for our actions but the people who are the principal players in this and who took the deposits off the students and their families, which is a terrible situation, have not been held to account.  I am aware of people who borrowed money.  I told the Minister that we are going round in a circle with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the IAA but the people who could solve this did not help.  We sent inspectors to the US and provided assistance and briefing to students.  Virtually everyone in this room has written to us at some stage so we have proactively tried to do everything we possibly can, not to fix the situation but to assist the students because it is not a very good situation.  I would hate it myself, as would any parent.  I will ask Mr. Purcell to outline what was done.</p></speech>

This was for two main reasons.  The primary one was to get hold of the training records associated with the students because once we had them, that enabled us to put together rectification solutions for each student.  I will deal with that in more detail in a moment.  It also allowed us to have a presence on site to establish fully what was happening.  It was also a focal point in Florida for the students and for the other facilities affected by the shutting down of PTC in Florida.</p><p>  We suspended the flight training organisation, FTO, approval for PTC Florida and PTC Waterford in order that no more students would come into the system.  We caught it at the point where we were just dealing with the number of students who were affected at that moment in time.  Nine staff within the authority were involved in setting up a dedicated helpline which operated over a three week period during our opening hours and dealt with queries from the students and their parents.</p></speech>

These people have elected to spend their funds on this particular type of training.  However, it is important to note that things were different under the old schemes.  For example, I was fortunate enough to get a cadetship in the Air Corps and Captain James Courtney was fortunate enough to get a cadetship in Aer Lingus, but these schemes no longer exist.  People are left to their own devices now.  This area is being addressed seriously in the United States.  The cost of training for the finished article, that is to say, a pilot who can genuinely operate commercially, is almost &euro;150,000.  This is to be expended over a period of two or three years.  It is capital intensive and the return is rather more long term.</p><p>  We fully sympathise and empathise with families involved.  This is not the first time this has occurred in Ireland.  It happened in Cork in the 1980s and people were left high and dry in the same way because the business element of the training business is precarious.  There is a short training period.  It is rather intensive.  There is intensive ground school training and then intensive flying.  The reason people moved out to Florida was to take advantage of the good weather, which we do not have.  However, in the absence of sponsorship by the airlines and the State, this area is open to this type of abuse, which is technically a Ponzi scheme.  We fully understand this and we have deep sympathy for the families, but until these loopholes are closed off by the appropriate agencies the potential still exists for such problems.  We are not the appropriate agency, by the way; we are a safety regulatory body.  I fully accept Deputy O'Donovan's point.</p><p>  A further point relates to our system of education.  We do not regard this as a third level requirement although there is plenty of scope for it.  Dublin City University and the University of Limerick are offering these courses but they are self-funded.  They do not qualify for university grants and they do not qualify for subvention by the airlines either.  The poor student must put himself through the basic requirements to gain his commercial pilot license which will cost &euro;120,000.  Then he must get a type rating whereby he can operate for an airline and this will cost a further &euro;30,000 and he must pay this.  Traditionally, if one had a cadetship in the Air Corps this training cost was taken from one's salary.  Similarly with Aer Lingus, because one had a career prospect of 20 years, the money would be repaid.  However, the self-sponsored student is not in that lucky position and this is a lacuna in our education and training requirement which should be seriously addressed.  I accept the points made.</p></speech>

I have listened attentively to the specific roles and responsibilities of the authority and I appreciate the definitions provided.  It is important to have clear lines of definition when we are trying to explore solutions to a major problem and this case requires a solution to a major problem for many families.  There is a particular dilemma for the families.  I have before me a list of transaction dates, including 15 June, 30 May, 5 June, 4 May, 15 June, 21 June, 24 May, 15 May, 13 June, 2 May, 21 May, 1 May and 15 June 2012.  An average of &euro;20,000 was handed over to the Pilot Training College in Watford during a period of up to four weeks prior to the authority being notified that there was a problem at the commercial end between the institute in Florida and PTC Waterford.  This is a hard dilemma facing these parents and students.</p><p>  I have five specific questions but I will be quick because I am mindful that time is against us.  Will the delegation reiterate its specific role?  Does the IAA examine a company and determine whether it has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required?  Does the IAA do this internally or does it commission an independent body to evaluate whether a company has sufficient resources to carry out training in a safe way?  How often are these evaluations carried out, whether internally or externally?  When was the most recent evaluation carried out, if at all?  If so, was the IAA satisfied with that evaluation?  Is the evaluation available to members of the committee?</p></speech>

Mr. Humphreys was very upfront and honest in his assessment when he spoke about the precarious business element of these schools.  It was alarming to hear that existing legislation technically allows for a type of Ponzi scheme to develop.  Deputy O'Donovan's proposal has been seconded.  I hope the committee will conduct a forensic examination of all these events and make recommendations to the Minister.  There needs to be legislative change.  I also endorse Deputy McHugh's call for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to investigate this matter.  This is essential.</p><p>  I have a number of questions.  In 1992, the European College of Aeronautics based in Cork also closed down, with a similar impact on families.  I refer to the Official Report at that time which records a response on the matter from the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, now a European Commissioner.  This was 22 years ago.  We know that the business element is precarious.  We also know that State bodies such as Aer Rianta and IDA Ireland were shareholders in the European College of Aeronautics in 1992.  The taxpayer was an investor in that college and it was a precarious business.  Those were the lessons from the situation in 1992.  The Irish Aviation Authority Act established the Irish Aviation Authority in 1993.  Twenty years later it has all happened again, and nobody, including the Minister, is taking responsibility.  The families have used their life savings to pay for these qualifications for their sons and daughters.</p><p>  The authority's responsibilities include an examination of the management structure and the continuing evidence of sufficient funding.  It must also have regard to safety regulations.  It must give a clean bill of health to a company's finances.  I refer to the authority's report in which it states there were no indications of any deficiencies with regard to resources and provision of approved training courses for the number of students registered with PTC and that all training was to be of a required standard.  It further stated in the report that financial evaluation is not intended to be a consumer protection provision.  However, families would be confident to invest in a company if it had been given a financial clean bill of health by a Government agency, albeit not funded by the taxpayer.  Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;400,000, along with a grant of &euro;8,000.  I think this would make families confident that the company was a safe place for their investment.  They would regard it as a pretty good bet because the company had a clean bill of health from the IAA and Enterprise Ireland had invested a fortune in taxpayers' money.</p><p>  The accounts of the company were not qualified by Cooney Carey.  There are a number of statements by the accountants which must have caused alarm bells to ring.  It was stated that the negative capital and reserves of the company were almost &euro;2.2 million - &euro;2,171,533 - as of 31 December 2010.  That last sentence is my own qualification.  The report states:</p><p>These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the company's ability to continue as a going concern. ... The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the company was unable to continue as a going concern.</p><p>That is pretty worrying for any lay person.  It is clear from the accountants' report that this company was quite financially precarious.  Yet the company was given a clean bill of health and Enterprise Ireland invested in it.  The families continued to pay the fees in good faith.</p></speech>

I am almost finished.  Mr. Purcell referred to those who remained and are availing of training in Florida and Ireland.  They are paying more money for this training.  What is the situation for families who cannot afford to pay further?  This is the nub of the issue.</p><p>  I do not wish to attribute responsibility to the Irish Aviation Authority for what has happened.  Everyone, including the Minister, the Department and ourselves, has to find a solution and learn the lesson.</p><p>  The Irish Aviation Authority runs its affairs competently and is financially sound.  Ireland has the third best record in Europe and I commend the authority on this.  What can be done for those families who cannot afford to pay for continuing training for their children?  It is not a large group.  Can a solution be found to help them?  They acted in good faith.  They had confidence in the imprimaturs given to the company by the various State agencies.  This is the objective of this meeting.  The lessons will be learned, the committee will issue a report and I am confident there will be resulting changes in the legislation.  This is the second time we have been burned.</p><p>  The Clearsky issue will have to be dealt with.  I commend Deputy McHugh for his proposal.  We cannot allow a situation in which directors have walked away from their responsibilities and abandoned these families.  They have set up a holding company and a new company to provide refresher training to qualified pilots, which is legally permitted.  This is making a mockery of corporate policy.</p></speech>

I would endorse the comments of Deputies Mac Lochlainn and McHugh and I do not wish to repeat them.</p><p>  Undoubtedly, the State has failed in providing adequate protection for those who took up places on this course.  As has been outlined, overall through the IAA, the Department of Transport, the education system and Enterprise Ireland, we failed to ensure there were adequate protections to prevent something like this occurring.  As we have seen, we should have learned the lessons of the previous instance.  We can spend time now trying to ensure a recurrence is prevented.  I also endorse the suggestion that this be referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p><p>  The nub of the argument relates to those students who have been left high and dry.  Many of them are left with loans and without the ability to find funding to continue their training.  We failed to provide them adequate protection, which means we need to find a solution that can assist them in moving on.  Many of them saved to undertake this course.  Many took out loans which they are now paying back without ever getting the training.  They have been left with no way forward.  Their situation is urgent.  It is not something on which we can dwell for very long.</p><p>  We have all been in contact with the various Departments.  We also have been in contact with the IAA.  So far, no solution has been found for those involved.  There is nothing obvious.  I would ask the IAA to find a solution that can allow these students to complete their training, and I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, to take the lead in that.  The students must do so within a particular timeframe to avoid the training they have undergone needing to be taken again.  We do not have the liberty of time to dwell on that.  Ensuring we do not repeat the mistakes that were made in this situation will not assist the students either.  While I call on the Minister and the IAA to engage with each other, perhaps the IAA would respond by outlining here what type of solution we can offer to those students to allow them to finish their training course.</p></speech>

I fully agree with Deputy McHugh that, from the payment of funds of this company in recent months, it appears it was trading while insolvent.  That should probably go to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Like the Deputy, I cannot understand it.</p><p>  It would take me a few minutes to go through the issues in terms of the checks we carried out, but I would be willing to provide them to the Deputy afterwards if he wishes.  All the internal checks we carry out relate mainly to the safety of the aircraft, the provision of the aircraft, the flight manuals, the instructors, the airworthiness, the simulators, and so on.  Those are the main checks we carry out and they are carried out by our professional staff of pilots and flight engineers.  That is done regularly.</p><p>  We would have regular contact.  For instance, we conducted a standards audit in April 2012 and we found that all was in order.  The director, Mr. Humphreys, was in Florida a month or so before they went out of business.  The Florida staff stated that the relationship was fine.  There was money owed but it was okay.  They were carrying out their activities, doing their training, and so forth.  The reality is that-----</p></speech>

He came to see us.  We asked him straight out.  We asked what his situation was and would he still be able to provide this training.  He replied that he was having difficulties with Florida Institute of Technology and he would be fine until the middle of 2013, when he would need more students to come in to keep his business going.  We took him at his word.</p><p>  At Mr. Brennan's direction, I went down to the Florida Institute of Technology and met the principals, the head of flight training and the chancellor of the university.  This is a huge university.  It is the old University of Melbourne in Florida.  It has magnificent facilities.  Its flight training school goes right out onto the international airport at Florida.  It has everything one could want in a structured flying school by way of accommodation, facilities and lecture halls.  I visited the hangar and saw the aeroplanes, which were in mint condition.  One could not ask for anything better.</p><p>  When I met the two principals of the university who are university professors, they stated it was confidential information and they were not at liberty to tell me the financial position, but they were having trading difficulties.  That was early June and shortly afterwards the relationship broke down.  What happened was Florida Institute of Technology stated that Waterford could not continue to pay it and it owed the institute so much money that they were ceasing trading.</p><p>  Immediately, there was a bit of a panic because the students thought that, due to their visas, they would be thrown out of America and that they would be put out of their accommodation, but, in fact, the Florida Institute of Technology accommodated everyone for up to three months at the institute's expense.</p><p>  An important point I would make is that I went down there to do what I could to salvage the reputation of Irish aviation.  As far as the possibility of trying to do this again with anyone is concerned, our reputation is seriously damaged.  We, as the regulator, had to point out that we are a safety regulator.  We are interested in the quality of the aeroplanes, the instruction, the instructors and the standard of training being provided.</p><p>  I have had the misfortune to visit Florida to collect the bodies of Aer Lingus cadets who were killed in an accident there.  I have had the misfortune to visit the accident site where trainee cadets and pilots were killed in our own flying schools in Cork.   Thanks be to God we have not had that experience with this.  Although it is little comfort to families who have lost money, our responsibility is for the safety, and that is what we believe we have delivered.  The matter of the financial irregularities is for another organisation.</p><p>  If we ever have difficulties with a flying school, the proprietor states that we are closing down the business on dubious safety grounds which leaves him or her in the position of having to tell all the cadets that he or she cannot continue.  That is the dilemma for us.  Where we in good faith believed that the quality of the training was up to scratch, that was the limit of our remit and that is the way we acted.</p><p>  I fully acknowledge that the lessons from ECA in Cork were not learnt.  Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, appointed me to chair a task force on that, but all the recommendations were not taken on because the main players are the airlines and the educational institutions, not the regulatory body.</p></speech>

In fairness to the people tied up in this, we might be rushed today because the committee started later than normal and must finish earlier.  In the absence of the Chairman and Vice Chairman, I propose that the committee revisit the issue as soon as possible in order to carry out a full investigation of what happened and, as noted by other speakers, to put measures in place to ensure this cannot happen again.  More importantly, there should be an attempt to see if the committee can recommend remediation to the families and students involved.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I thank the Irish Aviation Authority-----</p></speech>

If there are further hearings I would respectfully suggest that the committee should invite the principals of the company before it.  We seem to be going around in a circle and there is frustration with the process.  Our board is directing that we cannot take on the liability of this.  Our legal advice is that if we took on liability for this, we would effectively secure a preferential creditor in the company; in effect, we would treat one class of creditor better than another, even when we have absolutely no liability.  I have huge sympathy for the families but the point has been made that bills cannot be paid on sympathy.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy but we are not in a position to hope to do what he mentions.  Otherwise, the Revenue Commissioners and everybody else would be asking where the process would stop.</p><p>  There should be a broader solution.  I respectfully suggest that the committee should bring the principals of the company before it to detail what was done and where the money went.  We had audited accounts from Cooney Carey signed off up to August 2011.  Somebody indicated that we did not look at Pilot Training College but we did more than that by examining Shemburn, the consolidated holding company.  Looking at PTC would have been irrelevant as the consolidated structure is the larger company.  There were checks and we asked our accountants to consider the matter.  We got  statements etc. from Cooney Carey right up to then.  If we cannot rely on audited accounts,  statements and representations by auditors, we cannot know what we are at.</p></speech>

I would welcome a body like the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement bringing together all sides.  We are only dealing with a third of a circle.  If the directors and accountants were here they could explain the position more clearly.  From our perspective, all the flight safety matters are clean, along with flight records and aircraft.  Everything we had to cover is 100%, although I understand the frustration that we are taking a defence that we are only in charge of a portion of the issue.

We are pleased to be able to facilitate the committee in any way we can.</p><p>  Two value for money reports were commissioned at the same time.  The Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport commissioned these as part and parcel of the arrangements for the Croke Park agreement.  The focus of both reports was on value for money.  Both reports are on the Department's website and are available to the public.  No decisions have been taken on the implementation of those recommendations.  There is a process of review underway in the Department, where both reports and various recommendations from internal and external audits are being examined with the objective of producing an action plan to address a number of what we would regard as significant deficiencies that have been identified, for example our ability to respond to major pollution incidences, the need to strengthen coastal unit training and other related issues across the maritime safety field.  We take both reports and the recommendations from audits as part of an integrated approach to developing and promoting greater safety and emergency response in the marine arena.  We are not in a position to comment on the reports at present because we have not completed our work on them.  We have not presented the Minister with formal recommendations to inform policy decisions.  There is significant interest in the contentious issues but these are policies issues which ultimately must be the subject of a policy decision.  We also recognise that whatever we do will require phased changes because we cannot at any stage fail to continue to provide the best service we can with the resources we have available.  At the same time, we face difficulties.  We are very stretched for resources and we have identified gaps.</p> <p>Changes in the way in which these services can be delivered have been suggested by consultants.  As part of the review of preparing the action plan, we are testing and analysing the services to see whether we think the recommendations stand up.  The workload across the board, in the Coast Guard and in the Marine Survey Office, which is the regulatory end of the maritime safety regime, has increased enormously, and that is part of the dilemma we face.  We have to make headway.  We are the senior management for delivery service and we have to examine the various options.  Part and parcel of the Croke Park agreement is to get better value for money, find new ways of dealing with issues, free up resources where we can for redeployment to address the service gaps and try to streamline where we can, all of which must be done in the context of maintaining safety and the priorities associated with it, based on good risk assessment and keeping that to the forefront.  </p><p> The value for money review recommended that a different search and rescue co-ordination model should be adopted.  It recommended moving to two rather than three stations and left it open as to exactly how the system should operate.  Fisher Associates believes there are greater efficiencies to be had and that it is for management, therefore, to take that on board and see whether the Department agrees and can focus on getting more from there.  In support of its case, the review refers to difficulties in running with the current services which include the fact that we are relying heavily on overtime to keep three stations in operation.  It also believes there are operational issues and that, with a smaller number of stations, one gets more from people being together rather than being in disparate locations.  It also knows there are different wider social factors that have to come into play and given that people are in place, there are human resource factors that have to be taken on board.   </p><p> The Department is examining what is the best way to move forward and how it can better use technology that would, perhaps, give results.  How does the Department deal with the HR issues and should it go with a model that calls for change?  We have not decided that yet.  I stress we have not gone back to the Minister at this time.  We are keen to hear what people have to say and we know there is much debate yet to take place on these matters.</p></speech>

Many of them concern the operating structures in place in Valentia and Malin and the confidence and professionalism in the fishing, leisure and general maritime industry which has been displayed for decades in what is a difficult and challenging coastline.  I note several incidents have taken place, for example, the incident with Rambler 100, where, were it not for the expertise and professionalism of the unit at Valentia, there is no doubt many lives would have been lost.  The unit was able to predict where casualties had drifted almost to within metres, which was an extraordinary feat.  I have serious concerns about the consultation process that took place between the consultants and the volunteer Coast Guard units along the coast.  Their opinion could have been better portrayed, to say the least, in the review.</p><p>  I am deeply concerned as to how the Coast Guard or the Department can show that amalgamating, closing, splitting or changing the work practices at either Malin Head or Valentia stations would help safety issues, particularly on the western seaboard, and how the consolidation of the centre in Dublin and a back-up centre, also in the Dublin area, would increase safety, irrespective of cost issues.  According to the Fisher review, there are cost issues that would have to be dealt with in any event, whether through increased staff or deficiencies in pollution control mechanisms or protocols.  The proposal to interact to a greater degree with the Marine Survey Office, the Coast Guard and-or other agencies as recommended should clearly address other issues, but sacrificing vitally important coastal safety infrastructure is a matter of concern to the maritime community.  I am concerned as to how that could possibly improve safety issues.  There are great people in those stations.  I am strongly opposed to the recommendations.  There may be other ways of dealing with the issue.  It is timely that we can discuss the review prior to recommendations coming before the Minister.</p></speech>

Following that report, it appeared the Malin Head and Valentia Coast Guard stations would be closed.  The then Minister, Dermot Ahern was in situ at that time.  Around 21 October 2003 it appeared as if he would maintain Malin Head and Valentia and close the Dublin station.  Later during the term of office of the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, it was suggested that Malin Head and Valentia be closed.  After much deliberation the coastal communities in and around Kerry and Cork came together with the communities not only in Donegal, but across the north west, as exemplified by the presence of Mr. John Dallat, MLA, representing that community, based on the fact that we had the necessary technological capacity to sustain the situation.  More importantly, we had the support of the maritime communities, including the emergency rescue communities who are the practitioners on the ground and know the need for people who understand and can identify the specific geographic location and know the terrain.  All of those factors came into play and once again we thought the question would be resolved and there would be three locations, Valentia, Malin Head and Dublin, where marine rescue services would be co-ordinated.  Then there was a directive that equipment would be purchased and all the centres would be upgraded.  The equipment was purchased but it was put into storage in rented space in Blanchardstown for so long that apparently the manufacturer's warranty expired.  It appears the Department has sought a new warranty.  I welcome the fact that hundreds of thousands of euro have been invested in upgrading Malin Head station and Valentia will also be upgraded, but where is the sense in returning to the matter when we thought the issue was resolved?  What agenda is at play?  Why do we keep coming back to the issue of having to defend the services at Malin Head and Valentia?</p><p>  I understand that discussions have taken place between staff and unions with senior management and the Minister.</p></speech>

The old adage holds that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".  These stations have been performing very efficiently in every respect.  They have gained a considerable amount of knowledge, experience and expertise throughout the years.  We should consider the retention and enhancement of the structures in place.  Regardless of what any service does, there is always room for improvement and this is what we should be considering.</p><p>  The value of these stations is well known.  It is baffling and difficult to comprehend because hundreds of thousands of euro worth of new radio and communications equipment is being installed in Valentia.  The station's main operations room is being upgraded and other rooms have been prepared to host equipment for a more automated service.  Kerry County Council has spent &euro;150,000 on upgrading the access road.  Something similar is happening at the station at Malin Head.  More than &euro;1 million of investment has been made at the time when money is scarce in the country.  The issue is the location.  The staff work out in the most treacherous seas in the north Atlantic terrain.  They go out over 200 miles into the ocean performing their duties and services.  They are working marvellously.</p><p>  I received a reply to a written question from the Minister yesterday.  I note that these changes in the main are not about saving money and that is fair enough.  A newspaper report was published yesterday and reference was made to the possibility of political strokemanship by the Minister.  I will take his response clearly.  I did not raise this matter in the question but the Minister replied that no consideration was being given regarding the location of a so-called redundancy centre in Blanchardstown or the Dublin 15 area, a matter which, the answer noted, had been the subject of some speculation.  I take his word and his credibility on this and he is a man of high ethics and dignity.  We should get back to the Minister and consider the merits of what we have in place.  I believe he will act in a positive manner.</p></speech>

We agree with the idea of local knowledge and input.  The contribution those services have made and continue to make is fantastic.  Deputy Fleming asked an interesting question and suggested that it if was not broken, then why fix it.  We believe a considerable part of the service is working very well in this case but the consultants have pointed to things that are not working well and we must address these.  That is incumbent on the management side.  Even as we speak, there is a drive towards information technology development and a far more integrated approach to the service.  We are dealing with functionality rather than simply the geographic location of services.  It may be the case that geographic location is less important in terms of the way in which we ultimately address the problem.</p><p>  I emphasise that a considerable amount of consultation has taken place.  Neither the Department nor the Coast Guard in any way directed how the consultation should go.  We asked Fisher Associates to go out on the ground.  They went to the stations and consulted a considerable number of local interests and stakeholders but we stood back from that.  We did not direct that they should go to any particular group.  In fact we do not know all the individuals with whom they consulted.  I emphasise that we have not decided on the merit of these recommendations or on the context in which ultimately we bring them forward.  This goes back to the idea of an integrated service.  Even if we retain three stations, the future of the service must involve a far greater integrated approach.  This is how we must think about it but it is a complex thing.</p><p>  Another major issue for us is the resource issue.  We must deal with the issue of value for money.  The world has changed for all of us and that is the position we are in at this stage.  We must see how we can use the resources better to provide services across the board within the Coast Guard and to address the gaps in place.</p></speech>

In the Department's view, what is the rationale for the Fisher report and what is the rationale given by the Fisher report for recommending a two-centre mirror model?  Is it primarily in terms of savings and staff?  Do the stations at Malin Head and Valentia have the capacity or are they up to the level required to carry out the job?  My experience from my inquiries is that they are but I seek a clear answer from the Department in terms of whether they have the capacity to do the job and whether they are doing it well.  If the Department were to adopt Fisher's recommendation of a two-centre model with Dublin being the primary base, would it require a new building in Dublin?</p><p>  My understanding is that the current operation base in Dublin is part of an OPW building and that it does not provide the level of security or stand-alone requirements needed for running a centre.  For example, if an issue arose in another part of the building it may lead to the evacuation of that building.  If the Fisher recommendation were to be implemented, would there be a requirement for a new building in some part of Dublin?  If so, what would the cost be?  Whose decision is it in terms of whether we go with the current three-centre set up or whether we move to a two-centre set-up?  Can the Department officials clarify whether that is a decision for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and whether it is entirely within his remit?</p></speech>

The overarching principle is safety for people at sea and that people can call for help.  Two thirds of all calls are being dealt with in Valentia at the moment.  My questions relate to staffing in future.  In 2007, it was apparent that Valentia never had any problems with staffing but this has been undermined on many occasions since.  The uncertainty gives rise to people being unable to give a commitment to reside in Valentia.  I offer an example.  A total of 17 positions should be filled in Valentia, 11 of which are filled at the moment.  Five of these people do not live in Kerry and commute great distances, from as far away as Offaly and Galway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1163" speakername="Tom Shehan" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400015#P00200"><p>Despite its apparent remit, I have found very little reference in the entire report to the concept of value for money.  In that regard, will Mr. Mullen indicate - I realise it is a very blunt question - whether Valentia Island and Malin Head are giving value for money?  In the meeting I had with the Minister, he raised the issue of oil pollution prevention and response, an issue that is referenced in the report.  In my view, this is nothing but a red herring.  Colleagues will recall that when an incident of oil pollution occurred two years ago off the United States, that country struggled greatly to deal with it.  If an oil tanker were to go down off the coast of Kerry, I am not convinced that the entire Irish Coast Guard service could deal with it.  Let us be straight about this - the references to providing a pollution prevention and response service, both by the Minister and in this report, are, to be frank, mere tokenism.</p><p>  There has been mention of the recruitment embargo and the constraints on public sector staffing resources, but it is my understanding that there is no ban on recruitment for emergency services.  In fact, such recruitment may be initiated at the behest of the Minister.  As such, I ask colleagues to join me to in calling on him to recruit immediately the staff required to man and provide the services at their best level.  Are the delegates satisfied that the Fisher report accurately reflects the contribution made by the hundreds of volunteers in the Coast Guard?  In my own area, for instances, volunteers work in Dingle, Ballybunion, Glenderry, Waterville and Valentia.  Are they getting due credit for the service they provide?  Is Mr. Mullen satisfied that these locations are adequately resourced to provide the service that is expected of them?</p><p>  Finally, is there any timeframe for a decision on the report, a decision I assume will be made by the Minister?</p></speech>

There is no question about that.</p><p>  The Senator's question as to whether Valentia Island and Malin Head provide value for money is an important one.  I do not hesitate to say that there has been a very fine performance in both locations and right across the Coast Guard service.  The issue for us in terms of value for money is the question of how, across the whole integrated service, the total expenditure stacks up <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the service we receive.  The Fisher report deals with this issue in its consideration of the merits of two locations versus three and so on.  The rationale for recommending two, as set out in the report, is based on a bigger picture perspective which also considers the question of how more jobs might be saved.  In fact, the report identifies five potential centres - we are considering all of the possibilities - but argues that operating two centres, where there are more staff available in each station, has a huge number of additional benefits in terms of the strength of the service that can be provided.  Such a scenario would mean, for example, that staff are less isolated, training would be more easily facilitated and there would be more cohesion and co-ordination in dealing with incidents and so forth.  All of this is not to say that the current model does not offer very good value and a good service.  As I said, we are reviewing all of the recommendations.  If one looks at it across the board, however, the report does come down on the side of a more centralised model.</p><p>  For members' information, it is not the case that Valentia handles two thirds of all incidents.  In fact, Valentia handles some 40% of incidents, Malin deals with approximately 20% and Dublin handles a slightly higher percentage than Valentia.</p><p>  The issue of socioeconomic impacts, as referred to by Deputy Arthur Spring, is an important one.  What the Fisher report says on this matter is that the Department can advise on what we consider the best operational arrangements.  It is a matter for Ireland Inc., as represented by this committee, the Oireachtas and the Government, to work out the implications from a social perspective in the context of the types of problems facing the country as a whole and the particular communities we are discussing.</p><p>  I disagree with Senator Sheahan that the issue of oil pollution and prevention is a red herring in this discussion.  If, as the Senator posits, a major oil tanker were to go down off the Irish coast,  clearly every resource would be brought into play, not only within the Coast Guard but also from the Marine Survey Office, the Naval Service and everywhere else.  Everybody would be on board.  Below that worst case scenario, however, there is a whole array of intermediate possibilities, whether pollution in harbours, pollution around particular sensitive coastal areas and so on.  What the Fisher report is saying is that we should have plans in place - plans that are well tested and approved - for such eventualities.  That type of expertise is available in a delimited way within the Coast Guard and in the case of a major accident it would not be expected to act alone.  It does, however, have a role to play in this area in respect of smaller incidents involving, for instance, a 10, 15 or 20 km stretch of coastline, which can have a devastating impact in the particular area.  The report is simply saying that we must be ready to respond in those types of instances.</p><p>  The Fisher report acknowledges the enormous contribution of the voluntary sector and the substantial expertise which exists within it.  There is no question but that our coastal units are doing a superb job and will continue to do so.  We are examining the proposal contained in the report that from a management perspective, certain units should be amalgamated.  The report points out that while some coastal units are constantly busy and their staff always on the go, it is important to ensure that units which have less business and whose staff subsequently have less operational experience are continually trained so that in the event of an incident, they are fully capable of dealing with it.  We are discussing these proposals.  As Mr. Reynolds and his colleagues have pointed out, Ireland Inc. does receive a huge benefit from the service as it is currently delivered.  There are different ways in which we can proceed in order to ensure that coastal units remain strong and active and available to their communities when they are needed.  That is the perspective from which the Fisher report examined the issue.</p></speech>

Mr. Mullen can correct me on this but I understand that in the past 16 to 18 months since personnel have been there, there have been outages and issues with the power and the fire alarm.  Anyone who works in the Coast Guard service will know that utmost priority is given to health and safety and to best practice.  Is the Department satisfied with the safety of the building in Leeson Lane in light of the information that was received on foot of a freedom of information request by a member of the public?  Is the building fit for purpose?  To use a seafaring analogy, there is a lot of fog around everything here and I cannot see through it.  Perhaps the matter can be clarified and when the fog lifts, we may get some clarity.  Is Mr. Mullen satisfied this building is fit for purpose in view of the information that has been given?</p></speech>

He is working on that.  Deputy Tom Fleming, who is a member of the committee, has agreed to chair the meeting if it can be reconvened.  I will not be available at 2.30 p.m., the Chairman has suffered a bereavement and the Vice Chairman is not available, but Deputy Fleming has agreed to chair the meeting if a room is available at 2.30 p.m.  This matter is of major concern to the members present and I want to be fair to people.  We are examining if an alternative room will be available for the meeting to be reconvened at 2.30 p.m.</p></speech>

It is not fair that any member would not have an opportunity to probe this matter.  As is evident from the turnout from all hues of the political spectrum, from Kerry and Donegal in particular, there is massive interest in this matter.</p><p>  I wish to ask about the need for a station in Dublin.  Other countries do not rely on the concept of co-location so why is that deemed necessary here?  For example, in 1985, Valentia co-ordinated the response to the Air India disaster and there was no significant intervention from headquarters in that case.  Is this something that has been considered or why would Mr. Mullen say that there is a need for co-location? </p><p>  I also wish to ask about equipment installation.  Given that 80% of emergencies are dealt with between the Malin and Valentia stations, why was equipment fitted out in the Dublin station before those two stations given that the 2008 Fearon report stated that this equipment is subject to catastrophic failure, which in layman's terms could lead to loss of life?  Why was the Dublin station prioritised?  Was that part of something bigger of which we are not aware?</p><p>  On another equipment-related matter, an emergency call was picked up off Galley Head and the crew of the MV <i>Janet Roberto</i> was rescued.  In the five months prior to that rescue, I understand a distress signal could not have been picked up in that area.  Why was that situation allowed to continue for five months in the later half of 2011?  Also, it has come to my attention that on 14 October some of the obsolete equipment in the Valentia station failed, the Dublin station could not take control of the situation and the Malin station had to step in to take over until the Valentia station came back online.  What was that situation allowed to prevail?</p></speech>

It is important members get an opportunity for a proper hearing on this issue today.  I welcome back the delegation.  This is the big boomerang issue of the past 20 years.  We had the PricewaterhouseCoopers report in 1998, the Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche report in 2001, the Fearon report in 2008 and now we are back dealing with the issue again.  I have four questions for Mr. Maurice Mullen.  Why was the Fisher report commissioned?  Who commissioned it?   Did the Minister request this new report and when was it commissioned?  We all have one common ground on this.  The people in the Visitors Gallery, the members of the delegation and ourselves all have a problem, although I do not underestimate the problem facing the delegation, be it the recruitment embargo, issues around training or the pollution control issue.  Furthermore, the Minister has a problem.  He has a report on his desk and if a pollution issue arises tomorrow morning off Dingle, Malin Head or in the Irish Sea, should he take responsibility or would he be in control of the situation?  Therefore, he has a problem and we all have a problem.  However, from consulting with everybody concerned, including the Minister and the delegates - I was delighted to see Mr. Chris Reynolds in Malin Head during the summer - I appreciate we all have solutions to this problem.  Mr. Reynolds's personnel, the people in the Visitors Gallery, the volunteers, the Coast Guard units, the Minister, the fishermen, the people living along the coast and even the politicians have solutions.  I am not talking about parochial backyard interests here.  Deputy Noel Harrington is not a Kerry man or a Donegal man.</p><p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Chris Reynolds.  Has he examined the Canadian model which, effectively, is a state-run public-private pollution control model, which is very interesting and as far as I am led to believe does not require the recruitment of additional staff?  It is very much a public-led programme-strategy.  The Canadians have a plan that involves outsourcing to the private sector if an incident occurs.  Has he evaluated in detail the potential to have a cross-Border pollution control plan?  It great to have Mr. John Dallat, MLA, from Stormont here.</p></speech>

First, on whether the current centre in Dublin located on Leeson Lane is fit for purpose, it is owned by the State and the Office of Public Works, OPW, maintains it as fit for purpose.  There are fire drills and everything else that is managed in it.  We are satisfied and have had no intimation from the OPW that there is anything wrong with it as it is newly developed, etc.  The second, linked, question was on the reason Dublin was first, which is a fair enough question.  The centre was located in a building beside the current one, which had a significant asbestos problem and consequently it was prioritised for development.  The entire centre was moved out and as part of this redevelopment of the centre in the adjoining building, the entire development, including the communications elements, was also completed.  This reflects what has now been completed at Malin and shortly will be completed at Valentia as well.  As for the logic for the Dublin centre, it is a station that provides both a local response in the sense that each of the three stations has particular areas for which it is responsible, as well as a national response in respect of a number of elements.  Moreover, it provides a response to the majority of instances that arise.</p></speech>

For example, a boat in trouble will call the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard operator will launch assets to it and will then relay to shipping in the area a mayday relay broadcast or, if it was not at a mayday level, a pan-pan broadcast.  Consequently, off Valentia, for example, where it might take a while to get an asset to the place of difficulty, the operator might rebroadcast this between five and ten times, each of which is counted as a mayday relay broadcast in the statistics.  On the east coast, however, given the closer range, the chances of being obliged to relay maydays so often are smaller.  That may be the statistic to which reference is being made and it pertains to mayday relay broadcasts and pan-pan rebroadcasts.  As for the statistical breakdown between centres, Dublin is slightly busier than Valentia and Valentia is busier than Malin.  This has been fairly consistent throughout the years.</p></speech>

I now call on Mr. Mullen to reply.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Chris Reynolds, director, will deal with the questions that were posed about the equipment issues, including failure, in Valentia, and also the plans to re-equip Valentia.  Malin has recently been completed and we intend to do the same in Valentia shortly.  Mr. Reynolds will explain that point.</p><p>  A series of questions were asked by Deputy Joe McHugh about the Fisher report.  It was commissioned because under the current arrangements for dealing with appointments in the public service, the embargo prevents posts from being filled.  However, in certain instances, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will allow priority for posts of an urgent nature to be filled.  To do that, one has to be able to show that every effort is being made to achieve value for money.  In that context, we would not be able to continue filling posts, including the radio officers, etc., without having a full value for money report completed.  That is under the Croke Park arrangements.</p><p>  The second question was who commissioned the report and the answer is that the Department commissioned it.  The third question was whether the Minister commissioned it and the answer is "No".  The Department is responsible and the Secretary General is accountable for the deployment of resources on the ground in the Department.  Obviously, therefore, the Department formally did the commissioning process.</p><p>  The fourth question was when the report was commissioned.  The answer is that it was commissioned just over a year ago.  They started to work and effectively got into their stride towards the end of the summer, in the autumn period.  The intention was to complete it sometime in or about the Christmas period.  </p><p>  A further question asked by Deputy McHugh was whether we are doing further analysis of what is going on at present and the answer to that is "Yes".  As I indicated, we are still looking at all the different elements of responding to the two value for money reports.  We consider that an integrated response is necessary.  We felt we needed to look at other elements of how the stations operate to see if there were options that would allow us to operate them in a way which would give us the type of value for money demonstration that we need to be able to show.  At the same time, are there other ways we could do that other than simply by what the consultants had to say?  That is not to say that we accept or reject the consultants at this stage - it is simply to broaden the line of options that we may be able to pursue.  We have asked the same consultants to examine a couple of additional matters.  They are doing that at the moment and we expect them to come back to us in the next two to three weeks.  That is the timeframe for that.  In the meantime, we are continuing to look at this issue and all the other issues associated with the reports themselves.</p><p>  I will now pass over to Mr. Reynolds to deal with a number of matters that were raised, including the Canadian model and others.</p></speech>

I have been in the service for 16 years, as has Mr. Eugene Clonan and Mr. Gerry Smullen.

One was an unplanned outage and the other planned.  During the first outage, a telecommunications failure, Malin took over because it was fully manned and Dublin was not.  The second outage, the planned one, both Dublin and Malin took half each which is the concept of the operation with the new integrated communications system.  That is an example of how the investment of the new technology has been very successful.  Only a few years ago, each centre could only control its own area.  If there were a power failure in Valentia, there was no way of Malin or Dublin taking over because the boxes in each centre were not capable of taking the extra channels and aerials.</p><p>  The problems with oil spills and the Deepwater Horizon incident in the US were raised.  There were up to 250,000 people involved in that response which went on for months.  Crisis management must be viewed as a generic response.  Accordingly, when one is responding to either a <i>Costa Concordia</i> or <i>Estonia </i>incident, there is a generic response.  The crisis will not come to one; one has to go to the crisis.  Therefore, one plans, one prepares, one trains and works with the other agencies that will be involved on the day.  We are not talking about having a cohort of people to clean up beaches but a process where we can respond to an incident when it happens.  We will not be able to stop every incident happening but at least we can put in strategies to lessen the damage as much as possible.</p><p>  We work closely with the UK coast guard and have used its aircraft for spotting oil pollution.  During the <i>Admiral Kuznetsov</i> oil spill in 2009, we used the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency's spotter aircraft for assisting us while all aeronautical search and rescue in Northern Ireland is done by the helicopters based in Dublin and Sligo.  We exercise with the Northern Irish coast guard every year in the joint search and rescue, JSAR, games.  In the past two years, Sir Alan Massey, head of the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency, and Lady Sylvia Hermon, have lent their support to these games.</p><p>  The Canadian model is based on shipping companies providing many resources.  This happens on the other side of the Atlantic where there is much shipping.  We do that to a certain extent.

This is why the unit is co-located with Mr. Reynolds and his management team.  It is also not far from the main emergency co-ordinating centre in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the event of other services, such as the Garda, being needed for a major incident it is possible to bring all the key stakeholders together to respond in a co-ordinated way.  That consideration remains just as important today.</p></speech>

Mr. Reynolds painted an important part of the picture, which is that the entire service has developed over the past 20 years by following best practice as closely as possible.  We believe best practice is best served by co-location of senior management resources with the centre.  We are a relatively small country and our service is not huge.  Key staff need to be available in the event of a major incident.  We have moved to a position where we can best respond to an incident.  The argument has been made that Dublin should be removed from the equation but I suggest the opposite applies because co-locating management and the centre provides a robustness that did not exist 20 years ago.</p></speech>

Other countries bulk up in their centres so that the type of expertise required is available in them.  Second, this is exactly what the Fisher report meant in recommending the three versus two model.  It argues that if we operate two centres instead of three, the second centre will have a critical mass of people.  At least four desks would be operated on a daily basis.  That critical mass makes the service more robust and, therefore, best for coast guard operations.  That is the critical point.  It is not a geography lesson - I apologise to the Senator - it is what is important to the operation in terms of the strength of resources available to deal with critical incidents.</p></speech>

We have no record of that ever being said.  The only one I remember close to it was a sinking in Donegal.  There were two maydays heard and then nothing and a boat was missing in the area.  We picked up those two maydays after replaying them three or four times to ascertain it was two maydays.  Two lives were lost in that incident but we picked it up and we responded to it.  I do not know how to answer the question because the person would have to tell us that he called us and did not get through to us.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending and, I hope, for taking on board our concerns.  Valentia is a small, vibrant community in Kerry and the threats of the closure of the Coast Guard station and the local hospital are hanging over the heads of people and draining the lifeblood out of the community.  We cannot put a price on that.  I am always fascinated by how people from Dublin seem to think that centralising everything in Dublin is great and is the answer to everything.  We fought this battle previously with the ambulance service.  We had a lengthy battle with the HSE as it tried to move the ambulance station to Dublin.  It is all very well to ask someone in Dublin but nobody has mentioned local knowledge.  One cannot overstate local knowledge.  I do not care what anyone says; it cannot be beaten.  If someone in the Dublin office is asked where is Tousist or Ballinskelligs, he will reply they are in Killarney but they are a long distance from the town.  Local knowledge cannot be beaten and no one can put a cost on that.  It has to be taken into consideration.</p><p>  I have a number of straightforward questions and I hope I will get straightforward answers.  Why were Leeson Lane and Blanchardstown eliminated from consideration when Fisher Associates was commissioned to conduct the value for money report?  What are the running costs of the Leeson Lane and Blanchardstown sites?  Why are no costings provided for them in the report?  Malin Head and Valentia Island Coast Guard stations are in State ownership.  More than &euro;800,000 has been spent on the refurbishment of Malin Head station and a similar amount will be spent on the ongoing upgrade costs for Valentia Island station.</p></speech>

I must stress that we neither eliminated nor included any of the three stations because we have not decided how we should respond to the recommendations by Fisher Associates.  While we are, as part of our current assessment, looking at the various costs and options for how one might operate them, they are still being worked on in fine detail.  Before any decisions would be taken, they would all be put on the table.  There is nothing on or off the table at this stage.</p></speech>

As a Department, I have stressed that we are looking at the whole picture.  When it comes to Dublin, both Mr. Reynolds and I have explained the issue in respect of the operation there.  That is part of where we are at this stage.</p><p>  The Senator asked why there has been significant investment in the equipment now, which is a fair question.  As matters stand we need that equipment and, therefore, we need to pursue the type of flexibility that communications from it will give us.  The equipment is such that the vast bulk of it is not centre-specific and can be moved.  However, even if we decided that the operation of some place was to change, it does not happen overnight.  The idea that we would put this off or long finger it rather than service current needs makes no sense to us.  We are continuing to pursue this and if there are to be changes in the future they must be considered, planned and put into a structured change programme.  Everything I am telling the committee is in the context that no decisions have been taken at this stage.  In respect of the very engagement about which Deputy McHugh asked and the question of whether we were looking at additional work at this stage, I can say that we are doing so because we are examining the maximum array of opportunities or ways in which we could approach this and following that, where we can move forward.  </p><p>  Mr. Reynolds picked up a very important point.  We are still very stretched with regard to resources and we must take the best decisions and continue to operate as best we can with the available resources in the country.  We are no different from any other public service body in that we are not in a position to put up our hand and ask to man the whole system the way we would all love to.  </p></speech>

That is at the Minister's discretion.  Has the Department submitted a request to the Minister to have the extra staff provided?  I speak about Valentia Island because that is the one I know best.  I will not speak about Malin Head as those involved there will speak for themselves and I am not sure about the staffing there.

That is why the detailed analysis is taking place.  Before it goes to the Minister and any decisions are made, all the different elements of it have to be set out.  They include the different costs and approaches that are possible and they must be set out for the Minister and pass muster with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Only it can sanction at this stage the additional posts on the basis that where there is an emergency post, it can identify it.  The fact that we are holding these types of review confirms that we are looking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for various posts to be filled.  That is why these are part of the process.  </p></speech>

We must be able to construct the cases that will stand up for scrutiny by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because it will not accept any stepping aside from the embargo at this stage other than where processes we are now going through have been pursued and the case can be shown to stand up.</p><p>    There were a number of elements in the Fisher Associates report.  Much of it is very challenging to us, for example, its preference in respect of our operations.  It knows we live in a different type of world - a real world - but it points out that we have to look at what it is recommending.  It was challenging us in that way because it knows that unless we can answer the hard questions, we will not be able to meet the requirements of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is across the board in the public service.  We are all pursuing matters to get the best possible service.</p><p>  We know there are difficulties in respect of local issues and knowledge and that all those factors must come into the equation.  I cannot answer the question of how they should come in at this stage because we are still setting up the building blocks.  </p></speech>

Was the assistant secretary of the Department aware of how parts were taken from the first draft, with the final draft presented to the Minister excluding those comments?  The final draft only has one paragraph, which has been neutered, in reference to senior management.  The first draft of the report was not presented to the Minister.  It stated:</p><p>  [There is a] very strong perception that the organisation lacks a sense of strategic direction and purpose.  A common observation among both external and internal stakeholders is that this apparent lack of direction was due in part to the directors' time commitments to external issues other than to the State.</p><p>It also states:</p><p>  There is a sense at middle management level that the organisation lacks strategic direction.  In the unlikely event, one hopes, of a major maritime emergency, a somewhat torrid relationship between the Irish Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office is a significant cause of concern since this might impact on successful resolution of the incident.</p><p>  There were further concerns that the Irish Coast Guard does not appear to have a clearly defined role and if it does, it does not stick to it.  The report indicated that the Irish Coast Guard is perceived as being all things to all men.</p></speech>

It is outrageous that at a time of economic difficulties in the country, money is being spent on reports to make decisions that people would appear to want.</p><p>  I have a number of questions, some of which follow on from Senator Daly's questions.  Regarding the reports undertaken by the Department and given the approval of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, why were two reports commissioned?  Why would one not suffice?  If there was a need for a value for money review and if the reports were genuine in seeking more value for money, why was there a need for two separate reports, one on the Irish Cost Guard service and one on the Marine Survey Office, given that both are under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p><p>  Senator Daly referred to the draft report which, it appears, was complete and ready for publication last November.  It is like the book that was the subject of a recent High Court challenge and which was taken off the shelves just before it went on sale because it did not suit someone.  It appears that what was contained in the report was ready last November.  If the Department had confidence in the consultants and in their findings and if they were given the freedom of expression and the independence to carry out their report, why was it not published last November?  Why was there a need to respond to certain aspects of the report, as outlined by Senator Daly?</p></speech>

They are two hard-working and admirable officers.  I want to make that very clear.  Much of what has been said about them at the meeting does not represent the sequence of events that took place in the recent past.  I want to make that clear from the outset.</p><p>  I will go through the issues sequentially but there is some overlap and I can pull them together.  I wish to make two quick points regarding Deputy Healy-Rae's comments before I go into the detail.  At no stage was the equipment stored in the Minister's constituency and used in that way.  It was placed in Blanchardstown <i>per se</i> because that is one of our main store areas and it was for no other reason.  It has been there since the Minister was appointed.</p><p>  The Minister has not indicated a preference at this stage.  I want to make that clear.  Reference was made to a suggestion that somehow or other the Minister has a specific view.  The Department engaged in this process to make a case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and as part of the overall development under the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister has not been involved in any part of the process with regard to what model might or might not be used.</p></speech>

He has made that clear to us.  Certainly, he has not indicated any preference to those of us working on the situation.  That is clear.</p><p>  A question was put about the value for money exercise and whether it is simply about saving money.  In the replies to parliamentary questions and in responses from the Department generally, the issue for us is best value for money in the first instance.  The Minister has made it clear that he is not setting out to seek to save money in this process.  Given that money is tight - by money I mean resources - the exercise is to try to use the money we have to get the best value.  If we can do something to help us to achieve additional things we are not doing, that is the type of desired output.  The objective is not to start from a point of view of simply trying to save money.</p><p>  A series of points were made by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Deputy Healy-Rae in respect of the first part and the second part of the draft and I wish to explain that because it is significant in respect of the role senior management has played.  Fisher Associates presented their first draft, as they termed it, to us.  They did not see that this draft was for publication; it was a first draft.  In discussions, they used the terminology of a "challenge draft".  They presented views from across the board and from the various stakeholders but one key group from which they wanted a response to that draft was senior management.  They used this as a challenge draft.  That was their preferred process.  We had stood back up to that point.  This is a value for money process and an independent company was hired.  It was not a case of them sitting there or of us holding their hands.  There was no element of that.  They were to consult and we indicated all the potential stakeholders.  We indicated the longest list we could and we gave it to them and told them that it was theirs.  They then consulted under their terms in respect of who they believed would give them the most information.  We did not dictate in any fashion or form who should or should not be consulted.  We included all stakeholders and any group we could think of which had even a marginal interest.  We identified these and left it with them.</p><p>  Essentially, when the consultants came back, they presented a one-sided view.  They put it to us what many of the stakeholders were saying and they wanted management's perspective and a response.  Their concern was to ensure that the subsequent iteration of the report would have two sides of the coin and that the process of presenting the second iteration of the report would be robust.  In the course of the second iteration, they challenged management's responses.</p><p>  I am keen to outline some points that arose during that process.  Several negative views were expressed about senior management.  Different perspectives were offered by various stakeholders who presented different views.  Different stakeholders would have different agendas in terms of expressing those views.  It was then up to senior management to rebut those observations, which it did.</p><p>  I followed the process from the outset and I was familiar with the initial material and the final material.  It is clear to me from examining the process that many of the arguments presented were part of a wide range of agenda items, many of which dealt with human resources issues and concerns and other matters.  These were the genesis of many of the negative comments towards management and they were not altogether relevant to value for money or other operational issues.  At the same time as part of the openness of the process I was concerned that the senior management would directly rebut these views with officials since they were responsible for doing this value for money report.  Of course it did so in written form and in intensive face-to-face exchanges.  A considerable part of the engagement at that stage was to do with the fine detail of what views were suggested, what options had been suggested, where value for money existed and what things were happening which could be changed, and so on.</p></speech>

It is the document that is on the table today.  The consultants recognised that different stakeholders presented different views and agendas and they looked carefully into each of the issues raised.  Much of the difference between the two documents is accounted for when one considers the iterative process that was followed.  In the initial stages many of the stakeholders expressed negative views.  Fisher Associates realised, however, that some had a far from even moderate understanding of the different relationships that must exist between a regulatory service, in this case the Marine Survey Office and the Coast Guard, and other stakeholders in a service.  There are certain walls that must be maintained but which were crossed over in many instances, causing them to draw conclusions which were not appropriate.  All I can say is that Fisher Associates took the opportunity to examine all of these different issues and ultimately to come to their informed conclusion.</p><p>  The options were expanded by the consultants to include their perspective on what they were told.  We ourselves are widening that process further, simply because there is no simple answer to all of these issues.  We recognise that there are difficulties in finding ways of moving forward.  As such, we have engaged to look at different ways of working and we have not yet decided what the options will be.  Our position is indicative of the complexity of finding a solution within very limited resources while at the same time seeking to capture issues that are important and give weight to them, such as local expertise and so on.  That is why this process is still under play and why, rather than options being written off, more options have, in fact, come onto the table.</p><p>  I regret the use of terms like "lie after lie" in our discussion today.  In the case of the reference to "catastrophic failure" in regard to events in 2008, there has been an attempt to convey that this somehow misrepresented the whole game.  In fact, all that is required for clarity is a simple understanding as to why certain actions were taken in 2008, when there was the potential for a catastrophic failure on equipment in Dublin.  There is no question about that and, as I indicated earlier, we had to renew the Dublin equipment immediately.  However, this upgrading at Dublin meant that two previously unavailable equipment spares were now available, which meant we could then continue operating Malin and Valentia with greater safety.  Action was taken purely to deal with an imminent danger.  We were already stretched using old equipment in three centres.  As soon as we fitted out Dublin with the new equipment, we had working spares that could be used in the event of anything untoward happening in Malin or Valentia while they were awaiting upgrade.</p></speech>

I said we then had equipment that would act as valuable operating spares in the event that the equipment in Malin and Valentia was down before we had an opportunity to upgrade them.  The risk changed at that stage.  That is my only point.  The reason I am bringing this back in at this stage is that it has been presented in some other fashion that there was a major change.  The circumstances changed there which allowed us to operate in a safer way.</p></speech>

If the Valentia station suffered a catastrophic failure, the possibility of which was stated in the 2008 Fearon report, having a spare would not be much good if a machine broke down.</p></speech>

The Department told us four years ago that the equipment in the stations in Malin, Valentia and Dublin was subject to catastrophic failure at any moment.  Motorola had issued a death certificate on the equipment.  It was not in respect of a card or a bit of the equipment but on the entire equipment.  Is Mr. Smullen saying that if the Department had a few spares, Motorola had it wrong and that a catastrophic failure would not occur?</p></speech>

Prior to the engagement of that programme we were in a very difficult position, as was explained.  Once the programme moved forward on the phased basis, our situation improved immeasurably, as I set out, and soon that whole programme will be finished.  I have no doubt that at some stage in the not too distant future, there will be the next phase of it.  Similarly, we have proposals for ongoing development of equipment, communications and IT generally, and that is part of the parcel of day-to-day operations.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked a number of questions, one of which was why money was spent on two reports rather than one.  At the time we commissioned them, there was the possibility that responsibility for the Coast Guard service would be moved to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and there would have been two governing Departments when the reports might have to be addressed and implemented.  However, we lined up the terms of references fully and the work was undertaken as if there was a single one in order that we would get the maximum benefit from them.</p></speech>

It provides what we call a tier three level response for us.  What we expect from the national pollution response capacity is that harbours and local authorities have a tier one level capacity to enable them to respond to a spill up to a certain size.  In the case of a bigger spill than that, the Coast Guard will step in and this is the reason for our stockpiles in Blanchardstown, Killybegs and Castletownbere.  One point about Killybegs is that we are not building a Coast Guard station but are building a Coast Guard station and a pollution response stockpile, which is the reason it is a significantly bigger building.  These are the three national tier two locations.  OSR gives us the capacity for a tier three level response, that is, in the case of an even bigger spill, it will come in with experts, additional equipment, additional pumps and booms, as well as with a Hercules aircraft that is capable of spraying and of airlifting stores into Ireland very quickly.  This is the reason we deal with OSR.  We have a contract with it which is quite innovative, in that not many countries have a contract as, in the main, oil companies have such contracts.  However, it has given us access to this response capacity, which is really good for Ireland.  We are doing a very good thing in this regard.  The  London Offshore Consultants Limited is not paid a retainer.  While it conducted a survey for us in 2010, it is just comprised of people we know.  If necessary, we can give the company a call and its people can give us some advice.  Consequently, there is no retainer issue with that company.</p></speech>

My presence here as a Northern Ireland Assembly member is endorsed by our entire Assembly group and is supported by our 84 councillors.  In addition, I am accompanied by two councillors who represent the most beautiful part of our coastline.  I have served in public life for more than 30 years and this also is an opportunity for me to pay tribute to the Irish Coast Guard at Malin Head.  In the past, this usually just meant a trip up to the Coast Guard station with a box of chocolates or something but it is important to have placed on the record of the Oireachtas that our respect and admiration for the Coast Guard has no limits.</p><p>  Ms Orla Beattie is a member of Limavady Borough Council and was elected to represent that part of the coastline from Magilligan up to Lough Foyle.  Ms Maura Hickey is the deputy mayor of Coleraine and has the privilege and honour of representing Portrush, Portstewart, Portballintrae, Castlerock and Downhill.  Undoubtedly, many members will have heard mention of those seaside towns when the Coast Guard from Malin Head was instrumental in co-ordinating the saving of hundreds of lives over the years.  In each case, the Coast Guard worked with the local coast guard in the North, as well as with the RNLI and the other voluntary organisations.  Consequently, when people talk about centralisation, I believe anything I wish to cover will be wiped out by centralisation.</p><p>  Much earlier, reference was made to the training programmes.  When mayor of Coleraine, I had the privilege of attending one of the aforementioned training programmes at the University of Ulster and it was second to none.  Each year, 100,000 people attend an air show in Portrush and pride of place goes to the Irish Coast Guard.  While it always is dangerous to claim one speaks for everyone, on this occasion, I can make an exception.  I have not a shadow of doubt but that everyone from the area and from the North will support fully my presence here today to make a bid for the retention of the Coast Guard station at Malin Head.</p><p>  While we stated we would come to talk about the facts, it is difficult not to be nostalgic.  Coast Guard personnel have been there since partition and some would say long beforehand.  Through the darkest days of the Troubles, Coast Guard personnel kept open those lines of communication in the North.  They played a major role in helping along the politicians to get to the current position.  I acknowledge that consultants have no space in their reports for such things but they are important.  When one has a cross-Border body that is working perfectly, it would be a shame to do anything to destroy it.</p><p>  When the Good Friday Agreement was put together, cross-Border activity relating to the sea, the rivers and so on was recognised as being fundamental, which is the reason Waterways Ireland came into being.  I note that during the suspension of Stormont and so on, that body carried out incredible work on the River Bann.  At some point in the future, when the Ulster Canal is reopened, the River Bann will undoubtedly become the second Shannon of Ireland.  The other cross-Border body is Tourism Ireland, which is charged with the responsibility of selling the coastline and rivers to the international world.  The point I make is these are two cross-Border bodies which were brought into existence to promote some kind of future that presents us as a normal society.  However, the one body that was working perfectly and seamlessly is under debate.</p><p>  This is the second time that I have met Deputy McHugh, the first being at Malin Head four years ago, and I thought this argument was over.  In the meantime, there has been an argument about Belfast Coastguard and I note that, united, we won that argument.  God grant that this one will be the same.  While I will not get into the environmental issues, I remind members that Malin Head is on the north Atlantic route.  It faces out onto one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and I would not like to think that in the future, our efforts to co-ordinate pollution control and so on would be centralised elsewhere.  There must be a major role for Malin Head.  I apologise if I have offended people from Valentia.  I acknowledge they have very good arguments to which I have listened.</p></speech>

Unless one gets up on the balcony to look down on such matters, mistakes will be made.  One success of the peace process in the North was the establishment of the ferry service between Greencastle and Magilligan.</p> <p>Every time that ferry crosses the busy River Foyle, it has to communicate with Malin Head.  Collectively, we bring people from Inishowen into the North and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are filling empty beds in hotels and guesthouses.  Apart from the hundreds of people who owe their lives to the Coast Guard personnel, there is a question of competence as well.  If one takes that away, one has a problem.</p><p> We have come here today to plead as fellow citizens of this island for something that has served the citizens of Ireland in the most incredible way.  It is a proud part of Irish history.  In my 30 odd years in public life I never thought we would get to the stage where we would be debating its future.  I am encouraged by the standard of the debate here today, with its cut and thrust.  I hope the contributions will not be missed.  I am honoured to be here from the North.</p><p> I wish to introduce my two colleagues.  Alderman Maura Hickey will tell the joint committee something of her experiences as a local councillor.  She is grateful to the Coast Guard for things that happened recently. </p></speech>

I will follow on from what Mr. Dallat has said.  I am delighted to be here to support the Coast Guard.  I represent an area where the population quadruples during the summer season.  All too often, inexperience or high spirits have led to disaster and grief.  More often, however, there have been happy endings where tragedy has been avoided.</p><p>  The most recent incident was just a few weeks ago when a couple became stranded in a boat on a reef at the bar mouth, at the entrance to the River Bann.  By the grace of God, the Coast Guard at Malin Head picked up a distress signal, alerted the Irish Coast Guard helicopter and the couple were plucked from those dangerous waters.  This is a story without grief but it could have ended with much more serious consequences without the alertness and quick thinking of the Malin Head Coast Guard personnel who know the area, and the other organisations needed to co-ordinate such a rescue.</p><p>  This is only one account but I hope it helps to underline the absolute need for the Coast Guard personnel to remain in Malin Head, reaching out to the people of my area who have relied on their skills and experience for many years.  I pray that wise counsel will prevail and that we will not be robbed of this magnificent service now or in the future.  I pay tribute to the Coast Guard.</p></speech>

As a member of Limavady Borough Council I represent an area which includes Magilligan and Magilligan Strand.  I want to reinforce what my colleagues have said.  Magilligan Strand overlooks the Inishowen Peninsula.  Each hour, on the hour, the body of water between them is crossed by the Foyle ferry taking people in both directions.  Every time the ferry sets out, it communicates with the Malin Head Coast Guard personnel who confirm if it is safe to cross the busy shipping lane.  The Coast Guard is a part of everyday life, but in recent times there has been a realisation that it cannot be taken for granted.  There has been shock and disbelief on both sides of the Foyle that there could be circumstances of any kind whereby it would be gone from this idyllic but dangerous part of our coastline.</p><p>  As someone who teaches in Donegal, lives in the North and has the honour to represent Magilligan, one of the most stunning parts of our coast, I plead with the joint committee to allow the officers who man this station to continue the work that they and their predecessors have done for over 100 years.  I repeat what my colleague, Mr. Dallat, has said.  Let us not be the generation that closes the one cross-Border body which year after year saves lives, many of them from the North.</p></speech>

The response from the Coast Guard management is withering in its ferocity.  Its 19 pages contain comments such as "idle gossip", "lazy reasoning" and "hearsay".  Fisher Associates claims that the IRCG lacks a strategic sense of direction and purpose, which is insulting to all the full-time staff and volunteers involved in the service.  To state it lacks direction because of the director's absence is not correct.  It is not based on evidence.  At a minimum it is insulting and based on malicious hearsay and, at worst, it is defamatory.  The review lacks sufficient intelligent analysis, which means that most of the findings will not stand up to scrutiny and questions over the competency of Fisher Associates.</p><p>  Incredibly and somewhat insultingly, Fisher Associates also does not even appear to know how to spell the name throughout the report, using the Commonwealth, possibly indicating that a lot of cutting and pasting from other sources and reports were used throughout the review.  </p><p>  I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience.  As Oireachtas committees go, I have to say that the evidence given by some of the witnesses here today is shocking and the answers are incomplete in their substance.  The Department has been badly let down.  The behaviour and mindset indicates that they are on the same agenda the Department has had in the past.  Their display here today has been incompetent.  Answers have been fudged and statements they made themselves have been ignored.  They have tried to say afterwards that they said something else.  I am glad every word that has been said here today has been recorded because at least we will be able to go back over what has been said to see that the departmental witnesses have contradicted themselves on more than one occasion.</p><p>  If anyone tuned into this meeting today, they would not know if it was an Oireachtas meeting or an episode of "Yes, Minister".  I am disappointed with the responses that have been made to genuine questions.  We are here today with one objective, which is to fight to retain the Coast Guard service we have in Valentia and Malin Head.  We wish to do so because we believe it is for the protection of people's lives in the years ahead.  We believe the Department's agenda is wrong, including the centralisation to Dublin.  It happened to us when people in Departments advised and ensured in the 1960s that the train service to Cahirciveen and Kenmare was closed.</p></speech>

I do not agree with him.  I assure the committee the points made today will be taken in good faith and will be dealt with as fairly and in as best informed a manner as I can.  As the Department prepares policy papers for the Minister, we will take on board all the views expressed today.  I assure the committee I will take its intentions in good faith which are the same as mine &ndash; to save lives.</p><p>  I indicated at the beginning of the meeting that we are continuing to examine the situation with regard to Valentia.  Throughout the process, I have made it very clear that we are not at a point where we are making recommendations.  We are still doing the digging in assessing and preparing a response.  We know it is not all about economics but a complex situation with long histories and concerns.  We are also facing difficulties like other arms of the public service to which we must find solutions.  We will give the position the best consideration, however.</p></speech>

Have those matters been clarified for the Minister?  Will Mr. Mullen indicate when a recommendation will be made on Valentia?  Will he report back to the committee before a decision is made on the station?</p></speech>

The Minister has read the reports in detail and there are issues he has flagged.  The committee should be under no doubt that we did not look for additional work or for different issues to be teased out.  There are issues in the reports with which we are not happy and we do not think some of the conclusions stand up.  That is not to say Fisher Associates are at fault either.  There is no perfect issue in this.  Fisher Associates came to their conclusions.  In some of them, while there may be merit, we do not think the logic stands up.  Accordingly, we have to put on the table a suite of suggestions as to how, from a policy perspective, the Minister may examine the issues.  There will be much dialogue at this stage.  The Department will be available to the committee to come back as part of this process.  There are many policy issues here on which, ultimately, the Minister will have to make a decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400031#OO00500"><p>I am not sure about the answer to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s question about the shed.  My understanding is 22 medivacs involving Spanish speakers were done by Valentia and, obviously, the Royal Air Force has called on the station&rsquo;s services many times.</p><p>  Sometimes I am concerned about the information the assistant secretary receives.  When the Fearon report, presented by a former assistant secretary, came before this committee, we dissected it paragraph by paragraph.  It made assertions about the electricity supply to the Valentia station.  The committee got the ESB to show the supply was up to standard.  The Fearon report stated telecommunications at the site were not up to standard.  All it would have taken to solve the problem in this regard was &euro;22,000.  Senior management knew that but it wanted to write down that telecommunications were not up to standard.  The committee had to show the building at the site was the fourth largest Coast Guard station in Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales while the report criticised it.  The report claimed there was no work for spouses of Coast Guard staff in the place when 11 of the 14 spouses of the staff based there were working locally.  Education for staff children was not up to standard according to the Fearon report but 80% of pupils from Col&aacute;iste na Sceilge go on to third level education.  The committee proved that all bar two of the staff wished to be based there.  The predecessor of the Fisher report was full of lies and inaccuracies to follow an agenda.</p><p>  It is bizarre that four years on there is still equipment sitting in Blanchardstown and there are spares.  It could take a couple of hours to use those spares to fix a machine in Valentia.  It would seem it does not really matter when someone&rsquo;s life is at risk and the communications go down.  That is inexcusable.  It is the same as the Galley Head incident where the equipment was out of commission but not repaired for five months.  Four years on, there is no urgency in installing life-saving communications equipment at Valentia.  The death certificate had been issued by Motorola prior to 2007.</p><p>  What I find most appalling is that the criticism of senior management was edited out.  I would expect a balanced report to go to the Minister.  If there were criticism of senior management by stakeholders, the Minister should get a more rounded view.  This is worrying because this is really a case of &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; and we do not want the Minister knowing that senior management has been criticised.  Four years on, the Department is still manipulating reports in order that the Minister will give the outcome it wants.</p><p>  Where does the first draft of the Fisher Associates report state there should be only two stations?  It states there are three options but it does not come down on the side of any one in the first draft.  However, in the final draft, which we all know was manipulated, it comes down clearly on the side of the two-station proposal.</p></speech>

Any editing done to the report was done by the company.  They made it very clear to us, as I explained to the committee, the circumstances between the first draft and the second draft.  They went into the process I described earlier.  There was no manipulation of any process.</p></speech>

I was clearly aware of what was being said and I met Fisher Associates at that stage.  This is not the end of the process<i> per se</i>.  Within the Civil Service we are expected to have a robust system of exchange while policy is being developed.  It is useful that we are discussing these issues prior to the conclusion of the policy process but members are seeing the sort of robust exchanges that take place both within Departments and between them as we develop robust strategies and policies that can be presented to Ministers.  We have to shake proposals vigorously to see what they contain.  This is why we have not yet completed the process and we are neither including nor excluding any issues at this stage.  I can only give that assurance for the umpteenth time.  It will also be an open process with the Minister in respect of what he accepts or otherwise.  Like all Ministers, he is an independent individual and will inform himself about where he wants to go.  That will be part and parcel of the process.</p></speech>

I would like Mr. Reynolds to reply to the issue of Spanish language availability.  The draft report indicated that language miscommunication is a notable risk in emergency response and that all communication should be in English.  The management response argued, however, that this was a legacy of when fishing reports were being logged in the Spanish fleet through Valentia radio station and criticised the report for either failing to note that the traffic has ceased or ignoring that fact and failing to analyse the impact.  However, I understand that 22 medivacs or rescues were carried out.  A recent RTE documentary showed Valentia&rsquo;s involvement in co-ordinating a rescue through Spanish.  The RAF has similar capabilities.  How is it that senior management can claim Fisher Associates are out of date regarding Spanish rescues when RTE can show one being co-ordinated through Spanish?  I ask Mr. Reynolds what is actually happening.</p></speech>

The Spanish fleet reported its catches to the naval base and fishery monitoring centre on a daily basis.  Vessels would call up Valentia every day to transmit information on fishing catches.  There were also a significant number of link calls to crewmen&rsquo;s families through Valentia.  There was a history of using Spanish for these routine operations.  Link calls have effectively been discontinued because people have satellite and mobile telephones and the recording of logs is done electronically via satellite.  That is what I meant when I noted that Spanish in routine traffic is a legacy issue.  I did not think the fact that most of the staff in Valentia have good Spanish skills was a sufficiently sound reason for picking Valentia over Malin when deciding which station to close.</p></speech>

If we are responding to a stress emergency, we would prefer to do so through English.  The Spanish boat should be using English.  Air traffic control does not control Spanish aircraft in Spanish and everyone else in English.  It is only by operating solely through English that we can guarantee consistency.  My concern is that if the fleet expect someone on the end of the line in Valentia to be a fluent Spanish speaker, I cannot guarantee consistency.  I cannot guarantee that every watch officer in Valentia will have good Spanish.  A relief officer is currently on duty in Valentia while another officer is on holidays.  I do not know if that individual has good Spanish.  It is great the officers in Valentia can speak Spanish and they can offer a great service to the Spanish fleet, but co-ordination should be carried out through English.  The extra bit of language skills helps, but it is not a reason to pick Valentia over Malin.</p></speech>

Many members and people supporting them have devoted a great deal of time in preparation for this meeting.  At a time when there are 450,000 people on the live register, we have a huge budgetary deficit and the country faces massive problems, the fact we are giving so much time to an issue that should never have arisen in the first place is a sin.  I am sure there is someone in the Department with a big enough shredder to take the Fisher Associates report and do away with it.  There will be no major financial savings if any of the proposals are implemented.  There will be great uncertainty about the delivery of service and the Department cannot ignore the collective voice of all the public representatives who are present because, ultimately, we represent the people.  Mr. Mullen cannot continue to ignore those voices.  It is rare that Members on all sides of both Houses sing from the same hymn sheet.  Will he consider strongly everything we have said?</p><p>  It is an emotive issue, about which people are angry and upset.  It is about time this issue was put to bed once and for all.  The Department has tried and failed and it should accept it will not succeed on this because the people will not have it.  Will Mr. Mullen examine alternative areas to justify recruiting people who are needed for this emergency front-line service?  This is not an area in which the Department has to make a case for hiring staff.  It is not an unnecessary service that we can do without in lean times.  As assistant secretary in the Department, Mr. Mullen can make that case to the Minister and he can ensure staff are recruited.  That is the most feasible solution to the problem.  Will he seriously consider that?  He should not leave our voices go unheard because we are representing the people of Kerry and Donegal and others elsewhere in the country who are engaged in the maritime sector.</p><p>  What has been said today is clear and further pursuit of this ridiculous notion would be an affront to democracy.  There might be merit in the report if it would make a significant contribution to our efforts to bring about fiscal rectitude or to provide a better service and neither of those prospects is clear.  I ask the Department to step back from this and to apply a little common sense.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the fine helicopter the Coast Guard has.  There is no reason experts could not be in Valentia Island or Malin Head given helicopters can land at both stations.  There is a fine airport in Kerry at which the search and rescue helicopter lands regularly to refuel.  The logistics involved should be considered in the report as well.  I ask the officials to go back and think this out.  They should think of the local people because, at the end of the day, we are talking about people's lives.  Cost savings and so on are all very well but what cost will the officials put on one life?</p></speech>

I do not know whether Mr. Mullen answered the question about whether a risk assessment was carried out on the Dublin station before the equipment was installed above a kitchen.  I believe it has been evacuated a few times.  The assistant secretary felt the criticism of senior management in the first draft of the Fisher Associates report was unfounded.  It stated, "With better management, many people [not one individual] considered that it could provide more out put with the same resources".  That sounds like value for money.  Many people said that to Fisher Associates but it did not appear in the draft that was forwarded to the Minister.  The Department did not allow it.  Officials did not say, "That seems to be a criticism of many stakeholders so we'll leave it in there".  That is not the only time people said something critical of senior management.  The report states, "During the internal consultation, it is very clear that many experienced people within the organisation below senior management level felt that the Irish Coast Guard could be better run".  This again did not appear in the report that was forwarded to the Minister.  It was edited out.  Pages of criticism by people internally and externally did not go to the Minister and that is disturbing.</p><p>  Mr. Mullen referred to a suite of observations.  Fisher Associates made a suite of observations in their first draft but they never said, "I believe you should go for this".  In the first draft, did they ever say they had one preference over another?  Will Mr. Reynolds clarify that?</p></speech>

In the first draft, did Fisher Associates in their suite of observations, whether they related to one, two or three centres, ever come down on the side of any of them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-24a.1577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Mullen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012102400034#RR00200"><p>I responded to that question in full.  The first draft they produced was the document that Fisher Associates say they put forward as the challenge document.  They made it clear to us at that stage that they were then going to engage with the senior management side and following on from that, they would draw up their definitive views on this.  It was not marked "draft" for nothing.  It was made very clear to us that this was part and parcel of the deliberative process that Fisher Associates themselves were conducting.  That is the fundamental truth.  As far as I was concerned, I was less worried about what they did or did not say in respect of that as long as that, by the time they finished the deliberative process, which they were steering, the subject had been totally addressed and Fisher Associates were satisfied and would stand over their final recommendations.</p></speech>

In the draft report, as I understand it, there was no preference expressed by Fisher Associates.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It was not a case of <i>quod scripsi scripsi</i>.  It was a draft report which they called the challenge report.  When they produced a draft report, they were unaware of a lot of information.  They were unaware of how a Government Department was structured internally.  Many things in their report were factually incorrect and when all these matters were made clear to them, they produced the second and third drafts.  The issue here, as Mr. Mullen rightly stated, is that it was a draft report and a challenge to us to respond and justify.  My biggest concern with the draft report was not those comments but that they were looking to cut the volunteer service in half, close 20 teams, remove all the boats and more or less remove all the cliff climbing equipment.  These were the issues at which I took umbrage, not the personalised issues.</p></speech>

My concern was that they looked at the Coast Guard effectively on the right-hand side of the balance sheet as something that incurred a loss and was expensive and needed to be looked at.

My point is that the final draft most certainly contained a recommendation.  It was the recommendation that senior management wanted.  We asked the question about Spanish trawlers and we received an answer about Spanish air traffic control and all the international rules.  The fact that Mr. Reynolds does not know how many Spanish speakers there are in Valentia Island does not say much for senior management but then the draft report says a lot about senior management anyway.  What I do not understand is that he does not seem to care that there are Spanish trawlers without English speakers on board who rely on Valentia Island and that Valentia Island saves lives.  He just says the rules are that an English speaker must be used in communications.</p></speech>

A sum of &euro;50,000 is not a small sum of money, rather it is a very substantial sum in the current climate.  There are many officials employed within the public sector, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and I cannot understand why these reports have to be undertaken by outside experts, people who do not even live in this country.  How can one justify undertaking a so-called independent report and to deliver the recommendation from that report, employ the same people to finalise a recommendation that goes to the Minister?  That does not make sense.  One can employ a group of consultants to produce a report, with officials within the Department then scrutinising the findings and presenting a proposal to the Minister, but how can one go back and spend another &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000 employing the same consultants to scrutinise the report?  We are not experts but we have gone through it line by line.</p><p>  It galls me when questions are asked here today about who has been consulted.  We have not heard who has been consulted.  Who was consulted along the seaboard?  Mr. Reynolds referred to the fact that staff at Valentia Island and Malin Head were consulted.  They may have been consulted.  Their proposals were included in draft one and their recommendations were removed in draft two.  Mr. Mullen indicated that the Department responded to draft one.  If the Department did respond to draft one, why were the recommendations of the ordinary staff who work 24-7 and give all of their time in Malin Head and Valentia Island excluded from the final report when the Department's recommendations were taken into consideration?  It appears that there is some form of collusion between Irish Coast Guard senior management and Fisher Associates.  If there is no such collusion, why the hell are Fisher Associates still on the table?  We are here today to talk about the report and now we find out that Fisher Associates will come back, get &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000 and decide the outcome of the independent report in conjunction with the management of the Coast Guard and Department officials.  We are wasting our time here if that is where we are going.</p></speech>
