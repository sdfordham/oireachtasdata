As stated by the Chairman, I am accompanied by Mr. John Lynskey, chairman, national sheep committee; Mr. Peter Shields, vice chaiman, national sheep committee, Mr. Pat Smith, general secretary; and Mr. Kevin Kinsella, director of livestock.  We wish to outline the case for increased support for the sheep sector and the specific proposals the Irish Farmers Association has put to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of sheep farmers.</p> <p>  The sheep sector is the third largest farming sector in Ireland, with over 34,000 producers and an output value of &euro;300 million per annum.  The sector is very important in terms of the number of farmers involved, strong export earnings of over &euro;220 million and the very positive social and environmental contributions it makes in rural areas, particularly in remote areas and on hills where it is not possible to conduct any other type of farming enterprise.  Sheep farming is particularly important in counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry and Wicklow and is also strong in counties Roscommon, Cork, Wexford, Meath, Tipperary, Sligo and Carlow.  I was informed earlier by the vice chairman that it was particularly important in County Lout also.</p></speech>

Our main markets are France, the UK, Belgium, Germany and Scandinavia.<br/><br/>There are eight key meat plants involved in processing lambs for export and a larger number of small abattoirs servicing the domestic butcher trade.  Lamb consumption on the domestic market accounts for about 15,700 tonnes with retail sales valued at &euro;102 million.<br/><br/>Incomes on sheep farms are challenging and direct payments are hugely important in helping to maintain viability.  The Teagasc 2014 National Farm Survey shows an average sheep income of &euro;14,551 or only about 44% of the average annual earnings.<br/><br/>The sheep sector has not fared well in previous CAP reforms.  In the original MacSharry reforms, the ewe premium system strongly supported incomes and drove numbers, which increased from below 2 million ewes in the late 1980s to almost 5 million in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Under the Fischler reforms with the move to decoupling, ewe numbers declined rapidly again dropping back to 2.2 million.  The IFA worked hard to get support for the sector and various initiatives were undertaken to stabilise numbers, including the Malone report and the introduction of &euro;18 million under the sheep grassland payment, financed from unused CAP funds.<br/><br/>The sheep grassland payment scheme was cut in the 2012 budget down to &euro;14 million for 2013 and &euro;3 million was transferred to the sheep technology programme, or STAP scheme.  Payments at farm level reduced from about &euro;8.50 per ewe back to &euro;6.35 per ewe on a maximum of 210 ewes. <br/><br/>In the most recent CAP reform there were no specific policy elements agreed for the sheep sector either under pillar 1 or pillar 2, unlike the beef sector where the suckler beef genomics scheme from the pillar 2 RDP was introduced.  This is worth &euro;52 million per annum to the beef sector.<br/><br/>As part of the current CAP reform, the IFA lobbied strongly for a coupled payment for sheep, which was rejected by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his Department.  Instead, the Minister incorporated the sheep grassland payment into the single farm payment of sheep farmers and increased its value to &euro;15 million through unused funds and modulation.  However, we now have a situation where we do not have a targeted sheep-specific payment that will support and develop the sector.<br/><br/>I would now like to hand over to our national sheep chairman, John Lynskey, to go through the finer detail of these proposals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lynskey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#H00200"><p>Chairman, Deputies and Senators, in order to maintain and grow the national sheep flock there is a need for increased targeted direct support for sheep production from a combination of EU and national funds.  Support should be targeted at active producers.<br/><br/>A number of EU countries have introduced coupled payments for sheep as part of their CAP 2015-2020 plans.  As reported in last week&rsquo;s <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, 22 member states have introduced varying levels of coupling for sheep.  The average payment is &euro;12 per head.  A total of &euro;486 million, or 12% of coupled payments, is being allocated to sheep.  In France, payments are varying from &euro;16 to &euro;27 per head.  In Spain, the range is from &euro;8 to &euro;13 per head.<br/><br/>Through a combination of CAP and national funds, there is a budget of &euro;580 million per annum in the rural development programme for 2015-2020.  The IFA worked hard to secure matching funds for the rural development programme.  New schemes are being rolled out through GLAS, knowledge transfer, beef genomics and TAMS II. <br/><br/>Sheep farmers are entitled to their fair share of, and access to, these funds and schemes.  The IFA is insisting that sheep farmers get the best deal possible.  To maintain the national ewe flock, the sheep sector requires targeted sheep-specific payments to the equivalent to &euro;20 per ewe.  The IFA is demanding that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, starts providing funding for this, with priority access to a number of schemes and the allocation of &euro;25 million for a direct payment.<br/><br/>Sheep farmers must have priority access to the GLAS payment of up to &euro;5,000 per annum.  All qualifying sheep farmers should be accepted into the scheme.</p><p>In addition, mixed grazing involving cattle and sheep should qualify as a payment measure.  The latest move to limit the scheme and exclude farmers from the second phase is not acceptable.  The changes to the low-input permanent pasture and traditional hay meadows measures effectively halve the value of those measures, which are vital for sheep and cattle farmers.  This must be addressed and 50,000 applicants must be allowed join.</p><p> For commonage farmers, plans must be implemented in a flexible way in order to maximise participation in line with the IFA commonage strategy.  The restrictions on GLAS+ must be eased so that hill sheep farmers and commonage farmers can qualify for the extra payment of &euro;2,000.</p><p> The current sheep technology advisory programme, STAP,  has been very successful, with more than 4,000 sheep farmers participating.  This success must be built upon and the IFA is proposing that a target of 10,000 participants be included in the new knowledge transfer scheme for sheep in 2016.  That scheme must be simple and practical in nature.  Mixed cattle and sheep farms must continue to qualify for a level of separate payment.  Likewise, mixed tillage and sheep farms should also qualify for additional payments.  The IFA has made its views very clear to the Minister on the unacceptable situation in respect of the making payments to advisers and facilitators as opposed to directly to farmers and also on the actual level of these payments.</p><p> TAMS II must have a significant and dedicated level of funding for investment in the sheep sector.  The decision of the Minister to exclude sheep fencing and technology equipment in the recent TAMS II announcement was wrong and must be reversed immediately.  The Minister must include these items under the amendment currently being prepared on the Rural Development programme to be submitted to Brussels.</p><p> Payments for areas of natural constraint, formerly the disadvantaged areas scheme, should be restored to their pre-2008 levels.  This would involve a restoration of payment rates at farm level and restoration of the payment status of farmers in split holdings.</p><p> The Government, in conjunction with Bord Bia, must adopt a strong market access policy to open up new high-value markets such the US, China and others, and remove the access restrictions and difficulties associated with TSEs for both sheepmeat and live animals.  We also need to develop market outlets for light lamb.  Other policy areas that are important for sheep producers include the need for Teagasc to maintain a strong independent sheep research and advisory programme, with Athenry as a centre of excellence.  In addition, Teagasc needs to increase the numbers of sheep farms in the BETTER farm programme.</p><p> Bord Bia promotional funding for Irish lamb on the domestic and export markets must be maintained in addition to EU funding for generic promotion of lamb.  There needs to be a worthwhile and transparent price incentive for lambs from a Bord Bia quality assured farm.</p><p> Sheep Ireland is working hard on sheep breeding.  It is very important we have a well-funded, focused and practical sheep-breeding improvement programme implemented for the benefit of sheep farmers and the sector.  It is essential that this be closely linked to the knowledge transfer programme and Teagasc.</p><p> Regarding the most recent discussions on imposing compulsory electronic tagging, EID, for all sheep, the IFA has made the views of sheep farmers very clear to Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department.  The &euro;2 million cost involved for sheep farmers is excessive and the derogation on lambs direct to slaughter must be maintained.  In addition, the unique situation of hill sheep producers must be accommodated and central points of recording must be available to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy.</p><p> In summary, the IFA is requesting the backing of this committee in respect of increased supports for the 34,000 plus sheep farmers operating in the sector.  This sector is very important and deserves its fair share.</p><p> I thank the committee for its support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#K00300"><p>I thank the delegation and apologise for being late, but I was at a briefing.</p> <p>  The sheep sector is vitally important to many smaller holdings, particularly along the western seaboard where the farms are not as fragmented as along the eastern seaboard.  There might be a small number of suckler cattle and sheep and the dependence on income from sheep is very high.  The CSO figures show that the overall number of sheep in the June livestock survey was 5.16 million.  This is up 1.3% on the 2014 figures but it identified a fall in the number of breeding ewes.  In Australia and New Zealand, the production levels are around 86% of the overall sheep production in the world, but they also have a fall in the number of breeding stock.  The sheep sector is at a crossroads.  Farmers do not know whether to stay in sheep production, invest and continue breeding, or to have dry stock.</p> <p>  There are major demands on sheep farmers in spring when the ewes are lambing.  It is not an attractive way of life, especially for younger farmers, and there is an issue, which I think the witnesses have touched on when they identified a need for an incentive for breeding animals.  The figures would back that up.  I think a decoupled payment for breeding ewes should be looked at.  While the figures have remained fairly stagnant in the past four or five years, there has been a fall in breeding stock.  If that fall continues, we will not be able to supply the emerging markets.  The emerging markets in Europe are countries such as Germany, Sweden and the Northern European countries.  We are exporting more at present to the United Kingdom and France but production of the breeding stock is up about 7% in the UK.  That will obviously lead to an increasing internal supply in the UK.  To try to deal with that, we must consider the emerging markets.  The Far East is also an emerging market.  The supply of lamb in the emerging economies is not able to meet the level of demand.  There are opportunities in these markets.  </p> <p>  I agree that Bord Bia has a role to play but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine initially has a role to play in bringing about a decoupled payment for sheep, whether that should be an across the board payment per ewe up to a certain maximum number, similar to the previous payment of either &pound;10 or &pound;20.  I think it is the right way to go.  It is the only way we can incentivise production within the sector.</p> <p>  GLAS was mentioned as were the difficulties with the commonage.  The commonage framework plans being implemented at present are causing huge difficulties.  Some farmers want to have one plan in place.  This is causing significant difficulties for farmers in my county with commonages.  It is leading to farmers wanting to opt out of the new commonage framework plans, which is disappointing.</p> <p>  Bord Bia has identified emerging markets and has conducted extensive research in identifying market access.  It might be an idea for the joint committee to engage with Bord Bia to ascertain what work it is doing to target some of those emerging markets.  It may well say there is a lack of available supply, which goes back to breeding ewes issue.  </p> <p>  Traditionally, lamb prices have been volatile.</p><p>Over the past two years there have been peaks and troughs in prices.  They declined going into the middle or end of September and picked up again for the Christmas market but that is a cyclical issue every year.  Price stability affects the lambing season because one can lamb at a certain time and hold on to lambs if one has after grass.  I ask the  witnesses to comment on prices in the lamb sector.  Would a decoupled payment for breeding ewes bring some price stability?  I know that prices are driven by the market and that the delegation will probably identify that fact.    </p><p> The presentation has been helpful and useful.  I support what has been said, particularly the suggestion of a decoupled payment.  A lot of payment schemes, such as the TAMS, are very important to farmers who wish to invest in their farms but it takes investment to draw down funding.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the following matter.  I know a lot of farmers, and the delegation probably has the figure, who are up in years and want to hand the farm over to a family member or someone else.  There is a lack of incentive for them to do so and one is nearly paid for doing nothing.  I believe that an inbuilt production payment would greatly assist the sheep sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#L00200"><p>I thank Mr. Downey and Mr. Lynskey for their presentations today.  Those of us who come from the west will fully understand and appreciate their contributions, suggestions and ideas.  One realises, particularly when one comes from hilly land and areas of mountain ranges, that people must make a living out of land that is far inferior to other parts of the country.  Survival is down to the diligence, commitment and strength of the people involved in the sector which has helped in no small way to keep rural and peripheral Ireland vibrant.  That vibrancy is down to the people who farm that type of land, particularly the sheep farmers.</p> <p>  I was struck by the statistics outlined by the delegation that there is an annual production of 58,000 tonnes and that 46,000 tonnes of it represents the third largest export in Europe.  That fact shows the value of the product to rural Ireland.  I was also struck by the fact that the average income is &euro;14,500.  For a considerable period I have fought here against the cutbacks to farm assist, etc.  How many of the people involved in hill farming and sheep farming depend on the farm assist payment?  How have the cutbacks to farm assist, over the past number of budgets, affected the livelihood of these people?  A small contribution from the State can make the difference between surviving and not surviving in the areas that I referred to.</p> <p>  I believe that a decoupled payment for ewes would be a good move.  It would be  very helpful if the Government made a statement to the effect that it was prepared to concede to such a measure.  It would make a huge difference to the overall production of sheep and lambs.  The measure would give an element of certainty to the people who produce and work at that level.  I support such a measure.  The delegation mentioned a payment of &euro;20 per ewe.  That would be money well spent by the Government.</p> <p>  The delegation mentioned market access and the opening of trade to the US, China and other countries.  Sheep farming has been the poor relation when it comes to farming.  There needs to be positive discrimination towards ensuring that the people involved in the sheep sector get the best access to markets.  It is important we ensure that people are not discriminated against in that regard.</p><p>The witnesses mentioned that the strong independent sheep research and advisory programme in Athenry was being maintained as a centre of excellence.  There is a necessity for it and while we might all argue where it should be, I will not put a spanner in the works.</p><p> The witnesses also said the cost of compulsory electronic tagging was &euro;2 million and that this was excessive.  Is there any support from the State for this or is any support proposed?  It would be to the benefit of all of us, particularly these days with so much crime in rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#M00200"><p>I thank Mr. Downey and Mr. Lynskey for their presentations.  I agree with almost everything they said.  It is vitally important we help sheep producers.  They mentioned the sheep grassland payment, which was absorbed into the single farm payment and which brings us closer to the maximum more quickly than it should.  Something has to be done about that.  The coupled payment would be a way out of the problem but we have to be careful not to drive the numbers up and leave ourselves with the problem of overgrazing.  Maybe if a coupled payment was put in place up to a maximum of &euro;150 or &euro;200, it could help the smaller sheep farmer and it would take less in the way of funds at a time when the money may not be there.</p> <p>  Another way we can help the sheep farmer would be in respect of the &euro;1,000 that was lost in the budget cuts of 2008 and 2009.  I have raised this on a number of occasions.  Perhaps it could be restored by &euro;500 over two budgets, if not by &euro;1,000 all in one.  There are 34,000 sheep farmers with 3.5 million sheep but we do not want to go back to 5 million sheep overgrazing on the hills.  Even with commonage frameworks in place we still see a bit of overgrazing here and there around the country.  We have to be careful not to damage the environment.</p> <p>  Another problem we have been raising for a while concerns sheep exports to Northern Ireland via the marts.  Sheep going from a farm can travel freely but if Northern Ireland people want to come down to Wicklow or Carlow, as they often do at this time of the year, to buy ewes to breed them, there is a difficulty getting them from the marts to Northern Ireland.  </p> <p>  On the coupled payment, we see &euro;52 million going into beef genomics and something along those lines should be done for the sheep sector.  The STAP programme is very good in its own way in bringing farmers out and getting discussions going but we have to target sheep farmers, particularly young farmers starting off, to encourage them to stay with the business.  We do not want numbers to fall any more.</p> <p>  As other members have pointed out, farm assist is a problem and we regularly get calls on that subject.  We have to support those people who are dependent on sheep farming and the farm assist will help to boost their income in difficult areas.</p></speech>

As they outlined, the sheep industry is a very important part of our overall agricultural package.  It supported the economy when we were in the doldrums and it is important we do not lose sight, as we have done previously, of the role agriculture plays.  Not every acre of land in this country is suitable for dairy or beef production and a lot of sheep production is in areas of natural constraint.  I agree with Mr. Lynskey that we should try to restore the payment under the old disadvantaged areas scheme, now known as the area of natural constraints scheme, back to its 2008 level.  It is important, not only for rural Ireland, to keep people in active farming in those areas.</p> <p>  It is important farmers in beef and sheep production are allowed draw a knowledge transfer payment for both sections rather than a joint payment and we will have to lobby the Minister on this.</p><p>Fencing should be included in TAMS II.  We can spend up to &euro;100,000 on a milking parlour and get support from TAMS but if somebody spends up to &euro;5,000 on fencing, which is very important for his or her type of farming, that must be included in TAMS II.  The committee must take that up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> Many have expressed support for coupled payments.  As a nation we have moved away from coupled payments.  I always supported them for sheep and suckler herds.  We have progressed the suckler herd into the beef genomics programme to try to improve the quality of the suckler herd.  We could bring up a similar scheme for sheep.  We would be starting from a low base because we do not have the research criteria.  Something like that would be better than a coupled payment which might damage the industry by increasing numbers for the sake of increasing them, whereas it would be important if people were paid some sort of incentive for improving their breed, their herd and sheep flocks.</p><p> Young farmers are very important.  Maybe the IFA witnesses could tell us how many young people are involved in sheep farming.  It was not a sexy thing to be in.  Sheep farming is a hard way of life.  One can put a cow up a crush but when you want to do something with a sheep you have to catch it.  It is a physically demanding job.  Young people will not go into it unless they can get a financial return.  Lamb prices have been fairly steady and good for the past year but because prices were depressed for three or four years there was no incentive for people to stay in sheep production.</p><p> It is important that fencing be included in TAMS II.  The knowledge transferred is that farmers are entitled to both payments.  I question the coupled payment but there has to be some support, in a different way and given the areas of natural constraint.  With the economy picking up and a few more quid in the coffers, it is time to restore those cuts because the areas involved in sheep production are those under natural constraint and it would be a way to keep people in active farming in these areas.</p></speech>

I generally support the idea of helping the sheep industry in any way possible because it is a tough sector of business to be in.  If a coupled payment was announced where would it come from?  There are 3.5 million ewes in the country.  Will that come from the rural development plan or is there scope within the rural development programme to get more on top of GLAS, TAMS, knowledge transfer and the other schemes?  Is the door closed for another scheme within that programme or must we go back to the European kitty for an extension?  I would like that clarified.  The concept is good but as Senator O&rsquo;Neill said we do not need to increase numbers for the sake of increasing them.  We need quality.</p> <p>  The knowledge transfer programme has been very successful and that could be developed further with farmers coming together.  I hope I am wrong but I think getting young farmers involved in the sheep industry will be a huge challenge.  As Senator O&rsquo;Neill said, it is not &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; to be involved in the sheep industry.  It was not sexy to be involved in agriculture during the so-called Celtic tiger years, not alone the sheep industry.  I hope we will not go back down that road.  Agriculture has been the driving force behind the rebuilding of this economy and it needs to be developed and protected for the future.  The key is to get more young farmers involved and create an incentive for them.  In some parts of south Carlow there are commonage issues.  Senator Comiskey spoke about over-grazing.  There may be under-grazing soon.  The majority of sheep farmers who have rights on hills are elderly farmers who have nobody coming after them.</p><p>At more than 80 years of age, they will not go up a hill to run around after a sheep for half the day.  What will happen to them and to those rights in the future are major issues to be teased out.  It was a mistake not to include them in the TAMS.  Hopefully, the Minister will row back on that in respect of sheep fencing.  I tabled parliamentary questions in that regard last week and I hope there will be a bit of a row back, which would be helpful.  It is important that younger farmers get involved in the industry.</p></speech>

I also agree that the coupling payment needs to be more incentivised in the context of quality and productivity and it should be measured.  Ireland averages &euro;6.35 a head while the other 22 member states average &euro;12 a head.  Why is there such a massive gap?</p> <p>  I am taken by the commonage issue and how we must address that.  Donegal has 5,607 flocks while Galway has 4,148 flocks.  It is vital that we retain the livelihoods of these farmers and the tradition in the west.  We are turning over &euro;250 million in exports from this industry.  We were over-grazing at one stage but that has been addressed.  Bord Bia will find the markets for the farmers and we must get that right.  The proposal regarding TAMS and fencing is a no-brainer.</p></speech>

Sheep are important as part of a mixed farming enterprise and they play a pivotal role in grassland and pasture management and environmental enhancement.  I have a brother involved in the industry but none of my nieces or nephews are too interested in it because it is not attractive.  Sheep farming is labour intensive, which is lost on many people.  The hole in the bucket for sheep farmers is the failure to have their entity specifically identified as such within the CAP reform structure and to have a specific payment for them.  I do not ever fear a return to the late 1980s and early 1990s when Ireland had 5 million sheep.  Everyone in the place had a sheep, including those who did not know the difference between a sheep and a cat.  We do not want that again.  I can recall what happened.  Land was taken willy nilly just to get the sheep.  That is a road to nowhere.  We were up that road and we are now on a road to sustainability and we are trying to ensure that.  That is why any aid that is secured must be targeted.  It should be targeted at the flock.  It is no use having a flock owner with 10,000 sheep.  In the west, in particular, there has to be a cut-off point.  This takes a little thinking.  There is no use diving in, being halfway across the pool and drowning.  We have to think about this and work it out properly.  I have no choice to support this because there are significant sheep farmers around Ballynacargy where I come from.</p></speech>

The IFA has identified a figure of &euro;25 million and the issue is how we secure it.  It is important because many people are digging in and there is a constrained amount available.  This will be supplemented by giving access to a number of specific schemes.  It is a little irritating that significant grant aid can be secured in one sector but a sector such as this is the poor relation with little done in respect of fencing and management issues.  Money could be provided and it would only require a small amount.</p><p>It is small money because at that level &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;5,000 is the equivalent of &euro;150,000 at another.  The TAMS II scheme must be looked at again because it could be an area of interest.</p><p> I am also supportive of the idea that any support for which we can argue and secure should be directed at active farmers.  That is a matter about which I feel strongly.  The provision of support for farmers who are on their farms night and day and get up at 3 a.m. with weanlings and so on is very important.  </p><p> It is also important not to omit market initiatives that could be taken.  I have no doubts about the role played by Bord Bia, Mr. Aidan Cotter and others.  We have the best beef and sheep marketing board in Europe and it can continue to play a constructive role in marketing and other related areas, even in the home market.  On a trip to France in the early 1990s I recall going to the big Rungis market at 4 a.m. and remember distinctly how preferential treatment was given to home product over Irish product, some of which had been brought in from my own area, Kilbeggan.  I wonder if that is still the way it is?  In trying to break into these markets I wonder if home produce is still given preferential treatment?  Notwithstanding the fact that there is equal access to markets and everything else, are we still at the stage where countries always hoist their own flags?  If that is the case, we should hoist our flag and make sure domestic consumers also appreciate the value of the very good product we produce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Downey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#P00200"><p>I thank members for their comments, all of which were positive.  Many people talk about the west and small farmers, particularly sheep farmers, but we need to lose sight of and move beyond that issue at this stage.  Quite simply, we want to have a balanced industry across the country.  In order to have a viable sheep sector we need to have lowland and upland sheep.  It is clear from all of the reforms and support mechanisms put in place that direct supports drive numbers and output.  There is a concern, which was expressed by some members, about the effect this can have on the environment and associated issues, but if we can drive numbers and output, it will secure a supply of product to keep the factories in place and jobs secure.  On top of this, while we develop and break into new markets, we can guarantee a continued supply over the full year.  There is no point in getting into a market for a couple of months and then being out of it for the rest of the year; it is simply not viable to do so.  That aspect is of critical importance to us.  </p> <p>  On the environmental side, many have talked about commonages and our position on them.  In terms of what we need to consider, we have to be clear on what has always been our position.  We need individual plans for individual commonages.  Once we have done this we have to revisit and examine the need for flexibility to allow active farmers to farm commonages in the correct way.  This can be measured and done on a planned basis, but we need to have a plan to make sure it will happen.</p> <p>  GLAS presents a huge problem for us because we see the exclusion from it of low input grasslands.  This will have a huge effect on farmers through the halving of the amount of land in respect of which they can submit applications.  That has to be reversed.  Put simply, if the Minister takes something out of the scheme, surely additional measures should be included to act as a counterbalance if there is overuse of a particular measure.</p> <p>  Another important issue raised was succession and the need to get young people involved in the industry.  Members have read our pre-budget submission in which we raise the issue of the phased transfer of farms from one generation to another.  We need to deal with that process in a stronger way.  In addition, we must ensure the leasing incentives in place will continue to work.  I will leave the question of farm assist to Mr. Kinsella who might be able to give more details and outline the current position on the scheme.</p> <p>  This is a low income sector which relies on a suite of schemes and payments.  I refer to the sheep technology adoption programme, STAP and the farm assist scheme, but what is vital is a direct payment which we see as essential in the future.</p> <p>  A few members mentioned the facilities in Athenry.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there is a need for a centre of excellence for the sheep sector.  The facilities are available in Athenry, but that initiative has to be driven and we need to get real results from it.  </p> <p>  I will leave the issue of tagging to the chairman, if he wishes to address it.</p><p>Senator Comiskey raised the issue of how vital it is to rural areas to have these schemes in place.  The issue of exports to Northern Ireland continues to be a problem for us.  We need to examine this, both on the cattle side and the sheep side.  There must be give on this because we are excluded from direct sales to our nearest neighbour and our cattle have been discounted in those markets.  That is not acceptable and we need to look at that area in more detail.</p><p> Restoring the disadvantaged areas payment would be a huge vote of confidence in this whole area.  Allowing farmers to participate in two of the discussion group payments is essential.  The value of these discussion groups and the knowledge that has transferred directly to farmers has been phenomenal.  One of the key things to emerge from discussion groups is the value of paddock grazing and rotational grazing.  To make that happen, it is essential that one has proper fencing and yet we have the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS II, which excludes that.  It is a no-brainer to me.  Payments need to be made in that respect.</p><p> Schemes should be an incentive to improve, not just a payment for having sheep.  Deputy Penrose stated very clearly the difference between a cat and a sheep.  While that might be a stretch, we want people who want to farm these areas and learn the skills associated with farming difficult areas.</p><p> While overgrazing is a problem, a whole new set of quotas from Europe has been put in place.  We have the environmental quota which restricts the number of animals that can be put in an area.  The risk of overgrazing in commonage areas has been reduced because there will be individual plans for each of these areas with which farmers will have to comply.  I do not see that as a risk.  These can be used flexibly to manage it; to put extra sheep to get it under control and then put a correct management figure on it.</p><p> Deputy Penrose raised the issue of the Rungis market in France.  What he saw happen there in the past has actually increased.  The renationalisation of European markets is absolutely clear.  We see what is happening in the UK with the little Red Tractor food standard symbol.  I always say we want to be in the little trailer behind the red tractor, not in the skip.  If they are bringing us along in a trailer, we are selling on an equal footing.  If they put us in the skip, we are dumping in there.  We are the largest exporter of beef to the UK and 90% of our agricultural produce goes there.  We can damage markets just as quickly as we can protect and look after them.  The French market now has a flag system that is making a difference.  We were promised a free European market but it is going in the opposite direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lynskey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#Q00200"><p>Across the board, the impression has been given that sheep farming is the poor relation, which is absolutely correct.  Once that is realised, we can move on.  We need our fair share of the supports.  This is why we want to ensure the sector, the poor relation, get its fair share of the supports available to maintain it.  In 2002, when we were down at around 1.2 million ewes, the IFA fought a battle for the sheep grassland scheme, which was introduced in 2008.  It was not a huge payment but enough to grow numbers to 2.5 million ewes.  The numbers stabilised over several years and, over the past two years, lamb prices have been reasonably stable.  However, ewe numbers have dropped.</p><p>We see a drop because this payment has slipped from being a targeted support for sheep into the CAP payment.  This is where we are at and why we are here looking for support to get a fair share to maintain sheep numbers, maintain meat factories around the country and maintain the markets mentioned.  Therefore, it is vital that a support is available to maintain the numbers.  We do not believe there is any basis for the fear of overgrazing and of driving numbers to the highs of the late 1990s if the support is targeted correctly to the sector to support productive farmers willing to do a good job, producing lamb.  There is a market deficit in Europe.  Reference was made to the increase in sheep numbers in the UK.  The UK can consume the exact amount of lamb it produces, but it imports a cheaper New Zealand lamb and exports some of its own.  That is the position.  Sheep numbers are falling right across Europe, so the prospects are there of a market for our lamb.</p><p> We have pointed out that full electronic identification, EID, across the board would cost sheep farmers in the region of &euro;2 million or &euro;2.2 million per year without any noticeable benefits to them.  In our discussions with the Department on the matter, it said there is no issue on traceability where lambs go direct to slaughter from the original farm where the lamb is produced.  The Department does not have a problem with that position and we are looking for the derogation to continue.  In the case of light hill store lambs, which are sold for approximately &euro;25 to &euro;50 per head, placing a tag costing in the region of &euro;1.40 to &euro;1.60 per head is an excessive charge for the sector.  Work needs to be done to ensure fair play for all lamb producers.</p></speech>

The changes proposed on GLAS in recent weeks discriminate massively against the small, mixed sheep and dry stock sector and must be addressed.  Part of the way to address it is for the Minister to allow 20,000 into GLAS rather than 7,000 to 10,000 extra.  That would take some of the pressure off the system and it could be done now.  The payments could be managed as we go forward, but that is a key priority.</p> <p>  The second thing that could be done at the stroke of a pen is sheep fencing.  We must accept that it was a mistake.  That could be done now.  Knowledge transfer could be doubled up.  Sheep farmers could enter two schemes in the past but now they can only enter one.  There is a benefit for the industry.  While it might not be the full payment, there should be an acceptance of the benefit of it and there should be a payment now.  Those are three things that could be done now and that would show the 34,000 sheep farmers that the Government is interested in their industry.  Another thing that could be done is that the Minister could make a commitment to the sheep industry that, as and when funds become available, it would be prioritised for a direct payment of &euro;25 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Kinsella" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#R00300"><p>In line with my colleagues, I thank all the Deputies for their support for the proposals we have put forward.  It is very clear there is broad support for those proposals.  That is related to the fact that, first, the people here are in touch with their sheep farmer constituents on the ground and, second, our national sheep committee is also at that same place so there is a general consensus on what is the right thing to do, and there is consensus in the committee in that regard, which is positive.</p> <p>  In a broader sense, it is very important for the sheep sector that we maintain our critical mass.  I would be very concerned if we were to move toward or fall below 2 million ewes.</p><p>That would be a serious situation because at that stage we would lose factories, markets and customers and we would not get them back because we would not have the critical mass.  In order to deal with organisations such as Carrefour, Intermarch&eacute; or Casino, it is necessary to be at that level.</p><p> We lost a meat plant close to where the Chairman lives in the past two years.  That was a pretty serious blow and we need to ensure we do not lose another.  In that regard, we have clearly identified today what needs to be done, as outlined to the committee.  Twenty-two countries across Europe are not silly.  They have identified this and taken a decision.  It is not an easy decision and it gets complex, as Mr. Pat Smith said.  The funding comes from CAP Pillar 1 for those going down a coupled route or, alternatively, it is some combination.  We have &euro;580 million per annum in RDP funding over the coming years.  There are adequate resources in the system to try to prioritise some level of payment for the sheep sector and that is what we are asking the committee to support.</p><p> Mr. Downey highlighted one figure that stood out for me.  Professor Alan Renwick from UCD identified that every &euro;1 of support to the sheep sector delivers &euro;2.70 in overall economic output in the rural areas we are all trying to maintain and support positively.</p><p> Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked about farm assist.  I do not have the precise figures for the number of sheep farmers eligible for farm assist; we can get those.  There is an increase in these remote rural areas where sheep farming is important.  That is directly linked back to the reduction in the level of direct payments that have gone in in the past.  I refer in particular to REPS and the disadvantaged area cuts that a number of members of the committee clearly said need to be addressed.</p><p> Senator Comiskey and a number of others asked about the Northern Ireland issue.  On sheep, it is very specific.  There are two markets here.  There is one for breeding animals coming from the Chairman's county and another of other counties.  Under current EU regulations, live breeding animals may not be exported to another EU country unless they have been tested and the flock has been certified as TSE free, which is almost impossible in an Irish context.  As Mr. Downey said, we need discussions with our Northern colleagues to resolve that trade issue whereby we are prevented from trading on the cattle and sheep side with Northern Ireland in an uninhibited way that can let that market free up.  We need to bear in mind that approximately 400,000 or 500,000 lambs come south for slaughter and we cannot send our breeding animals back up north.  That is not acceptable and needs to be addressed.  We have looked at it very closely and it is very difficult to address within the regulation.  It needs more attention.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for this opportunity.  We very much appreciate the support the committee has given for additional supports for the sheep sector.</p></speech>

It was later amalgamated with the area based payment.  Many sheep farmers felt cheated by that.  A specific payment needs to be put in place.  We have already seen the closure of the processing facility in Hackettstown.  Unless this industry is supported, other processing facilities across the country will close.  Every other aspect of the agriculture industry is being supported.  We need a targeted scheme for the sheep industry.</p></speech>

The point has been raised at every joint Border committee meeting.</p> <p>  I thank members their contributions to this discussion.  I come from the country which has the highest average flock.  I am also a sheep farmer.  Sheep production in this country comprises two categories, namely, low-land flocks, which are mainly big commercial flocks, and upland flocks, both of which have a role to play.  As stated by Mr. Downey, we need to have this industry across all sectors.  Deputy Penrose made the point that the industry contributes enormously to good soil and grassland management and, in particular, to the control of diseases such as ragwort.  It is easy to identify a farm that has sheep because there is never any ragwort evident on it.  That is a very basic, simple fact of life.</p> <p>  Sheepmeat, which is probably the healthiest red meat on the market, is in danger of being defined as a luxury product as opposed to a product accessible to the masses.  Chicken is probably the greatest competitor of sheep, pig and other meat products.   </p> <p>  On the points raised during today's meeting by the IFA, there is widespread support for the TAMS to include fencing.  As has been stated, sheep will never stay where they are put.  They must be controlled.  It is important GLAS and other commonage schemes provide for sufficient numbers of people who want to produce sheep.  Sheep must be part and parcel of the plan.  In other words, this should form part of the incentive of having sheep in the uplands.</p> <p>  With regard to marketing, I have already addressed that point.  On EID, I would like to float a suggestion.  I agree with the proposal in relation to the two derogations.  However, in my opinion, two yields should derive from EID tagging.</p><p>One advantage is that it does away with paperwork.  If a farmer decides to sell animals and they are EID, the responsibility is to get feedback from the mart or whomever with a paper or electronic readout that is theirs, so they just tag them and bring them in.  There should be a common sense approach to lost tags and lost animals, especially on uplands.  This could form part of a genomics-type scheme to deal with TSE or scrapie.  A number of animals are tested - maybe 5% per annum - and that might be agreeable to achieve scrapie-free status, especially for sires, in particular, where the target has to be.</p><p> Those are some of the ideas that should be examined in greater detail.  However, the coupled payment has to be incentivised for improved animal health and production.  One is not going to get it otherwise.  The knowledge transfer must form part of that because we have seen the value of it.  To get 4,000 out of 34,000 is a start but it is nowhere near acceptable when one considers that probably half the country's dairy farmers are part of discussion groups.  That should be the ultimate target.  </p><p> In the early 1980s, New Zealand had 70 million sheep but it is probably back down to half that number now.  Lamb production, however, while not the same, is very nearly the same through better flock management, grassland and management skills.  That was only gained by knowledge and research.  A Teagasc centre of excellence in Athenry would, therefore, be crucial to developing that, along with better farm programmes.</p><p> I understand that Mr. Downey and Mr. Smith are staying and that we are moving the discussion from rom sheep to the dairy sector.  I wish to thank Mr. Lynskey, Mr. Shields and Mr. Kinsella for appearing before the joint committee.  </p><p> I will now suspend the meeting to allow the new witnesses to take their seats.</p></speech>

Accompanying me today are IFA national dairy chairman Sean O&rsquo;Leary, IFA national liquid milk chairman Teddy Cashman, IFA general secretary Pat Smith and IFA dairy executive Catherine Lascurettes.</p> <p>  The end of 31 years of quota creates a real opportunity for Irish milk producers, who operate cost-competitive, grass-based production systems, to supply fast growing global dairy demand for high quality, sustainably-produced dairy products and ingredients.  However, this positive outlook comes with major challenges around volatility of prices and input costs in particular.  Indeed, dairy farmers all over the world are currently living through a difficult period of sustained low milk prices.</p> <p>  Extreme income volatility for dairy farmers has been the norm since 2007.  Farmers will need tax policies and milk price instruments to help them manage this reality.  In addition, farmers will need well-resourced advisory services to help them improve efficiencies further.  The Government must also ensure that the banks give farmers access to flexible, internationally competitively priced finance with variable repayments to reflect income variations.  At the conference of parties, COP, in Paris in December, the Government must secure climate change legislation which gives farmers credit for their low carbon footprint in the global context, and which does not prevent them from expanding sustainably.</p> <p>  I will hand over to our national dairy chairman, Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Leary to present the issues in greater detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#V00300"><p>There is a positive outlook for dairy, but there will also be cyclical price and income challenges.  World population is growing rapidly, with the equivalent of the population of Germany being born each year.  It is projected to grow to 9 billion by 2050.  Most of the population growth is predicted to occur in emerging countries and as numbers grow so will the percentage of those emerging populations classified as middle classes.  This is important because the emergence of more affluent middle classes always coincides with changes in diet.  Consumers in those countries will be ambitious to move from poorer quality vegetable protein to higher quality animal protein, often supported by government health related policies, such as the Chinese school milk scheme.<br/><br/>The long-term outlook as predicted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, OECD-FAO, market analysts and confirmed by most experts is for demand to grow somewhat more slowly than in the previous decade, at around 2% per annum, with global supplies chasing it at a slightly slower pace.  There is huge potential for countries that are capable of producing high-quality dairy products and ingredients efficiently and sustainably to supply this growing demand.  Ireland is one of the very few countries well placed to capitalise on this opportunity.<br/><br/>Volatility in milk prices and input costs has, however, multiplied over the last decade.  This is a result of much greater levels of trade, the quasi-abolition of market supports in Europe, and the greater prevalence of weather events across the world.  Economic and geopolitical events, such as the absence of China from the market, the current low oil prices and the Russian ban on EU food imports, have also played a part in worsening price volatility.  Farmers will have to learn to manage the impact that the extreme fluctuation of prices will have on their income in order to supply this growing demand and fulfil the sector&rsquo;s economic potential.<br/><br/>In respect of solutions for the short and longer term, right now the biggest issue for dairy farmers is cashflow or, more to the point, how their cashflow will evolve over the coming months in the face of low milk prices, high superlevy and tax bills and repayment commitments.  Come next spring, we will have the added challenge of lower milk cheques as relatively smaller volumes and lower constituents mean lower milk price value.<br/><br/>The early payment of up to 75% of the basic payment scheme, BPS and rural development programme, RDP<b></b>will provide welcome short-term assistance.  The distribution of Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;13.7 million share of the EU targeted aid, which we have called on the Minister to match with national funds as is explicitly permitted by the EU and to distribute equally among all the farmers concerned, will also be of some help.</p><p>It is also vital that all rural development programmes be fully funded, and that TAMS<b></b>is administered efficiently and promptly to allow farmers carry out their investment plans in good time.  However, the type of cash flow pressures we are seeing right now will be part of the dairy cycle over the coming years.  A suite of policies and instruments must be developed and offered to farmers to help them manage their income for the longer term.  The setting up by Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, of the Dairy Forum is welcome in this respect, and it must be used by the Minister to put pressure on all stakeholders &ndash; including banks, industry, Government and the EU - to deliver long-term viable solutions to the challenges of farm income volatility.  <br/><br/>The &euro;500 million EU aid package voted by Council on 7<sup></sup>September, which enhances APS for dairy products, increases promotion budgets and makes &euro;420 million worth of direct payment available to EU dairy farmers, will provide some assistance.  However, the EU Commission and Council have shied away from doing the one thing that would actually help put a floor on dairy markets and turn them around faster &ndash; increasing the so-called intervention safety net so that it is more in tune with actual production costs.  The Minister must keep this issue on the agenda and progress it, not play the EU Commission&rsquo;s game and wait for markets to recover and leave the issue unaddressed, to cause difficulty again when the next price trough arises.<br/><br/>Banks and other finance providers must come under greater Government pressure to make available to farmers competitively priced, flexible financial products, which allow farmers to take repayment holidays or go on interest=only repayments without re-pricing or re-negotiation costs.  The Minister must also seek maximum leveraging of the European Investment Bank funds to support the sector, including farmers.<br/><br/>With all the stakeholders around the table of the dairy forum, we want to see the Minister drive greater engagement from industry around fixed price and margin contracts and other forms of optional price-margin hedging.  As yet, too few farmers have access to or even understand the potential value of such contracts to help them manage their business for the long term.  A crucial piece in addressing income volatility will be to tackle the EU Commission on state aid rules, in order to increase our ability, at national level, to deliver individualised tax-based solutions. <br/><br/>IFA has proposed a detailed scheme to allow farmers to put away funds in good years, to be returned to their taxable income for investment or in poorer years.  Such schemes exist in New Zealand and Australia, and in a smaller, more restrictive way, in France.  It is essential that we provide this type of individualised flexibility to assist farmers in managing their volatile income.<br/><br/>With budget 2016 only a few days away, I also take this opportunity to thank members for attending our lobbying session last week.  The land mobility initiatives facilitated by last year&rsquo;s budget decisions are immensely valuable for new entrants and expanding dairy farmers.  However, more can be done to facilitate farm investment.  I remind the committee of IFA's proposals to encourage lifetime transfers and farm restructuring by phasing transfers through partnerships and to accelerate capital allowances for sole traders, among others.<br/><br/>One element which the forum did not discuss at its inaugural meeting, and which we cannot and must not shy away from, is the need for efficiency benchmarking at processing level, with a view to identifying savings and removing costs, including through co-operation, and even consolidation.  This is an exercise which the industry itself must undertake, but it must be part of the focus driven through the dairy forum.  Only an optimally efficient dairy processing and marketing sector will be able to deliver on its fullest potential for the Irish economy.<br/><br/><b></b>Ireland&rsquo;s sustainability credentials in milk production, being measured through the Bord Bia sustainable dairy assurance scheme on every dairy farm, and promoted through the Origin Green campaign, must be given the fullest recognition in Paris at the COP later this year.<br/><br/>Liquid milk is facing a particular challenge.  One of our team today is our national liquid milk chairman, Mr. Teddy Cashman.  He has invited the members to the launch of the IFA Liquid Milk Handbook later this week, and can talk to members later on of the particular concerns we have on the sustainability of specialist, contracted liquid milk suppliers in the post-quota era.  Expansion opportunities do not exist outside of exportable milk, and with intrinsically higher feed and labour costs in delivering milk counter-seasonally, there is a real need to reassess payment structures and regulation within the liquid milk chain to secure fresh, locally produced milk supplies for a sector worth over &euro;500 million at retail level.<br/><br/>I will hand back to IFA President, Mr. Eddie Downey.</p></speech>

The difficult situation we are experiencing right now, and will be experiencing for some months, will improve as markets rebalance and prices recover.  With the correct suite of instruments and policies available to them to opt into, farmers can learn to better manage this extreme volatility.  We also need delivery in Paris later this year of legal changes recognising our sustainable grass-based milk production system to make sure we are not unfairly restricted from expanding under climate change regulation.  In the race to expand for export, we must not ignore or take for granted our domestic market, especially our liquid milk market.</p></speech>

This is obviously a vitally important area as we have come out of the era of quotas.  I think quotas were in place for approximately 32 years.  Many farmers viewed the end of the quota era as an opportunity to invest, getting away from the super levy culture and moving into investment.  The financial crisis came and had a major impact, which was touched on in the presentation.  Intervention and production opportunities were also touched on.</p><p>Unfortunately, the dairy industry produces a commodity and one is dealing with the markets.  All the markets are volatile.  In the US, there is the change in the interest rate and the Chinese market has gone through the floor, all of which are having an impact right across the board.  In the most recent milk auction in New Zealand, prices were up 16%.  However, 16% of a very low price is not a great deal.</p><p>The demographics of the world population present great opportunities.  Incidentally, the European population up to 2050 will fall by approximately 50 million.  Most of that increase in population will be in the emerging markets or in Third World countries.  The population growth will be most evident in places like Syria and Iraq.  There will be opportunities but it is about getting to those markets.  </p><p>The<i>Journal of Agricultural Economics </i>has looked at the difficulties dairy farmers are experiencing in Ireland, in particular investment opportunities which are being lost as a consequence of no finance being available.  A paper by Conor O'Toole and Carol Newman in that journal examined the challenges dairy farmers are facing, in particular smaller and medium sized dairy farmers as a result of having no reserves in place and not being able to withstand the current challenge which the larger farmer might be able to withstand.  They called for policy intervention at Government level, similar to the call from the IFA, that is, for the Government to get tough with the banking sector and to provide some level of fluidness in regard to being able to lend to the dairy industry as an industry with growth potential in the Irish economy.  That has to happen.  Some form of Government-sponsored or European Investment Bank loans  may be the only alternative to a fluid banking sector.  Do the delegates have a view on what can be done by way of policy intervention in that regard?  Do they have suggestions or recommendations?</p><p>Do the delegates have views in relation to the EU market mechanisms, such as intervention, export refund or private storage aid, which was introduced and then taken away in September?  They mentioned the possibility of intervention.  Intervention may be required but obviously it will lead to difficulties with storage and so on.  However, one would hope that when the markets improve, one could sell on the product.</p><p>What about the export refunds?  Does the delegation believe that it would form part of a solution at European level under the regulation and the protocols available to Commissioner Hogan?    </p><p> No one envisaged the price volatility in the dairy sector - in fact, the price has dropped off the cliff.  The price has gone from a high of 43 cent to about 29 cent.  According to Bord Bia's figures, the average price per litre is lower than that at the moment.  The price was rising from June 2014 but since January 2015, it has fallen off the cliff.   Quotas have obviously played a role in the price drop. </p><p> In a nutshell, will the delegation identify the two or three main solutions, from a public policy point of view, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine implement?  What solutions does price volatility call for?  Will the delegation explain its solutions in a nutshell so that the committee can use its resources to ample potential to try to raise these issues?  There are approximately 200 dairy farmers in my own county of Donegal.  This issue has affected a lot people who invested heavily in this sector because they expected that the abolition of quotas would bring about financial rewards.  Unfortunately, many of the smaller or medium sized dairy farmers will go to the wall unless there is some form of intervention at a policy level, whether using European tools or in regard to banking, and the economics back this up.  In regard to banking, one will only borrow from the banks if one seeks to invest.  Why would anyone invest in a sector if there is no policy support for a three-year or five-year period?  I would like to hear the thoughts of the delegation on my points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#Y00200"><p>I welcome the delegation from the IFA.  We spoke about the sheep farmer being the poor relation with the previous delegation but as a dairy farmer, I know what it is like to be the poor relation at the moment.  This time last year, in advance of the abolition of the quotas, I was one of the first to suggest we produce a report at the beginning of the year, following consultation with all of the stakeholders.  That was very important.</p> <p>  I disagree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill when he said that most dairy farmers did not expect a huge drop in prices.  I felt there was an expectation, but perhaps I was living in dreamland, that even though the long-term outlook was quite positive, the short-term outlook would be difficult.  As has been said here again, what was said at the time was that there were opportunities and challenges going forward.  The biggest challenges existed last year.  In my opinion, the superlevy situation was the biggest challenge.  This year we were faced with the biggest superlevy bill to come our way in quite a number of years.  That bill was the biggest challenge we faced in the short-term because the people who had invested heavily would be the same people who would have to pay back the superlevy.  </p> <p>  There are still massive opportunities.  During the summer or late spring, I attended the opening of a new Glanbia facility in Belview in south Kilkenny, as I am sure some of the delegates did.  Some people might say it is in Waterford but it is in south Kilkenny.  A point was made that day which I will not forget for a long time.  I think it was Mr. John Moloney who made the point that there are 75 milk producers in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, who will over the next period put an extra &euro;10 million into the local economy of Ballyragget due to the extra milk they will produce.  That is a huge financial contribution to make to a local area.  That is the positive side of the development but there are challenges as well.  It is important to note that there are plenty of small areas with 75 milk producers that can develop in the same way over the next period.</p> <p>  As I said at the start of my contribution, we produced a report last March.</p><p>We brought in all the main stakeholders, the IFA, their colleagues in the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the banks, processors and so on.  The dairy forum was up and running last week, which is very important.  It was probably born as a result of our deliberations at the time.  It is important to review where we are now in light of our report.  Before this meeting, I suggested that over the next few weeks, we should bring in all the stakeholders again, particularly the banks.  They have a huge part to play.  Several new producers are coming into the system now, such as young farmers, who may have borrowed heavily and will require assistance.  Someone suggested payment holidays or extending payment plans.  This time last year, I attended a Bank of Ireland briefing in advance of the abolition of quotas.  The bank was very proactive in telling us what it had on offer and that it would be able to handle volatility in the future.  I am not certain that is happening.  The dairy farmers I talk to are not entirely happy that what was promised last year has been delivered.  We need to investigate that.  There is only so much we can do in Ireland on this issue.  We are now playing with the big boys in the world market and we will have to get used to that.  We will have to get our house in order before we can play away.  </p><p> Twenty years ago we were getting 20 cent per of milk but now we are getting 26 or 27 cent.  The cost of production has increased by 50% in those 20 years.  That is why we must look at where the costs are and what we can do to reduce those costs.  Energy costs have increased a great deal, although they have reduced a little in recent times.  We must analyse where those costs come from and whether we can produce milk more efficiently.  Milk farmers are very efficient and produce a very efficient product but we must analyse that 50% again and how it can be pared back.</p><p> That is why I think it is important to have the processors in as well, when we have the opportunity.  Are they in a position to give a better price for milk?  They will probably say "No", but we must see what exactly they can do.  Our report mentioned the New Zealand lesson and people mentioned this from time to time and the Northern Ireland lesson.  We must learn lessons from them.  New Zealand was in a similar position to us 20 or 25 years ago, producing probably the same amount of milk as we did pre-quota and the prices went through the roof.  There have been serious consequences there, such as animal welfare and mental health issues.  Farmers there did not go down the efficiency road and analyse where the costs arose.  We must learn from that.  There was a similar situation in Northern Ireland.  There are obviously issues that can be dealt with at European level, which would be very helpful.  The package of measures that was announced was helpful to a certain extent, as was bringing forward the 75% of the single farm payment.  The downside of that, however, is that there is only 25% left at the end of the year, making coming into springtime challenging.  There are pros and cons.  There are huge challenges but there are also huge opportunities.</p></speech>

I saw when the quotas went up in springtime last year, the huge investment people made and it is vitally important the banks do not put pressure on farmers.  When things look good, the bankers are out there willing to throw out their money but when some little thing happens, they put the pressure on and want to call that money back in.</p><p>This a time to be reasonable with people and to give them an opportunity to get over this little difficulty they face.  With our current strong, positive outlook, there is a chance for the future.  The banks should not tighten up on farmers at this time.  I have spoken to farmers who are experiencing serious cash flow problems, particularly small farmers who do not turn over much milk.  Many farmers use their co-operatives where they sell their milk to get their feed and so on.  In June and July, they had small cheques coming in.</p><p> It is crucial that the EU intervention price be increased.  There was an opportunity to do that and it should be examined again.  The &euro;500 million aid package will be a help and, as Deputy Deering said, providing 75% of basic payment is welcome but when we get to December and January, farmers will be in difficulty because that is the time they need money as the spring approaches and they have to spend a great deal of money on feed and so on.  The outlook is good but there will be a difficulty for the next few months and it has to be managed for farmers.</p></speech>

It is important that we ensure that the industry continues to grow at a sustainable level and that farmers can make money.  We received a briefing document before the meeting, the first line of which is a post by Oliver Moran on Ireland, which is on the Agricultural and Rural Convention website.  He states: "Having had a massive economic crash in 2008, one driven in part by an unsustainable property bubble, Ireland seems to be rushing headlong into another potential troubling bubble called milk."  While the prices over the past few years were not unsustainable and it was great that everybody benefitted, five or six years ago, milk was 18 cent a litre.  We are relying on a world market.  The price of a barrel of oil is currently less than $50 a barrel whereas it cost almost $200 a barrel less than 18 months ago.</p> <p>  We need to examine how we provide support to ensure people remain in the industry.  When we joined the EEC, people over-extended in the late 1970s with their investments and banks took possession of their farms eventually.  We cannot allow that to happen again.  As Oireachtas Members, we can make statements and lobby the Minister but when the IFA, as the main farming organisation, meets the banks, it  must ensure they are honest and truthful in the way they deal with farmers.  They extended the hand of friendship, brought them in and gave them the money they wanted.  As Deputy Deering said, when bank officials appeared before the committee to discuss the expansion of the dairy industry, they could see problems coming down the line.  The briefing document refers to the European Milk Board and reports from France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Germany and even New Zealand highlighting problems.  I hope these are short-term problems but the Russian situation is causing a major issue for the dairy industry while China's lack of economic growth is causing another issue.  We have opened all the markets we can and farmers cannot deliver more efficiencies.  We have the most efficient dairy farmers in the world at this stage and that has been borne out by Teagasc figures.  Farmers have delivered the efficiencies and it is now up to us, as legislators, and the co-operatives, which are controlled by shareholders, to make sure the primary producer is not squeezed.  In every agricultural sector, the retailer is taking the profit and we have to change that.</p> <p>  Senator Comiskey mentioned the supports the EU Commission has provided for the dairy industry and he said he would like an increase in the intervention price.</p><p>The price is now 22 cent per litre.  If we increase it to 35 or 36 cent, it will make the co-ops lazy.  They would see they had a level at which they could sell into the market at 25 or 26 cent and, accordingly, would not try to market it.  We must ensure all markets are exploited.  It is all about efficiencies.  Regarding the banks, we cannot see people who are overextended being closed down.  I hope this is only a minor blip and the view is that the price will return.  It might not return to the level of 43 or 44 cent a litre, but if it gets to 30 or 31 cent, it will be all about efficiencies.  As farmers have geared up for higher production, they are producing more, perhaps at a better price.  We have the most efficient dairy farmers in the world such that they cannot cut their costs anymore.  We must, therefore, ensure the cost of imports such as fertilisers and oil is not allowed to rise in the world market.</p><p> The Government has supported agriculture for several years, particularly in the past two budgets through the farm partnership scheme and tax breaks.  I agree that farmers should be allowed in their tax income to put funds away in good years for investment in poor years.  The Department of Finance has to examine that issue.</p></speech>

The Chairman anticipated it well.  We heard from the Irish Dairy Board, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, Teagasc and other interested parties.  I remember saying at the time that the Food Harvest 2020 proposal to increase milk production by 50% was ambitious and that one had to hasten slowly.  I was warning people who had no knowledge of the dairy industry to be wary of getting stuck into it.  That warning was prescient.  We understand what it is like for efficient farmers.  What must it be like now for those who are inexperienced?</p> <p>  The average price of milk last year was 38 cent per litre because of various world factors.  In New Zealand there was a drought in 2012 that led to a large price increase.  In 2013 there was a drought in America, with a cold snap in the European Union.  It is a function of the market.  Demand rises because of various events which are mainly weather-related.  The Fonterra Co-operative Group in New Zealand had warned about price volatility and I was not surprised at the turn of events in the price of milk.  It is a global issue.  Production expanded because of various events which, as I said, were mostly weather-related.  Then the market and consumer preferences changed.  There was a downturn in the Chinese economy, which resulted in a decline in demand in China for milk.  It is important, therefore, that the marketing bodies and processors continue to sell Irish milk in the way they did before.  I recall when the committee was dealing with the issue of milk prices that we had the banks in.  They are offering all sorts of financial product.  I am always concerned about people who come offering incentives, which is grand on a fine day.  However, it is on the cold day when one has no shelter, that one needs help.  </p> <p>  Questions were being asked about how we should pay the superlevy fine which was &euro;100 million but which was reduced to &euro;60 million, thanks to the appeals system.  The banks made all sorts of suggestion such as having prompt pay systems.</p><p>They were going to do the devil and all.  Bank of Ireland had set aside a fund of &euro;1 billion to assist in meeting the 2020 targets and wondered why nobody was using the AgriFlex loan facility.  Farmers in Ireland have a very low level of debt in comparison to their counterparts in other European countries.  The banks had various suites of financial options for farmers but the only point they put forward with which I agreed was that dairy farmers should take a "better-before-bigger" approach when considering expansion.  I think that was a key point.  I do not know which of the banks said that.</p></speech>

Before one expands, one should consider how efficient one is at that point in time.  That is a very important lesson.  Another issue relates to forward selling.  With markets are in their current state, however, it is very hard to engage in such selling.</p> <p>  In my view the banks must give farmers some type of holiday to work through the situation.  In the context of tax, the Government is obliged to take income averaging and various other issues with which farmers are faced into account.  We need short-term solutions to address what, I hope, are short-term problems.  That is the issue.  Some things have been done.  I agree with Deputy Deering that it is all right having what one intended to get brought forward but that leaves a very lean period at the end of the year.  In farming circles generally, that period is already quite lean.</p> <p>  Well done to our guests for the points made in the presentation.  We can certainly pursue a number of issues.  Deputy Deering has made a proposal - on which I know the Chairman will follow through - that we should again invite some of the bodies, in particular the banks, to appear before the committee to see what they can do.  If there are policy issues that we can pursue with the Government, we will not be found wanting.  Now that people are in difficulties, we must focus on the financial institutions, even in the short term, in order that we might help them in the context of cash flows.</p></speech>

I am aware of an issue that will be raised in respect of the report.  We invited Ornua - the new name under which the Irish Dairy Board operates - Teagasc, Bord Bia and the banks to make presentations.  We were under time constraints because we wished to publish our report before 1 April.  The other factor was the super levy and the opening up of the markets which had been well flagged in advance by all the farm organisations.  A decision was taken to use that information as a platform to bring in the other witnesses.  We felt at the time, and I take full responsibility for it, there was no need to invite the farm organisations because we felt we had the information that we needed and were under time constraints.  I hope the IFA will take that point on board.  We have never ever shirked from bringing in farming organisations.  Lest that be an issue for any of the witnesses present, I want to clarify the point before I invite them to speak.</p></speech>

A major opportunity has come along for farmers who have been operating with their hands behind their backs for 30 years.  Farmers could not expand their enterprises.  We came late to the European Union from that point of view and, therefore, we were disadvantaged.  In the intervening period, farmers in New Zealand increased output four times over while we stood still.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  The removal of the milk quota has made no difference to the price.  The price has increased by 0.8%.  That is not the issue.  As was quite rightly pointed out, what have affected us are global changes such as, for example, those in the financial sector, what has happened in China and America, falling oil prices and, of course, the Russian ban.  We trade in a commodity which must be traded at a world price.   It is how we manage the givens in the market and get it to deliver a sustainable situation for the family farm units here that is at issue.  We pride ourselves on our family farm units.  We do not want to see them disappear, nor do we want them to become huge units.  We want to continue to have family farms.  That is why we put forward our policy.</p><p> Everyone has identified the banking system as being critically important, which it is, but we need flexibility in it.  Every time I met the banks, I made it clear that we want sensible lending to farmers.  We want the lending stress-tested properly and we want to know if the farmers will be able to make the repayments.  We have no ambition to end up with a situation such as that in New Zealand, where debt levels have gone through the roof, or the Netherlands, where debt levels are at &euro;18,000 per cow, which is unsustainable.  We do not want to arrive at such a point, lumbering our family farmers with that type of debt level.</p><p> We need a sensible approach to lending.  However, there is also a responsibility to manage the loans sensibly.  The banking system has to provide more flexibility to deal with short-term problems.  No one built a milking parlour for one year.  I do not like it when a farmer starts jumping up and down saying he is going to go broke.  My view is very simple.  The farmer built a milking parlour for 20 or 30 years.  We want parlours to be built for 20 or 30 years and we want sustainable industry.   I met a man at the ploughing championships.  He told me he is after taking out a lease on land at &euro;300 an acre for the next ten years.  He says that the milk price is going to break him but his problem is not the milk price.  We need to get that message back to farmers and I will happily live with that.  We also have to get the message back to the farmers on the ground to be sensible with the measures they take.  </p><p> The other big issue is volatility.  We have proposals in our budget submission.  We need to examine them and see if we can get something that works sensibly, which will allow a farmer, if there is a good year, to put a few euro aside in a tax account or wherever and bring it back in later.  No tax will be foregone because the averaging system will take it out of it in any event.  Let us allow the farmer the power to manage his business and use it in the most efficient way.  I think that can be done. </p><p> Another big issue raised concerns oil prices, which are down.  Grain prices are also down.  Is this a short-term problem?  How long will we be seeing low prices?  The problem is that grain prices continue to be low.  When grain prices are low, American farmers drive milk production and will continue to do so.  They also have forward contracts for milk, which will potentially elongate this problem.  Political intervention is required.  There has been a complete failure on the part of Commissioner Hogan and his team to examine the intervention system.  They keep telling us that it will take eight to nine months before they review the system and are at the other end of it.  We need to start that eight or nine month process.  This should have happened and we should be two months or so into it already.  Everyone in this room has stated this fact already but the key point is that this is a commodity which is being traded by commodity traders.</p><p> Commodity traders do not come into a market when a price has fallen.  They stand back.  By not looking at intervention, the signal has been given that we are going to allow the price to fall.  If we had put our hands up and said we were going to look at the intervention system, the signal would have been clearly given that there is a floor and that we had better get back in and buy the product we want for the next number of months.  Traders would have re-engaged.  That is the position that should have been taken and why there has been such a failure.  It is not that intervention would have had a huge effect.  There would not have been a huge buy-in or laziness on the part of the co-operatives to buy into the intervention system at an increased price from where that intervention is as of now.  The markets are stronger than it.  We want the intervention system and the prices to take account of the current cost structures.  It is as simple as that.  We want that put in place.  </p><p> The cost of doing business, including the costs of energy and fertiliser, is another issue.  Four major companies control the fertiliser market.  Is there a cartel in operation?  The market has four major companies and a levy, which protects one major player, on imports into Europe.  This is crying out to be examined.  One major company in Europe is protected by a levy to stop other product coming in.  This is manipulation of the marketplace which is placing extra costs on farmers and needs to be examined.  </p><p> Investment, banking and flexibility are important issues but farmers must take responsibility as well.  We cannot simply say that the industry is wrong or that the price is wrong.</p><p>Farmers have to make good solid investment and that means having good quality advice from Teagasc.  Farmers have to be advised of the level and the cost of borrowing at which they can operate.  The co-operatives need to be efficient and farmers together with the co-operatives need to co-operate in generating more efficiencies.  Given the size of the milk pool, there are certainly question marks over the number of co-operatives.</p><p> Russia made a political decision to stop the export of European products into Russia.  It was a political decision to put that ban in place.  The consequences of that political decision are clearly being felt on family farm units all over Europe, particularly in eastern Europe.  The political system in Europe needs to stand up and take responsibility for that and make good decisions.  The failure on intervention stands out as a failure.</p><p> It was AIB bank which came up with the phrase "Better before Bigger".  We are absolutely clear that is how it should be.  If a farmer cannot make money with 50 cows, he should not have 200 cows.  Farmers should start and get the processes right and then build up from that point.  We want to build the industry.  It involves sensible banking, good control of costs and Government intervention by way of taxation and other supports.</p><p> My colleague Mr. O'Leary will add to my contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#EE00200"><p>The president has covered many points.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned in his contribution that dairy farming is a commodity business.  Largely that it is true.  As an exporting nation we find ourselves more exposed than other countries.  However, it is not just a commodity business and Ornua has been working on developing the brand - developing the Kerrygold brand - and moving it up the value chain.  That investment which had already taken place did in some ways shield us from the worst effects of the fall in milk prices.  The effects of the fall in prices happened faster in Europe and in New Zealand where they had a higher cost base.  To a degree, as has been said around this table and in the report, volatility was not a surprise.  It will always be part and parcel of milk production.  The timing was a surprise, with the quick fall from the high prices down to the current price level.</p> <p>  Teagasc has said that one third of dairy farmers will lose money in production this year.  The fall in prices in the middle of an expansion phase is the major part of the problem.  Farmers invested from cash flow, maybe through lack of the financial products.  This was obviously a mistake, as investment should be longer-term.  A number of issues have made this problem worse.  The valley of the trough went lower and is lasting longer than we expected.  It is not the normal 12 months to 18 months cycle of highs and lows.  That is another lesson for which we have to plan.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked what we were going to do about that level of volatility.  The president referred to solutions to deal with volatility.  What has also helped some farmers in some processor areas is the ability to lock in margin.  Glanbia has done this.  Other co-operatives have developed fixed price contracts, not tying in the margin.</p> <p>  What we were pushing for at the forum was that the Minister would push the industry toward looking at further long-term volatility coping solutions.  We are a small country in the overall scheme, however, we have a number of plus factors and our structure is good in terms of farmer ownership.  We have the power and we have to push it in terms of getting co-operatives working closer together and developing products.  Initiatives are being taken by Ornua in terms of developing a hedging index, which will allow farmers to consider hedging as well as developing products so that they can hedge forward at an industry level and by extension tie in milk price over a period.  That will give farmers some security.  That is not for everybody.  All of these options come at a cost and we cannot lose sight of that.  However, when farmers who are heavily exposed in the level of debt they carry, and the new entrants in particular, can tie down their input costs and the margin in general it will give them a far greater coping mechanism.</p><p>This is something we have to measure.  </p><p> Referring briefly to the issue of intervention, the Commissioner has taken a steadfast position against it.  He has said to leave the market do its work and that we will be out of the downside more quickly.  We have stated consistently that there should be a review of emergency levels and have called for a review.  The Commissioner has said such a process will take too long.  There will be another volatility crisis in the next number of years followed by others.  It is provided in legislation that the EU must review the intervention levels to reflect the costs of production and the market at a point in time.  We need this to happen.  This is not just about the response but is something that has to happen and will bear fruit further down the line.  </p><p> I will not deal with the issue of the retailer and the middleman and who gets the margin, which is more Mr. Cashman's area, except to say the milk sector would be more exposed to the problem.  Mr. Downey has dealt with most of the other issues.  Mr. Cashman might deal with the issue of liquid milk and where the margin goes, which is an area that has to be examined. </p></speech>

Our biggest problem with it is that it did not go far enough in terms of having an Ombudsman, as is the case in the UK.  Below-cost selling is also not banned any more.  Those kinds of instruments are helpful to keep things in line.  I have stated in the past that we need legislation and not aspirations to make these things work.  We have heard many aspirations but have not seen enough done on the legislative front to ensure they are realised.  This is about fairness.  When we speak of the product chain in Ireland or any other market, there is the retailer, the processor and the farmer.  We are farmer representatives but it is fair to say that each link in that chain needs to be paid.  Money is being transferred and the economics work through the economy for that to happen.  We are looking for a clear portion of the retail price to be passed back to the farmer to ensure our costs of production are covered and we can make a margin.  We do not begrudge others in the chain their margins or their businesses but we need enough to keep us alive and to ensure there is fairness in the system.  What was introduced in the retail legislation in Ireland has not gone far enough.  Commissioner Hogan has made noises around this issue at a European level.  I attended a National Milk Agency meeting today.  One of the issues the chairman raised at the meeting was how prices for dairy products have crashed so hard across Europe and in fairly mature retail markets such as France, Germany and the Netherlands.  A huge amount of the produce of those countries is sold to big home populations.  We have a low population relative to our dairy output and are largely an exporting nation.  Those other countries would not face the same scenario.  There has been a certain amount of use or abuse or whatever way one might want to describe it of the situation by the retail sector to gain more margin.  The sector has been opportunistic in some markets.</p> <p>  When it comes to the retail scenario, my view is that this concerns fairness.  As a matter of fairness, there should be proper remuneration at every point along the chain.  Farmers carry the greatest cost.  We also return possibly the most to the economy because we source our raw materials here.  Unlike foreign direct investment, to a large extent, all the input costs come from the Irish economy.  The money is transferred around the economy and benefits everyone.  The same scenario applies to the 75 farmers in Ballyragget mentioned earlier.</p><p>In the context of the retail scenario, it is about fairness and having proper legislation in place because aspiration does not work and what is required must be properly legislated for.  The legislation does not go far enough.  We need to support European legislation to create fairness in the context of that scenario.</p></speech>

Part of the scenario is the margins the retailers are taking.  I have not seen any feedback on an initiative that was introduced, although the IFA may have got some on it.  We saw the pressure English farmers were under with their milk prices.  Morrisons, one of the largest retailers in the UK, made a token gesture, whereby they provided an option for their customers when buying milk off their shelves to pay the farmer 10 pence more.  I do not know what the response to that initiative has been.  Under my colleague's chairmanship, we published a comprehensive report on the retail section in this area.  Commissioner Hogan was mentioned.  This area is part of his priority and I hope there will be an investigation into the retail sector, especially into below cost selling.  Morrisons made a token gesture in giving their customers the option to pay 10 pence more for 1 litre or 2 litres of liquid milk on their shelves, which would support the local farmers.  I do not know what was the uptake of that initiative.  Has the IFA done any research on that?</p></speech>

I would not support it.  In the British scenario, there are aligned contracts in England.  The Tesco, Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury contracts are linked into the costs of production, and have been for the past few years, and they are a much more sustainable system.  I do not agree with them entirely but they are a better system than what Morrisons were supporting.  They only came about eight or nine years ago because there was a sense that there would not be enough milk in UK to supply the liquid milk market there.  It was a response to dumping down and people getting out of milk production at the time.  It was a cynical gesture.  I cannot give the Senator figures as to the take-up of that initiative because they are hard to get.</p></speech>

A large swathe of the EU market supports were done away in 2007 or at the end of the previous Common Agricultural Policy, the one that has just finished.  The situation prior to that was that, by and large, we had a global market with relatively low prices and an EU market with much higher prices.  The logic of the export refund measure was that one was bridging the gap between the two, but that is no longer the case.  Today, skim milk powder and whole milk powder prices would be similar for such products coming out of the EU for export, and also, for example, on the Global Dairy Trade, which, incidentally, this afternoon went up another 9.9%, so markets are righting themselves, as we speak.  They have a way to go, as was pointed out, but they are going in the right direction.  However, it is cyclical.</p> <p>  We no longer have a budget for market supports at European level.  We now have to tap into the so-called crisis fund.  Such a fund can only be generated out of a levy on farmers' basic payments.  I would have some reservations about export refunds in terms of how useful they can be at present.  The current Common Agricultural Policy does not do a great deal to address the issue of volatility.  There is much more work to be done around providing information that can be used through the milk market observatory to establish indices and to do the kind of thing that can be done by the USDA in the United States, namely, providing hedging mechanisms and options that are readily and simply available to farmers.  The Commission should take an interest in this area.  For all sorts of the WTO-related reasons, I do not think we will see export refunds being relevant again, particularly in the context of their being no fund for them.</p></speech>

To return to the competition legislation which was briefly mentioned earlier, as was pointed out we did a good deal of work on producing that report which made a number of recommendations.  However, the legislation does not go far enough.  We should go down the road taken by the English but it must tie into the overall European context.</p><p>The vast majority of our multiples are European based.  Would the volume of milk in supermarkets make a difference in this context?  If one were to buy a litre of milk today, one would pay the same price as one would have paid for it this time last year.  The volume of milk in supermarkets is quite small in the overall context of what farmers produce.  The vast majority of our milk products, be it milk power or other products, are exported.  </p><p> Have our guests any comment to make on the suggestion that the price of milk has bottomed out?  We all like to think it has and that there will be a gradual increase in the milk prices in the next period, although nobody can know or guarantee this.  What is our guests' opinion on the perception that the price of milk has bottomed out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-06a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100600002#HH00300"><p>We look to New Zealand because that is where the price became the lowest most quickly and that was how it stayed for quite a while.  What has been said for some time is that the prices being paid for milk were below the cost of production and that they were unsustainable.  New Zealand was more exposed than other countries in that it was exposed to the Chinese market and when that market was closed, it found itself in difficulty.  There have been four positive GDT auctions in New Zealand.  Obviously, the volumes are a little lower, but it was working hard to try to change sentiment, which is what we were seeking to do in Europe through the use of intervention measures.  Sentiment plays such a strong roll in the market and it has changed.  We have seen spot prices climb week on week in Europea.  Last week they were up, on average, about &euro;30 a tonne across the product range, with the exception of cheese.  The market has, therefore, turned around.  The next job is to get milk prices to rise.</p> <p>  To return to the issue of contracts, their duration and so forth, it has saved us to a degree with prices coming down.  It is the lag effect, but it will probably work against us if prices start to rise.  From talking to farmers at the national ploughing championships two weeks ago - members will have heard this also - they are looking to seeing the price start to change next spring resulting in a positive sentiment.  I hope that will be reflected in a positive vibe in the market.  </p> <p>  In the other big market, the US market, an increase in production in the region of 1.4% on an annual basis is what is being talked about.  Demand is increasing in that market also.  The currency factor is a plus for us.  </p> <p>  The culling rate in New Zealand is quite high.  A reduction in the region of 6%, 7% or 8% in this production year is being talked about.  If that were to happen, we would see lower production.  The overhang of product and the likes of the APS introduced by the Commissioner can play into this also.  We will see a gradual price increase, the bottom having been reached, but nobody is saying it will be immediate, rather it will be slow.  If farmers receive that positive message, they will react with more confidence.  Despite what many have said, I do not think farmers jumped headlong into it.  They took account of what was going to happen and what their capacity was within the farmgate to expand.  There was pent-up frustration having been held back for 30 years, but, by and large, the plans made over a period a time will stand up to the pressure.</p><p>The immediate pressure of cashflow in an expansion mode is something at which we must look.  Maybe the brakes have been put on a little bit by this price fall but I think the right supports have to kick in at the right times, that is, from Government, the banks and the processing industry, which has to get itself together in terms of efficiency and benchmarking.  With the monitor farms and the greenfield farms, farmers can measure efficiency and not everyone measures up.  Where are the efficiency and benchmarking measures within the processing industry and how does one processor measure up against another and against its international counterparts?  We need to put focus back on that.  Mr. Cashman will deal with the other issue on the price.</p></speech>

It is simple enough.  In Ireland, liquid milk is about 10% of the market.  The retail market for liquid milk is &euro;530 million or &euro;540 million.  It is a question of nurturing the market at home because we are among the biggest consumers of liquid milk in Europe and in the world.  The UK, Scandinavia, Ireland and probably Australia are the biggest consumers of liquid milk in the world.  What one has, one holds and nurtures.  It expands into the world after that in that if people nurture and appreciate the market at home, it is much easier to sell abroad and bring people in here as well.  A buy-in from the whole community is important.  It might not be as tangible from the financial point of view but what is done at home must also be projected in sales abroad.  There are two issues around it.</p></speech>

We are heading into a very dodgy area with liquid milk.  I do not have to tell the witnesses this.  It is not a very profitable business.  We could be facing a situation where in a number of years, we will not have fresh milk to put on our corn flakes in the morning.  That is probably a fact.  It may be a scary fact but unless it is nurtured properly, to use Mr. Cashman's words, by all concerned, that could be the scenario.</p></speech>

Many of those issues are pretty well covered in the document.  It is useful from that perspective to lay out the issues around it.  I think that covers it.</p></speech>

Mr. Cashman touched on the issue of 10%.  The sheep are divided and so is the dairying but it is much more imbalanced.  That is critical.  It is interesting what was said about the incentives that were put into the British liquid milk system to prevent the scare of not having fresh milk available.  It may seem inconceivable here but it is still possible.  I am aware that Deputy Deering is actively involved in this.  I am quite taken by the suggestion to devise a suite of long-term volatility coping solutions.  That is something at which we should look.  Only a Corkman could come out with that but it is very good and I think it is something-----</p></speech>

There is a lot behind that.  On the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill, which I hasten to add we asked the IFA in to discuss, we were staunchly in favour of legislation underpinning the Ombudsman.  We have been told the regulations are ready to be published and the implementation of what is there should be a good step.  We will see if it is enough but if it is not, I think it will have to be led by Europe.  A previous Commissioner, Mr. Ciolo, put, for the first time, a reference to the producer organisations into the CAP to give power to the producers to negotiate without having to fear the Competition Authority, as it was in the past, and which the witnesses are aware of.  From that point of view, there is work to be done.</p><p> We should not forget the liquid milk producers.  Ironically, it is the one the consumer in Ireland is most familiar with but almost takes for granted because the milk is on the shelves, yet it is probably the most vulnerable at the moment.  It certainly needs to be watched.  Sometimes it is the fear of loss that spurts some kind of initiative, which seemingly happened in Britain.  That is something that we should keep an eye on as well.  </p><p> The State-aid rules have been referred to.  It would be interesting to see how France got around that and whether there was a certain trigger point, when the price hits a certain level above that, from which a fund is extracted directly rather than from the farm profits from the price of the milk, and put into a holding fund that triggers back in as a support when it gets below a certain point.  Maybe that is because such a process does not constitute State rules and is actually farmer funded directly.  There might be a way around that.  The other issues were the contracts, in particular, for liquid milk and a recognised percentage margin which should be backed up by the legislation and regulations from the Government.  </p><p> We will bring in the banks and if we have time, depending on what happens, we will bring in Ornua and Bord Bia as well.  They are important players from the point of view of a long-term industry.  This industry will be the main driver of the Irish agri-food sector from the point of view of output and production, along with beef.  Certainly dairying is the one in which there is big room for expansion.</p></speech>

Some people might say at times that farmers need to be protected from themselves but I would reject that.  There were one or two funds introduced by some processors last year and that was used to support milk prices in recent times.  If some products or initiatives are introduced by processors, the important thing is that there is a transparent system, that farmers see that if money is there and is not being passed onto them directly, that it is put into an alternative fund and that it is transparent and does not reflect back on base milk price.  It is a question that some farmers are asking of their processors - the fund is put in place but is it then being used to subsidise a lower base milk price?  There is not the same situation in dairying as there is in beef with regard to farmers and processors but I think whatever systems will be put in place in future will have to be voluntary and transparent.  With the structure of farm ownership that we have in the industry it should be possible with whatever initiatives take place but the voluntary part has to be borne in mind.</p></speech>

If it has that scrutiny attached to it, that cannot happen.</p> <p>  This has been a very interesting meeting.  I hope all concerned agree.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Brendan Griffin, the director of licensing, and Mr. Keith Johnson, the director of marketing and membership.  I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee on the topic of our recently published report, The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy.</p> <p>  We commissioned Deloitte to undertake this study.  Consultations were conducted with IMRO members and with key industry representatives, including artists, labels, publishers, songwriters, management companies and retail and broadcast personnel.  The findings demonstrate real opportunities for the sector, which currently supports over 11,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;500 million annually to the Irish economy.</p> <p>  The report highlights a number of areas where action could be taken, including finance, market access, intellectual property, education, training and collaboration.  It outlines a number of recommendations, including: establishing a music industry task force with representatives from Government, the business community and industry to reinvigorate the sector and encourage collaboration; appointing what we have termed an "IP tsar" to consider the impact of intellectual property and copyright legislation and enforcement in both music and technology industries; the development of advanced training courses for music professionals to focus on the business of music education, particularly for early career musicians; greater collaboration among the music, tourism, gaming and technology sectors; greater support for musicians, many of whom are self-employed, in accessing finance and ensuring any fiscal supports are effective and appropriately structured; and the establishment of a music office, Music Ireland, to act as a focal point for the music industry, similar to the Irish Film Board, which would provide assistance to individuals in the music sector and those looking to enter new overseas markets.</p> <p>  These policy interventions have the potential to increase activity and jobs in the sector.  The music industry is fully committed to taking the lead on these initiatives but Government support remains crucial in terms of the speed at which progress can be made.  There is a will within the music industry to push forward but collaboration is the key if we are to maximise the positive effects on Ireland's reputation for culture and creativity.  We are happy to address any specific issues the Chairman or members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

I am delighted they have come before the committee because there is no doubt music is one of the most important industries we have at present.  In the context of tourism, it is huge.  One need only read the various surveys carried out over the years, in which people were asked what they did while they were in Ireland, to discover that the vast majority engage with music in some form, whether at a festival or a concert, in a pub or whatever.  There is also the community aspect of music, which plays an important role in strengthening people&rsquo;s morale and encouraging them in many other ways.  The statistic of 11,500 who gain employment through music is only a small part of its monetary aspect.  It does provide very important employment.</p> <p>  I compliment IMRO on the report.  It is exceptionally well done.  There has been wide consultation with all the partners involved in music.  There is no doubt that the message - not just the statistics but what IMRO hopes to achieve - is very well laid out.  What does IMRO see the task force, which is central to its vision for the future, doing?  Does it see it as an official or semi-official task force, possibly appointed by the Government?  All of that is important.</p> <p>  The almost 50% decrease in sales of recorded music in recent times is a huge challenge and has happened in a very short period.  Does IMRO feel the task force has a role to play in that regard?  The music offices are interesting as IMRO seems to be trying to give status or an official profile to the importance of the music industry.  At one point the report refers to the things we take for granted, which is quite right.  The witnesses might touch on that when they respond.  We do take for granted what is there.  If we were dealing with any other industry, whether construction or agriculture, it would be a constant topic of debate and discussion.  IMRO is right to try to bring music as a career and a community and broadcasting expression centre stage.  Do the witnesses think the task force is sufficient?</p> <p>  IMRO refers to financing and I presume that, as in all areas, it must set out its stall about where that is most needed.  I agree that up-and-coming artists make a very big decision and take a huge risk when setting out.  We all know of people who buy their first guitar or whistle and work away at home hoping that some day they will reach a stage where they will be accepted as important and develop a career.  Can something be done in that regard within the educational system?  Music forms an integral part of education but more often perceived as a cultural expression or a hobby.  Very often, guidance counsellors direct young people towards the type of employment they might consider.  Is there something within the educational system that might be of assistance in that context?  The manner in which IMRO has laid out the results of its survey and the report is quite graphic and straightforward.</p><p>The figures are clear, but Mr. Finn is requesting the committee to consider sending a recommendation to the appropriate Departments on the issues he has raised in order that they might be considered in a proactive way rather than leaving them on the long finger.</p></speech>

We would require representatives from at least three of these Departments.  The music industry and wider commercial expertise from outside it should also be available to the task force.  In, particular, the task force should comprise people from within the industry, together with representatives of the various Departments involved.  It should be time limited and not have an open-ended remit.  We believe that within a period of two and a half to three years it should be in a position to drive home most of the recommendations made in this report with the intention of having them become Government policy across the various Departments.  We are talking about a focused group, with industry and departmental experts working over a relatively short period.  It would provide strategic leadership and direction in tackling some of the main issues we have identified in the report.</p> <p>  The Senator rightly pointed to the significant fall in sales of recorded music, in particular in the past five to six years.  IMRO has been to the forefront in ensuring the licensing of new online services providing music, be it through streaming or downloading.  This makes music available to consumers in a form they want and at a time they expect.  That means that the creative community is receiving remuneration for the use of its work in the online environment, but that does not mean that all uses of music in the online environment are licensed.  In the report we have called for the appointment of what we have termed "an IP czar" who would be a copyright expert to lead policy in the area of intellectual property and copyright.  There are significant opportunities not just to follow but also to lead European policy in this regard.  </p> <p>  There are significant problems with the manner in which European copyright legislation is being implemented in member states.  The safe harbour provisions in the European copyright directive, for example, provide opportunities for those who wish to minimise their licensing fees to do so.  This is one area where we believe significant progress could be made.  The creative community is suffering because its remuneration has dropped alarmingly in the past five to seven years.  That is at the expense of large technology companies the income of which is entirely dependent on the use of creative works, but the commensurate level of remuneration for these works bears no relation to the use the companies derive from them.  Therefore, there needs to be a rebalancing of the remuneration of the creative sector compared to the benefits the technology industry generates.  This issue is high on the agenda in Brussels and Ireland could and should take a leading role in dealing with it.</p><p> We believe a music office would provide an opportunity to have more structured support for the music sector.  In many organisations, such as the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, First Music Contact and IMRO, funding is available for new entrants into the industry to break into overseas markets.  We believe if that was centred in one music office, in the same vein as the film board acts for film, it would be far more beneficial for new entrants into the industry and could lead to significant growth.  In many cases, the domestic market is not big enough to sustain a career in the music industry currently and many of our new entrants need opportunities for overseas earnings to subvent their income, especially at the start.  We would see a music office as possibly providing repayable grants over a period of time, depending on the levels of success.  We believe it would be self-funding.  Most of the recommendations in our report are not overly expensive in terms of draws on the Exchequer.</p><p> Financing is related to the point the Senator raised and also to the area of a music office.  The banking sector and some arms of the State engaged in promoting industry do not seem to understand the creative industries and how they deliver returns to the country not only in terms of copyright but through other invisible earnings.  The Senator rightly pointed out the benefits that accrue to tourism directly because of the availability and the popularity of music as an entertainment medium throughout the State.  Our tourism industry has grown substantially in recent years.  The principal reason many people come to Ireland - research has borne this out - is because of the entertainment value music provides them with when they arrive here.  The indirect benefits of music to the economy are also significant.  My colleague, Mr. Keith Johnson, will deal with the issue of education and training.</p></speech>

The report has highlighted that there is definite skills gap, particularly in the area of professional development for music professionals.  We note there is a requirement to bolster this area in order to give a gear change to the industry as we move forward.</p> <p>  In terms of the schools and third level, it is important to build on what is currently happening in schools and to have a better co-ordinated approach to music education.  It is not that this is not happening within the schools sector, it is just that very often there is not a co-ordinated approach and, in many cases, music is not seen as a viable career.  We want to foster a notion that there is a long-term career path and an expectation that one can develop a career in music.  Putting in place mentorship programmes for students would be an important aspect of any programmes that would emerge from any initiatives with which a music office might assist.  </p> <p>  We would also like there to be a greater contribution towards initiatives that encourage creativity through teaching at primary and post-primary levels.  The intention is to generate the idea that music is a viable career path and should not be seen simply as being a hobby.  Culturally, in Ireland, music is seen very much as something one does as hobby rather than something one pursues as a career path.</p></speech>

The Senator has already touched on many of the questions.  As a music lover myself and someone who loves going to concerts and festivals, as well as growing up in a pub, I understand the importance of music.  At home when I was younger, I would have been guilty, like everybody else, of streaming or downloading music and songs which is obviously a significant problem for the smaller artist, particularly Irish artists.  What does the Irish Music Rights Organisation see as its role in educating people of the damage that this does?  How would it encourage people not to do this?</p> <p>  There has been much change in film viewing over the past several years.  No longer do only television channels show movies but one has YouTube, Snapchat and other different social media formats which have made it easier for people to get involved.  This has also made it more difficult for people to make money and promote themselves.  How does IMRO see itself in the social media aspect of this?</p> <p>  The Government could do more to help.  In its report, IMRO stated the taking up of a number of its recommendations means it could increase its contribution for &euro;14 million to &euro;25 million.  Will the delegation expand on that?  Does it consider that Irish radio and television stations do enough to promote Irish music?</p></speech>

How pervasive is the extent of illegal downloading?  What is being done - or not done - to prevent that from happening?</p></speech>

I do not want to minimise the problem because it is still an issue but it is not as big a problem as it once was.  Some of the newer methods of distributing music online, for example streaming, are now fully licensed.  In the online area, we have adopted a three-pronged approach.  There is education, especially in the youth area with a schools programme, part of which highlights the importance of copyright and earnings for the creative community and, in particular, musicians.  The second stage is to ensure all services are licensed, as much as we can.  The third stage is enforcement.  If a provider is not licensed, we seek to have them licensed.</p> <p>  There are two tiers in how streaming works.  There is premium streaming where one pays a monthly membership fee to stream on a monthly basis.  Then there is free streaming which is supported by advertising.  Both are legal services.  The streaming services would like people to transfer to the premium model.  This model is delivering reasonable returns to copyright owners.  We are still in this evolving market where streaming services are trying to migrate people from the advertising model to the premium service model.  They are being slowly successful in that but it will take more time for it to bear more fruit for the creative community.</p> <p>  Side by side with that, one has services which allow access to music online where they are refusing to be licensed or they are what we would term under-licensed, in that they are claiming the exceptions available to them under the safe harbour provisions.  Some very large companies claim exceptions to copyright regarding many of these uses that go through their networks.  This continues to be an issue and needs to be addressed, not just at Irish level but at European level.</p><p> In relation to radio and the amount of airplay artists receive, we think that is an issue the task force would be ideally suited to address, once it is made up of industry experts and people from the relevant Departments.  It is one issue that could be addressed.  I would also add that given the development of downloading, streaming in particular, and curating of content on streaming services, radio continues to be very influential in discovering new artists, both online and on social media.  I agree that social media are also very important in that role; therefore, we should not just confine ourselves to concerning ourselves with the issue of radio.  That environment is also changing by the day, but, nonetheless, it is an important issue and something we would like to see a task force address at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It is important to emphasise that music is a business as well as being culture and education.  Reference was made to the more than 11,000 people involved in the industry and the capacity for further employment.  Putting it on what one could call a more regularised footing would be advantageous.</p> <p>  When one speaks about Irish music, perhaps the correct terminology is traditional music, but must people refer to it as Irish music?  There are many genres of Irish music, leading to folk and other types, but one thinks of Irish music in the context of the Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO.  Does IMRO represent people with recording labels?</p></speech>

IMRO is a voluntary organisation, but it is licensed for copyright music, as well as the other organisation.  Is there a transfer of people between the organisations because one starts off as an individual performer without a recording label?  Do artists stay with IMRO or do they leave if they get a recording contract?</p> <p>  There is no fee for membership of IMRO, but is everyone entitled to protection from it?  Do artists source IMRO or does it source them?  What is the membership like?</p> <p>  We take music for granted.  In addition to the economic benefit, there is a health benefit to music.  Recent research into Alzheimer's disease has shown the benefits of music and how taking up a musical instrument can help to prevent Alzheimer's disease.  The benefits are so good, but the information does not get the airplay it deserves.  Music is important in the economic sphere and enterprise, but it should also be considered from the health perspective.  It is taken for granted.</p> <p>  We all know that tourists go to Irish pubs, but they do not even have to come to Ireland to hear Irish music because the concept of the Irish pub has travelled, as has Irish music.  I compliment Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s group, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, and the support it provides for traditional Irish musicians.  A plan for Irish music is required and the task force is necessary.  The Chairman said he would look further at the recommendation that a task force be set up.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the tax exemption to be spread over a period of years.  I presume the proposal has already been sent to the Minister for Finance.  One could have a great three or four months in one year, but it might not be the same in the next year.  That is a matter that should be examined, in addition to having a music office.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Finn clarify the position on people who transfer from being represented by a label to being represented by IMRO?</p></speech>

Such artists are also entitled to royalties from Phonographic Performance Ireland, PPI, which is the representative body for the record labels.  If the artist is own-label, he or she would be entitled to join both PPI and IMRO concurrently.  There are separate rights and the artist would receive separate payments in respect of them.  Many artists now release on their own labels and are, effectively, SMEs; it is a small cottage industry for them.  They are entitled to join both organisations.</p><p> I agree on the health benefits issue.  We deliberately themed the discussion around the social and economic benefits of music.  The health benefits are certainly well documented in research.  I thank the Senator for bringing that to our attention. </p><p> We have asked for the artist's exemption to be evened out over a period of years rather than it having to be availed of in any one given year.  The earnings from an album, for example, can occur over a period of three, four or five years and it would be a fairer exploitation of the exemption that is available, especially to up-and-coming artists.  It is only available up to a certain level.  It is particularly directed at smaller-earning artists and is therefore directed where it is particularly needed.  We would like to see it extended over the four or five year period.</p><p> Did the Senator have any other questions?</p></speech>

I strongly agree that the music industry greatly contributes to the overall economy.  I believe music and its many offshoots have a massive impact on tourism, in particular.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would support me in saying the Fleadh Cheoil was an enormous success in promoting Irish culture and heritage and the Irish music tradition nationally and internationally.  It has also been extremely beneficial to tourism in Sligo and the north west for the last two years.  It brings huge numbers of visitors to Sligo town and the wider region.  The Fleadh brought an estimated 400,000 in 2015 and over 350,000 in 2014.  It is also estimated that in 2014, the music festival was worth almost &euro;40 million to the local economy in Sligo and would have been closer to &euro;50 million in 2015.  Local hotels, restaurants, pubs, small businesses and the general public all benefited financially from the promotion of the festival.  Many residents leased out their rooms.</p> <p>  While the rewards to the local economy were enormous, only &euro;90,000 in specific Government funding was allocated to the Fleadh Cheoil in 2015.  I am sure we will all agree that this was returned in full by the spending that took place over the duration of the event.  There could be greater support offered, with a possible focus on promoting certain acts - for example, new and emerging artists.  I am sure the witnesses would all support that.</p> <p>  The second example I want to discuss is the Sligo Live music festival.  I see from the witnesses' report that IMRO is prominently involved in the sponsorship and promotion of music in Ireland, including Sligo Live.  The festival has been running for the past 12 years and has grown into a major music festival in the north west.  Only yesterday I met a delegation of the Sligo Live organisers, and I have with me the programme for this year's festival, which takes place from 21 to 26 October.</p> <p>  It is unfortunate that specific Government festival funding for Sligo Live was drastically reduced by 60% in 2015.  For over a decade, the festival had always received in the region of &euro;50,000.  This year, that was reduced to &euro;20,000.  No festival can receive that large a grant cut and be expected to provide the same level of service.  Both young and very well-established artists are playing the festival.  This needs to be re-examined in the near future.</p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland's policy on the funding of music festivals seems to have changed this year.  I will seek a meeting with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in that regard because the loss of a festival such as Sligo Live would have a major damaging effect on Sligo's tourism product.  Sligo Live is more than a music festival in that it offers new artists the opportunity to grow and develop and it attracts music tourists to the region, which is only beginning to expand its tourism potential.  It takes place in October when the tourism season is over and there are few festivals taking place elsewhere.  It is unfortunate that this year the Sligo Live festival is in a very challenging position financially.  I would be fully supportive of greater investment by the Government in the Irish music industry.</p><p> What percentage of IMRO funding is available for sponsorship of festivals around the country?  How does IMRO undertake the allocation of funding?  What is IMRO's stance on the funding of music festivals such as those I have listed?  Does IMRO have a part to play in the development of the smaller music festivals throughout the country?</p></speech>

We sponsor a large number of festivals throughout the country, and not just festivals but music education programmes and song contests.  Sligo Live is a festival we have sponsored for a number of years, principally the new and emerging artists stages at the festival.  We also sponsor Sligo jazz festival, and have done so for a number of years.  We have also sponsored the Other Voices festival in Dingle, the Christy Hennessy song contest in Tralee, which will take place at the end of the month; and Song School, which is the national programme where IMRO members go into schools to teach children about the craft of song writing and the need to respect copyright.  BEO is another schools programme which was initiated in Donegal and has spread throughout the country as well.  We provide support for a large number of song contests and festival, principally the smaller ones.  Typically, the funding we provide is a small amount of money.  Not only do we provide financial support, we also provide promotional support.  We use our network of communications channels to help provide promotional support for the various different events taking place around the country.  That is beyond the financial contribution we provide as well.</p></speech>

We have asked Deloitte as part of the research to do a cost-benefit analysis on the benefits accruing, as opposed to the cost to the Exchequer.  It informed us that for every one euro invested, between &euro;4.10 and &euro;7.40 could be generated by the industry.  That compares very favourably with any other sectors where there is State involvement and encouragement.  The economics of the case for assistance are clear.  We think the first stage is the formation of a task force without delay so that we can get on and do the work that needs to be done.</p></speech>

The work that IMRO carries out rightly defends those involved in the music industry, whether writers or otherwise, who historically were probably taken for granted and got very little return for their creative work.</p><p>We all like to listen to music and pubs and other places like to play the music, but not many of them want to pay for it if they can avoid doing so.  That is putting it bluntly, but I could be more sharp about it.  The directors of IMRO include Mick Hanly and Eleanor McEvoy.  Obviously, there is a very small population base and if a performer cannot break into the island off this island, it is quite limited in terms of earning a living, which is a pity for gifted people.  IMRO's work is valuable.</p><p> I was thinking of the late Brian Friel the other day.  A playwright or an author automatically receives copyright protection, but it is completely different for a songwriter in Ireland.  I welcome what the delegate said about the task force, which is needed and I would be very supportive of it.</p><p> I have never liked the term "Irish music".  I heard it mentioned the other night in reference to Hozier who is a fine singer and a very good songwriter.  The same is true of U2.  Let us face it - it is rock and roll, not the Kilfenora C&eacute;il&iacute; Band, of which I am a great admirer.  I know that there are some very good c&eacute;il&iacute; bands in Cork, but they are not as good as the Kilfenora C&eacute;il&iacute; Band which has been around for more than 100 years.  I see Bono being praised for having a super group, but it is hard to beat a band that has been around for 100 years, which is what it has managed to do.</p><p> Others, including Senator Susan O'Keeffe, referred to the Sligo festival.  Technology is everything now.  The great thing about the fleadh in Sligo is that it has brought it into an urban environment.  I came across people living in my estate who generally would not talk about traditional Irish music and who, because it was on television, as people do with their fingers when they are not texting, changed channels.  It is amazing that in an urban centre, probably for the first time ever, music is fed into people's homes on their television screens and most are impressed by the number of young people who are playing.  These young people from throughout the country are fine musicians and it is technology meeting what is our traditional music, which is very positive.</p></speech>
