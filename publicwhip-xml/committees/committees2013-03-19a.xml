I welcome from the Irish Insurance Federation Mr. Kevin Thompson, chief executive officer, and Mr. Michael Horan, non-life insurance manager.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and other documents you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website this afternoon.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The delegation last attended the committee on 25 September 2012.  Since then the committee has met several groups in its ongoing consideration of the issues of flooding and its effects across the country.  The significant issue of geocoding and insurance cover is causing some distress and discomfort to people.  The blanket categorisation of whole areas as being at high risk of flooding has affected people's house insurance premia, as well as their chances of getting cover.  The difficulty in getting insurance adds to the psychological burden for those affected by flooding.  One can find that a house on a hill near houses which have flooded but which was not affected itself can be categorised as high risk.  There is an unfairness in this system and those affected get exercised by it.</p><p>  There are also home owners who have engaged in remedial works and developed flood defences but these have not improved their insurance premia or even their chances of being able to renew cover.  People who may never be affected by flooding are suffering because of claims in other areas.  Geocoding seems to be the central culprit in this and I would like to hear the delegation's views on this.  I call on Mr. Kevin Thompson.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompson" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900004#C00100"><p>On behalf of the members of the Irish Insurance Federation I welcome the opportunity to address the joint committee on the problem of flooding, with particular reference to household insurance availability in areas that have experienced extreme weather events.  The IIF is a representative body for insurance companies in Ireland.  Collectively, IIF members write the vast majority of all life and non-life business in the State.  In 2012 domestic non-life gross written premiums amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  This figure incorporates motor, property and liability insurance.  As the voice of insurance companies in Ireland, the key functions of the IIF include representing members' interests to Government, State agencies, regulatory bodies, public representatives, other national interest groups, the media and the public; representing the position of members at a European level, especially via Insurance Europe, the European association for national insurance company representative bodies; keeping members abreast of relevant policy and regulatory developments and providing a forum for member debate on such issues; and providing information to the Government and the wider policy-making community and the public about insurance.</p><p>  We have experienced eight major floods in Ireland since 2000.  The claims costs of these events stretch from June 2012 to November 2000.  In June 2012 the cost was &euro;54 million; in October 2011 it was &euro;127 million; in November 2009 there was a large cost of &euro;244 million; in August 2008 the cost was &euro;96 million; in October 2004 it was &euro;38 million; in November 2002 it was &euro;50 million; in February 2002 it was &euro;37 million; and in November 2000 it was &euro;51 million.  The cumulative cost of these eight flood events was &euro;697 million.  At the time, the November 2009 floods represented the single largest insured loss ever, at &euro;244 million.  However, the new record did not last long because it was closely followed by the December 2009 and January 2010 freeze, which cost &euro;297 million.  A further freeze in December 2010 cost &euro;224 million.  This provides a further insight into the cost of severe weather events.</p><p>  The most serious floods have been during the past four years and the claims costs of these events are as follows.  In June 2012 there was a cost of &euro;54 million in the Cork region; in October 2011 there was a total cost was &euro;127 million in the Dublin region; in November 2009 there was a cost of &euro;244 million in the Cork and Shannon regions; and in August 2008 there was a cost of &euro;96 million nationwide.  These figures can be broken down between household and commercial property.  In June 2012 the breakdown of the cost of the flood in Cork was &euro;15 million for household and &euro;38 million for commercial property.  In October 2011 the breakdown in flood costs for Dublin was &euro;58 million and &euro;59 million for household and commercial property, respectively.  The cost of the November 2009 floods in Cork and the mid-west for household and commercial property was &euro;76 million and &euro;160 million respectively.  The worst-hit areas for household claims in the November 2009 floods were as follows: Cork, &euro;21 million; Galway, &euro;16 million; Clare, &euro;9 million; and Dublin, &euro;5 million.  The worst-hit areas for commercial property claims following the November 2009 floods were Cork, Roscommon, Galway and Clare with costs totalling &euro;119 million, &euro;8 million, &euro;8 million and &euro;7 million, respectively.  The response of insurers after all of these flood events was to provide 24-hour helplines, alternative accommodation and emergency funds where necessary.  It was necessary to dry, clean, repair and restore properties.  This process can take some months, particularly due to the time it takes properties to dry out.</p><p>  The IFF's role as a representative body in the area of flooding is to collect statistical information, provide advice and comment to the media, the Government, politicians and the public and liaise with the OPW.  The problems we see in the area of flooding include those of climate change, a legacy of poor planning decisions, under-investment in flood defences, under-resourcing, a lengthy planning process even for small flood defence projects, and the fact that too many agencies are involved in flood risk management.</p><p>  Whatever side one takes in the climate change debate, there is no disputing the fact that in the past decade insurers have seen more frequent and costly weather-related losses not only in Ireland but globally.  The fact that we have had so many of the largest ever weather-related losses in such close succession has put significant pressure on the property insurance market.  However, insurers have repeatedly displayed their resilience and have protected people against financial loss.  Unfortunately, one legacy of the building boom was that many houses were built on flood plains due to bad planning decisions.  This reinforces the importance of taking flood risk into account when zoning and planning.  The Government capital budget for flood risk management averaged &euro;37 million per annum between 2005 and 2011.  Capital spend on flood risk management averaged &euro;27 million per annum over the same period.  To put this in context, the claims cost of the last four major floods totalled &euro;520 million.</p><p>  Flood insurance is widely available in Ireland and we estimate a high penetration rate of approximately 98%.  It is a standard peril in household insurance policies.  All policyholders pay a contribution and low-risk areas subsidise high-risk areas.  The household insurance market is competitive, with 12 insurers operating from offices in Ireland and others without an Irish office also offering insurance under EU Single Market rules.  When assessing risk, insurers analyse the claims history of a property and flood prevention measures implemented by the OPW or local authority.  Some people pay a higher premium or have a higher flood excess because the flood risk is higher.  Exclusion of cover is a last resort.  Insurance offers protection against a risk but not against a certainty.  It is not tenable to ask policyholders in general to absorb the cost of losses, nor is it sustainable from an insurance business model perspective.  Insurers spread risk throughout the world through the mechanism of reinsurance.  Therefore, it is vital that insurers act prudently with regard to flooding risks to ensure that affordable reinsurance cover is maintained for all policyholders.</p><p>  Among the goals of the IIF are to preserve as far as possible the widespread availability and affordability of insurance and to act as a partner with the Government, and especially the OPW, to achieve this end.  The elements necessary for the sustainable provision of insurance are availability of flood mapping and accurate data to facilitate risk assessment, high penetration levels to prevent adverse selection, continued availability of reinsurance, investment by the Government in structural and non-structural measures, and the addressing of deficiencies in planning guidelines.  Insurers need maps in GIS format showing likely flooding extent and benefit area maps showing the likely extent of protection offered by remedial works.  They also need to know the status of remedial works, such as those deemed to be priorities, in progress, etc.  They need to know the design standards to which flood defences are constructed; the minimum standard is a return period of one per 100 years.</p><p>  The Irish Insurance Federation and the Office of Public Works have a common interest in ensuring that information on the completed flood defences is provided to insurers.  Following our previous discussion with the committee the IIF invited the OPW to join a working group to accelerate the provision of flood defence information to insurers.  The working group commenced its work in January 2013 and meets monthly.  The objective of the working group is for the IIF and the OPW to work together on the provision of OPW information on completed flood defences in line with the IIF's requirements in order that household insurers can take this information into account when assessing risk in respect of private dwellings.  The scope of the work of the group is to establish areas for which flood defence information will be provided, establish the format in which the information will be supplied, agree a delivery date for sets of completed flood defences and agree on how frequently the information will be updated.  The Irish Insurance Federation believes that the 2009 planning guidelines are deficient and too complex.  The future availability and affordability of flood insurance were not considered at the preparation stage.  The guidelines are only advisory in nature and planning authorities are not obliged to follow them.</p><p>  We believe there needs to be a focus on impact mitigation.  A flood risk management plan is needed for all high-risk areas.  All flood resources should be considered.  Flood risk management plans need to be properly funded and resourced.  We should also stop creating new flood risks.  Insurers are major stakeholders.  Insurers want to continue to offer affordable insurance to as many people as possible.  Minimising the financial impact of the cost of floods is critical and we appreciate the engagement on the part of Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Office of Public Works in this regard.  I would be glad to elaborate on any aspect of this presentation on which members have questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900004#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  I represent the constituency of Cork North-Central.  It covers the north side of the city and includes a large hinterland around the periphery of the city as well as the city centre.  We have been devastated on several occasions and it is nothing new to the psychology of people in Cork city to have normal flooding or tidal flooding, which may come with a south-easterly.  However, in November 2009 we had extensive flooding in the city.  At the time I called for an independent investigation into the cause of the flooding and the contributory factors.  At the time I held major concerns, along with other Deputies in Cork, about the behaviour of the ESB.</p> <p>That issue has not been adequately addressed and investigated and no final conclusion has been reached.  I do not expect the delegates from the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, to comment on who was liable for the flooding, but I have grave concerns about the behaviour of the ESB on that fateful night.  Only for the grace of God, nobody was drowned, but huge damage was done to property and people's lives.  In the context of that flooding and other floods, does the IIF or its members ever consider taking actions against people who may have been responsible for or contributed to a flooding or does it just always pass the costs on to policyholders in general?  I am concerned that the easy option in such circumstances, rather than take an action against those who may be culpable or negligent in addressing issues that allow certain areas to be flooded, is to hike up premiums throughout the country and ask the householder to pay.</p><p> In the context of the 2009 flooding, did the IIF or any of its members look at any State agency or the ESB with regard to whether they were either culpable or liable in any way or did they just decide to pay out and recoup the moneys from policyholders over a period of time?  I am very concerned about this particular aspect of the 2009 flooding and I believe this committee has a fundamental role to play in ensuring some finality is brought to this issue.  The ESB and others should be brought before the committee and held to account, as we tried to do previously without success.</p><p> On the issue of geocoding, in June 2011 Glanmire was flooded extensively as a result of an act of God, in the context of the amount of rain that fell.  However, we are now getting evidence from constituents living in Glanmire and elsewhere whose properties were extensively flooded on that fateful night that they cannot get insurance because of geocoding.  Glanmire and certain areas near the Glashaboy River have been highlighted as a high risk category.  Therefore, when people from these areas apply for insurance or a quote, they are refused because of the geocoding system in use.  Is that what is happening?  I have had contact from people who live on the top of a hill in that area and the only way they would be affected by flooding would be if they were at sea level.  Their house would certainly not be flooded.  This situation must be examined.</p><p> Insurers are asking fewer people to carry a higher burden, but the theory behind insurance is to spread risk among a greater number of people.  We now have situations in areas like Glanmire, which I accept are prone to flooding, where obtaining insurance is difficult.  Some of these places had never been flooded previously until June 2011.  Why are we allowing this to happen?  Is there any appeals mechanism in place so that a person refused insurance by a number of insurers can get insurance?  Can they approach the Irish Insurance Federation or to whom should they go to appeal a decision to refuse insurance or to at least be offered a quote?</p><p> I also want clarity on the issue of the value of a house whose owner is unable to acquire insurance for it.  Effectively such a house is worthless, because the only person who could buy the house would be a cash buyer due to the fact that if the buyer applied for a mortgage, he or she would be obliged to obtain insurance.  Most solicitors would advise a person not to purchase if insurance could not be obtained.  The banks certainly would not release money for a mortgage for a house that could not be insured.  This needs to be addressed.  Hundreds of people in the Cork Harbour basin area, particularly the marsh area, will find it exceptionally difficult to dispose of their houses because new purchasers will be unable to get full protection and therefore will not be able to get a mortgage or buy the house.</p><p> In the context of local authorities, we have heard of cases where the authorities do not keep drains cleared, maintain flood defences or have proper alert systems in place.  In view of the amount paid out by insurance companies, almost &euro;500 million in the extensive flooding between November 2000 and June 2012 - my apologies for saying earlier the Glanmire flooding was in 2011, it was 2012 - how closely does the Irish Insurance Federation work with or monitor local authorities to ensure they carry out their obligations with regard to the maintenance of flood defences?  It has been mentioned that some of the floods caused recently were due to the lack of maintenance of grilles and culverts.  Does the federation do anything to ensure local authorities carry out their obligations in those areas?</p><p>The Irish Insurance Federation needs to carry out a review to ensure that people are at least given a quote from insurance companies in areas of high flood risk.  I accept people may have to pay a premium, but the logic of insurance is that it carries those that have a high risk by spreading the load among those that have a low or no risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompson" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900005#D00200"><p>I will respond to some of those questions and will hand over to Mr. Horan to deal with the technicalities of geocoding.  With regard to the potential increase in insurance premiums, our view is that the marketplace is quite competitive in terms of the 12 general providers in the market, not including foreign insurers which, under freedom of services, underwrite business here also.  Premiums have decreased in the past 12 months by 4%.  I believe insurers are acting prudently and fairly in terms of the application of premium rates across the marketplace.</p><p>  In response to whether we take action against establishments such as the ESB, the federation has no knowledge of any of its members taking action against such parties.  This would be the decision of each insurer to do that, but I believe they would not see it as their role to take legal action against such organisations.  In respect of local authority maintenance of flood defences and clearing of drains, we would refer to the committee's previous report in July 2010 where such recommendations were made.  I am aware membership of the committee has changed since then.  As a representative body, the federation would urge that follow-up action be taken on the recommendations of the previous committee.  One of the recommendations concerned ensuring drains and so forth were kept clear and that local authorities were followed up on in respect of their responsibilities in this area.  </p><p>  Our engagement on insurance of flooded areas has been with the Office of Public Works since January and it is the main conduit for us in understanding what remedial action has taken place, the standard of the action and considering whether that work can be incorporated into underwriting criteria within insurance companies to provide people in those affected areas.  I agree the principle of insurance is based on spreading risk within a risk pool.  However, there is a difference between insuring a certainty versus a might be and this must be taken into account.</p><p>  In respect of geocoding, Mr. Horan our non-life insurance manager is probably best placed to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Horan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900005#D00300"><p>Household insurance is a mass market product and insurance companies make their individual underwriting decisions on the basis of the information available to them, and geographical location is an important rating factor.  Insurance companies use their own claims experience, secondary data and flood models, etc.  The geodirectory gives exact geocodes for each building and pinpoints the property.  Without geocoding, risks would be assessed on a blanket basis.  It would be assumed that all properties within a geographical area are at equal risk of a flood.</p> <p>In simple terms, geocoding enables insurers to see that, for example, one side of a street is within a flood hazard area and the other side is not.  Rather than excluding all areas in a blanket manner, geocoding depicts graphically what buildings are within a flood hazard area and what buildings are not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900006#E00200"><p>Does geocoding take account of elevation and altitude?</p></speech>

It is not feasible because of the number of houses that are insured.  When we attended a meeting of this committee in September of last year, we were asked how a person in one of these areas can get out of it.  We are working with the OPW through our flood working group.  We are getting information from the OPW on digital files that show the areas which are protected by flood defences.  Historically, insurance companies have not had that information when they examine at-risk areas.  The new data coming from the OPW will enable them to amend their lists of at-risk areas to take account of flood defences that have been built.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about elevation.  I guess it is possible for somebody's house to be within a particular area but at a more elevated height.  We recommend that a person in such circumstances should make representations to the insurance company, drawing its attention to the fact that the house is in an elevated position.  He or she also has the option of using the Irish Insurance Federation's information service, which can liaise with the insurance company and bring its attention to the salient facts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013031900006#E00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Horan and Mr. Thompson to this afternoon's meeting.  Like Deputy Kelleher, I would like to impress on the joint committee the importance of reaching finality with regard to the Cork flooding of November 2009.  As the first person to call for an independent investigation into that episode, I hold firm to the view that we have yet to get proper answers.  Why has the federation not asked its members to go after the ESB?  Like Deputy Kelleher, I have a view on that aspect of the matter.  I am worried that an incident similar to the flooding that happened in the Middle Parish area of Cork could happen again.  We have not yet received adequate answers from the ESB regarding its role in that event.  I am aware that representatives of the ESB appeared before a committee in the previous D&aacute;il.  Some questions have yet to be answered.  Why have they not been challenged on this matter by the insurance companies?</p><p>  I was amused to hear the witnesses say that insurance has decreased by 4%.  I would like to see real evidence of that.  It is news to my ears.  While I welcome what was said about affordable insurance, I do not see evidence of it in the cases of people in Cork who have suffered as a consequence of flooding.  The gargantuan premium increases have been unacceptable.  The people whose houses have been flooded are being asked to foot the bill.  There has been no engagement with the ESB or the county councils.  In the case of last summer's flooding in the Douglas area of Cork, it is clear that there was an issue with a grille.  Perhaps I am speaking in a vacuum in that case because a report on it has not yet been published.  There does not seem to be a link between the local authorities and the Irish Insurance Federation.  It was mentioned that the federation did not start engaging with the OPW until January of this year.  It does not make sense that it did not start before now.</p><p>  We need more than negotiation.  Surely there is an obligation on the insurers and those representing the insurers to talk to the county councils, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the OPW regarding the clearing of drains and the operation of flood defence measures.  It seems to me that the innocent victim is not recognised in all of this.  I agree with what the witnesses said about some of the stuff that has been built on flood plains, but we cannot blame the home owner or the business person who bought a home or a business in such an area.  They were merely trying to buy a home or a business.  During the planning application process, did the members of the federation inform the local authority that these developments should not be allowed to go ahead because they were on flood plains?  As a public representative, the system seems to be weighed against the home owner or the business person.</p><p>  I would like to speak briefly about geo-coding.  I have an office on Glasheen Road near University College Cork.  I accept that the witnesses are probably not familiar with the area.  I am 46 years of age and I have never seen a flood in the area.  Letters have been sent to local residents telling them their houses are on flood plains.  I do not buy that argument.  I have never seen water lodge anywhere along the road.  It is quite elevated.  Similarly, people in the Bishopstown area of Cork, where I live, are being refused insurance or being given gargantuan insurance quotes because of subsidence.  I appreciate that subsidence is not on today's agenda.  Many people have been told to shop around, which is fine.  People in their 70s might not have the computer skills to do so online.  If they try to shop around by telephone, they are told to press line 2 or line 3 before they get to talk to an agent.  People living in areas like Uam Var, Benvoirlich, The Rise and Curraheen Road have been told their quotes will be increased, or have not been given any quotes at all, because they live in high subsidence areas.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher was right when he suggested that a person's house is worthless if it is not insured.  I do not know how we have arrived at a "one size fits all" situation with regard to subsidence.  People who got their houses fixed, if I can use that term, and have not made any claims for the last 25 or 30 years are still being told they will not be given any quote unless they pay a certain cost.  We should not victimise the person whose property has been flooded.  I accept there might have to be an increased premium level if it is an ongoing issue.  Do the insurers think they have treated the people of the Middle Parish and the people of Glanmire fairly?  I honestly do not think fairness has been exhibited in some cases.  I have seen evidence of this.  Premiums have gone through the roof, people have been refused cover and claims have been questioned.  I accept that insurers have a role in questioning claims.  I will conclude by saying I hope we do not go down the road of saying to people that they cannot get insurance as a result of the only flood to have taken place in their area in the last 50 or 100 years.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

The federation has not taken any specific action.  I am not aware of any specific action having been taken by any of our members.  It is debatable whether the role of an insurance company should be to take action, or whether other appropriate authorities should fulfil that role.  We are insurance providers.  We are here to assess risk and to try to provide coverage where we can.</p> <p>Mr. Horan is probably the best person to deal with the issue of subsidence, which has different criteria.</p></speech>

The problem is exacerbated by the fact the underground pipes are made of clay and are susceptible to cracking when development takes place.  This results in underground erosion, which causes downward movement of the ground supporting the existing properties.  As I said, there is a particular problem in this regard in Cork.</p><p>  In terms of remedial measures, with flooding, a flood defence can be put in that will protect a whole area, whereas with subsidence, the remedial measure is specific to the individual house.  What needs to be done in general is to remove the cause of the damage, ideally, and then monitor for a period to make sure the movement of the property has stopped.  Then, when one is sure the property has stabilised, underpinning work is carried out.  Where subsidence has happened and underpinning work has been done, individual insurers would generally look favourably on this.  As to whether the overall cause in Cork city can be removed, one of the issues there is the fact these clay pipes are cracking.  In terms of removing the cause, I would have thought it would be a case of the local authority replacing the pipes, but I am not aware it has any plans to do that.</p></speech>

There are one or two very small subsidence blackspots in the country.  Subsidence is a standard part of the household insurance policy for the vast majority of household insurance policyholders.  Unfortunately, there is this blackspot in Cork where the likelihood of subsidence is so great as to be tantamount to inevitability.  Insurance cannot cover people against an inevitable event because the cost of premia would skyrocket for everybody.</p></speech>

One of the points I made very strongly the last time this arose in the committee was the need for co-operation across Departments, the OPW and city councils in order to exchange data.  The first question I would have is in regard to this point.  At what stage is that process of co-operation?  Is it just at the stage of exchanging data and when will we see concrete results from this co-operation?</p></speech>

Our first meeting was in the middle of January, we had a meeting in February and another meeting last week.  The idea is to keep these monthly meetings going.  We need to fully understand the technical data as presented to us by the OPW.  That is the current position.  It is an effort to get these technical data into a format that both parties can understand.</p><p>  To be clear, we have not got all the data on every piece of work the OPW has carried out.  We started with certain pieces of work and it is a matter of working through, the idea being that once we fully understand this, we will try to incorporate it into our members' underwriting criteria.</p></speech>

If one extends the period of time, one may get a more even result, but even to take that three-year period, there is a cumulative loss of &euro;396 million.

The point we were also trying to reflect is the payments which the industry has made in respect of floods which have happened and to correlate that against spending on flood defences.  When we stack one up against the other, there is definitely a disconnect.</p></speech>

There are the costs of flood defence payments by the insurers and the costs paid by the OPW on flood defences over the 12 years but, in the other margin, is the insurers' income.  To look at &euro;697 million in isolation is probably the wrong manner for this committee to do it.  It would be good if the Irish Insurance Federation could provide the profit margins of its members over those 12 years.</p></speech>

I would have some concerns, given the examples they provided to us, and perhaps the witnesses could clarify those for the committee.</p> <p>The first example given to us was of the person who gets a refusal from one insurance company and must notify that refusal to every other company.  A person who gets a letter stating that renewal costs &euro;300 may telephone around to get a cheaper quotation but if any of the insurance companies say "No" because the house is located on a flood plain, or for whatever reason, that person must then report the refusal to the first insurer, whereupon the premium skyrockets.  That situation was mentioned. </p><p> Another element raised was that a person who has made an insurance claim cannot move to another insurance company for five years, even though he or she may have been 20 or 30 years with the company.  There is also an element of price-fixing for specific areas, a pattern that becomes very clear when people telephone around to ask about prices.  There is the spread of risk, which I heard mentioned on one occasion, meaning the allocation of customers within a risk area.  Are the delegates aware of anybody operating in that manner?</p></speech>

Last week clear allegations were made that some operators in the industry were operating as a cartel.  Another aspect of that allegation was that some companies might exclude cover in an area, in the full knowledge their competitors might be doing the same, the result being a cartel.

The Irish Brokers Association gives a figure of some 50,000 houses that cannot achieve flood insurance.  Does that tie in with the statistics Mr. Thompson gave us today?</p></speech>

Flood cover is a standard part of the package a customer gets in a household insurance policy in this country.</p></speech>

This means they cannot sell their home or purchase the one they want to because they cannot get a mortgage for it.  Judging by the calls we get, the figure of 98% does not seem realistic.  The figure from the Irish Brokers Association is probably much more realistic.  From what period was the figure of 98% taken?</p></speech>

The purpose of our engagement with the OPW in the flood working group is to try to improve that penetration rate even further.  As I said, insurance companies are not aware of the flood defence information available to the OPW, nor of the standards to which those defences have been built.  That is the main issue.  We are trying to get past all the previous debates we have had, which go back and forth after every flood that occurs and in which a lot of mudslinging goes on, on all sides.  We are trying to get past that to make concrete, practical progress within the flood working group.</p></speech>

I refer again to the 98% figure.  Was that figure taken before geocoding was in wide operation?  Other Deputies and Senators  will have received the same telephone calls.  A person will report being with the same company for the past ten years but then being told it will not give flood cover. That would be the normal telephone call we would receive in the office on a daily basis.  Was the 98% figure taken prior to the companies operating geocoding, or has geocoding been rolled out?</p></speech>

It is individual insurance companies competing against each other for business.  I am not privy to how each company makes its underwriting decisions.  Some companies are probably more technologically advanced than others.  From the Irish Insurance Federation's point of view, I am interested in the overall penetration rate.  We believe the rate in Ireland for flood insurance is far higher than in most other European countries.  In some countries the penetration rate for flooding is as low as 20%.</p></speech>

Insurance company X sends a renewal notice.  The person prices this against other companies and gets knocked back or refused for flood insurance by other companies.

We are happy to look into individual cases of that kind.  In regard to talk of cartels, etc., we would refute that allegation in the strongest possible terms because the Irish household insurance market is very competitive.  As we noted in our presentation there are at least 12 insurance companies offering household insurance cover, with many others writing into Ireland under EU Single Market rules.  The market is very competitive and there is a huge range in quotation prices for a person looking for same.  People bandy around allegations about cartels but nothing could be further from the truth.</p></speech>

This discussion seems to be going around in circles.  The use of computer technology has enabled much new information to be provided on existing flood plains and proposed flood plain management.  Many of the county councils are doing magnificent work.  I was a member of South Dublin County Council.  The SEAFRAME study is available for consultation, as are the studies being conducted with reference to SEAFRAME.  Computer imaging studies have been carried out on rivers.  I will only speak with reference to the south Dublin area because it is the area I know best.  South Dublin County Council did a computer study of the River Dodder under the auspices of the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  However, the insurance companies are still working as if they were back in the Dark Ages.  I acknowledge that the computer studies from around the country have not been collated.</p><p>  Aerial surveys have been conducted.  I refer to the LiDAR study of rivers carried out in south Dublin, which was commissioned by the OPW under the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Elevation levels were investigated in the LiDAR aerial survey and a digital terrain model is available in South Dublin County Council.  This is not rocket science.  It is hoped all this information  will be collated.  RPS Consultants are working with the OPW and with county councils to collate information.  Is it the case that the Irish Insurance Federation has not been consulted about this new information or is not aware of it?</p><p>  The best way to make a point is to speak about something with which one is familiar.  I live near the Dodder but I will not use that river as an example.  When I was on the council in 2000 a huge body of work was carried out by South Dublin County Council, including a flood alleviation plan for estates in Lucan which had suffered flooding.  That area is now free of flood risk.  The senior engineer in South Dublin County Council provided the residents of those estates in Lucan with letters stating that this work had been carried out.  This was because they were being refused insurance.  There has been no flooding since the work was carried out; nor is there any prospect of flooding.  The witness has stated that he has no knowledge of a cartel.  Why can the people in those estates not get insurance?  The letter received by residents was for the attention of insurance companies.  The engineer was prepared to put his name on the line in signing that letter.  I ask why the residents are unable to get insurance.  </p><p>  I refer to the regulations and code of practice for the insurance industry.  How is the code policed?  What knowledge, if any, is garnered from this policing?  Other speakers referred to geocoding, so I will not speak about it.  The county councils have very little money but they do the work when they have the money.  This should be acknowledged by the insurance companies.  It seems the situation is worse now even though more information is available to insurance companies than was the case four or five years ago.</p><p>  On the question of claims and who is or is not making money, I refer to the figures provided by the delegates.  I got the impression from figures provided by others that the insurance companies were cleaning up.  I ask the committee to undertake research on the figures coming from both sides to determine the actual figures.  </p><p>  What percentage of insurance companies are members of the federation?  I spent 20 years as a councillor.  The GIS mapping system and computer technology supply information on roads and rivers.  One does not have to be Mohammed to guess where flooding is likely to occur, because the information is available.  The insurance companies should know this also.  I acknowledge that it was wrong to allow building on flood plains and I hope this will never happen again.  In my view, the cost of insurance should be coming down instead of going up; it should be more freely available.</p></speech>

I reiterate that our members do not act as a cartel.  There is no evidence to suggest this.  I refer to the earlier comment by my colleague.  There are 12 domestic insurance providers in the marketplace, and also providers based outside this jurisdiction that passport in to sell their products.  There is no evidence whatsoever of a cartel.  Our members do not engage in cartel activity.  We do have a code on anti-competitive behaviour, of which we remind our members.</p> <p>The minutes of all our meetings are published and available for people to read.  As an organisation and industry, we are fully transparent in the way we conduct our business, which I must emphasise very strongly. </p><p> In terms of our membership, 98% of insurance providers are members of the Irish Insurance Federation.  Of those which are not members, the majority are international insurance companies, probably based in the IFSC, and do not currently feel a need to be members of the representative body.  In terms of technology, it is for each of our members to use the technology available in the best way they can.  </p><p> Again, I draw the committee's attention to the work we are doing with the OPW.  We are starting to understand fully the good work it has done and the technicalities in order that our members can better understand and incorporate it into their underwriting assessment.  This is an evolving process, on which we have taken a leadership position.  In January, following the previous committee meeting in September last year, we invited the OPW to enter into face-to-face dialogue in order that we would better understand the remedial action which had taken place.  We are open to such dialogue.</p><p> I am not sure if Mr. Horan has a further insight into the actual technicalities from an underwriting point of view.  Again, I strongly emphasise that our members do not act as a cartel.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do in the working group is to understand clearly through the files from the OPW the areas which are protected by the flood defences which have been built and the standard to which those defences have been built.  It goes beyond letters being given to individual households.  It is about trying to understand, on a global basis, which areas are protected.  That is a more efficient way of doing it because, as I said, household insurance is not the sort of product in repect of which one can survey every house.  One needs to be able to understand which areas are protected.</p></speech>

The federation has been made aware that there are houses in the Old Forge, Grange Castle and John's Bridge estates which have not been flooded since the flood alleviation plan was put in place in 2001, yet their owners still cannot get insurance.  What can the federation do about this because its members have refused to insure them?  It could not involve those in the 2% which are not members of the federation.  The federation has a code of conduct which members read, but they need not take notice of it.  How does it know who takes notice of it and who does not?  What follow-up action does it take?

The code is voluntary.  It means that when our members meet, whether at board, council or working group level, they do not enter into conversations or practices which could be seen as anti-competitive.  How we monitor it is through the minutes of meetings which are transparent and available for everyone to read.  It is a transparent process.</p><p>  On the work carried out in specific areas, again we are looking to the OPW to verify it.  My colleague has highlighted the fact that it is not a question of receiving a letter from an engineer; we want to work through and fully understand the technicalities and make sure the defences are built to the required standard.  If they are, we will look to our members to incorporate this as part of their underwriting criteria, but we admit it is early days in the process.  We have momentum and are meeting the OPW once a month.  As we evolve through this process, we may have to involve other agencies in the dialogue to ensure we adopt a holistic approach.  </p><p>  Insurance is only one element of the whole picture.  I must again draw the committee's attention to the report produced in July 2010 in which numerous recommendations were made, including keeping drains clear, which is the local council's responsibility.  This issue must be addressed as much as the work we are doing with the OPW.  We will do our bit, but there are other pieces of the jigsaw which need to be addressed also.</p></speech>

Mr. Thompson has said the federation meets the OPW and is trying to understand its processes.  Getting a scheme up and running is a tall order because one goes through a painstaking process in allocating public funds.</p><p>  What seems to be happening is that those living within 500 m of a watercourse are routinely refused.  That did not happen before, or certainly I did not come across it until last year.  It does not matter how much money the OPW spends from the public purse on remediation works, as one is routinely asked if one lives within 500 m of a watercourse.  One may even be living above a river.  Why are all of the insurance companies asking this question?  Perhaps it is not a cartel in terms of pricing but it is in terms of shared information to ensure no company will incur a larger loss.  I have come across situations where people have been refused insurance because they are living within 500 m of a watercourse, even though there is no evidence whatsoever of a risk of flooding.  I have also come across people whose insurance premium last year was a few hundred euro but who were asked for &euro;1,000 this year, even though there was no evidence whatsoever of a risk of flooding.  </p><p>  What is the point in entering into a process with the OPW when most mitigation or flood defence measures are taken beside watercourses?  The people most likely to be affected are living within 500 m of where the remediation measures have been taken and the ones likely to have had a problem previously.  The figure of 500 m is critical in terms of the new approach adopted to offering flood insurance.</p><p>  The planning process needs to be assisted because there were mistakes made in the past.</p> <p>There is no doubt that houses, businesses and so on have been built on flood plains.  There has even been a problem in some areas during the construction of motorways because the planners did not adequately take note of the water table.  The more information in the public arena the more of a problem that poses for the public with regard to adequate protection.</p><p> Will a certification process emerge from the federation's dealings with the Office of Public Works?  The delegation referred to the letters sent by South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council.  Kildare County Council has also sent letters where there have been instances of flooding.  Does the delegation intend to establish a certification process?  What way will it feed the information to its affiliated insurance companies?  </p><p> I wish to inquire about shared services.  Does the federation have a blacklist of areas that are prone to flooding or another risk?  Is the list shared with its insurance companies?  Does it advise its companies that risk cover is inadvisable for reasons such as flooding, burglaries or whatever?   </p><p> I can bear witness to the fact that local authorities do positive work, including in my area of Kildare.  However, the positive work has not benefited people, from an insurance point of view, who have experienced flooding.  Defences were put in place and they were tested by floods yet people still encounter difficulties when it comes to flood insurance cover.  It would be quite useful for us to know what information the federation provides to its insurance companies. </p><p> It was stated in the presentation that the federation believes that "the 2009 planning guidelines are deficient and too complex" and were "only advisory".  I, too, have sat on a local authority and was involved in the compilation of a county development plan from mid-2008 to 2009.  The information that was used was advisory and also taken on board.  What deficiencies does the federation see in the planning guidelines?  I cannot see it and spoke of my experience.  Perhaps Kildare County Council was good at preparing its plan.  I would be pleased to hear any problems because if a problem is identified then it can be resolved. </p><p> The need for focus was also mentioned.  I accept that there is a management issue when it comes to keeping drains and culverts clear and all of the rest of it.  There is no point putting good systems in place if they will be blocked.  The federation mentioned that all high risk areas need a risk management plan.  There is risk assessment through the county development plans.  Does the federation agree?  Is more needed?  </p><p> I wish to return to my key provision on the 500 m distance between a water course and a building.  I only came across that provision in the past year.  The provision has had a heavy impact on locations where there has never been evidence of flooding even after a number of instances of fairly severe weather.  I know that such instances did not have an equal impact on all parts of the country.  Since 2000 there have been more 100-year return floods in the area that I am talking about.  There is ample evidence of floods and remediation systems have been put in place. </p></speech>

We try to understand at a macro level what areas are protected by flood defences that have been established by the OPW.  Over the years the OPW has done plenty of good work and installed good flood defences but there has been an information deficit in terms of communicating the information to insurance companies.  The IIF and the OPW have a shared interest to ensure that the information is received by insurance companies so that the benefit gained from the flood defences is maximised by all of the people who live in the areas that are protected by them.  It is more efficient to get the information from the OPW rather than to ask individuals whether their area is  defended when one quotes for household insurance.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked a question about certification. </p></speech>

Insurance companies ask people whether they are within 500 m and immediately give a quote or refuse insurance.  They never ask whether the premises is defended and they do not ask if there is evidence of flooding in the past.  Most of the mitigation measures are on the perimeter of a review except where there is attenuation and things built into the middle of an estate.  Insurance companies do not ask the question on proximity, they do not even get to the point of asking and that is when the refusal happens.  Insurance companies do not want to insure anything that is within 500 m.  It does not matter how much money that the OPW has spent on a riverbank because one is a goner in insurance terms if one lives within 500 m.  That proviso is now applied more rigorously and all of the insurance companies ask the question.</p></speech>

Therefore, when one examines a proposal submitted by telephone, website or whatever one can see where a person lives, whether there is a river or other source of water in the neighbourhood and if flood defences of an acceptable standard have been built.  That is the aim of our working group with the OPW.</p></speech>

Many members of the Irish Insurance Federation operate in international markets.  Across Europe international standards apply and provision is made for events that happen perhaps at intervals of 100 years, 150 years and 200 years.  There is an international certification for events that happen at those intervals, such as coastal flooding and the one-off weather event or what is known as monster rain.  Has the Irish Insurance Federation conducted any research into the levels operating in Ireland?  The OPW operates under the criteria of the international standards, the 100 year, the 150 and 200 year event.  I notice insurance companies insure over a 100 year event.  Is there an easier way of moving that certification?  Time is an element that is causing many different problems.  Is there a way of moving to the certification to which the local authorities and the OPW work?  Some of the insurance companies work on an European wide basis to this standard of certification, but this does not apply in Ireland.</p></speech>

I think the levels are taken on the east coast and they arrive at a mean and all the levels are graded from that, so they know exactly the height of the event level.  If the local authority can state that the defences it has built meet the requirement of a one in a 200 year event and have certification for that level, will the insurance companies accept that certification, which gives them a significant margin for error?  Under the current method, it will take quite a lengthy period to work through the process and in the meantime people cannot move homes or cannot get insurance cover.</p></speech>

The advent of the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, AEDs, creates not only a real concern for them but, in more than one instance where substitute generic alternatives have already applied, resulted in serious personal experiences on the part of that person.  We cannot ignore that as elected members of this committee and of these Houses.  That is the basis of our arguing the case.  It is not about a possible charge on the Exchequer; it is about reflecting firmly and responsibly the concerns that have been made known to us.</p><p>  I have read Standing Order 156(3), and I would argue that the interpretation here is too harsh, but it does not prohibit the Minister of State, Deputy White, taking action.  My appeal to him is to recognise the validity of the concerns presented to us here in committee, and that have been made known to us over a period of time.  We cannot ignore individual sufferers with whom we have engaged.  My appeal to the Minister of State is that if the structures here are such that we will not be allowed press our amendments to seek their adoption, the Minister of State would adopt them and make them Government amendments to overcome this most regrettable obstacle.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, in the names of Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and amendment No. 6 in Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's name, seek to exclude medicinal products in the anti-epileptic drug class from the list of interchangeable products.  I am advised the amendments involve a potential charge on the Exchequer as the cost to the State from reimbursement under the medical refund scheme in this regard could be greater than that of a substituted cheaper generic equivalent.  Accordingly, the amendment must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156(3), which provides that an amendment to a Bill which could have the effect of imposing or increasing a charge upon the Exchequer may not be moved, save by way of a Government amendment.  That is the advice given to me.  We may refer to it again on Report Stage.  That matter is dealt with and I have no say in it.</p></speech>

We put down these amendments not just based on individuals.  Highly eminent professional clinicians have stated to us that they have major concerns about this legislation and the effect it may have on sufferers of epilepsy who have normalised their lives with the drug they are on currently.  That is critically important because the Bills Office, in effect, has not understood the import of our legislation.  We are not saying there is a difficulty with a generic drug.  It is clear that some sufferers of epilepsy are on generic drugs but they are the ones that are suitable for stabilising their condition.  We are not calling on the Minister of State to accept the amendments based on his having to give generic drugs.  We are saying that whatever drug has been beneficial in terms of stabilising people's conditions and stopping them from having seizures from time to time should be the one that is used.  That is clearly different from what the Bills Office is saying.</p></speech>

I am very aware of the issues and I have met members of Epilepsy Ireland.  I have had e-mails from members of the public who are directly affected by what is happening, but I cannot change Standing Orders no more than the Deputy can, and he is a long-standing parliamentarian also.  Unfortunately, the Chair's hands are tied in terms of the Standing Order, which I have read out, and the Chair cannot reinterpret or revisit that.  That is beyond my jurisdiction.  I will call Deputy Naughten but if it is on this matter, we have dealt with it and are moving on.  If it is on any other issue-----</p></speech>

It is the provision that appears in any similar legislation but there is no proposal to incorporate the scenario to which Deputy Naughten refers.  The Bill deals with the pricing and supply of medical goods and there is no proposal to extend it beyond the pricing and supply of medical goods.</p></speech>

Sadly, the medicine people are taking while waiting for a hip replacement can have a damaging impact on the body.  If at a future date a device was developed that would provide pain relief and would be an effective substitute for medicine, should not the Bill provide for that scenario?  If such a device was developed the response from the Department of Health would be that it would require amending legislation before going through the HSE primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, to facilitate the equipment.  We are talking about a remote possibility of this happening but as the Minister of State will argue later, this is a blueprint for developments at a later date.  Given that the Irish Medicines Board will put much of the flesh on it should it not be provided for in the legislation?</p></speech>

In all likelihood that would require not just amending legislation but a different type of legislation.  This Bill provides for the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs.  The scheme of the Bill does not contemplate the changes or facilities to which the Deputy referred.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with the point he made, or that he does not make a good point, but I do not think it belongs in this legislation.</p></speech>

We can only do a certain amount in this legislation and a huge amount is being done here.  However, we cannot try to extend it outside the basic remit contemplated which is the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs in certain circumstances, if the rigorous test is passed, and the pricing regime.  As that is what this legislation is seeking to do we have to be careful not to try to do everything in one piece of legislation.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is the substitution of a device for treatment in the case of pain relief.  The Minister of State is talking about substituting one medicine for another medicine, or one tablet for another tablet, for pain relief on a more cost effective basis where it has the same treatment for the individual.  If a non-pharmacological replacement could have the same impact, should not provision be made for it, if it is more cost effective and more beneficial to the patient?</p></speech>

Without being critical of an organisation that is not present to defend or represent itself, urgency may not be a word given high priority in the Irish Medicines Board in general.  While the Bill states that the board shall, as soon as practicable, after the commencement of this section establish and publish on its Internet website and maintain a list, what obligation is on the board to advance this urgency?  It may have difficulties in terms of staffing arrangements and practical issues about whether enough support is being given to the Irish Medicines Board to adjudicate on what is interchangeable, to carry out a critical analysis and to be obliged at some stage to put it on its website.  Clearly this is an issue that will revolve around the practical implications of the Irish Medicines Board being able to move fairly swiftly to publish the list.  At the end of the day this is about providing a safe system to people but equally to benefit taxpayers by way of savings.  That is the only issue on which I seek clarification before agreeing to the section.</p></speech>

Market authorisation holders, MAHs, will be consulted on the proposed groups of interchangeable medicines and will then have 28 days in which to comment to the Irish Medicines Board.

It was pitiful.  People in awful pain must continually change their drugs.  While I understand that we are trying to save taxpayers' money, when people are under duress and suffering terrible pain, we must guarantee that they do not get cheap drugs for the sake of it.  Another person I have had contact with was on blood-thinning drugs for a heart condition.  His doctor prescribed an expensive blood thinner rather than a generic drug because that is the one that worked for him.  I want a guarantee from the Irish Medicines Board that if a doctor advises in good faith that a more expensive medicine is required, the patient will get that drug.  I read here that medicines will only be substituted where it is safe to do so.</p><p>  There are 37,000 people with epilepsy in the State.  How much cheaper will it be to switch to generic drugs?  What kind of savings are we talking about?  Why can the Irish Medicines Board not provide this information before we pass the Bill?  I will follow up this matter on Report Stage.  I am very concerned for patients.</p></speech>

No matter what way one reads it, there is no defined period by which the board is required to deal with the issue of the interchangeables.  I do not question board members' eminence or ability, but the issue of resources and priorities could come into play.  I am also concerned about high-tech drugs and the complexities of that.  High-end drugs come on the market and are under patent for a period.  When the drugs come out of patent, does the board have the competence, experience and resources to adjudicate on the medicines which become available immediately afterwards?  I am concerned that the wording of the section is vague and does not contain specific timelines for adjudication and publication in respect of medicines.  Timelines are also lacking to encourage people to apply and to force the board to act promptly where people apply and put their products up for interchangeable use.</p></speech>

I will deal with any of these issues as they are very fair.  The issue of timing is specific to section 4.  Deputy Kelleher is correct that there is no defined timeline.  It would not be reasonable to have precise timelines and Deputy Kelleher would not expect us to legislate for them.  The section provides that the board "shall" act as soon as is practicable, which is a strong mandate to the board to do this work.  The section provides that the board will publish the list of medicinal products in respect of which it is satisfied in accordance with section 5.  The board has very careful, analytical work to carry out based on the principles set out in section 5, which are extremely important and at the heart of the issues raised by Deputies Mitchell O'Connor and Dowds.  This is not a charter for cheap drugs as may have been suggested.  It is far from that.</p></speech>

Surely, there should be a mechanism in section 4 which obligates the board to inform the Minister or some relevant body the reasons for any delays.  The phrase "as soon as practicable" means "as far as the board is concerned".  There must be some obligation.  I am not saying the board must have everything done within three or four months, but it should be obliged to inform the Minister as to why a certain issue is delayed.  It is open-ended.  The board has not been proactive in other areas.  The board has attended the committee and we have asked it these questions.  It has been far from proactive about analysing prescription-only versus over-the-counter drugs.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is giving us an indication on establishment.  It is very difficult to talk about section 4 without referring to section 5, as the Minister of State has acknowledged, and I hope the Chairman does not mind.  Whatever timeframe may be involved in the establishment of the list, the changes that will present as the list is updated on an ongoing basis will create further concerns.  There is a need for clarity on timeframes for new product introduction.  I ask the Minister of State to address that.  I acknowledge that discussion will come under section 5, but we are starting to kick the ball on section 4.</p><p>  A range of concerns present regarding the pharmacies sector and the position on GPs and the do-not-substitute requirement within the legislation, particularly in the event of a failure to indicate "do not substitute" but where the knowledge of the pharmacist involved may be more extensive.</p> <p>They are looking for certainty and clarity on their position.  Are they to adhere rigidly to the direction "Do not substitute" and, if it is not there, do they have the freedom to substitute as they deem appropriate, given their exceptional knowledge?  In correspondence with us, the IPU has also raised the issue of GPs prescribing ingredients rather than products by name.</p></speech>

That is a newly patented drug.  That is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about generic substitution.  I can understand people's concerns and this is new to our system.  We have never had proper legislative provision for generic substitution.  It is not a willy-nilly charter for cheap drugs.  It is unfortunate that this impression has been given.</p><p>  Section 5 is very rigorous.  The Irish Medicines Board is required to apply considerable tests.  I know we are not discussing section 5 but so many references are being made to this issue that I feel it necessary to make it absolutely clear to the committee that this is not some kind of charter for cheap drugs.  We are imposing a rigorous requirement on the Irish Medicines Board only to allow generic drugs in the circumstances contemplated in section 5.</p><p>  The issue that is germane to section 4 is Deputy Kelleher's original question about how quickly the board will move.  He and others then moved on to other issues to do with timelines which are also relevant to section 5.  In response to the question about the board, the legislation is being introduced to ensure value for money in the supply of medicines.  That is an overall requirement.  Therefore, the medicines that will be reviewed first are those that cost the most for the patient or the Exchequer.  The Department of Health has asked the Irish Medicines Board to prioritise the classes of medicine that result in the greatest cost.  There are 20 currently identified, including statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  I have a table that I can give to the committee.  There are 6,000 different items, so this will have to be phased in.  It will not be possible to do it immediately or quickly across the board.  The Irish Medicines Board is expert in this area.  The Department of Health has held conversations with it about its general work programme.  It will deal with the areas that I have mentioned first and it will take time for the matter to be addressed.</p></speech>

It sets out that the board shall have 180 days to make decisions on such applications and allows it to request further information from the authorisation holder if necessary.  As currently drafted, the 180-day period does not begin to run until such time as this additional information is provided.</p><p>  In addition, section 18 provides that a supplier of an item may make an application to the HSE seeking the inclusion of a product on the list of reimbursable items.  The HSE shall agree a reimbursement price for the supplier and make a final decision for inclusion on the list within 180 days.  The HSE may seek further information from the supplier as part of the application process.  As currently drafted, the 180 days shall not begin until the further information requested has been supplied.  This is not fully in compliance with Article 6 of Council Directive 89/105/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products.  Article 6 of the directive provides for the suspension of time limits pending receipt of the additional information rather than setting the clock back at zero.  This article must be interpreted as applying to any decision which influences the amount of coverage by reimbursement systems.  This includes decisions on reference groups or groups of interchangeable medicinal products as well as pricing decisions.  Accordingly, I am proposing to amend sections 5(3)(<i>b</i>) and 18(3)(<i>b</i>) to provide for a clock-stopping arrangement so that decisions on interchangeability and reimbursement are taken within a total timeframe of 180 days.  This means that if additional information is sought on day 49 the clock will begin to run again at day 50 on receipt of the information.  This brings these sections into line with the transparency directive.</p></speech>

I oppose section 5 in view of the fact that none of my amendments were accepted.  I cannot accept a section that does not address the concerns that I and many Deputies on this committee, as well as the general public, have.  Eminent clinicians are also exceptionally concerned about the issue of bioavailability of particular epilepsy drugs.</p> <p>In the interest of alleviating concerns - and it is not only a question of concern and disquiet - I cannot in conscience support legislation that overrules strong clinical advice from eminent neurologists and others who are closely associated with this area and who work with patients suffering from epilepsy.  Many people make the mistake of thinking that those who are campaigning for the inclusion of our amendments to the legislation support the idea that epileptics must always take advanced drugs and are concerned that they might be moved to generic drugs.  However, that is not the case.  Many epileptic sufferers use generic drugs already but they are suitable for their condition as they prevent them from going into seizure frequently.  The idea is not that all those who suffer from epilepsy are on high-end drugs and that as a result of a change in the legislation they will all be on cheap drugs.  That is not their concern.  Their concern is that they will not be able to remain on the drugs they are currently on, some of which are generic, and that there may be obligations as a result of the legislation to change from one generic to another generic.  That is the clear issue of concern here.</p><p> Eminent people, representatives of organisations and professionals have appeared before this committee.  We have had numerous representations from individuals who are extremely concerned about this.  There are also organisations and advocacy groups representing other patient cohorts which have not raised concerns, because most people subscribe to the idea that we, in our role of overseeing the spending of taxpayers' money, will campaign for the use of generic drugs.</p><p> I have considered publishing a Private Members' Bill to ensure that we have generic substitution where possible and feasible.  However, with regard to people who suffer from epilepsy, there is a clear body of evidence across the water in the UK.  Nothing in section 5 gives me any reason to do other than object to it and call a division.  The issue is to do with bioavailability.  The Minister knows about this and obviously he has been well briefed on it, but that is the issue of the concern.  The fact that we cannot move our amendments to section 5 means that I must oppose the section in its entirety because of the concerns of those on anti-epileptic drugs and the fact that no genuine effort is being made, not to appease them but to address them.</p></speech>

I again record the fact that it is deeply regrettable that we were not able to pursue the amendments we have validly tabled.  I would like to share with the committee a case of which I have become aware.  The person has epilepsy but it was controlled by the medication he or she was using.  It takes some time to get to that point, as it is a matter a trial and error.  However, at end of last year a substitute was introduced which had very clear adverse consequences for the person.  Such situations are real.  It is not a matter of an alleged fear; rather, it is a reality that will present not for all of those concerned but for some of them.  It is out of concern for that particular cohort of people who suffer from epilepsy that we had sought to deal with this point.</p><p>  I am not surprised that the Irish Medicines Board has presented this document to us.  It was here when we walked into the room and we did not have prior sight of it.  The position was explained by the Chairman; it was not his fault or the fault of the secretariat.  This is very much what the Irish Medicines Board would say - namely, that these people are adequately protected and the matter is catered for within the legislation - but I am not buying that.  International practice shows us that five member states of the European Union, including our nearest neighbour, already accept and provide for the exclusion of AEDs from such provisions, given the experience and knowledge they have regarding the particular need of those with epilepsy for very refined medication.  Make no mistake about it; that should not be a surprise to any of us.  The issue of the address of epilepsy is not only for the body but is very much of the mind.  This is an area of very particular and specific address and science; it is something not to be played with.  </p><p>  The consequences for people of a resumed attack, an epileptic episode or a seizure are huge.  A person who has been seizure-free for a number of years would be able to drive and, hopefully, hold down a job if he or she was fortunate enough to have one.  A range of things are immediately turned on their heads if a further event takes place.  We need to be cognisant of all of that in our deliberations on this matter.</p><p>  I again ask the Minister of State to refer to the points I have made in terms of notification.  We are talking about five amendments which deal with the ongoing maintenance of the list, etc., and the timeframes with regard to pharmacists, prescribers and the general public.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on any or all of that?  What about the point in regard to the do-not-substitute requirement, under which the GP is obliged to write in his or her own handwriting a "Do not substitute" message to the pharmacist?  Will the Minister of State address that point and the consequences for the pharmacist in that situation?  What should the pharmacist do in such a situation as it presents?</p><p>  With regard to the prescribing of ingredients rather than named products - this applies to those who suffer from epilepsy but also to others - that was something the troika had argued for, and it needs to be addressed.  Will the Minister of State advise what his notes in preparation for today's exchange indicate on these matters?</p></speech>

One cannot give someone a different pair of shoes as they may be the wrong size and they may end up taking the feet off them, so to speak.  In the case of epilepsy, changing a person's medications can be far more serious because it can have both short-term and long-term consequences.  In fairness to Epilepsy Ireland, there is an issue in regard to AEDs.  Approximately &euro;75 million per annum is spent on AEDs and, of that, approximately &euro;40 million is spent on one particular drug.  The vast majority of people taking that drug are using it to treat neuropathic pain rather than epilepsy.  In instances in which a medication is being prescribed specifically to prevent seizures, there should not be the flexibility to replace it, because of the implications it could have for the patient.</p> <p>It is not just Epilepsy Ireland or those suffering from epilepsy who have said it; the Moran report, published by the Department in 2010, specifically highlights the issue and states it should be excluded from generic substitution.  The case has been made in the Upper House and at the committee.  If the intention is to ensure there will not be generic substitution for persons with epilepsy, why not provide them with reassurance and include a technical amendment in the legislation to facilitate this?</p></speech>

Some 40,000 people in Ireland have epilepsy and they are concerned about generic substitutes.  Can we do our best to provide more confidence for them?

How can section 13 be of help where a doctor can include on the prescription that the drug prescribed cannot be changed?  Is that section a source of comfort for us, in conjunction with section 5?  </p><p>  No one has mentioned those with chronic pain.  They receive their drugs and the next step is an epidural, followed by a spinal drug implant - I am not sure what it is called.  However, I am concerned that the people I have met - there are thousands around the country - may go from phase 1 to having an epidural and a spinal drug implant.  Will they be able to get it?  I am talking about cheap drugs.  Will section 13 be of comfort in order that people will be able to get the epilepsy drugs they need and that the pharmacy or the Irish Medicines Board will not be able to change them?  The Irish Medicines Board states medicines will only be substituted where it is safe to do so.  Will it be of help if the prescribing doctor includes on the prescription that the drug prescribed cannot be changed?</p></speech>

Over the weekend I met epileptics who had a difficulty.  Part of the difficulty is the confidence factor in making a change.  We need to allay the concerns of those who are genuinely upset.  We heard from the Irish Epilepsy Association on Thursday and it presented a strong case to us.  It is not opposed to the legislation, but there is a fear which is partly due to a disengagement on the part of the Irish Medicines Board from Epilepsy Ireland and partly due to the change in the branding of medication.  It is a matter of confidence and familiarity.  Deputy Denis Naughten has made the point that when an anti-epileptic drug, AED, is changed, it has a profound impact.  We must allay that fear.</p></speech>

I appreciate the concerns expressed and have met Epilepsy Ireland to discuss the matter.  I have carefully considered everything that has been, including the matters raised at the committee last week.  I met the relevant body sometime back and had a good discussion with it.  </p><p>  With the permission of the Chairman, I will spell out the provisions of section 5.  The Irish Medicines Board will, if the legislation is passed, have statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a list of interchangeable medicinal products.  The Minister or the Department will not perform this task.  It will be an expert decision taken by the Irish Medicines Board.  Nothing we are doing today or in the course of passage of the legislation will cause a particular drug to be included or substituted for another.  That will not be done by Parliament or the Minister.  It will only be done by the Irish Medicines Board under a very strict and robust regime that it will have to follow, as set out in section 5(5), which provides that the board shall not add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable products unless it is satisfied that the medicinal product has the following characteristics:<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the active substances of the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products,<br />(<i>b</i>) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products, and<br />(<i>c</i>) has the same route of administration as each of the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products.</blockquote>I accept that this is an issue of confidence and trust.  We should have trust in public institutions.  We need to be able to trust institutions such as the Irish Medicines Board.  The Oireachtas has that trust and if it is a question of communicating that trust and confidence; we have a responsibility to do so and ensure people are confident.  The Irish Medicines Board briefed the committee and the point is well encapsulated by the quotation provided by Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  The board points out - it is true - that medicines will only be substituted where it is safe to do so.  That is not a generalised statement on safety, whereby the Oireachtas will state to the board that it only should do so if it is safe.  We are spelling out what we mean by safe.  The medicine must be interchangeable in the context I have set out.</p><p>  Section 5(7) provides that the Irish Medicines Board shall not add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable products if satisfied that there is a difference in bioavailability, in other words, the amount of the active substance.  This refers to the element of the drug that has an effect and does the job the drug is supposed to do.  If there is a difference in bioavailability between the product and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products, the board cannot approve it if it &quot;may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them&quot;.  That is a strong requirement and test.  The board cannot substitute or add a medicinal product where it contains more than two active substances, or where the device for the administration of the product carries significantly different instructions for use than the devices for the administration of the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products, where the medicinal product is a biological rather than a chemical entity, or where it cannot be safely substituted for each of the interchangeable products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable products.  Only where the board is satisfied that the medicinal product satisfies the conditions set out in section 5(5) and (7) can it add it to the group of interchangeable products.</p><p>  The point raised by Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor and others concerns section 13.  In addition to the protection provided in section 5(5) and (7), section 13 includes the provision that where a branded interchangeable medicinal product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, be exempt from substitution, the prescriber shall write &ldquo;do not substitute&rdquo; on the prescription.</p> <p>In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written under prescription, that is, he or she is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products.  I emphasise that the Bill does not provide that medicinal products will be included or otherwise in a group of interchangeable medicinal products.  It is not appropriate that there should be a statutory exemption and I will come back to that in due course.  It follows that the non-inclusion of an exemption does not mean a product will automatically be included in a group of interchangeable products.  We are not making a decision under the legislation to include products in a list or to make products interchangeable; we are simply providing a statutory framework for the IMB to do the work it is required to do and to follow the test set out for it in the Bill.  The committee will not make a decision that this or that product will be interchangeable for this or that other product.  We do not have the expertise to do that anyway.  As Minister of State, I do not and most, if not all, committee members would not purport to be in a position to do that.  The IMB is available to us to do that and there is a justifiably high level of trust in the board to do that.</p><p> The purpose of the Bill is to provide that the IMB has statutory responsibility to decide what medicinal products will be included in a group of interchangeable medicinal products.  In doing so, the board is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable.  I also emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the list of interchangeable products, the IMB is obliged to have regard to the criteria set out in section 5.  These criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the joint Department of Health-HSE report entitled, Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution, the so-called Moran report of 2010, regarding criteria for interchangeability, to which Deputy Naughten referred.</p><p> This is why I respectfully disagree with the suggestion that there should be a blanket statutory exclusion of any drug or class of drugs.  It would be inappropriate in this context to include a provision that would have the effect of statutorily excluding a particular class of medicinal products from being added to a group of interchangeable medicinal products while the IMB would have responsibility for determining whether all other medicinal products marketed in the State should be added to a list of interchangeable products.  It is not an appropriate way to legislate when one consider what we are doing.  We are introducing for the first time a statutory basis for generic substitution, which everybody has called for for years.  I do not make a partisan point about this but it is finally happening now and everybody is in favour of it.  It is right that we should support the introduction of this regime but we are only setting down the statutory basis for this.  We are putting rigorous controls and a rigorous test in place and we will rely on the expert decision-making of the IMB.</p><p> I do not wish to pre-empt or seek to anticipate what decision the board will make on AEDs.  I do not know what the decision will be but we should not fetter the professional, expert discretion of the board's members in this regard.  I have met representatives of Epilepsy Ireland and I had a good discussion with them during which I explained my position on this.  Generic medicines must meet the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine.  All the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and to meet the requirements of the IMB and, therefore, that is the basis on which I strongly urge colleagues to support the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

I hope the Irish Epilepsy Association representatives are listening to the committee's deliberations because they should have good grounds for having their confidence enhanced.  The Minister of State has gone to a great deal of trouble to tie everything down and to ensure everybody gets the appropriate medicine.  He was correct to emphasise the need for us to push for generic medicines because the money being wasted in the State drug payments, which could be easily be used more effectively for other health services, is scandalous and we have to stick to this.  I presume if there are problems for epilepsy sufferers in this area following the passage of the legislation, they will be examined.  However, it seems to me that the Minister of State has covered everything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013031900008#G00300"><p>This is an important issue and we have received many representations on this.  We have also had hearings and I want clarification.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I again refer to the shoe analogy.  If he goes into a shoe shop tomorrow morning to buy a pair of shoes and picks a pair out and the retailer says he has another pair in the same size that look the same but are &euro;20 cheaper, he would not buy them without first trying them on and that is the difficulty for someone with epilepsy.  It might say the same thing on the tin and that will be the case because if it is a generic medicine, it will be a substitute for whatever is the market leader.  There is a niche in the market and some of the largest players in generic medicine in Europe are based in this country.  They are successful and they can see a market leading drug that is coming out of licence.  They will manufacture this product, which is supposed to be the same as the product on the market.  It would not be a generic medicine if that was not the case.  That is grand for 99.5% of the population but there are people who, for one reason or another, will have a reaction to the medicine, possibly because of the way it is formulated and so on.  We can identify a cohort of the population who have a problem with generic substitution, that is, epilepsy sufferers.</p><p>  The Minister of State said section 7(1) provides reassurance that substitution cannot happen if there is a clinically significant difference in the efficacy of the drug.  I fully accept that but the difficulty is there is not in many cases a clinically significant difference between the two groups but, on an individual basis, people react differently because of the type of condition epilepsy is and the legislation cannot make provision for this because of the way it is worded and because of its purpose.</p><p>  The other issue is a greater concern, which we will deal with later under section 13, but it was referenced by the Minister of State in arguing his case.  He said in regard to substitution that the IMB will progressively go through a number of different medications and it could be a while before it gets to AEDs or other substitute drugs for epilepsy sufferers.  The difficulty is pharmacists are substituting medicines at the moment and they are not even telling the patient that they are substituting the particular medicine.</p> <p>As stated, we will return to this matter when we come to section 13.  However, what I have described is happening.  If that is the case and statutory provision has not been made, how can the Minister of State assure us that it will only apply to the 20 target groups in question once the legislation has been enacted?  It is already happening, which runs contrary to the provisions in the existing legislation.</p></speech>

What he said, however, will not assuage people's concerns.  Equally, he did not really address the fundamental issue.  I read the relevant passage of the Moran report and it indicates that anti-epileptic drugs, AEDs, cannot be classed as interchangeable in the absence of a critical analysis being carried out of availability and all the other considerations relating to particular medicines.  It is fine for the phrase "do not substitute" to be written on prescriptions, but there comes a time when patients find comfort in and benefit from certain drugs, be they generic or otherwise.  I refer to those who suffer from epilepsy and the drugs to which I refer prevent them from having frequent seizures.  There are no difficulties with many of the other medicines being used by epileptics in the treatment of pain, migraines, etc.  Those with epilepsy are specifically concerned about those medicines which prevent them from having seizures.  Consultant neurologists and others also have grave concerns about this matter.  I am certainly not competent to second-guess their opinions, but I certainly respect these opinions which are very clear and state AEDs should be exempt from the rules on substitution.  That is why we should be extremely cautious in the moves we are making in this regard.</p><p>  The various advocacy groups have not expressed the same concerns as those expressed by Epilepsy Ireland and consultant neurologists about the practice of substituting medicines.  Epilepsy Ireland has stated, "However, we are vehemently opposed to any system that will allow for patients currently prescribed a particular brand to be switched from that brand to a generic form of the drug, or to be switched from one generic to another."  The issue of concern which arises, therefore, is not switching to generic drugs but rather the concept of switching in the first instance.  That is why I will be opposing section 5 in its entirety.  I will be seeking all the support I can muster, but my prospects in that regard do not appear very hopeful.  Another reason I will be opposing the section is this matter has given rise to huge disquiet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013031900009#H00300"><p>As the Minister of State is aware, the Moran report - he probably has a copy of it in front of him - contains a recommendation to the effect that AEDs should be excluded from the terms of the promised legislation on generic substitution.  That is my clear recall of what is contained in the report which was produced by a joint working group involving the Department of Health and the HSE.  The line taken in the report should be both followed and adhered to.  As other members and I have stated, the practice in many other jurisdictions - not only in Europe but elsewhere - must give rise to concerns in our proceeding along the course suggested.  It is not the case that we should be using trial and error in respect of those who have found stability in their lives in the aftermath of a process of trial and error.  The consequences of a misfit for those on anti-epileptic drugs could be absolutely life-changing.  That is the real concern.</p><p>  I am sure that, like me, other members have been advised of specific cases in the not too distant past in which substitution has occurred, perhaps in pharmacies, in the filling of prescriptions.  I am not completely clear on whether substitution took place at that point or at the point where such prescriptions were actually written.  However, that would be my guess.  When substitution occurred, it gave rise to serious consequences.  In one instance about which I am very clear, the patient was obliged to return to both their GP and their specialist and put back on the original  branded product.  In that case, it was not another generic substitute but a branded product.  The incident to which I refer occurred at Christmas time.  As the Minister of State is aware, when such an incident occurs, a patient must not have a seizure for a full 12 months before he or she can resume driving and a number of other activities.  It is extremely important that those with epilepsy and who drive do not have occurrences or events which can significantly impact on the quality of their lives.  The risk is too great.  We should, therefore, adhere to what is recommended in the Moran report.  </p><p>  It is my view that we should press the amendment, but I do not want a division to occur.  I intend no personal criticism of the Minister of State, but there is obstinacy in this matter.  I support the Bill and also what it is intended to achieve.</p></speech>

The Irish Medicines Board will have a central role to play in what is contemplated in the legislation.  I do not want any of those present - members, the Chairman and everyone else involved in the legislative process - to react to what I am about to say because it is not intended in a critical way.  The point is that we cannot substitute ourselves for the Irish Medicines Board.  The board has the relevant expertise in this area; not only that, it will also be required to carry out very robust tests under section 5.  No one has said this; in fact, the opposite has been said.  I appeal to colleagues not to, as it were, imagine that the Irish Medicines Board cannot be trusted in some way or that we have to keep certain elements of what is proposed away from its control.  That would be the effect of providing for a statutory exclusion of a particular drug or class of drugs.  We should proceed with the Bill in accordance with the scheme we have put in place and trust and have confidence in the Irish Medicines Board in what we are calling on it to do with regard to AEDs or other drugs.</p><p>  I wish to make matters absolutely clear in respect of the Moran report.  I understand why it might be interpreted as having recommended that AEDs be excluded.</p> <p>It does not recommend the exclusion of AEDs.  The Moran report sets out ten criteria in terms of interchangeability which the Bill reflects.  It then states:<blockquote><br />General circumstances where medicines will not be regarded as interchangeable (on the basis of current evidence and manufacturing standards) include the following:1. Where there is a difference in bioavailability between brands of the same medicines, particularly if the medicine has a narrow therapeutic index.  Changing preparations may result in sub-therapeutic or toxic doses.  Products in this group include the following anti-epileptic medicines &hellip; CFC-free Beclomethasone metered dose inhalers, etc.</blockquote>The report is essentially stating anti-epileptic drugs are examples of the types of drugs that should not be considered for interchangeability.  If they are not interchangeable and the report is correct, they would not pass the test as set out in section 5.  We are setting out the test which the Irish Medicines Board must observe.  I appeal to colleagues to communicate trust and confidence in the board, as Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick said.  The legislation sets the statutory basis and it is up to the board to carry out this important work.</p></speech>

Will the legislation, particularly section 13, ensure this does not happen?</p></speech>

Section 13 states:<blockquote><br />When a branded interchangeable medicinal product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber [the doctor] is satisfied that the medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution in accordance with Chapter 2, the prescriber shall write, legibly and by hand, &ldquo;do not substitute&rdquo; on the prescription beside the name of the medicinal product.</blockquote>In such cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription and is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products.  This section offers additional comfort to the robust test that has to be adhered to in the provisions laid down in section 5.</p></speech>

The inclusion of the clarity for which we have been arguing in this legislation will immediately deal with that aspect.  There have been recorded consequences.  It is hugely important not to wait for the Irish Medicines Board's review and decisions.  There is already ample evidence that there is an issue to be addressed and one way to address it, contrary to the Minister's argument, is to place the exemption clearly in the legislation.</p></speech>

If a medicine is prescribed generically, pharmacists can fill the prescription with the appropriate product.  Pharmacists can also supply a parallel-imported product.  As matters stand, this is perfectly legal and I am not suggesting it should be otherwise.</p><p>  I have stated we are dealing with a human situation where people rely on medication to treat epilepsy.  Concerns have been raised with us by Epilepsy Ireland and some medical doctors.  My officials and I have carefully considered what has been said.

In some cases, there may be a number of brands of a product that can be substituted.  One can have Mrs. Murphy, for example, receiving brand A for her heart condition for the past six years but receiving brand B one day and brand C on another.  This may be only one of her medications, as she could be on 15 tablets for 15 conditions.  This switch could confuse her.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State ensure that if substitution takes place there is some consistency, so that a patient is not switching every month from one medicine to another?  That only adds to the confusion.</p><p> More important, there is a requirement for measures to be put into the legislation such that the adhesive label that the pharmacist puts on the medicine outlines the particular medical condition that is being treated.  At least then, if an individual has 14 or 15 medications and the brand is changed from month to month or every few months, he will know that a given medicine is for his blood pressure or something else, because he will be used to having a medicine from one particular manufacturer.  Such an individual understands that a given tablet is for his heart and so on.  This is not only to ensure compliance in taking the medication but also to deal with the fact that when that individual visits a consultant and the consultant asks whether he is on anything for his heart, he might say that he does not know because he has 15 different tablets and he is unsure what they are for.  Unless that individual brings the bag of medication with him he will be unable to explain the details to the consultant.  There is an issue of familiarity with regard to medications prescribed at the moment.</p><p> I have no difficulty with generic substitution but there should be some consistency and, more importantly, the exact purpose of any given medication should be put on the label in order that the individual knows he is taking a particular tablet for a given condition.  It would facilitate compliance.</p></speech>

It is fair to have regard to people's information and knowledge about the drugs they are prescribed.  The professionals across the board have an interest in the communication of accurate information to patients and in ensuring that people know what they are taking.</p><p>  The Deputy makes a fair point about consistency and the need for communication.  I will consider more carefully what he has had to say with regard to the broader question as well but I am unsure whether it is something we need to change specifically in this legislation.  Anyway, he has made some fair points and given some good insights.</p></speech>

I know from first-hand experience that a person will ring up a health care professional and indicate that he is on a particular tablet and the professional will explain that it is for his heart.  However, if the medications are being changed frequently then even the health care professionals will not know the details.  A small amendment to the legislation could address that and it could be applicable not only to this legislation but across the board.  Introducing this legislation without the consumer focus will lead to confusion and problems with compliance from the point of view of citizens and patients when it comes to taking medication.</p></speech>

Second, section 24 is of some relevance to the point raised by the Deputy because it has to do with the intervals between reviews.  It is not as if it would take place every week or every couple of weeks.  Intervals will be provided for with regard to price reviews.</p></speech>

If we take that in the context of the reference pricing that we will come to later, it means that if a patient refuses to take the substituted medicine, he or she will have to pay the difference in the cost.</p><p>  To return to the point I made earlier, it is important that people are given an explanation of exactly what is happening here in regard to generic substitution.  I am concerned that a patient on a medical card will go to the supplier with a list of 14 or 15 prescribed medicines and pay the prescription charge and that he will then be told that medicines A, B and C have been substituted.  The patient will be told he can accept the substitution or pay an extra &euro;15, or whatever the charge, if he wants the original brands prescribed.  It is important the situation is explained to patients and that they are reassured with regard to the generic medicine they are being given.  It should be pointed out to them which medicine is being substituted and its purpose.  Time must be given to the patients and they should not be just told that they take the alternative medicines or take their usual ones and get charged extra.  The approach used with patients is important.  It should not just be a case of telling them that it will cost them if they opt for their existing medicine.</p></speech>

Communication is important and it is important the professionals involved, the prescriber and the pharmacist, communicate with the patients concerned so that people know what is being done.  When this legislation and new regime are implemented, it will behove everybody involved, particularly the professionals, to ensure there is clarity and communication and that the maximum information and reassurance is given to patients.</p></speech>

I hope also that all of us, as citizens and patients, will be encouraged to take a closer interest in medication and medicines prescribed for people.

We could all attest to the fact that pharmacists in the front line do as a matter of course - this is my personal experience and observation - take the time to engage with clients and present information on prescription fulfilment etc.  However, there may be exceptions and situations that do not tick the boxes as well as most do.  Therefore, should there be some strengthening of the indication given on this?  This should not just apply to pharmacists.  GPs may also require a prompt in this regard.  Deputy Naughten may elaborate if he was directing this in some other way.</p></speech>

Nobody in either profession would take offence at that.  The critical issue is that patients, now as never before, need to understand the situation, because they are now being presented with a choice that heretofore they never had to make.  Taking a little extra time with them and ensuring they have full knowledge and understanding of the change is important.  I agree with the sentiment of what Deputy Naughten said, but I feel that is already the practice in the overwhelming number of situations.  However, there may be some who need that extra prompt.</p></speech>

I believe they do an exceptional job.  However, the difficulty is that in many cases what will happen is that GPs will prescribe the active ingredient and the pharmacist will fill the prescription based on the cheapest generic drug available.</p> <p>The pharmacist is complying with the law in this area as it currently stands and as envisaged in the guidelines set out by the Irish Medicines Board.  The difficulty is that it is not actually explained in some isolated instances.  I do not really have a concern if somebody is getting a once-off prescription for one or two medications.  I am talking about the many cases in which an elderly person - perhaps a relative - is picking up the prescription.  If a change is made all of a sudden to a branded product that he or she has always been on and is used to, he or she might get confused.  As we introduce this new regime, we need to take time to acknowledge that it will present a particular challenge to a particular cohort of the population.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was right to point out that this does not relate to pharmacists only, as it also relates to GPs.  I will come to that when we reach section 13.</p></speech>

GP surgeries are extremely busy at the moment.  They have a huge throughput of patients.  When errors are made with prescriptions, the pharmacists pick it up 99.99% of the time.  I will give the example of someone with epilepsy.  When he or she gets to see a consultant, a prescription will be made after a series of trial and error uses of various medications.  The patient and the consultant settle on a particular medication and the consultant writes on the prescription that the medication cannot be substituted for any other generic medicine.  That is fine.  The patient gets the prescription filled by the pharmacist and off they go.  When the patient needs a repeat prescription, he or she goes back to the GP and everything is fine.  What happens if, six months down the road, the GP forgets to reiterate on the next repeat prescription script that the medication should not be substituted?  Some type of safety net is needed to ensure that a medication which has consistently been used is not substituted all of a sudden if it is not mentioned on the prescription that it is not to be automatically substituted.  Some type of safety net is required to double-check that there has not been a change in the prescription.</p></speech>

The Irish Pharmacy Union has sent us a communication asking us to raise this matter with the Minister.  All sorts of circumstances could present themselves if the "do not substitute" notation is not in the handwriting of the prescribing GP.  Somebody could devise a brand.  Any number of other situations might present.  We were invited to ask the Minister to outline what a pharmacist is supposed to do when presented with a prescription that says "do not substitute" in a form other than the handwriting of the prescribing GP.  Should the pharmacist send the patient back to the GP if he or she questions the veracity of the message?  If the pharmacist ensures the patient's needs are met, can the Minister ensure he or she will not be left open to sanctions from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland?  It is understandable that such questions are arising in the pharmacy sector.  Perhaps the Minister of State can respond to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-19a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013031900013#M01000"><p>Many different circumstances could arise.  Section 13 clearly provides that in order to preclude substitution, the "prescriber shall write, legibly and by hand, "do not substitute" on the prescription".  That could leave it open for the patient or someone else to write "do not substitute" on the prescription.  I know that would be of concern.  Is there a way of addressing that?  Is a sanction being provided for?  I would also like clarity on what will happen in the event of a pharmacist being unsure of the authenticity or veracity of a handwritten note that says "do not substitute".  What mechanism will be available to the pharmacist to address such concerns?  Will he or she be able to pick up the telephone and ring the prescribing doctor, or will the patient have to go back to the GP?  I am asking these questions because it is clear that many people are attached to the medicines they are on.  We all know people who only want the blue tablet or the green tablet and no other colour tablet will do them.  If, after we include this provision in legislation, a doctor makes a clinical decision that the person's medicine is suitable for substitution, it will be very easy for a patient to write "do not substitute" on the prescription in nice legible handwriting to ensure no change is made.  As the Minister of State knows, such handwriting is totally different from medical handwriting.  Obviously, that should be an offence.  I am concerned to ensure pharmacists who sense that a prescription has been amended will be able to take action to confirm the authenticity of the request.  If they find it is not an authentic request while they have the prescription at hand, will they be able to override it by means of verbal contact with the prescribing GP?</p></speech>

We live in a human world where errors can occur.  It should be emphasised, leaving aside this legislation completely, that the high degree of reliance we place on the professionalism of those involved in our prescriptions system - doctors, consultants, GPs and pharmacists - is well repaid.  I think we can all agree that the instances of human error causing something bad, dangerous or worse to happen are few and far between.  I have no reason to believe that will change under this regime.  I would like to consider some of the issues that have been raised in a little more depth.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the recourse pharmacists might have in particular scenarios to which they might be exposed.  I will consider that and revert to the Deputy.  It is important to draw attention to section 15 of this Bill, which gives us some comfort in this regard.  It states:<blockquote><br />Nothing in this Part shall be construed to affect a pharmacist's discretion, when presented with a prescription, to not dispense, whether temporarily or permanently, a medicinal product in accordance with the prescription (including any substitute medicinal product) if, in his or her professional opinion as a pharmacist, the use of the medicinal product by the patient for whom the prescription was issued may be prejudicial to the health of the patient.</blockquote></p> <p>I have an amendment in this regard with which we will deal shortly.  That gives, as it were, a statutory basis for the pharmacist to pause and say, "No.  For a specific reason, I do not think it is appropriate to dispense a particular medication."  That provides some comfort.</p><p> While I do not make little of the issue, there is always the risk of the falsification of a prescription in particular circumstances.  To be honest, I do not know whether it is an offence, but I will risk saying that I imagine that, under the relevant legislation, it is unlawful to falsify a prescription.  However, I will check for the Deputy.</p><p> The point comes back to the issue raised by Deputy Denis Naughten and others that we have a proper information campaign and a proper communications strategy in this regard in order that people will have the confidence to know this new system will work and contains protections.</p></speech>

It is my strong view that section 13 will not comfort pharmacists.  It comes back to the myriad situations that can present.  It is important, in giving effect to their professional judgment, that there be a degree of cover or comfort for pharmacists in order that, in the event that something is other than what was intended, they would be covered.  If we are trusting their professional opinion, on which we do not have a question, any number of situations might present in meeting the &ldquo;do not substitute&rdquo; requirement.  Section 15 only refers to adverse consequences, which is not what we are talking about here in regard to generic substitution, apart from the very important exception of epilepsy which we have spent a lot of time discussing.</p></speech>

As drafted, the section is explicit in its expectation that the pharmacist's professional opinion will inform the decision to dispense on the grounds of the health of the patient.  However, in practice, under the current regulatory regime, one of the most common situations where a pharmacist might refuse to dispense a prescription is where the pharmacist has a concern that the person presenting the prescription may be planning to sell or supply the medicines to other individuals or on the street.  In this case, the pharmacist would usually refuse to dispense the prescription, not necessarily on the basis of a concern for the health of the person named on the prescription but on the basis of concern for the safety of others and the integrity of the supply chain.</p><p>  The pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, expressed concern that the scope of section 15 ought to be broadened to explicitly provide that a pharmacist would not dispense a prescription if he or she had a genuine concern that dispensing the prescription might put others at risk.  I am, therefore, proposing to amend the section to broaden its scope to take into account the obligation of the pharmacist not to dispense a medicine included in a prescription on the basis that it may cause harm to the health of the patient named on the prescription or the health and safety of any member of the public.</p></speech>

The country is awash with these drugs and there is over-prescribing.  Let us be clear.  They are being prescribed legally, but they then find their way into the underworld where people sell them on.  This is an issue of huge concern.</p><p>  I have made this point before.  Pharmacists have spent seven years in college and are highly qualified professionals.  As a society, we do not trust them enough.</p> <p>We always have to look to the GP who prescribes and whose view is sacrosanct.  This is fine.  Let there be a pecking order, but I passionately believe that pharmacists should have a greater role to play in the health of the nation.  They are in every town and village and are a great resource and highly professional and qualified.  I am very concerned that medications such as benzodiazepines are being slushed around society at a fierce pace.  Documentaries have covered this, but as practising politicians, we are all aware that it is clearly a major issue.  Anything that can put checks and balances on prescriptions is a good thing because it might discourage some GPs from over-prescribing, and there is a propensity among some GPs to over-prescribe these medicines, particularly benzodiazepines.</p></speech>

I am not a pharmacist but the people with which I deal in Cork are the most professional, thorough and caring people and a huge resource within society that is perhaps undervalued, as Deputy Kelleher said.  An individual I know who works in a pharmacy takes time to deal with people.  I would love if the Government would look at the issue of over-prescribing.</p></speech>

I share Deputy Kelleher's concern about benzodiazepines, which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others share.  In respect of the Chairman's comments about pharmacists, we are enhancing the role and strengthening the hand of the pharmacist.  With regard to pharmacists declining to dispense, there was a concern that this would affect the health of the individual patient tendering the prescription, but we are now expanding the basis upon which the pharmacist can decline to fill the prescription where there is a broader concern about the health and welfare of others.  That comes back to the point about benzodiazepines.</p></speech>

I do not mean that in a disparaging way.  There is no reference to prescribers and pharmacists in this section.  For example, if something is removed from the list, there is an obligation for the Health Service Executive to notify the manufacturer, but it has no obligation to notify prescribers or pharmacists.  This could present difficulties.  For example, a prescriber or pharmacist may be blissfully unaware that a product has been removed from the list and may continue to prescribe or stock it.  Surely they should be informed at the same time as the manufacturer, as a matter of logistics?  Pharmacists would need to secure other types of medication similar to that item and hold them in stock.  If they are not informed they may not do that, so patients going to their local pharmacists on a regular basis may have to wait a number of days or go elsewhere if the pharmacist is unaware that this product has been removed from the list.  That is the primary purpose of this very logical amendment.  I hope that if he cannot accept it today, he will consider it in the broader context of Report Stage.</p></speech>

I do not know if the phrase should go immediately after "decision"; I would opt to put it in after the reference to the supplier of the item.  The case is irrefutable.  Maximum dissemination of information is hugely important.  Prescribers and pharmacists are key players in all of this.  We are talking about maintenance and ongoing amendments.  Decisions are made in respect of either new medications or other medications that for whatever reason are to be removed.  Strengthening and improving the legislation is a requirement.  The IPU has made the case strongly in support of these amendments.  The Minister of State should be aware of that from his engagement with it.  The purpose of this is to help ensure maximum awareness and the greatest safety not only for those who are prescribers and pharmacists but, most importantly, for end users.</p></speech>

Part 4 of the Bill sets out statutory procedures concerning the supply and reimbursement of medicines and other items to patients under the general medical scheme and community drugs schemes.  Section 19 of the Bill sets out the action to be taken by the HSE where it makes a relevant decision under section 18 of the Bill, namely, to add or refuse to add an item to the reimbursement list, to remove an item from the list or to retain an item on the list.  Section 19(1) provides that, as soon as is practicable but not later than 14 days after making a relevant decision under section 18, the HSE shall give notice in writing of the relevant decision, together with the reasons for it, to the supplier of the item that is the subject of the relevant decision.  Section 19(2) provides that where the HSE has used any expert opinion or recommendation in reaching such a decision, it shall attach a copy of all such expert opinions or recommendations to the notice of the decision provided to the supplier under section 19(1).</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher is proposing to amend section 19(1) to provide that notice of a relevant decision in respect of an application from the supplier of an item which is the subject of the relevant decision be also supplied to prescribers and pharmacists.  Deputy Kelleher is further proposing to amend section 19(2) to provide that any expert opinions or recommendations provided to the supplier under this subsection should also be provided to prescribers and pharmacists.</p> <p> As the purpose of section 19 is to outline the actions to be taken by the HSE in giving notice in writing of a relevant decision under section 18 to the supplier of an item or listed item which is the subject of said decision, I consider that Deputy Billy Kelleher's proposed amendments are not really relevant to section 19.  In such circumstances, I do not propose to accept them.  I draw the committee's attention to the fact that section 17 which has already been agreed to deals in some detail with the establishment of the reimbursement list which will be available and accessible to prescribers and pharmacists.  What we are dealing with in section 19 is a slightly narrower part of the regime where when an application is made by a supplier, there are certain requirements on the HSE to revert, within particular time periods, to that supplier in respect of any decision it makes.  I am not sure whether the amendments relate to what is proposed in the section.</p></speech>

Section 19 relates to the action to be taken by the HSE in circumstances where it makes decisions in respect of the provisions contained in section 18 which relates to the maintenance of the reimbursement list.  That list will be updated from time to time and products will be added to, retained on or deleted from it.  There are myriad reasons products may or may not be on the list.  There are certain products which may have been on the list but which will now be removed from it.  Prescribers and pharmacists should be informed when particular products are removed from the list and they should be made aware of the reasons for their removal.  Let us consider the case of a person who is normally prescribed a particular medicine and may go to his or her GP, obtain a prescription and present it to the pharmacist to be filled.  The pharmacist will then give the individual involved the relevant medicine while remaining blissfully unaware that it has been removed from the list.  Surely there must be some mechanism by means of which prescribers and pharmacists can be informed.  Am I completely missing something?</p></speech>

However, prescribers and pharmacists should be informed when a product is being taken off or added to it.  Will GPs and pharmacists be required to go online each morning or afternoon to see what has been added to or deleted from the list?  The list of various products to which we are referring is huge.  In order to ensure there will be a full flow of information, when products are added to or deleted from the list, the HSE should issue - probably by electronic means - a circular advising dispensers and prescribers of the changes made.  That would make absolute sense.</p></speech>

These are normal steps which should be taken in this regard.  I have no particular knowledge of the extent of items being added to or deleted from the reimbursement list.  However, I am well aware that many medical card holders were seriously discommoded when the decision to remove from the list all coeliac targeted products - that is, those which are gluten free - was taken last year.  It is all very well to state it was cheaper for those who did not have medical cards to purchase such products in supermarkets, but what was done had an extremely serious impact on medical card holders in straitened circumstances in accessing gluten free products.  The consequence has been that many pharmacies with which I am familiar have significantly reduced the number of such products they stock.  The products to which I refer were sold in pharmacies for a purpose.  I accept that they may not appear on the shelves of pharmacies in the future and that supermarkets may corner this part of the market.  However, the decision to which I refer is continuing to have a serious impact on coeliacs throughout the country.</p><p>  This is one of the footprints in time of our very being as a people.  This is a very serious matter and it is most regrettable that the Government did not accept the arguments to the effect that it should not have proceeded with the change to which I refer.  I instance this matter only to illustrate what can happen.  I suggest, not through a further amendment but rather in the context of the common sense of what Deputy Billy Kelleher is arguing for, the IPU and the IMO be included.</p></speech>

The Deputies may well have raised an issue in respect of which I could perhaps seek further clarification between now and Report Stage as to precisely the technical process by which changes are made to the list.  Deputy Billy Kelleher inquired as to whether prescribers and dispensers would be obliged to consult the list online each day.  It would make some sense if the relevant website issued automatic notifications of changes to the list, rather than it just being a case of the list being changed.</p></speech>

However, section 19 deals with the process by which the HSE will make decisions and revert to suppliers on such decisions.  I respectfully suggest that what Deputy Billy Kelleher proposes in his amendments is excessive and unnecessary, particularly if he is advocating that all prescribers and pharmacists and, as Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in recommended, the IMO and IPU be individually notified, either by post or e-mail, of any changes which occur.  I accept and understand the fair point which has been made on people being notified that the list has changed rather than being obliged to continually to check to see if changes have been made.  Perhaps a specific notification might be included on the website, to which people would be periodically referring, to draw attention to the fact that changes have been made.  I will certainly consider the matter before Report Stage.  However, I am not minded to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

However, section 19(2) states:<blockquote><br />Where the Executive has made a relevant decision based on any expert opinions or recommendations, it shall attach copies of all such opinions and recommendations to the notice concerned under <i>subsection (1)</i> to be given to the supplier of the item or listed item the subject of the relevant decision.</blockquote>That is fine, but the relevant information should be available to prescribers and pharmacists.  In other words, they should be alerted to the fact that certain products have been added to or removed from the list.  The information to which I refer should be made available online or disseminated in some other way.  I have made my case.  I accept that the Minister of State may have concerns about the volume of information involved, but when a product is removed from the list, people should be notified.  At the very least, there should be an alert system on the website to indicate that certain products are no longer on the reimbursement list.  Let us ignore for one moment the fact that pharmacists and doctors will be discommoded and concentrate on circumstances where a particular product might be prescribed and the GP or pharmacist involved is not aware of its removal from the list.  The very fact that these professionals have not been informed will give rise to difficulties for the consumer.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine this matter.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that this amendment is necessary, given the difficulties experienced by some countries in securing an adequate supply of necessary medicinal products following price reductions.  This proposed amendment brings section 21 into line with section 24, which already provides that the HSE must have regard to this criterion when setting a reference price for a group of interchangeable medicinal products.  In addition, I am also proposing to amend this section to include a reference to agreements such as those recently agreed with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI, to ensure that the State can continue to benefit from price reductions contained in those agreements.</p></speech>

Section 7 of the Pharmacy Act is amended to ensure that it will be a function of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, to ensure that pharmacists operate generic substitution in accordance with the legislation.  Section 18 of the Pharmacy Act is amended to allow for the making of regulations imposing duties on pharmacy owners and supervising pharmacists to supervise compliance by pharmacists with the generic substitution provisions.  Section 35 of the Pharmacy Act is amended to include failure to comply with the generic substitution provisions as a ground for complaint against pharmacists.</p><p>  I am now proposing to further amend section 35(1) of the Pharmacy Act 2007 to provide that a failure by a pharmacist to comply with regulations made under section 18(1A) of the Pharmacy Act, as inserted by section 32(<i>b</i>) of this Bill, will constitute a ground for complaint.  I am also proposing to amend section 36 of the Pharmacy Act, which refers to complaints about registered retail pharmacy businesses.</p><p>  The amendments at 36(1)<i>(</i>i) and 36(1)(ii), are technical amendments recommended by the Parliamentary Counsel.  These are to ensure that the terminology here is in line with standard usage.  The substantive amendment at subsection (<i>d</i>)(iii) provides that failure by a pharmacy owner to comply with any of the duties referred to in section 18(1A) of the Pharmacy Act 2007 will constitute a ground for a complaint.  This provision addresses concerns that section 32 as drafted places an unfair burden on pharmacists when compared to pharmacy owners.  This amendment will allow pharmacy owners to be held accountable for breaches of duties to supervise compliance with the generic substitution provisions of this Bill.</p></speech>

I refer to section 14(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Pharmacy Act 2007, under which a bankrupt will be removed from the register of pharmacists.  Is this absolutely necessary?  While one may be bankrupt, it is not a corollary that one is incapable of dispensing medicines or seeking employment with another pharmacist.  Why is it necessary to strike an individual off the register as a result of bankruptcy?  A pharmacist will have spent seven years in college to earn his or her qualifications but his or her business may go pear-shaped.  Why should a pharmacist lose the right to practise if declared bankrupt?</p> <p>I want to examine the matter in the context of tabling an amendment to deal with the specific issue under section 32 and in view of the fact that the Minister of State referred to the Pharmacy Act 2007.  It strikes me as bizarre.  I presume that if a GP is declared bankrupt he or she is not struck off a register.  Does it happen to a dentist?  If a nurse goes bankrupt is he or she struck off the register of nurses?  </p></speech>

No malpractice is suggested and that must be the clear critical determinant of whether somebody is suitable to practise as a pharmacist.  It is without question that in times such as these situations can present that nobody could ever have planned for or catered to.  It is within the bounds of possibility that a person could find himself or herself bankrupt.  Pharmacy is a very competitive sector.  There are a significant number of pharmacists in my home town yet a new one has opened in the past week.  I was stunned because the new pharmacy is located next door to an existing outlet.  The sector is almost at saturation point and not everybody can survive.  Deputy Kelleher has made the reasoned argument that failure to succeed in an economic situation does not suggest inappropriateness to continue as a professional in the sector.  A valid case must be considered here.  The Minister of State probably knows more than me about the matter and he might consider the matter for Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are talking about certain duties that pharmacists must undertake in order to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  A failure to comply with the provisions of the Bill could be the subject of complaint made under the Pharmacy Act 2007.</p><p>  The question of bankruptcy as grounds for being struck off is wholly unrelated to the legislation that we are dealing with today.  It might be the basis for an interesting discussion on whether bankruptcy should be grounds for being struck off for any of the professions.  The matter does not arise today.  </p></speech>

As a consequence, the board is obliged to give notice in writing to all authorisation holders of products already included in a group of interchangeable medicinal products of a relevant decision that proposes to change the composition of the group of interchangeable medicinal products.  All proposals by the board in this context are therefore material decisions for the purposes of Part I of Schedule 1.  It is unclear what would be an immaterial one, they are all material.  In those circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
