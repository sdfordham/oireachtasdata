The sub-committee is near to finalising its report on developing aquaculture and it appreciates Mr. Keatinge for attending to update it on the progress made in establishing the fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Keatinge" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000003#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the sub-committee for this opportunity to update it on the progress made to date in establishing a functioning network of fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.</p><p>  FLAGs are provided for under priority Axis 4 of the European Fisheries Fund.  They are community-led, local-development initiatives that focus on the sustainable development of fisheries areas.  Funding is through the European Fisheries Fund and the national development plan.  Following decisions made by FLAG boards, financial assistance, complementary to other Community instruments, is provided for the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas eligible as part of an overall strategy which seeks to support the implementation of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, in particular taking account of its socio-economic effects.</p><p>  BIM, as the State agency with primary responsibility for the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund and with a long history of working directly with the seafood sector as well as the wider fisheries community, is tasked by its parent Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with implementing the European Fisheries Fund, including priority Axis 4, the sustainable development of fisheries areas.</p><p>  The FLAGs are established pursuant to Article 43 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1198/2006 which states:<blockquote>A fisheries area selected for assistance shall be limited in size and, as a general rule, shall be smaller than NUTS, nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, level 3.  However, the area should be sufficiently coherent from a geographical, economic and social point of view.  Assistance should target, as a priority, areas with (a) low population density, or (b) fishing in decline, or (c) small fisheries communities.</blockquote>Following discussions at the operational programme monitoring committee, and subsequently with the European Commission services and our managing authority, the Department, it was agreed Axis 4 would operate throughout the Irish coast with the exception of towns and cities with a population in excess of 15,000.  It was further decided that this approach would be best delivered by adopting a regional approach to the establishment of FLAGs.  On that basis, a total of six FLAGs were identified.</p><p>  I have enclosed maps of the FLAG networks in the UK and in France in my written submission.  I could have selected others but these, by way of example, illustrate my points on our network.  In England and Wales, north Cornwall and Devon have a FLAG designation but there is vast gap in designations along the southern coast all the way to Hastings, south of London, then further gaps from there along the east, all the way to Norfolk and then up to Yorkshire.  The UK has stipulated that the FLAGs will be small.  The downside of that approach, however, is that vast swathes of the coastline are left out.  In France, with a total of 11 FLAGs, the authorities there concentrated on small specific areas, covering only small fractions of the entire coastline.  Scotland, in contrast, might be said to have adopted a model closer to the Irish one.  It has attempted to create FLAGs at a NUTS level 3 that incorporate the entire coastline.</p><p>  During 2013, all six FLAG in Ireland were established.  In addition, it was agreed that in each region the FLAGs could, as part of their development strategy, identify several sub‐priority areas, generally not more than two, wherein up to 70% of its operational budget could be concentrated.  In the event that sub-priority areas are identified, the development strategy for these areas could form an integral part of the overall strategy of a FLAG.  The balance of the operational budget would be available to projects from the remainder of the region covered by the FLAG.</p><p>  The development strategies were produced in the past 12 months and cover each of the regions.  I will make copies available to the sub-committee but other copies can be downloaded from the BIM website.  While BIM, the implementing body, has facilitated their formation, the FLAGs in every case consist of an independent board made up of public and private partners from various local, relevant, socio-economic sectors, selected according to the principle of proportionality.  BIM will examine a project to ensure it is complaint with regulations but it never addresses whether the project should be funded.  BIM also completes all claims of the managing authority back to the European Commission, as well as undertaking all audit visits by the Commission.  BIM&rsquo;s role is one of assistance rather than one of direction.</p><p>  By way of oversight and horizontal integration, a national implementation body has been established, comprising representatives of each of the FLAGs and representatives of the major public service bodies.  The body meets twice annually to provide guidance to the operation of the FLAGs, its most recent meeting being in November 2013.  By doing this at a national level, we have attracted representatives from large national bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland which might not be able to send representatives to local meetings.  The body has provided a useful forum for the FLAGs from all corners of the country to discuss common issues.</p><p>  During 2013, all six FLAGs developed and published their integrated local development strategies, based on a bottom-up approach in agreement with the managing authority.  These comprehensive documents are available on the BIM website.  A total of 61 projects were considered by the FLAGs, of which 45 were approved for funding.  To date, claims have been received from 36 applicants representing a total investment of &euro;172,631 with &euro;91,743 in grant aid, 50:50 between the State and the EU.  A further six projects provided funding of some &euro;90,000 towards the cost of producing integrated local development strategies.  These were community led not BIM led.  It was up to the communities as to how they prioritised their strategies.</p> <p>Among the services I have mentioned, we provide a local co-ordinator and there is one staff member from BIM in each of the six regions, currently from the fisheries side.  Next year we hope to include aquaculture, but at the moment it is fisheries.  There is one person from BIM available to assist, and the board bears the cost of that person.  We also provide administrative services to the FLAGs, including administering the management of project claims and so on.  Similarly, the board covers the cost of that administrative assistance.</p></speech>

I did a quick calculation for the six regions.  I could divide my region into eight sub-regions that I can clearly identify.  If I took the coast from Arklow to Youghal, I could find at least that number as well - west of Waterford Harbour, east of Waterford Harbour and so on.  There is a little more than &euro;400,000 for each of the six regions, and if we divide that by eight again we end up with &euro;50,000 for each sub-region.  We then set up all the superstructure for &euro;50,000.  I put the same argument up in the early days of the Leader programme.  It is an awful lot of money for such a little thing, because &euro;50,000 would not set up any kind of business.  I am not blaming Mr. Keatinge.  It is a pity they did not give this to the Leader companies and just let them get on with the job, as the structure is already there to administer the money to coastal communities.  As the money was so small, I think the French got it right by allowing in only those areas where there would be more socioeconomic benefits.  If a few hundred million euro was in question, it might be worth talking about, but &euro;2.5 million is a waste of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000004#C01000"><p>How long has this been in operation?  I got a briefing locally about this earlier in the year.  The amount of funding is trivial to meet the needs and requirements involved, or to create any sustainability for people in coastal communities and people who are struggling with inshore fishing.  Can any of that money go towards local co-operatives?  It may buy an ice machine or something like that.  Could the money go towards creating some kind of storage facility whereby people could keep certain fish until such time as they can get the maximum benefit from the market?  In many coastal communities, people involved in fishing for lobster and crayfish can make &euro;22 or &euro;24 per kilo in the months of March, April or May, but then in July and August that will drop to &euro;8 or &euro;9 per kilo.</p><p>  Has there been much interest in the take-up?  It was stated in the presentation that a management committee is being set up involving all the stakeholders in the community and so on.  Who selects this management committee?  Is it determined by local people?  Mr. Michael Keatinge stated that there was public and private support.  Are the local authorities behind it?</p><p>  I concur completely with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has stated.  The amount of money is so small that it will have no real effect on something that is so necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000004#C01100"><p>I thank Mr. Keatinge for his presentation.  He referred to 36 applicants that had been successful.  Where is that list available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000004#C01200"><p>I welcome Mr. Keatinge to the committee.  As part of our consideration of the report the issue of FLAGs cropped up, and very few of us understood what they were about.  I thank Mr. Keatinge for giving us an insight into how and under what structure they are operating.  The funding is relatively small when we look at the entire coastline of the country.  I presume the structure of these would have been provided by the current CFP.   It is funded by the European Fisheries Fund, EFF.  Why is it only in the last two years of the CFP that the FLAGs are being established, when the CFP is expiring at the beginning of 2015?  We have an opportunity to get proper funding for these FLAGs with the incoming CFP in 2015, similar to the way the Leader funding is going.</p><p>  The model for Leader companies is changing and coming back under a local government framework.  The south-west FLAG has a very impressive membership.  There are fishing interests, aquaculture interests, environmental interests, food interests and a member from the existing Leader company, but no public representative to oversee what are in effect public funds.  In light of the move by the Leader companies to go back under the local government model - one of the arguments for this was that it would give public oversight or transparency to that funding - will the structure for the FLAGs will be examined?</p><p>  There are many ways in which BIM could enter into partnerships for the purpose of funding.  There are possibilities in the area of retraining, upskilling and diversifying the skills that are available in the sea fishing industry for use in the offshore exploration industry.  Even though BIM has a hands-off role in respect of projects, I think Mr. Keatinge is underselling the whole thing if BIM does not get involved in that area of retraining and upskilling.</p></speech>

The budget we are discussing is part of the EFF, which exists from the last CFP.  The new CFP has been agreed, but what has not been agreed yet is the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, or EMFF.</p> <p>We do not yet know what Ireland will receive.  We know Axis 4 and the FLAGs have been retained and strengthened in their appearance in the new funding mechanism.  Ireland will get an opportunity to address the budget of the FLAGs.  That will not be in the gift of BIM but will be a decision by the Minister.  The funds I am talking about run to the middle of 2015 at the very latest.  In theory the new funds should begin in 2015 also, so we are talking about 2014.  To return to something Deputy Harrington raised, the key point is that by having a FLAG network in place we can avail of and draw down the EMFF funding.  It is a matter of ensuring it is given due priority, but that is a matter for the members rather than for me.</p></speech>

Everyone understands that if one gets an Intel it represents millions of euro, but it is thought that down the country it is dead cheap to create jobs and we can do it for &euro;5,000 here and &euro;20,000 there.  Having done the job, I can tell the committee it is not cheap to create jobs.  If anyone tells me they can create jobs at &euro;3,000 a punt I always tell them that if it were that cheap there would be no need for the grant in the first place.  If the money will be that small it would be much better to constrain it to the areas of greatest need and ensure we have something decent for a few people, rather than spreading the jam so thin that nobody will get any.</p></speech>

The FLAG could not be a sub-committee of Leader but would have to be a stand-alone structure.  That was a written instruction from the European Commission services.</p></speech>

If a FLAG committee had a sub-committee which was an affiliate, could it draw in Leader funding?</p></speech>

In every case we have sought to have Leader on the FLAGs alongside BIM.  In coastal areas Leader has reciprocated and many of the coastal Leaders have somebody from BIM on them.  The idea is to work to ensure that a project that merits funding does not fail for want of paperwork.  The facilitator will identify excellent projects and divide the funding areas between Leader, the FLAG and Bord F&aacute;ilte.  It is truly trying to integrate.  We are under written instructions that the FLAGs must be stand-alone entities.  We have truly sought to integrate with existing structures, including Leader, as Deputy Harrington has noted.  Leader is represented in all of our FLAGs.  We can have integrated projects.  The one thing we cannot do under Community legislation is to fund a project from two sources.  Instead we break the project into three parts, each funded from a different source.  The idea is to create this integration across Government services.  The budget is entirely outside my gift, but unfortunately the reality we live with is that fisheries budgets tend to be smaller.</p><p>  On Deputy Martin Ferris's point, the FLAGs have been set up from mid-2012.  I agree that there was a long lead-in time.  We lost a number of years getting the EFF implemented and a few years getting agreement on how the FLAGs should be rolled out in Ireland.  I do not have an answer or explanation on that loss of time.  We have worked very hard over the last 18 months to bring together operational FLAGs and, as evidenced by their strategies, which are available to the members, they have done much work.  We hope formally to launch the south west FLAG at the end of January.</p><p>  One could use funding to get a nice machine for the co-op.  Those are exactly the types of project that FLAGs would approve.  One could definitely look at something like lobster and crayfish holding.  We would encourage that.</p><p>  The question of who selects the committees is difficult.  It is a chicken-and-egg situation.  Deputy Harrington has also talked about membership of the committee.  We have approached communities and asked them to bring forward representatives.  If a community had an existing co-op or community structure they could look to those to nominate somebody.  The principle of the FLAG is a very open one.  If a group come forward and said it would like to participate, it would be the intention that they would be welcomed.  There is an attempt to avoid elections.  It is to give it a community basis and we have found that people have been willing.  We tend to see the same faces, but community activists have come forward in every area.</p></speech>

I live in a coastal area overlapping two areas and there is a co-operative society in one area, while a few miles up to road there is local development council and a community council.</p></speech>

Deputy Harrington raised an important point about the changes afoot in the Leader approach, whereby it is being brought back to a local government model.  In my earlier presentation I stressed that BIM has been the implementing agency for seafood funding for many years.  We are a public body, so it is a fine line.  We have made all the decisions for many years within our board structure, so the executive and the board of BIM make the decisions on grant aid.  Over the last five or six years we have moved to a more open model in which we have external bodies making those decisions.</p><p>  With the FLAGs, BIM takes responsibility for examining an application and ensuring that it is legal and correct and meets the necessary strictures of good governance.  We then inform the FLAG of the budget and strategy and let it make the choice.  We do not interfere in the choice process.  We do ensure the choice is legal and meets all the standards of governance, and we take responsibility for that and for the conduction of the audit with the EU auditors.  We are bringing the FLAGs within an existing public body governance structure.  Whereas Leader companies were separate private companies, the FLAGs are boards which have responsibility for decisions but make those decisions in the knowledge that a public body provides the oversight, not interference.  There is a definite line.  We do not make the decisions but advise on legality and appropriateness.</p></speech>

Mr. Keatinge said that the same faces tended to crop up in coastal and fishing communities, and one tends to meet the same people over and over.  Conflicts of interest could arise very quickly and easily.</p> <p>What is the role of BIM in that situation?  Is it just a matter of giving advice to the FLAGs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Keatinge" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000006#E00200"><p>As a facilitator, we try to act more like a secretary to a board and provide them with guidance and assistance as they require it.  On matters to do with governance, we have the final say.  In other words, we cannot allow a body to make a decision that is illegal or do anything that is at variance with Community legislation.  That is our role.  We have a vested interest in ensuring the group functions well and if there were personality difficulties, we would help.  However, our experience to date has been wonderfully encouraging.</p><p>  To return to the point made by Deputy Martin Ferris, it is a very open process and if any group from any section of the community considered it should have a say, it would be welcome to do so.  There is a balance to be struck on the committee in regard to numbers, but it is a very open process.  </p><p>  Senator Denis Landy asked about the list of 36 applicants.  It will be available on the BIM website.  I will provide the details for the Senator.</p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington asked about retraining.  This morning I took the opportunity to meet my colleagues from the Marine Survey Office to explore that issue.  We have been providing a large number of grants through the FLAGs to assist with retraining.  This has been geared towards moving into the merchant navy and there are also opportunities to move into offshore oil supply or wind farm work.  BIM has a role in training.  We have always interpreted our role strictly, as providing training solely for those involved in the fishing sector.  However, the point about Axis 4 is that it recognises fisheries can be in decline and that we need to look outwards.</p><p>  At a parochial level, I am from Dunmore East and see the industry there at a crossroads as to whether it will become a Killybegs or a Salthill.  It sees its future in the tourism industry.  Greencastle is another example where there is a spillover; visitors from Derry have become very important to the community.  These communities face change and part of Axis 4 is about facilitating that change.  It is not just about fishing but also about the maritime sector in a wider context.  It could be about marine tourism, including whale watching, sea angling, sailing, seafood and festivals.  It is about any area in a coastal community that can provide new opportunities to retain people in the area.</p><p>  It is important to stress this point.  Personally, there is a role for the BIM training facilities in Greencastle which are a long way from the facility in Cork to provide transition training for fishermen who might seek alternative employment.  As we know, inshore fishing is seasonal.  What are these inshore fishermen to do in the winter?  They could be gainfully employed working on offshore supply vessels, servicing wind farms or oil rigs.  This is something I will put to the board.  I also discussed putting it into effect with the Marine Survey Office this morning.  I will return to the Deputy in due course on it.</p></speech>

FLAGs are about socioeconomic development, not HR management.  I could have spoken about this issue at length if I had been asked to do so because in 1998 BIM produced the inshore fisheries management report.  In the period 1998 to approximately 2010 we were very active in trying to develop the national fisheries management arrangements.  That saw the evolution of four species groups, covering species such as lobster, crab, bivalve shellfish such as razor clams, scallops, shrimp and so forth.  The four species advisory groups were very much bottom up, driven by fishermen.  They also had complementary local committees.  We had a very active committee in Roaring Water Bay, Dunmore East and Kilmore Quay.  We had an active group in Dundalk Bay covering the cockle fishery, while in west Kerry there was an active crayfish group.  This work culminated in the production of the lobster management plan in 2008.  Sadly, however, that plan was never implemented and the groups have withered since.  It is a source of disappointment for me and the team on the coast that more has not been done in that regard.  These fisheries are ones that, by and large, fall outside management by the Commission; therefore, we are not talking about quota species in the normal context but about local national species such as lobster, shrimp, razor fish, cockles and so on.</p></speech>

The model we considered was one that involved a vessel used for lobster potting, where the vessel was used early on a summer's morning to check pots and then lay idle for the rest of the day.  Why can that boat not be used to take passengers out to engage in  sea angling or whale watching?  That is not allowed currently.  A person may hold either a fishing licence or a passenger licence.  He or she may change during the season, but may not hold the two licences simultaneously.  This is not a matter BIM can deal with; it is one for the MSO.</p></speech>

He has touched on the inshore fleet which, by and large, has been neglected during the years.  There is a need to implement inshore fisheries management plans in local areas.  For example, there is an inshore fishery in south Donegal where large pelagic vessels come and scoop up fish, whether horse mackerel or scad.  They rip up lobster pots and everything in front of them, much to the frustration of the local fishermen.  The legislation governing this area dates back to the 1800s and the maximum fine is approximately five shillings.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is working on legislation that will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.  Not only do we need this legislation, we also need management plans to protect the inshore fisheries fleet.</p><p>  I am not sure whether the FLAGS are engaged in supporting the inshore fisheries sector or whether steps are being taken in that regard.  The funding issue is a big one.  There is massive unemployment in coastal areas.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund has the objective of sustaining small local communities, but the funding available to Ireland is very small in the overall context.  It amounts to &euro;2.5 million over the lifetime of the CFP.  When we look at the average pay-out per project in respect of the 36 projects, it amounts to around &euro;4,700.  Grant aid amounts to &euro;2,500 per project, which is only peanuts in the overall scale of things.</p><p>  If I were to come forward with a project, I would not even approach the FLAG.  I would go directly to the Leader company, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or the county enterprise board because I would be wasting my time in drawing down a grant that would disallow me in drawing down another grant.  There is a conflict of interest and we need some joined-up thinking.  The funding should either be streamlined through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the enterprise boards or the Leader programme.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about the Leader protocol.  I know Leader funding is not being brought under the local authorities, but is there anything to stop the Leader companies from establishing a sub-committee or sub-structure to administer this funding?  Would there be any impediment in doing this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Keatinge" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013121000006#E01000"><p>I reiterate that the money about which we have talked was from the old fund.  There will be an opportunity under the new fund from the back end of 2014 to 2015.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund is making its way through the Council and the Parliament and the decision on it will, presumably, be made in the next few months.  Ireland will then make decisions on how to splits its budget and how much will be allocated to Axis 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p> <p>That is a decision for others and the Minister.  I do not necessarily believe there is the same conflict of interest with the FLAGs.  We certainly received an instruction from the Commission that the FLAGs had to have an identity and were not simply to be a sub-committee of an existing structure.  It was not to be a case of letting the local development company deal with coastal issues once a month.  They had to have a stand-alone identity.</p><p> I stress that once a local community is meeting at this level, if, as we have done, it attracts funding from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, the Leader programme, BIM and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, no project should go undone simply because of paperwork.  If it is more appropriate for a project to be included in the Leader programme, this is from where it should be funded.  If it is more appropriate to fund it through Enterprise Ireland or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, that is from where it should be funded.  FLAGs have a maritime identity and should not see themselves as limited in any way by the European Fisheries Fund.  They should see all of the other funds as part and parcel of what they are about.</p><p> With regard to whether another entity or group such as the Leader programme would be a better administrator than BIM, coming from BIM I argue that we have a tradition of administering for many years.  We are trying to achieve a balance between providing an administrative service which is centred solely on ensuring governance and ensuring local communities make decisions.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether any one body would be better at administering than another.  I do not think we are any less efficient and do not believe any money is lost.  As I stressed in my introduction, we do not take money for the services we provide.  We do not have overheads and do not charge for my time or that of coastal staff.  The cost is borne by the taxpayer through the general fund.  I do not want to say we are better than the Leader programme or<i>vice versa</i>.  That is not what it is about.  It is about creating structures which seamlessly provide a port of call for somebody in a coastal community to interface directly with all of these funds.  I hope somebody coming to a FLAG meeting will be equally able to speak to the Leader programme representative, or the representative from BIM, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s or F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  That is our aim.  </p><p> I hope this explains what we are trying to achieve.  I do not believe it duplicates administration.</p></speech>

The problem is that an illusion is created that something great is being done with FLAGs and other measures being announced.  A megastructure has been established to administer the amount of money one would give to a community council.  The local GAA club in a tuppence halfpenny parish would turn over &euro;80,000 a year.  I am not blaming BIM.  It is just that the European Union lives in an El Dorado in throwing crumbs from the rich man's table to rural communities.  It is time we went back to tell it to get real and ask how much it would spend on trying to redevelop an urban area.  It would run into billions of euro and nobody would blink an eye.  We have had the Ballymun regeneration project.  We have this thing in our minds that giving &euro;5,000 here and &euro;10,000 there rural people will be happy and that it will solve all of their problems and create plenty of jobs.  It has never tried it.</p></speech>

Mr. Keating has addressed this issue.  The committee's report on FLAGs must highlight some of the facts Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has given with regard to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  If a figure of &euro;2.5 million must be spent over two years and the new fund will kick in in 2015, unless it can be attached to other rural development programmes, coastal programmes or island development programmes, nothing will be achieved.  As a structure, it is very good, but it all boils down to money.</p></speech>

We hope the budget will be increased substantially.  I hope whatever administrative framework is put in place, whether in BIM, the Leader programme or whatever else, administrative oversight will facilitate without necessarily drawing funds.  We have tried to avoid using the meagre funds available to pay for administration.  By doing the work through BIM administration is free.</p><p>  If it is clear a small part of an area deserves a substantial focus, up to 70% of the budget can be focused on two areas.  This is a difficult issue and as a public representative, I must try to balance what I believe are the aspirations along the entire coastline.  How does one create a structure which does not rule somebody out in terms of funding and at the same time have a focus which creates a critical mass?  What we are trying to do in allowing the 70% rule is to invest a lot of money in a particular area.  I could pick any area.  Every committee member is from a coastal area and all members know what I am speaking about.  If funding is given to someone in north Donegal, people in south Donegal will ask why they have been left out.  It is a difficult issue and we hope we are getting the balance right.  Our aspiration for the future is to have a bigger budget.</p><p>  This year no legitimate project which asked for funding was turned down.  A problem not only in Axis 4 but also in Axis 2 and Axis 3 is that if we are offering a 50% grant, the other 50% must be provided through private sector funding.  In the past two or three years, not unexpectedly, we have seen significant problems in obtaining private sector funding.  It is not as though the FLAGs had a bunch of projects this year which were turned down because of a lack of money.  We could have funded more projects this year if we had projects to fund.  There was money left over.  The level of funding, that is, the grant aid rate, is very important.  Access to private sector funding is definitely a sticking point.  The rules for what may be funded have become tighter and tighter.  Where in the past I might have given somebody a grant for structural work on a fishing boat, this is no longer allowed.  I cannot give a grant to fix the engine.  Many projects have been ruled out and more will be ruled out under the new regulation for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  To my mind, the grant aid rate, access to private sector funding and what may be granted aided present much bigger problems than the amount of the funds available.</p></speech>

Soon we will discuss the ECC timber mill which has invested between &euro;3 million and &euro;5 million in recent years because it is big enough to get money from a bank.  People come to my office who have an idea and no money, but they are not the ones who will create employment in rural Ireland.</p> <p>I remember sitting in a hall years ago when grants like that were available.  My successor in the co-op and I were present and made a quick calculation, breaking it down village by village, and we concluded there was no money in the fund.  It would have been better to park it to get to somewhere with serious and significant funding to have the development we wanted.  We were part of a small rural village, but that was our view and we were very hard-headed.  I have made the case strongly and would make it straight to the Europeans.  They are not living in the real world.  I wish some of them would come here to try to develop rural areas and they would soon find out what the reality was.  This process is of no consequence in solving the major issues we face as communities in rural Ireland who are trying to find work for our people.</p></speech>

Are they having the same difficulties with the co-funding model?  Mr. Keatinge has indicated that the rate is an issue, aside from the amount involved.</p></speech>

There are certain projects which we can fund 100%.  They would be fully public.  For example, this would apply to something like a festival or a public good project.  The rule is that if the project is private, according to Community legislation, the grant rate goes down to 40%.  There is a figure of 60% for a semi-private project and 100% for a public project.  I have included the brochure that explains all of this in the package I gave to the committee.  The details are included in it.  To be clear, we allow for 100% funding, but that applies to public projects only.  The trouble is if a co-op wanted to build a lobster holding unit, as Deputy Martin Ferris suggested, it would be a semi-public project; in other words, it would be open to the members of the co-op and it might receive 60% funding.  If a private citizen wanted to do the same, it would not be made available to others and a grant rate of 40% would be applicable.  Somebody might want to conduct a survey of marine tourism and could receive 100% funding because it was a community project.</p><p>  I have addressed the following point to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We must not forget that Axes 1, 2 and 3 remain, as well as Enterprise Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland funds.  The FLAG initiative is about micro-funding and projects in receipt of grant aid of probably less than &euro;20,000.  If people wish to access more, they should come to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, as we have Axis 1 for the fleet, Axis 2 for processing and aquaculture projects and Axis 3 for wider fisheries projects for amounts up to &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000.  These projects are not underaken through Axis 4 which relates to smaller scale local projects.  We must not forget that bigger projects can also be undertaken, but they are undertaken through Axis 1 to Axis 3.  At times we must remind ourselves that these big projects can be undertaken.</p></speech>

That is a national decision.  I also hope grant aid rates are inclusive.  Access to private sector funding can be difficult.</p></speech>

Therefore, I propose we deal with Schedule B first.</p><p>  The proposals listed under Schedule B are as follows: COM (2013) 687; COM (2013) 720; COM (2013) 731; COM (2013) 748; COM (2013) 750; COM (2013) 759; COM (2013) 760 ; COM (2013) 776; COM (2013) 811; COM (2013) 817; EWN (2013) C 195-4; EWN (2013) C 299-4; EWN (2013) C 300-5; EWN (2013) L 228-1; EWN (2013) L 229-2; EWN (2013) C 160-3; EWN (2013) C 246-5; EWN (2013) C 300-14; EWN (2013) C 340-13; EWN (2013) C 342-12; EWN (2013) L 126-1; EWN (2013) L 126-19; EWN (2013) L 152-5.  It is proposed they do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The first proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 207, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups further scrutiny.  It is proposed this proposal remains under scrutiny at this time and the Department be requested to keep the joint committee informed of developments on this proposal.  It is further proposed that, if required, Department officials will be invited to discuss this proposal in the new year.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The second proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 798, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on seafarers amending Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC.  Ireland supports the proposal in principle.  However, clarification is needed on aspects of it, in particular those relating to entitlements on insolvency which could have wider implications for Ireland.  It is proposed that the proposal warrants further scrutiny and be kept under review with the assistance of both Departments involved.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The third proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 404, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the member states and of the European Union, text with EEA relevance.  On the basis of additional information supplied, it is proposed this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The fourth proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 740, proposal for a Council decision on a tripartite social summit for growth and employment.  It is proposed this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The fifth proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 803, proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of member states.  It is proposed this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise that any opening statement submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before calling on the first witness I wish to make some comments.  Genealogy has, in recent years, become a fascination for Irish people, as indeed for people worldwide.  People want to know more about their forebears and their origins; where they come from and what was happening back then.  While many people engage in genealogical research as a personal hobby there is a very important role for the professional genealogist in conducting research for others and in providing information in both hard copy form and also on the world wide web.  The world wide web in particular has an important role to play in the study of genealogy, providing information, research facilities and databases to people across the globe.  Mr. or Ms Murphy in Tasmania can research their great-great grandparent in Cork without leaving their home in Hobart.  Genealogy has many different aspects to it catering for individuals and people with a common ancestry as, for example, the MacCarthy clan or people originating in a particular part of Ireland; for example a town, a townland or an offshore island community.  There are also family history societies that facilitate members by sharing knowledge, indexing records, publishing journals and sponsoring conference and site visits.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s worldwide diaspora these developments can make an important contribution to enhancing our tourism sector and as an industry with major potential growth can contribute to creating employment in Ireland both in genealogical research and in encouraging people like the Murphys in Hobart to visit Ireland.  I now call on Mr. Merrigan to address the committee.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce my colleagues - to my left Tom Conlon, director of Internet services and Aiden Feerick, a member of the society.</p><p>  For the information of the committee, while the society itself does not engage in commercial genealogical research assignments for individuals, Aiden Feerick is also a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, APGI, and a director of Ancestor Network Limited.  It may be useful, in the interests of openness and transparency, that any person appearing before the committee for and on behalf of a voluntary genealogical organisation, declares if they are personally also members of APGI or engage in commercial genealogical research.  The Irish genealogical community is relatively small and cross-membership among organisations is not uncommon.</p><p>  On page 4 of the society's submission, we have included information on the society and its unique approach to these matters as it operates quite differently to other voluntary genealogical organisations in Ireland.  The society has a long record stretching back over 23 years of campaigning on genealogical and heritage matters at local, national and international levels.  Further clarification on our position is on page 5 of the submission.  The society was established in 1990 to promote an awareness, appreciation and knowledge of our genealogical and heraldic heritage in Ireland and among her diaspora.  The society is an independent not-for-profit voluntary heritage organisation with an Irish and international membership and it is an incorporated body in Ireland with charitable status.  It is also a nominating body for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The society is devoted to the promotion of the study of genealogy and related subjects as educational leisure pursuits available to all in the community irrespective of age, prior learning, background, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation or socioeconomic circumstances and we do so by organising two open meetings each month throughout the year, holding lectures, workshops, publishing genealogical material, group projects, exhibiting at major events and the provision of an archive and research centre, An Daonchartlann, at the Carlisle Pier in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p><p>  The principle of public ownership and right of access to our genealogical heritage is the cornerstone of the society&rsquo;s policies on heritage, genealogy and archival matters.  The society is precluded from affiliating with any organisation or group failing to endorse this fundamental principle.  Over the past 23 years, the society has encouraged the tabling of parliamentary questions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; raising matters on the Order of Business in Seanad &Eacute;ireann; advocating amendments to Bills in both Houses; it has drafted Bills for presentation to Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;; made numerous submissions to State agencies, Departments and local government; and formulated and published detailed proposals on many heritage issues.</p><p>  The society has always been to the fore in the development and promotion of genealogical and heraldic services in Ireland.  Legislative reform has been a core objective of this endeavour and therefore, amendments were sought and secured in many pieces of legislation as outlined in the written submission.  In addressing the issue, developing a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage, it is easy to see the matter from a purely economic perspective relating specifically to tourism or as a straightforward archival access problem to be resolved by more State investment, increased staffing levels, improved technology and, of course, the hope of philanthropy.  Capturing the full value of our genealogical heritage is as much an intriguing objective as it is a complex, multifaceted and, in some respects, a very contentious and ambitious endeavour involving many different stakeholders across a number of sectors including the State, commercial interests, voluntary organisations, institutional and private custodians of records and others.</p> <p> As members can see from the submission, the Genealogical Society of Ireland has taken a holistic approach to this important national issue by assessing our genealogical heritage in its many and varied aspects including whether it is a product or a resource.  This is an essential question as it impacts greatly on the manner in which other aspects of our genealogical heritage can be assessed in the context of the development of a plan as proposed.  As members can see on page 2 of the submission, the society has considered each of the various areas it believes have a significant contribution to make to the promotion of an awareness, appreciation and knowledge of our genealogical heritage or to the further development of genealogy in education, scientific research, roots tourism and other important sectors.  Given that individual members may have a particular interest in specific areas, each topic is explored in a separate chapter under the headings: Commercial Genealogy; Genetic Genealogy; Genealogy and Ethnic or Cultural Diversity - this chapter is important in view of the fact that this is International Human Rights Day and, in light of recent European Unions endeavours, it relates to the Traveller and Roma communities; Heraldry; Roots Tourism; Volunteerism; Philanthropy; and Legislation.  Each chapter provides some background information on the area considered followed by the society&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p> The society&rsquo;s recommendations - approximately 70 in all - cover public policy issues, Government or State agency actions, legislative proposals, product development, funding and the involvement of the genealogical community, both voluntary and commercial.  The recommendations proffer suggestions for consideration in the formulation and implementation of a national policy on genealogy.  While the society could have concentrated on the various archival resources that should be publicly accessible or in need of digitisation at our various repositories, we fully appreciate that, as legislators, the members of this committee must concentrate on those matters within the scope of legislation or public policy or on those areas for which the various line Ministers have responsibility.  However, it is important to restate two points from the programme for Government which directly concern the matter at hand, namely:<blockquote>We will promote genealogical tourism by updating the National Cultural Institutions Act in relation to the Genealogical office to put it on a proper statutory footing, modernise its operations and to enable publication of the 1926 census to stimulate genealogy tourism.<br />We will also explore philanthropic opportunities for the development of a national archives and genealogy quarter, providing easy access to archives and tapping into an area of cultural tourism which is of huge interest to the vast Irish Diaspora.</blockquote>The society has - as the submission indicates - been very active in both of these areas for a great number of years starting in 1993 when the then Statistics Bill was going through Seanad &Eacute;ireann, we almost succeeded, with the help of then Senator Maurice Manning, of reducing the 100 year to 70 years in respect of public access to census records.  We were the only genealogical organisation involved in that process at the time but, alas, the Bill passed into law in July 1993 with the 100-year rule intact.  We have been campaigning ever since on this issue, as members see by reference to chapter 16, page 36, of our submission.  The society has been very proactive in respect of the Genealogical Office ever since what became the National Cultural Institutions Act was going through Seanad &Eacute;ireann where, with the assistance of Senator Paschal Mooney, we achieved 28 amendments to the legislation and a further three in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We have also kept up the pressure in respect of the need to rectify certain aspects of the fundamentally flawed section 13 of the 1997 Act, as members can see in chapters 11 and 16 of our submission.</p><p> The recommendations in the society's submission present the committee with a set of comprehensive measures aimed at providing the framework for the development of a meaningful and structured consultative environment facilitating the formulation of specific objectives covering many aspects of our genealogical heritage.  The recommendations envisage the establishment of a priority list of actions and consultations from which specific and targeted measures can be put in place to enable the formulation and implementation of a sustainable development plan.  The society strongly believes that the formulation and development of a plan must be an inclusive, transparent and meaningful consultative process whereby all stakeholders will have an important contribution to make towards achieving the worthy objective of developing a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage.</p><p> I should bring the committee's attention to the fact that there are some typographical errors in the text of the submission on pages 14, 15 and 26.  References to chapter 14 in the text on these pages should read chapter 16.  <i>Mea culpa</i>.</p></speech>

It acts as an accrediting and regulating body to maintain high standards among its members and to protect the interests of clients.  Our members are drawn from every part of Ireland and represent a wide variety of interests and expertise.  The ongoing involvement of individual members in lecturing, teaching and publishing maintains our position at the forefront of genealogical developments in Ireland.  For more than two decades the field of ancestral research in Ireland has benefited greatly from the APGI's influence and lobbying.  Beyond its functions as an accrediting and regulating body, it has made a very positive contribution to many areas of development, championing the cause of record users with State-run offices and the Irish Genealogical Project, subsequently Irish Genealogy Limited.</p><p>  In respect of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht's request for submissions, we wish to raise the following three pivotal issues as examples of how finding workable solutions would greatly assist in developing such a plan as outlined by the Committee.  The issues in question are: the website of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, www.irishgenealogy.ie; the 1926 census; and the General Register Office of Ireland.  To the fore in developing a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage is for increased support to be given to the genealogy website &ndash; <i>www.irishgenealogy.ie</i> - of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The website, which is a work in progress, gives access, free of charge, to, for example, original images of parish church records &ndash; a primary source &ndash; and this, in turn, gives the website credence and authority.  An annual dependable grant-in-aid would allow consistent forward planning with regard to content and facilitate the consistent monitoring of content and management of the website.  The APGI - the only accrediting body for genealogists in Ireland &ndash; commends the Department in adopting the ethos and vision of the majority of our national cultural institutions by making accessible, free of charge,  primary source material relating to our history and heritage.  However, the Department needs financial and personnel investment to ensure the reliability and the ongoing development of the website and its content, CIGO</p><p>  On the 1926 census, the APGI, particularly through its connection with the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, the CIGO, lobbied for many years to convince those in authority that census returns could be opened before the 100-year embargo first introduced in the Statistics Act 1993.  Prior to the passing of the 1993 Act, the subsequently repealed Statistics Act 1926 provided no clear guidance regarding public access to census returns compiled post-Independence.  The returns for 1901 and 1911 had been released by a warrant, signed under the Public Records (Ireland) Act 1867, in 1961.  In the case of the 1911 census, this was only 50 years after the data was compiled.  The sky did not subsequently fall in.  When what became the Statistics Act 1993 was debated by the Houses in 1993, lobbying by the CIGO - spearheaded by its then general secretary, Mr. Michael Merrigan - succeeded in reducing the then proposed 100-year embargo to only 70 years.  However, the Central Statistics Office did not support this measure and the 100-year bar was reinstated.</p><p>  Numerous groups have continued to lobby since 1993 to allow early access to the 1926 census as a special case.  In the months before the most recent general election, approaches were made to the current Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, putting the case to him for inclusion of the proposal in the new programme for Government if, as seemed likely, Fine Gael and Labour were to form the next Administration.</p> <p>The Minister agreed and saw the value of the arguments made.  Since taking up the portfolio of Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht he has consistently promoted the statement in the programme for Government that the 1926 census returns should be released early.  This was particularly the case when he was interviewed by <i>The Irish Times</i>in April 2011 during a reception to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Genealogical Research Society.  Despite the commitment given in the programme for Government, the Central Statistics Office has consistently refused to engage and has advised the Department of the Taoiseach against amending the Statistics Act 1993.  In the meantime, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has formed a working committee with the task of establishing what needs to be done to conserve, catalogue and prepare the physical records in advance of their release, which cannot be later than January 2027.</p><p> Representations were made to the Central Statistics Office in 2009 by Mr. Paul Gorry, a council member of the APGI, who requested data from the 1926 census about his deceased father under section 33 of the Statistics Act 1993.  The CSO conceded in its reply that, &ldquo;While the release of census information in respect of named individuals to their next-of-kin is allowable by law, the practical arrangements involved are significant and effectively preclude us from doing so&quot;.  The APGI understands rudimentary finding aids have been compiled on the 1926 census returns held by the National Archives of Ireland.  They would enable some searching to be undertaken in order to locate particular household returns.  </p><p> One of the concerns raised by the Central Statistics Office was related to the privacy of data relating to persons born less than 100 years ago.  We are aware that the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, CIGO, raised the issue with the Minister and made the helpful suggestion that if the privacy issue should become a sticking point with the CSO, a compromise might be to allow the temporary redaction of data for those born less than 100 years ago and who might be still living.  The APGI supports the suggestion as a sensible compromise. </p><p> The third issue relates to the General Register Office.  Its public search room holds all of Ireland&rsquo;s civil records of births, deaths and marriages from 1845 to 1921 and for the Republic from 1922 onwards.  Until recently the office was housed in premises well suited for public access and utility at the Irish Life Centre on Lower Abbey Street.  The downturn in the economy necessitated a move to a State-owned building - the former labour exchange on Werburgh Street.  However, publicity surrounding the move has not been favourable.  The APGI concurs with our colleague, Mr. John Grenham, that among research facilities, the General Rgister Office should be a flagship facility, as is the case with the General Register Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast which last year received the CIGO&rsquo;s prestigious award for excellence in genealogy.  Unfortunately, that is not the case following the move of the General Register Office to Werburgh Street.  It flies in the face of what the Minister is trying to achieve in the area of heritage.  The Werburgh Street building,  particularly the surrounds, urgently need a serious facelift.</p><p> By contrast, the APGI enthusiastically welcomed the recent announcement by the Minister that, through an amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004, the Department&rsquo;s website will<i></i>shortly host the General Register Office&rsquo;s generated computerised indexes to civil records.  The departmental initiative should be extended to include the following sources on the Irish genealogy website: indices covering births, marriages and deaths of those born in Ireland who served abroad with the British army following the Act of 1879; indices for marine registers of births and deaths extant from 1864; indices covering people born in Ireland and who died abroad from 1864, generally known as the British Council of Births and Deaths; indices covering Irish people who died during the South African War from 1898 to 1902, otherwise knows as the Boer War; indices covering the deaths of those who served in the British army during the First World War from 1914 to 1918; the register and general index covering several thousand marriages and some baptisms performed in Dublin between 1806 and 1837 by the unlicensed clergymen Rev. Schulze.  These indices currently held in Roscommon are not available for consultation at the General Register Office's research facility in Dublin which for the researcher makes for incomplete or inconclusive research.  The APGI makes the case for all of the foregoing indices to be digitised and made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></speech>

I am the secretary of the Irish Family History Foundation and the genealogist for County Kildare.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Nora O&rsquo;Meara, North Tipperary Genealogy Service; Mr. Fintan Mullen, Ulster Historical Foundation, and Se&aacute;n &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, Leitrim Genealogy Service.</p><p>  The Irish Family History Foundation has 33 county genealogy centres on the island of Ireland.  We began computerising parish records in each county in the late 1980s and have provided research services for over 25 years or more in some cases.  The majority of the county centres were formally set up <i>circa</i> 1991 under the direction of Mr. Paddy Teahon, Department of the Taoiseach, with the aim of computerising all of the genealogical records pertaining to each county, including church, civil, census, gravestone and land records, while providing local employment and training opportunities.  We operate with paid staff and volunteers.  Some 14 centres facilitate various training and employment schemes. </p><p>  The foundation is a not-for-profit company and completely self-financing, paying VAT and corporation tax.  The county centres provide local employment and financially support other local services such as heritage centres.  They are a focal point for tourists in the respective counties and, in many cases, are the only contact point for visitors in the off-season.  Local researchers can pinpoint the exact area from where someone&rsquo;s ancestors came and help him or her to locate relatives still living in the area.  The service is free of charge and only available in a county with a genealogy centre.</p><p>  We have provided extensive background details on the foundation and its member centres in the written submission.  I would like to address the main topic before the committee through the following questions: how can or should genealogical and related services be resourced and funded?  The network of local centres and the highly successful website would not be available if we did not charge a fee.  In turn, as a not-for-profit organisation, the vast majority of revenue goes straight back to the local centres.  We use the balance to add further records to the site and develop and promote services and for the administration and management of the website.  In over 25 years we have yet to encounter a credible suggestion for alternative funding.  There seems no reasonable alternative to develop and manage the website.  It is a statement of fact that charging for this information online is international best practice. </p><p>  The provision of the 1901 and 1911 Irish census returns online has proved successful.  That is not surprising, as the data are provided at no charge to the end user.  What may not be appreciated is that a small charge could generate millions in income for the National Archives of Ireland and the State, as it has done for the national archives in the United Kingdom and the USA.  Another State body, the General Register Office, has no plans to make the State&rsquo;s computerised records of births, marriages and deaths available free of charge to the public.  The argument in support of the free availability of records is that it will promote or encourage tourism.  However, there is no necessary connection between providing a free service and tourism promotion.  We request that further developments in this area be carefully examined.  A common approach between local centres and national institutions would benefit a country that sells the personal experience to tourists as being paramount.  The causal connection between free online access for family histories and tourism inflow has not been demonstrated.</p><p>  Let me pose a second question which is an interesting one.  Who derives value from our services?  We have over 1.2 million visitors a year to our website and over 560,000 registered users, the majority of whom are from outside the State.  The data are accessed by two groups: professional genealogists or researchers and amateur family historians.  In the case of the former, it is reasonable to charge fees in order to provide them with structured access to what is a key input to their professional revenues.</p> <p> The second group is more interesting.  Our site provides them with access to one of the key sources for Irish family history research, parish records, on an all-Ireland database.  This unique and invaluable resource was created in each county and it enables the user, with a few clicks of a mouse, to locate records even if they have limited information or no known county of origin.  The fees charged are nominal and our customer surveys show that they are generally understanding of our need to be able to fund the provision of our services.  Tracing family history is not easy or straightforward, and researchers expect assistance.  Our online service is supported by an advisory service in each county and via a centralised customer service system where users can avail of free advice and help from locally based experts.</p><p> There is no evidence that our operating structure in any way, shape or form holds back the wider development of genealogy in Ireland and the derivation of value from it.  With regard to maximising the value of our genealogical heritage, the IFHF hopes that a way forward can be found whereby the local county genealogy centres and national institutions can work together within the existing and self-funding common platform.  This would offer overseas users and visitors to Ireland a unique blend of a local and national experience.</p><p> To finish, I will give the committee a more tangible example of the potential there is to leverage our existing structures and institutions in order to create value and benefits for the whole island of Ireland.  We recently hosted two Facebook question-and-answer sessions in conjunction with Tourism Ireland which were highly successful.  The success of this prompted us to co-sponsor a competition to win a trip to Ireland over the new year, and to offer credits to access our database to the runners-up.  We emailed more than 250,000 of our subscribers overseas, and more than 20,000 globally entered the online competition.  These activities have resulted in the growth of Tourism Ireland's Ireland Family History page from 53,000 likes to over 186,000.  The co-operation between us achieved exactly the kind of result that could be replicated and leveraged across all of our county centres and national institutions, creating a vibrant, well-resourced community to ensure we capture the full value of our genealogical heritage both immediately and in the future.</p><p> My colleague Mr. Fintan Mullen from the Ulster Historical Foundation, which is one of the oldest and most successful genealogical organisations in Ireland, will add a few words.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Mullen" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000006#G00200"><p>In addressing ourselves to the issue of capturing the full value of our genealogical heritage, we would make the point that an all-island approach is vital, and this has been the case with the Irish Family History Foundation.</p><p>  To give a bit of background, there are four centres in Northern Ireland.  They are embedded in the archives and institutions and the heritage sector there.  The Ulster Historical Foundation, UHF, grew out of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland; Derry Genealogy is part of Derry City and Archives Service; Armagh Ancestry is linked directly with Armagh City Council; and Irish World has a broad reach not only within Northern Ireland but across the world.  We are embedded within the heritage scene.  All of the centres were centrally involved in the development of the Irish Family History Foundation and in the <i>rootsireland.ie</i> database.  The four centres were some of the first to join it.  The Ulster Historical Foundation pioneered the prototype system and Armagh Ancestry piloted the first phase of the development of the <i>rootsireland.ie</i> database, and it is fair to say that all-island co-operation was crucial in the development of what is now equivalent to a national service.</p><p>  Historically, the North has always been centrally involved.  For example, two of those involved, if I might name them, were Sir Robert Kidd, the ex-head of Northern Ireland's civil service, and Mr. Paddy Doherty of Derry Inner City Trust.  In terms of our ongoing co-operation with the bodies, archives, etc., in Northern Ireland which are vital to the success of the genealogical heritage enterprise, UHF works regularly with the Public Record Office, Derry City Archives and the Cardinal Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich Library and Archive, which are the three main archival institutions in Northern Ireland.  That is merely a small example of how the cross-Border co-operation is essential if we are to maximise the full value of our genealogical heritage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Grenham" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000006#G00400"><p>I am here as an author, a columnist with <i>The Irish Times</i> and the author of <i>Tracing Your Irish Ancestors</i>.  I might seem to be a little lonely here on my own but, in fact, I am a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists, a member of the Genealogical Society of Ireland and a big source of profit for the Irish Family History Foundation, <i>rootsireland.ie</i>.</p><p>  My focus will be on the researcher, the person who is trying to find his or her ancestors, particularly coming from abroad.  The relationship between Ireland and its diaspora is utterly unique and this is not appreciated nearly enough in Ireland itself.  If one thinks of worldwide figures, only Germany has more people of German origin outside the country than inside.  In the case of Germany, there are 150 million persons of German origin outside Germany but there are 90 million Germans.  Then one looks at Ireland where there are 80 million persons of Irish origin outside Ireland but there are only 6.5 million of us still here.  The disproportion is extraordinary and it does not exist anywhere else on the planet.  If one thinks of it, Ireland today has the population of Rio de Janeiro and the Irish outside Ireland would number those in New York, London, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai all rolled together and then some.  We have a unique relationship with the Irish outside Ireland and that uniqueness places an obligation on us, particularly in genealogy, to make it as easy as possible for these people to find their ancestors and to find their way back home.</p><p>  It is also the reason that genealogy in Ireland cannot be as simple a business as it might be elsewhere.  In other words, purely commercial imperatives cannot dictate how genealogy works in Ireland.  We have a duty to make it as simple, low-cost and widely available as possible.</p><p>  Of course, there are economic benefits and people will point them up readily.  In my experience, the two Holy Grails for people doing genealogical research are to find the place from which their ancestors left, to actually stand in the field up to their ankles in mud, and to meet any surviving extended family.</p><p>  The tourism benefits are self-evident.  It always has been big difficulty in dealing with public bodies to make a business case to state that if one spends &euro;1,000 on improving genealogical research services here, so many extra visitors will come.  There may be times when common sense is more important than a watertight business case.  It is common sense - it is as clear as the nose on one's face - that if one makes it easier for people to find out where they came from, more of them will come back.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>  Rather than talk about the great plethora of sources that I would love to see digitised and online, I will focus on the four main sources that everybody doing research on Irish records will have to go through at some point or other.  These are the two 19th century land tax surveys, Griffith's Valuation and the Tithe Applotment Books, the 1901 and 1911 census returns, the State records of births, marriages and deaths from 1864, and the church records.  The first two of those four - the land tax records and the 1901 and 1911 Census returns - are already online.  In particular, the census returns were a revelation to many not involved in genealogy of just how powerful digitisation could be.  The other two are more problematic.  The General Register Office records are, as my colleague, Ms M&aacute;ire Mac Conghail, pointed out, coming online in bits and pieces.  The standard in general register offices in Australia, Scotland and Northern Ireland is to have these records fully searchable - for births, up to 100 years old; for marriages; up to 70 years old; and for deaths, up to 50 years old.  The General Register Office of Northern Ireland is about to do this for the records under its control, which include many areas that are now in the Republic.  We will have a situation in which those in east Donegal or north Louth will be able to search for their family history on the website of the General Register Office of Northern Ireland but will have to come in person, sit in front of an index register and work their way through a Victorian indexing system to do research in the South.  It is not as if there is a great deal of money required to digitise these records.</p> <p>The General Register Office already has a full digital copy of everything behind the counter, but it is not available to the public.  The obstacle is legal.  The Registrar General interprets the law to mean that he cannot make the records available except via the index system that exists.  He is probably right.  Northern Ireland had to pass a law, with the Queen's assent, to allow it to do what it is about to do.  Something must be done about this major source.</p><p> The last source is church records.  As the Irish Family History Foundation has pointed out, there is a huge database of church records, but it is incomplete.  The website <i>irishgenealogy.ie</i>has a large database which is also incomplete.  The National Library has digital images of all parish registers up to 1880, but not online.  It is surely not beyond the wit of the administrators of this country to bring those three bodies together to create a resource that is up to date and provides record images and database searches.  It need not be free.  It could be paid for in some form or other by the end user, but it must be done and it must be available.</p></speech>

I must declare a conflict of interest, not in this section but in one of the other sections.  It is in respect of Eneclann, which will appear before the committee.  I have shares and I must declare that as a conflict of interest so that we do not run into difficulties later.</p><p>  I probably must declare another interest because I have a passion about this subject.  I have nearly gone blind reading microfilm, microfiche and paper records.  I value the development of being able to research things online.  Having done it the hard way, one appreciates being able to do it through a more modern arrangement.  I have spent time in many of the repositories, including some of those in Northern Ireland.  I have not had a chance to spend much time in the new Public Record Office of Northern Ireland offices, but I did spend time in the old office on the Lisburn Road.  The idea of an all-Ireland facility should be a given.</p><p>  Mr. John Grenham made a point about the law.  Can he direct us to the law that was changed in respect of what was done in the UK so that we can get over this rule?  I presume he would say it was a game-changer to have the GRO records themselves, as opposed to the indexes.</p><p>  My next question is probably a very political one, and the witnesses are free to respond as they wish, but why is it that the Irish Family History Foundation and <i>irishgenealogy.ie</i> have fairly comprehensive church records, and why can the set of records not be complete?  It is fine if one knows where to find them, but there is a difficulty for somebody who does not realise how fragmented that set of records is.  Perhaps the witnesses would address that issue.  I would look at this from the same perspective as John Grenham - that is, as somebody who is trying to use the records.  That is the focus we should have on this.</p><p>  With regard to Mr. Michael Merrigan's presentation, the principle of records being in public ownership with a right to access is a good one.  In his view, does that preclude charging for records?  What is his view on that?  Karel Kiely made the point about not being able to run the service without the income, which obviously goes back into the service.  What is his response to that?  This will obviously be a pivotal issue.</p><p>  I totally agree with the point, which cannot be said loudly enough, about the move to Werburgh Street and the appalling building that has been provided.  The idea of a flagship building is something on which I hope this committee will comment.  If this is the first introduction for the visitor, it creates a very bad impression.  We are not simply discussing tourists from abroad.  I found the place where my family came from and I return to those places; I buy books and spend money there.  The opportunities do not just relate to tourists.  There are other things that one might not consider to be valuable in this whole area, but if we select the topic carefully, so that it is not put exclusively into an economic arena, there is a value beyond the economic as well which would be appreciated.</p></speech>

The General Register Office is now under the authority of the Department of Social Protection, and two social protection Bills are introduced every year.  I have suggested repeatedly to the Department that two lines in one of those Bills would be enough to change the civil registration to give authority to the Minister to allow access under conditions specified by the Minister.  That would be the end of the legal obstacle.  I will forward the legislative example from the UK to the committee.</p></speech>

We supplied a map in the submission to the committee.  The majority of the 32 Irish counties are on <i>rootsireland.ie</i>.  We will be adding a great deal more data in 2014.  The Department's site covers part of Dublin and parts of Cork and Kerry.  We would obviously welcome one website, but we have the majority of the records on our site.  Some of what we do not have is due to churches not giving us access.  In my case, in Celbridge, County Kildare, I was never allowed to take the parish registers.  That was always a consideration for us.  Unless the parishes were willing we could not take the registers from them.  John Grenham said earlier that the Department and the Irish Family History Foundation were the main players.  The churches, too, have ownership over their records and what happens to those records.  They should be consulted and the records should be made available on their terms as well.  That has been a problem in some counties, where things were done against the wishes of the churches, especially the Catholic Church.  Parishes feel strong ownership of their records and what happens to those records.  They are the records of local people in that county, and that is a very strong connection that should be maintained.</p><p>  Of course we would welcome partnership.  We have always engaged with the Department when we have been asked to make suggestions, and we have made suggestions about how things could move forward.  We would love to have all the parish records on one website, certainly as a starting point.</p></speech>

The issue of security always seems to come up in regard to these particular records - the misuse of the GRO records.  One of our members came up with an idea which could be looked at.  Certificates obtained for research purposes would be stamped "Purely for research purposes," which would get over that particular problem.  </p><p>  My colleagues will speak about the pay-per-view sites, the free sites and how we deal with that on our own website, but I will come back to Deputy Murphy's point on the principle of public ownership and right of access.  This is a cornerstone principle which we believe should be in legislation and in public policy.  It is well understood that records have to be digitised and there is a cost there, and the recovery cost is fine.  That is perfectly understandable, but we thought that a cornerstone of the State's policy in respect of genealogical records within the State, whether held in private or public hands, should be the principle of public ownership and right of access to the heritage.  The register is owned by the church and various databases are owned by particular organisations, but access to that heritage should be based on the principle of public ownership and right of access.  It does not preclude selling access to my colleagues' databases.  We have a particular view, as I am sure my colleagues know, and would favour the relationship they have in Northern Ireland with heritage centres rather than the current one, because we look at it in three ways - from the point of view of the security of data, the security and viability of the centres themselves and the security of the employment they provide.  Our proposals suggests they should be incorporated within the public library sector, on a par with what they have in Northern Ireland or very near to it.  One of our issues is that the security of legal ownership of the database would be defined by that process.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Tom Conlon, on how we deal with access to the website, etc.</p></speech>

Any records we have are free on that.  We believe in the principle of free access.  In respect of records that have a monetary value - that is, that have the potential to create revenue - we have a concern that the legal ownership of those should be very clear in the event of something happening.  Should they fall into private hands or whatever, we want to be very sure that such records would continue to be public records at all times.</p></speech>

In libraries generally, one is aiming for free access as far as possible.  That has not really been possible in the case of genealogy services.  There is a huge cost to getting the records digitised and computerised, but fortunately, through the good use of F&Aacute;S schemes, we have got to where are.  Even at that, to continue to provide the service and to provide the centres will not be possible without some charge - a modest one, we hope.  Many of the centres are supported by the local authorities.  In Leitrim the county council gives us a substantial subvention every year, and it is the same in many other counties.  It is an accumulation of the money one takes in from charges, a subsidy from the county council and a lot of voluntary effort.  If it had to be paid for otherwise, it would cost a huge amount of money.  I think most people are prepared to pay a modest charge for it.</p><p>  The whole purpose of this is tourism.  It could be Irish tourists as well as Americans and those of other nationalities.  As Mr. Grenham said, the crucial thing for the tourist is to find the house and the place.  Some of the sources talked about today, while they are useful in their own right, will not necessarily do that.  We would all like to see the 1926 census, but it of marginal importance in terms of finding places.  When one knows where one is from, then one looks at the census.  </p><p>  The birth, marriage and death records - civil and church records - are the critical ones.   The whole thing will not be complete until all of the church and civil records are computerised and digitised for the whole country.  As it is at the moment, the most important source is <i>rootsireland.ie</i>, the Irish Family History Foundation, because it has about 80% of the church records.  A considerable number of civil records are already fully indexed in some counties.  As of now, it is the only show in town.</p><p>  If one is an American who wants to find the place of one's ancestors, <i>rootsireland.ie</i> is the primary site.  The other things are useful and important but it is the crucial one.  The most important thing is to get the rest of this done.  A lot of our centres are doing that with the benefit of the bit of money they are getting from being online.  When it is all done, we will need to have it all together.  Somebody mentioned that although most of the 32 counties are on our site, County Kerry, Dublin city and part of Cork are not.  There needs to be a means of getting that together.  As I said, 75% or 80% of it is on the Irish Family History Foundation site already.  There are the portions not done in those counties and then there are the counties not on it which are on the Department's site.  I would like to see more co-operation with the Department to get that together as well as with the other stakeholders to decide how that will be done.  We all want to get to a point at which all of those crucial church and State records - birth, marriage and death records principally - are all computerised and digitised and available in some fashion.  I hope we will have more discussion with the Department.  We have had some over the years but there needs to be intense negotiations as soon as possible to bring that to a conclusion.  As of now, the Irish Family History Foundation is providing a tremendous resource at a very minimal cost and it is still totally reliant on the centres and voluntary effort.</p></speech>

It is very good and very often it brings one down to 1900.  One has to remember that they are transcriptions and from the researcher's point of view, one has to see the original to carry through the research.  That is the difference between <i>rootsireland.ie</i> and the Department's website.  The Department's website, which is a work in progress, certainly is not as expansive county-wise.  However, its policy is to match up the transcription to the image so that, literally from the computer table, one can feel confident that what one has retrieved is the original record.</p></speech>

I declare an interest in that I am the chairman of the Irish Family History Foundation.  I compliment Mr. Michael Merrigan.  I do not know a lot about him but he has been a great source of information.  We should go a step further and say he has been a great source of motivation as well.  I was very pleased to sponsor the Bill on the 1926 census and it was thanks to him that it was possible.</p> <p>Unfortunately, given the way the whip system works, we saw the outcome even though everybody favoured it.  There must be a lesson in that for us here in respect of the bigger picture which we are discussing today and how we might go forward.</p><p> The speakers mentioned the consultative process, which is probably the basis of what we must look at here.  The speakers might have some ideas on that.  It strikes me that a very fine element of a consultative process is taking place here today in a very disciplined manner with everybody getting an opportunity to have an input.  With the other witnesses who are due as well, I would like to think that whatever report comes from these hearings, it will be one element in the next set of steps we must take.  Perhaps this committee could continue to form part of and lead that consultative process.  Each person here today has made reference to the agreement that we should all work together and that is exactly what we should be doing.  I do not think we would be thanked for not doing so.  We must be seen to be working together.  While respecting the autonomy and existence of each group, there are so many players, many of whom will not be participating at all in these sessions so they are all there.  If Mr. Merrigan gets a chance to respond, he might tell us if he has thought a consultative process through, the extent to which the Department should play a role or whether this committee should play a role.  </p><p> In respect of a point made by Mr. Mullen, we have all been looking at North-South co-operation over the years.  We have not really got a great CV with regard to that generally.  It is certainly there in respect of the Irish Family History Foundation and genealogy and some of the personalities which have been mentioned by Mr. Mullen come from both sides of the divide.  I do not use that term in a derogatory sense.  For that reason, there is some message.  Could Mr. Mullen tell me if there is any resistance to that type of direct co-operation and are there any lessons to be learned as we have a consultative process in the future?  Ms O'Meara comes from my county even though it is north Tipperary - we will only have one shortly.  Again, there are messages there about the linking of genealogy as she and others are doing in the area.  The centre is part of the built heritage.  Does Ms O'Meara find that the local authority is forthcoming?  It is just that it is happening or is there active participation?</p></speech>

I have been a member of the Irish Genealogical Society although I am not as active as I would like to be.  One thing that is important is the provision of as much free information for people as possible because it is a deterrent if people realise that they must give Visa card details to access information online.  From the perspective of schools and education, it is much better that there are much free sources as ever.</p><p>  I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection and one of the issues we are looking at is the youth guarantee, which is to be implemented in the new year.  The idea is that money will be put into training and work experience opportunities for young people under the age of 26.  One area where there could be many opportunities for young people would be research under the heading of genealogical information.  Perhaps some of that is already going on.  If so, could any of the witnesses who are aware of it elaborate on it?  Does anyone on the panel see opportunities there?  If some of the funding from the youth guarantee could be directed towards organisations in which they are involved or at local authority level, it would be a great opportunity for young people because it involves research, administration and finding out about our history and heritage.  It would be a great experience for a young person to have on their CV and would also be a great learning experience.</p></speech>

It is something in which many people have a general interest.  I note that several submissions note the quality of the General Register Office for Northern Ireland's recent digitisation projects.  What aspects of those projects do the speakers believe can be replicated?</p><p>  The speakers said that the General Register Office's new facilities are less than ideal.  Do they think they can be brought up to scratch?  What needs to be done to bring them up to scratch?  I note that while it is a very valuable resource of researchers, the Irish Genealogy website has a number of omissions, which speakers noted in their presentations - births and deaths, British consular birth and death records, Boer War and Word War I deaths.  Do the speakers believe they should be moved from Roscommon or it is merely the case that they should be available online?  </p></speech>

His support down through the years with the Bills has been very much appreciated by our members.  We could say we are almost there.  A very good consultative process was begun in 1998.  It came out of a suggestion we made during the passing of the National Cultural Institutions Act through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We were working very closely with Senator Paschal Mooney.  Having got nearly 28 amendments there, one suggestion we had was that we need to know what we are talking about regarding what our genealogical heritage is.  What is the scope of this?  The Minister at the time, Michael D. Higgins, agreed to this suggestion.  There was a change of Government following the election and his successor, S&iacute;le de Valera, initiated the study in 1998.  That produced a very interesting and comprehensive interim report.  That interim report could have formed the basis for a draft policy and plan for genealogy in Ireland.  Unfortunately, when the final report came, they chose one particular suggestion within the consultative process.  Unfortunately, that was not what the Minister had asked for so that consultative process ended.  What I am suggesting is that the basis for the interim document of 1998 could be looked at again.  If we want to capture the full value of our genealogical research, we must first understand what it is.  We proposed within our document a national inventory of genealogical records or records of genealogical potential.  These are records that may not be formed for a genealogical purpose but which have genealogical potential.  All genealogists are quite aware of that.  The maximum amount comes from archaeology.  A grave yield site next to a known archaeological site is one of archaeological potential.  That consultative process that took place in 1998 by the Heritage Council was very open and inclusive.  I suggest that the committee with the possible aid of the Heritage Council build on what was done in the interim report from 1998 and see where things have changed.</p><p>  What is our genealogical heritage and what is genealogy?  I will bring my colleague in on that in a moment.  That must be looked at because if we can get that clear, we can all work together and say this is what we are talking about.  Regarding the youth guarantee, I agree that there are many opportunities there.  While we are getting an update on that interim report - in other words, doing the scoping exercise - there could be positions there.  </p> <p>There are issues there that could be looked at.  There is employment potential within the process but, at the end of the day, we need a national plan and policy.  All of us, even through we are coming at this in many different ways, we can work towards that.  However, we must work towards it on the basis that it is a national endeavour.</p><p> Genealogy is the only resource that can initiate, engage and successfully maintain a connection with our diaspora to create an affinity with Ireland through the promotion of an awareness, appreciation and knowledge of a shared ancestral heritage by providing free public access.  If an affinity is created, an individual might not only look at this to source his or her family history but he or she might buy Irish products or, at another level, he or she might invest.  We have to maintain and sustain an affinity with Ireland and build on it and that can be done even with a pay-per-view model.</p></speech>

It could be described as the study of the descent of a person from a common ancestor and the enumeration of the ancestors and descendants of that person or family in the natural order of succession.  That seems a mouthful but it is intended to give an idea of what we do when we are asked to investigate the person's pedigree, lineage or heritage.  That can lead to 100 other questions.</p></speech>

Tipperary has not experienced as much emigration as the west.  However, our centre attracts a significant number of tourists to our county.  Up to 6,000 people had used our online service up to November this year, of whom 893 travelled from abroad and visited my office.  That does not include domestic visitors.  That means a significant number of people have visited Nenagh.  We charge a small fee for the genealogy service we provide while they spend a great deal of money in the local economy.  We are a tourist point for the county when the tourist office is closed .</p><p>  Deputy Tuffy asked about education.  I have run several genealogy classes with the VEC for adult learners and primary school children.  The children visit us as part of their curriculum to trace their ancestors and we provide that service free of charge to them.  The centre also works with several MA programmes in the University of Limerick to provide a free service of lectures for students who visit us.  We are also an important source for local historians who are writing parish histories and, again, that service is free.</p></speech>

It is pleasing that there is a positive attitude towards co-operation, North and South.  As the Senator noted, however, people have not always been able to think what the initial co-operation would entail and are sometimes left scratching their heads.  We have found from our work with North-South bodies, such as Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency, that they see family histories as an easy win when they are otherwise dealing with contentious issues.  I recently joined the round table of the community relations council and the Heritage Lottery Foundation on the decade of commemorations.  This is an emotive and sensitive issue in the North and people are keen to take these easy opportunities.  Family history has proven to be an easy win because we can approach these historical subjects at the micro level of who, when and where.  We have working on a project with Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency to investigate aspects of the Ulster plantation and the various migrant communities in Ulster alongside those who were already there.  There is great potential for developing closer working relationships and exploring educational opportunities.</p><p>  With regard to digitisation, the Irish Family History Foundation has no objection in principle to posting images of original records online.  Much of the data we hold were captured in an era when the technology was not as far advanced as it is now.  We always want to work with the permission of the churches, which is not to say others who have digitised records did not have permission.  As a body working at an all-Ireland level we have always been careful to bring the churches with us.</p><p>  I am not entirely certain that the four centres in Northern Ireland are supported through the library network.  The Ulster Historical Foundation is a completely self-sustaining body.  We do not receive public moneys in support of our work.</p></speech>

There have been cases of duplication, although fortunately not to any great extent.  Deputy Tuffy asked about the use of schemes.  We have gotten as far as we have largely through the use of schemes and we have participated in all the new schemes, such as T&uacute;s and the rural social schemes.  The judicious use of schemes allows us to achieve a considerable amount.  Certain work is done abroad, somewhat unfortunately given that we would prefer to have it done here.  Cost is a factor in such decisions because it can be much cheaper to have the work done abroad.  Many things are desirable, including the issue of the images to which Mr. Mullen referred, but the priority should be completing of church and civil records for the entire 32 counties.  It would be lovely to see the images - and that will probably happen anyway - but the records are not complete for a number of counties.  There are also two separate sites, with the Irish Family History Foundation covering the larger part of the country.  It should be a priority to make all of these critical records accessible from one site.</p></speech>

We have heard four different presentations, from the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, the Irish Family History Foundation, the Genealogical Society of Ireland and Mr. John Grenham, respectively.</p> <p>To pick up on Mr. Merrigan's point on conflicts of interest and potential confusion, it seems some or all of the witnesses are linked in one way or another on a <i>prima facie</i>basis and I seek clarification on this.  Are all the members of the Genealogical Society of Ireland also members of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, the APGI?  It would be important for the committee to have clarification on this.  I do not have a profession conflict of interest, but I do have a personal conflict of interest in that my mother is a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland.  I am not a member of the organisation and I did not receive a briefing over Sunday lunch, but I must state it for the record.  It is unusual for a Member of Parliament to be questioning his mother at an official level.</p></speech>

I will not ask Mam what we are having for dinner on Sunday.</p><p>  The broad issue of access and resources seems to be a general theme.  Some of the groups obtain private income or make money from this.  The Irish Family History Foundation makes income from the very successful generating of genealogical services.  The submissions we received from the Genealogical Society of Ireland and the Association of Professional Genealogists of Ireland were concerned with how to maximise access as widely as possible to as many people as possible from the diaspora and Irish citizens.  Are there tensions between public access and creating or protecting jobs?  I need to know broadly what it means.</p><p>  I acknowledge the support of the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for <i>irishgenealogy.ie</i>.  I have heard from Mr. Merrigan and from my mother about the clear argument for reviewing the Statistics Act.  It makes great sense.  I do not want the witness to respond on the issue but I wish to know I am clear on the recommendation on amending the 100 year rule in the Statistics Act, particularly with regard to the 1926 census.  We know from Ms Catriona Crowe that an amount of money may be needed as significant investment was needed to put online the National Archives.  Perhaps we need to invite in the CSO to hear its view.</p></speech>

The Scottish collections have all been centralised in one location to one standard produced ten years ago.  It has been incredibly successful.  It is a pay-per-view site and it is generating income.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eibhl&iacute;n Roche" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000012#N00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the Guinness archive to engage with it on this topic.  The Guinness archive is based in the Guinness Storehouse, which is Ireland's premier visitor attraction.  It is part of Diageo's operation in Ireland.  It is an unusual archive service in the Irish cultural landscape.  It is a corporate archive which, as well as fulfilling a service to its parent organisation, is also open to the public.</p><p>  The Guinness company was founded in 1759 and there has always been a culture and philosophy within the organisation of both recognising the importance of the company's own heritage and its role within the culture of Ireland, and the need to preserve this heritage.  Today, the Guinness archive spans over 7,000 linear metres of paper records documenting the history of St. James's Gate brewery and the Guinness brand in Ireland from 1759 to the present.  Many researchers will be familiar with the 1901 and 1911 census, military records and church records, as we heard earlier today, but records of private industry are often neglected sources of genealogical information.</p><p>  The Guinness company has been an integral part of Dublin's economic life for over two centuries.  By 1930, for example, it was estimated that one in 30 people in Dublin relied on the Guinness company for their livelihood.  It was the single largest employer in the city for over a century.</p> <p>Part of our extensive archive collection contains the personnel or employment records of 20,000 such past employees, providing an important private social record which complements the official State record.</p><p> The Guinness Archive is unique in an Irish context in first, preserving these records and, second, making them publically accessible.  Over the past number of years we have heavily invested in making this information more publically accessible.  We have published a database of past employees on our website,<i>guinnesss-storehouse.com</i>, and this database is also available in the public research room of the Guinness Archive.  Recently, we made our database available on <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i>as part of the data sets that are available to access for free on the website.</p><p> Due to the often sensitive nature of the information contained within the personnel files, which can extend to financial and medical information, the Guinness Archive only allows direct descendents full access to original employment files.  As per data protection legislation, we do not allow access to the personnel files of living individuals and we only publically release details of past employees who we know are deceased or were born more than 110 years ago.</p><p> The information we have made publically available is information that is either already part of the official record or information that is not deemed personally sensitive.  It is important to note these files are files of private industry and not public files, that is, State records, which means the content of these files has to be treated differently from State records.  </p><p> Within the Guinness Storehouse, we certainly feel we are offering an important public service by making these employment records publically available.  Our researchers are mainly Irish but, increasingly, we are receiving genealogical queries from researchers around the world.  Guinness Storehouse received almost 1.1 million visitors in 2012, a 6% increase on 2011 visitor numbers.  This year, the year of The Gathering, I am happy to say we are on track to exceed our 2012 visitor numbers.  As we all know, The Gathering has highlighted the importance of our cultural heritage, tapping into the global Irish diaspora of more than 70 million people.  </p><p> The latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures specifically relating to genealogy tourism are slightly old and date from 2011 when an estimated 92,000 overseas visitors engaged in tracing roots-genealogical activities.  It will be interesting to see the impact of The Gathering on the 2012 genealogy tourism numbers.</p><p> It is imperative that initiatives such as The Gathering are backed up by access to genealogical resources, both public and private, and that records are viewed as part of our heritage to be valued and preserved as much as our castles and gardens.</p><p> However, our genealogy records are not just of importance for tourism.  As we enter the decade of centenaries, our historical archives are the window to the past, to accurately explore the history of Ireland during the 1912-22 period.  Genealogical records form an important part of our national collective memory and will form an important part of the historical debate on the events of this era. </p><p> To put that into context in terms of the Guinness Archive collection, we hold a large amount of historical material relating to the First World War.  This material ranges from the impact of the war on the company's operation to files relating to the 800 men who left the brewery to fight in the war.  These files are a hugely important sources for genealogical research and very much complement the official State and military records to bring a more complete history to life.</p><p> The investment Diageo has made in the Guinness Archive and the focus on preserving and making accessible the archive holdings to public is, ultimately, an investment in preserving a part of our national culture.  Records of private industry are as important, in genealogical terms, as official State records and should, therefore, form part of the national debate when considering a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Rev. Dr. Norman Gamble" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000013#O00200"><p>The Irish Railway Records Society was founded in 1946 and is based in the former goods offices at Heuston Station in Dublin.  It holds the non-statutory archives of the various railway companies which became part of CIE.  The statutory records - minutes, share registers, etc., - are held by the CIE group.  The society works closely with Irish Rail, the Rail Safety Commission, the rail accident investigation unit and the Railway Procurement Agency.  In addition to our archives, we have a publishing programme, a regular journal, and a library and meetings in Dublin, Cork and London.  If one goes to the 1911 census on the National Archives website, one will see a 1911 Dublin tram timetable which the library made available from its collection as part of the census digitisation project.</p><p>  The strength of our position is that we are widely known among railway staff some of whom are members and, therefore, when offices get cleared, we often get a telephone call.  As a specialist archive, we are probably best likened to military archives.  </p><p>  The focus of my presentation will be on staff records.  In the year of the Lock-out centenary, we have complete staff records from the Dublin United Tramway Company, although only from 1923 as its headquarters were burned down in the Civil War.  However, our main focus is on railway company archives.  The railways were the biggest employers collectively in Victorian and Edwardian Ireland and in addition to running trains, they ran hotels, docks and engineering workshops.  We hold staff records for all the big companies and some of the smaller ones.  </p><p>  In 1924 all the companies lying entirely within the Free State were formed into the Great Southern Railway.  This company was allowed to buy out competing bus and lorry operators and we have a comprehensive set of bus driver and conductor records from the 1930s.  The main body of our staff records are in ledgers from the main railway companies.  Some are grouped by stations, such as Cork or Limerick, while some companies had a simple chronological ledger.  These generally go back to the 1880s.  Some of the smaller companies, such as the Cavan and Leitrim ones, have all their staff in one ledger.  Cork had five railway companies and we have records for three of them.  </p><p>  The case of the Great Northern Railway is unique as we have a card index which, subject to some limitations, gives comprehensive coverage of all departments of what was until 1958 a cross-Border body.  We have records of the company's staff for all of Northern Ireland.  As an aside, it is worth noting that those who enlisted in the First World War were given a crimson card with the heading "European war".  The Great Northern Railway records are probably the most comprehensive as the engineering department records are patchy to say the least for CIE. </p><p>  We have through voluntary endeavour provided finding aides for some of these volumes and continue to do so.  Our latest project is to create a database of pensioners for the Great Southern and Western Railway in 1907.  Pensions then, as now, were a touchy subject.  When the old age pension was introduced in 1906, the Great Southern and Western Railway told all its existing pensioners to claim the old age pension.  They were then told their company pensions would be adjusted to compensate.  There is a voluminous file of correspondence on this matter and we are creating a database that will cover many hundreds of railway workers in the largesse of the Irish railway companies, some of whom were employed from the opening of the line in 1846.</p><p>  At the other end of the timescale, we have a full list of the thousands of Great Southern Railway staff who volunteered for service in the LDF during the Emergency.  We also have files covering enlistment in Northern Ireland showing the lengths to which the Great Northern Railway went to keep its staff from voluntarily enlisting by having them designated as essential workers.  We are carrying out this database project to help researchers but also to protect individual files from multiple handling.   </p><p>  We now come to our dilemma which is how to conserve the material and protect it from further deterioration.</p> <p>We have rebound ledgers some with assistance from the Heritage Council but this is only a partial solution.  Digitisation in a searchable format is the way forward but is beyond the means of the society at present.  We open our archives to the public each Tuesday evening and provide a service to historians and those seeking more information about their family history.  However, this is as far as we can go as a voluntary body.  In addition to these opening hours, we commit additional hours to listing material, drawing up finding aids and dealing with Internet and postal queries.  </p><p> In addition to family history it is worth, in the context of the decade of centenaries, outlining a selection of what we possess of a political nature.  We have the founding memorandum of the Dublin Employers Federation, together with a large file on the 1911 railway strike which is often considered to be a dry-run for 1913.  There are files on the European War, as it was then called, with material on the employment of wounded soldiers and veterans.  Sean Heuston was a clerk of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company.  His execution is recorded briefly in red ink in the staff record.  The staff registers record service in the war and we can see that many returnee veterans did not last long in employment, such was their poor physical and mental health.  This material continues to be of interest to historians.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline our archival activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Donovan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000014#P00200"><p>I would like to introduce my co-founder and fellow director at Eneclann, Ms Fiona Fitzsimons.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.  In this short presentation, I will highlight key points from our 15 years of experience in genealogy in Ireland.  The first question is what is the face of genealogy in Ireland and worldwide today?  Second, given that genealogy has been transformed in the last 15 years, what can we learn from the State's role in this?  Finally, as a company at the forefront of these changes, what do we recommend to propel progress?</p><p>  Some committee members may already familiar with Eneclann but for the benefit of those who are not, Eneclann is a heritage company that develops digital resources for Irish family history as well as a range of complimentary services and products.  The company was established in 1998 as a campus company at Trinity College Dublin and has won awards for its innovative business model.  To date, Eneclann has published over 1,000 individual titles and over 70 million records online.  It played a key role in the creation of the web service <i><i>irishorigins.com, </i></i>in 2003 and is a joint-venture partner in<i></i><i><i>www.findmypast.ie</i></i>, launched in 2011.  The company is well known for its high-profile genealogical research.  This year, for example, we met Hollywood star Tom Cruise at Iveagh House to delivery his family history, stretching back over 1,000 years, a project we funded to support The Gathering initiative.  We have worked with the popular television series, &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; as well as home-produced features and are currently the anchor Irish researcher for NBC's &quot;Faces of America&quot; in the United States. </p><p>  The company's highest-profile work was researching the ancestry of President Barack Obama.  The company worked with Tourism Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to maximise the value of his visit to Ireland in 2011 and introduced Obama to his closest-living cousin in Ireland, a man called Dick Benn from Tipperary.  This year, at the request of the White House, we gave Michelle Obama and her daughters a personal tour of their family history at Trinity College library.  </p><p>  Because of our expertise with historic records, Eneclann has been appointed by the State to tackle many landmark archival projects.  We worked with the Department of Defence on a massive data disaster recovery of over 130,000 files.  We worked on a project for the Department of Health involving a detailed listing of over 200,000 records relating to children in State care.  We also undertook work for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we scheduled over 100,000 Land Commission files.  Eneclann is also a trusted partner of many cultural institutions in Ireland and abroad including the National Archives of Ireland, Trinity College library, the UK National Archives, Family Search and many more.  </p><p>  What can we say about genealogy in the wider world in 2013?  In the past 15 years we have had a digital revolution in Irish family history.  There are now over 100 million Irish records online.  These records are much more accessible than they have ever been before and are much easier to search.  As a consequence, we have seen an exponential growth in the numbers of people tracing their Irish origins at home and abroad.  The two engines behind this change are the internet and popular entertainment.  Eneclann has been a technology pioneer in Irish genealogy, from publishing one of the first databases of material in 1999 to releasing the first complete edition of Griffith's Valuation online in 2003, a key resource, to our current position of having brought over 70 million Irish records to the public via the <i><i>findmypast.ie </i></i>website.  Popular entertainment and major television programmes have also played a role.  Genealogy is no longer perceived as a hobby for people with an aristocratic background.  There is an understanding that every family has a story and that it is possible to trace almost every family back to the 1830s.  </p><p>  Genealogy is now a major worldwide hobby.  What is the size of the global genealogy audience?  Marketing surveys in the United States over the past 20 years have shown a dramatic rise in interest in genealogy, with recent figures showing that 73% of the adult population are interested, which equates to 173 million people.  Of those interested, it is estimated that 17% or 40 million are very interested.  While surveys of this nature have not been carried out in Ireland and Britain, the continued success of family history television programmes as well as the strong commercial success of Irish and British online publishers like<i><i></i></i><i>findmypast.ie,</i> suggest that the underlying trend is the same.  </p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to the short roots tourism section of our submission.  An estimated 90,000 people visit Ireland each year to engage in family history research.  <i>findmypast.ie</i> now has more than 70,000 registered users from Ireland.  This is the face of twenty first century genealogy.  It is serviced almost entirely by online genealogy publishers, whether private or public.  Genealogy is a business, a growing industry that offers employment prospects and tax revenues.  The worldwide value of genealogy is approximately &euro;4 billion and is consistently growing at rates of over 20% per annum.  The scale of Irish emigration and the size of the Irish diaspora in general are important metrics in determining the potential value of Irish genealogy.  </p><p>  What can we learn from the last 15 years?  Our submission identifies those things the State did that worked and those that did not.  Let us look at the successes.  First we have the publication of the 1901 - 1911 census records online.  Even with budget cuts, the National Archives continues to release records online by working in partnership with the private sector, particularly <i>findmypast.ie</i>.  The National Library, despite cuts of 40% has managed to maintain a free genealogy advisory service which is actually unsustainable with such cuts.  In 2013 The Gathering was a great success but we need to develop roots tourism as a legacy project.  </p><p>  We can also learn from missed opportunities.  We regret the continuing inertia of many State agencies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> engaging with digitisation and releasing their records online, although sometimes they have no option.  There is also a lack of understanding of the possibilities online publishers can bring to our heritage which is unfortunate.  The development of the genealogy business offers great opportunities for tourism, access to archives and employment.  </p><p>  In light of these changes, what do we at Eneclann recommend should happen?  In our submission we discuss many areas that should be addressed but in the time allowed, I will only bring some key points to the attention of the committee.  Members will be glad to know that only one area involves spending.  The Government must reverse the cuts to public archives and libraries.  These provide an essential service that underpins all other development.  There are hundreds of millions of genealogical records that must be made available and this will only happen with an adequately funded archival sector with the support of online publishers.  The Government needs to familiarise itself with the genealogy business and what it means for the Irish economy, as it has already done with the technology industry.  We have an excellent opportunity to turn this country into a European hub for genealogy but this requires the Government facilitating this development and enabling innovation.  Our submission gives a step-by-step guide to some of the key issues to be addressed here, including freeing up access to historic records, changing data protection guidelines, empowering the cultural sector to partner with publishers and other innovators as well as connecting to the diaspora.  We are incredibly lucky in Ireland, with tens of millions of people worldwide with an emotional connection to this island that other countries can only envy.  To maintain these connections with successive generations and to strengthen these links, we need to connect these people to their personal heritage.  Genealogy should be the key legacy from the year of The Gathering.  We should have a genealogy centre in Dublin, which could be self-financing.  </p><p>  In conclusion, there are great opportunities to develop genealogy here and the Government can have a significant impact, for better or worse, depending on the decisions it makes or fails to make.  </p> <p>One thing is certain, we cannot do nothing.</p></speech>

It is lovely to hear both Ms Eibhl&iacute;n Roche and Rev. Dr. Norman Gamble's connection with and stories on the archive.  Of course, the Guinness Archive is extraordinarily valuable and long may they proceed to publish and make those connections, particularly as we approach the centenary of the Great War, the First World War.  That information will become extremely valuable.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Donovan for the time he has taken to make this presentation and I wish to pose some practical questions on what needs to be done.  This will help us in making recommendations to the Minister.  We believe the Minister is very supportive of this industry but perhaps needs more arguments and demonstrated proofs of what genealogy can bring to the economy, in short QEDs, <i>quod erat demonstrandum.</i></p><p>  Is Mr. Donovan aware of any economic impact study or economic study else where in the world on creating jobs from the genealogy business?  Has he any examples that we could examine so that we could make an argument for creating jobs, or that it can be viewed as an industry like the tech industry?  We know it is an industry.  We know also it is a hobby that can be monetised and that there is both a public and private interest in it.  Long may that continue.</p><p>  In respect of data protection, are they in favour of reducing the time frame from 100 year to 90 years or 70 years?  I would like to hear their view on that.</p><p>  The witnesses are, of course, aware of the difficulty the national cultural institutions face in making money, as they are practically prohibited from making money through a bizarre set of rules and regulations.  Let me give an example.  Even tendering for a fundraising job in the National Library, the National Museum or National Gallery is obtuse.  Have they further insights on how the culture sector can make money in this area?</p></speech>

Unfortunately I did not receive the documents in advance but I have a personal interest in the subject.  I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy and Senator McConghail for advising me of the agenda for today's meeting.</p><p>  I wish to address a question to Ms Eibhl&iacute;n Roche on the Guinness Archive.  She told the committee she has given access free of charge to <i>Ancestry.co.uk.  </i>This is excellent.  What is the reason that she cannot use the Irish genealogy site sponsored by the State, is that not an option?  I am trying to understand how to put material together from an Irish side.  She mentioned the difference between the types of resources.</p><p>  I am a big supporter of online publishing both because of the access to those in Ireland and overseas.  I have been in the National Archives to seek access to a will and have been told it cannot be transferred because of the condition it is in.  I am sure every time these documents are opened up, that is impacting on their condition.  There is an issue also with the handling of documents and with digitisation.  There are issues for those heavily vested in this areas as well as for the general public.  Ms Roche mentioned how television programmes and other sources that bring people's attention to this subject.  We saw the impact of the digitisation of the 1911 and 1901 census in raising interest in genealogy among many new people.  I am a big supporter of digitising the 1926 census.  I was very happy to hear Ms M&aacute;ire Mac Conghail speak about the General Register Office of Ireland digitising its records.  The fact that an Irish citizen can go to family search or <i>Ancestry.co.uk </i>to get a digitisation of the GRO but one cannot do it from an Irish site is wrong.  We own this material and yet Ireland cannot put it online but I can access it from sources outside Ireland.  </p><p>  Mr. Donovan mentioned that Ireland is a European hub for genealogy.  Is that in respect of our heritage or the digital hub that we proudly profiled in Ireland?  I have seen that <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i> have brought 15 jobs to the digital hub and expect to expand to 50 jobs, mainly in the management and finance area.  Could Mr. Donovan outline the basis for his assertion that we could become an European hub for genealogy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Rev. Dr. Norman Gamble" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000015#Q00600"><p>I will respond to Senator van Turnhout's last point.  We are working on such a small shoe-string that we do not even think about the financing.  That has some benefits.  We would be one of a number of very specialised archives and if the material was on a larger scale, one would lose the environment in which it is set.  People often come along and have an idea that somebody worked on the railways and were able to find out a lot but some of the terminology does not always match up with their expectation.  Engine driver for example does not necessarily mean a man who drove a railway engine, he could have stoked a mill.  We are able to read into the background.  I was just thinking when the hundreds of thousands were mentioned that we would probably see 400 to 500 people in a season from September to June and deal with the same number of e-mail or postal inquiries that come in.  It is a drop in the ocean, but we may need to prevent ourselves being carried away with a desire for technology.  We are a voluntary society with approximately 1,200 members scattered around the British Isles in the main.  We get donations from people who visit the archives but there is no source to which we can turn apart from the annual Heritage Council grant.  There is no finance from the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or Education and Skills.  I think some aspects of what we are discussing are related to the education budget just as much as the heritage budget.  I know that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is a very sincere and committed person but he does not have the mega millions.  It is still low down in the priorities of Government.  Something needs to be done to preserve local culture in a tangible way that is not being done at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Donovan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000015#Q00700"><p>A number of issues have been raised and I will answer them as best I can.</p><p>  Senator Mac Conghail asked whether a case study was conducted anywhere in the world on the economic impact of genealogy related activity?  I am not aware of one but I can refer members to the case study of the State of Utah in the USA.  For its own reasons this has become a centre for genealogy.  I am not going to discuss the good, bad or otherwise of those reasons but the point is that it has turned into a hub for north American genealogy.  All the major companies are located there employing thousands in this industry.  That happened for its own reasons.  Something similar could happen in Dublin or an English speaking country, because this is what will bring in these companies.  <i>Ancestry.co.uk </i>have already set up their international headquarters here and DC Thompson Family History has already set up an important office in Dublin, about which members will hear more on Thursday.  We could be bringing in <i>My Heritage.com </i>and many other such groups to base themselves in Dublin.  We have done really well in Ireland in reaching out to tech companies internationally to attract them to locate here.  That is an added reason these companies want to be here because they are also deeply embedded within the tech industry.</p> <p>Why should we not reach out?  To do so would not require substantial expenditure.  What we need is to have the vision to do this.  It would create a tremendous spur for genealogy.  It is not, however, the only thing we need to do.  While there is no pot of gold at the end of the genealogical rainbow, for all the reasons we have discussed, we should be intelligent about using our economic prospects to further what we want to do with genealogy. </p><p> We were asked what we wanted in the area of data protection.  Section 4 of our submission noted that we may only need to have a change in guidelines and regulations and the Data Protection Act may not require amendment.  What we seek is a reduction in the basic exclusion from 100 years to 70 years, the norm in most countries in the European Union and the United States.  Such a move would result in the release of records dating until 1943.  The legal issues in respect of access to the 1926 census would also be removed and it would free up millions of other records that we not even begun discussing. </p><p> We were asked about the cultural sector making money.  Section 4 specifically states that the cultural sector must be allowed to make money.  It is not that we advocate turning cultural bodies into commercial bodies - on the contrary - but there is a disincentive to engage in activities which would raise finance to be spent on other things.  These bodies are not encouraged to consider other options because there is no benefit for them in doing so.  They do their best with what they have but that is not an option. </p><p> Senator van Turnhout raised a number of issues.  I will be pleased to send her a copy of our submission.  She raised an important point which has been raised previously and will be raised again, namely, the issue of free access to records versus paid access to records.  This is a false dichotomy because one can have both.  Private publishers are good at reaching out to people to build their family histories online.  We offer added value in grouping and linking records, having family tree makers available and allowing people to do their research.  We also offer a range of other services.  We do not mind if records are free on another site, behind the pay wall of our site or even free on our site.  It is not a case of having one thing or the other.  We need to abandon the mindset that this can only be done in one way as it can be done in many different ways at the same time.  The more freely available genealogical information is to more sites, the better it is at meeting the needs of our diaspora as well as our cultural and economic needs.</p></speech>

The perfect example of this is Griffith's Valuation.  In 2003, in partnership with the National Library and National Archives, we started work on digitising the collection that is known as Griffith's Valuation.  This is not one source but a collection of more than 310 individual books.  When we approached the project the first thing we had to do was get to grips with how much information there was and where it was found.  The National Library, National Archives and Valuation Office did not have a single copy of all the different books that comprise Griffith's valuation.  It was, therefore, a matter of going from archive to archive and library to library.  Along with the national cultural institutions, we also approached King's Inns, some of the archives in the United Kingdom, a library in Salt Lake City and a private collector in North America whose ancestors came from a particular townland here.  The individual in question had gone to the trouble of finding the particular book, a once-off publication, and purchasing it at auction.  I understand there were only three land-holders in the entire townland of his ancestors.  We assembled all the relevant information, obtained the approval of all the relevant parties, digitised the information and created a searchable index.  Using this index, a person who finds the individual he or she is tracing can click through and see the visual image.  For the first time since Griffith's Valuation was published, we have a definitive version.  The only place the valuation is available nowadays is online because there is still not a single archive that has a complete collection.  This is one of the advantages of digital publication that is sometimes not appreciated.</p></speech>

The first step to making this public was publication on our own website.  We linked with the Irish office of <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i> two months ago following an approach it made to us.  This decision is very much part of an overall strategy of making the information we hold publicly available.  The information we have published on the ancestry website is not any more detailed than the information available on our website.  Our view is that it will result in increased traffic to our website.  Since we published on<i> Ancestry.co.uk</i>, traffic to our website has increased threefold.  We provide free access to our information, which is top line given the nature of the records.  We are very open to publishing the information on other websites.</p></speech>

This discussion and our previous session show that the issue may not be as complex as we first thought.</p><p>  I concur with Mr. Donovan that access to information can be both paid for and free.  We need to consider this if we wish to see beyond our discussions and identify what contribution we hope to make.  Even the diversity of the witnesses before us is very interesting in that they represent both private industry and organisations involved in public records.  We are adding not to the complexity of the issue but to the multifaceted nature of the important topic we are addressing.  </p><p>  My questions are aimed at identifying where the committee's discussions will lead.  The mere fact that we are having this discussion underlines the importance of the issue, its potential and the important assets that exist.  In other areas of community activity, for example, sport, the diverse elements of the relevant activity have been successfully brought together in a single body.  This has been useful and has eliminated much of the fog and fudge.  One could say the same about the Arts Council, although it is a statutory body.  There are many similar examples.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in the area of genealogy.  We meet every so often and make an effort but do not work on structures, disciplines and so on.  The final plan must ensure that each player is able to identify itself within the plan and see evidence of its ownership and autonomy.  This does detract from the success of the route we are taking.</p><p>  I empathise with the Reverend Dr. Gamble's argument on resources and others having greater resources for other types of work.  We also heard about the success of Eneclann and the bigger picture there.  We can all understand the reason the Guinness Storehouse is successful.  As we heard, when one speaks to people abroad about Ireland they refer to Guinness or scenery.  </p><p>  We would all like the various players to come together.  Do the witness have any ideas on the methodology for doing so?  I declared my interest in the previous session when I stated I am the chairman of the Family History Foundation.  We have engaged with many organisations, including Eneclann, in an informative exercise which I hope was helpful in both directions.  If this process moves forward in the manner we hope, what type of forum will emerge given the large number of players involved?  How will it work?  If we do not achieve anything from these hearings, it will create even greater frustration.  For this reason, we must try this time to make this exercise worthwhile.</p></speech>

This has been a very interesting session.</p> <p>It was deliberate that the committee invited such a diverse range of people to attend, who while they do not make up an exhaustive list of the groups involved in this area give us more or less a taste of the various strands that will provide for a plan that will include all of the records that are available.  In other countries many of the records we are discussing might not be needed by someone searching for their family history because the census would be there from the 19th century, but we do not have that.  Census substitutes have become very important here.  Some of these census substitutes are in the form of the railway records, the Guinness records and other work records.  For example, local authorities will have staff records going far back into the 19th century.  We could list a range of other similar bodies or organisations with records.  The important point about doing this is to show the diversity of what is available.  Many people think everything in the public records office was burnt in 1922, but that is not true at all.</p><p> I have worked out my family history and it was because of having to search for records sideways that I realised that these types of records are incredibly important.  I drove Eibhl&iacute;n Roche to distraction in my search for family history in connection with the Guinness records.  I also had reason to drive Dr. Peter Rigney of the railway records nuts.  I have searched both of these repositories.  People speak about the emotional connection, but I had not realised until I searched how important it is to pin down place and what a difference this makes to an individual in how he or she relates to that place afterwards.  Both the Guinness and the railway records helped me do that.</p><p> What we are trying to create for people is an easy path to do this.  Gabriel Byrne was very critical about us always trying to get into the pockets of individuals, but it is not about that.  Making the emotional connection for people is a different thing entirely.  We must find ways of making this easy for people.  It is all very well if people can get on a bus and go into town to the National Archives or whatever, but some people come from the other side of the world and have only two or three weeks to do their research, without knowing the landscape or where exactly to start looking.  We need to take on the challenge of making this easier for people if we are going to reconnect the people who wish to do this.  The range of repositories available will be important to doing that.</p><p> Many of my questions have already been answered.  In regard to the Guinness records, I compliment the website initiative because it makes the records visible and demonstrates how important they are.  On the Irish Railway records, mention was made of the voluntary effort on the cataloguing etc. so as to be able to pinpoint the relevant ledgers in the archive.  Is there concern with regard to the preservation of the records?  A concern was expressed regarding how they are handled.  In searching for my records, I brought a camera with me and took photographs and that was allowed.  Does taking photographs damage the record or is there a better way of dealing with this?  It is important to maintain the integrity of the records.</p><p> The gazette published by the Irish Railway Records Society is interesting and brings out the value of the records, particularly at a time like now when we are entering a decade of commemorations of centenaries.  The gazette report on the role of women in the railways during the First World War was incredibly interesting, as were many other reports covered in the gazette.  Will the society representatives speak about the preservation of the records?  I will leave it to Deputy Tuffy to ask about youth involvement.  What would a European hub involve or what would it be like?  Would it be a physical location or an online service?  I accept that accessing records could be done on a pay per view or a free to view basis.  However, is there a conflict in regard to records that were publicly produced, such as the indexes to the General Register Office, GRO, being available on a pay per view site?  If the records have been publicly generated, one should not have to pay to view them.  Is there an issue in that regard?  I felt annoyed by that, but do not know whether I should have felt so annoyed.  Is there a conflict in that regard?</p><p> I was looking at the figure for the population of Ireland in 1841, which was 8.1 million.  The UK then had a population of 18 million and the population of New York was 350,000.  This says it all - in the context of trying to put the records back together on that time.  The records, as mentioned, are our window to the past.  Clearly, we cannot tie all the information together and it will be fragmented.  Finding ways of working together, whatever format is used, is the important task we need to undertake.</p></speech>

What scope is there for the various organisations involved to bring in young people under the youth guarantee funding that will be available in the new year?  This would help the groups by providing personnel, but the work would also be great experience for young people.  Are there any plans to do this or have any young people been taken on through JobBridge or any of the other existing schemes?  If something is to be done in regard to the records, it is not enough for the Government to provide the funding.  The private and public sector have a responsibility to make places available.  This was done in the past.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, local groups got together and set up social employment schemes.  I took part in such a scheme and found it great because it provided a bridge into permanent work.  What are the plans in that regard?</p></speech>

Who would like to respond first?</p></speech>

I have been involved in research not into genealogy, but into history and 40 to 50 years ago the state of the records retained by CIE was appalling.  However, to give them their due, we brought this to their attention in the 1970s, through one of my predecessors, Joe Leckey, who was a professional archivist.  CIE spent significant money on the records then - it had more money then than now - but there are certain items that I would love to have the money to work on as they need to be retained in their present form.  The nature of, for example, the Great Southern and Western Railway archives is one that does not lend itself to digitisation.</p><p>  The railways had an appalling way of keeping records.  </p> <p>They listed the station and when somebody moved from one job to another, he or she was crossed out with a big red line and put on another page, before being moved to something else.  We end up chasing people through these books and there is a wear and tear factor in that.  There needs to be a general awareness, fostered by the Department, of the value of archives - genealogical and otherwise - in the history of Ireland.  These records were not seen as having any value until the 1970s.  They were there because they could not be got rid of and they were in damp cellars.  That is probably true of a whole range of industrial and social archives across the country.</p><p> Another thing that worries me is that these archives are increasingly going into digital form and there is no longer any paper.  I have grave doubts about the stability of much digital recording of accounts and payments from the early days of computerisation.  The records that we and others have around the country are in paper form.  They may be fragile, but we can keep them so that they do not deteriorate.  If somebody gives me a large disk of payments and staff records from the 1970s, I do not even know how to get into it.  We find it increasingly difficult to find people who can do that.  This is being disregarded across the industrial sphere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Donovan" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000018#T00200"><p>I would first like to reply to the question on digital records.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Records created in the early stages of computerisation, when the first accounts packages were introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s, have a huge range of associated problems.  However, since we started bringing in standards for keeping modern records in the 1990s, I am pleased to say that those problems do not really exist for the long-term preservation of the information.  We will be left with this problem for about 20 years and we will have to deal with that.   However, the digitalisation of historic records is a different issue altogether.  The standards that apply to the digitalisation of historic records are well known.  We follow open-source standards for the images that are captured.  We do not use proprietary software for this.  It is a very good way to keep a surrogate copy.  I say &quot;surrogate copy&quot; because the original record is more important.  By having a surrogate digital copy, people can look at that and the original can be put in a proper archival environment, with proper temperature humidity controls.  That is the ideal situation because like most archivists, we prefer not to look at the record at all because that damages it.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked what this hub would look like.  I am not talking about a hub as an institution.  I am talking about an environment where we have free engagement with the records that might result in innovative models, businesses, volunteer groups and so on.  There are certain basic things we need to do to facilitate that happening.  We must have free access to the records that are available.  We need to focus our attention on the limited Government funds to support the archives doing what they do, which is archival work.   Let the private companies and volunteer groups come together to seek to publish them, while the funds are low.  At the moment, what is happening is a misuse of funds because there are other ways of doing this.  The hub is not a building or institution, but a collection of organisations which happen to share a common space, and interact and engage with each other, and develop innovation as a consequence of being geographic location together.  That is not dissimilar to what happened with technology out in Silicon Valley.  I do not wish to exaggerate, as there is not a pot of gold.</p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of paying for indexes to public records.  If the indexes are digitised and made available for free by a public institution, then that is one thing, but it is a different thing altogether if indexes are not even in existence to start and are created privately.  I should say at this point that the GRO indexes are available on several sites online.  They are available for free at <i>familysearch.org</i>, or behind a paywall on <i>ancestry.com</i> or on <i>findmypast.ie</i>.  We have been told another version will be available from the GRO itself, and we look forward to that.  I think the question is whether the public sector is fulfilling its public access remits, but not suddenly to hobble private organisations from trying to do good things as well, which can help support them.  It is not an either/or question.  It is not about paying for something or having it for free; it can be both.  For example, we have a series of agreements with the National Archives whereby we digitise their records, index them, put them online and they are available commercially for a duration of time, before they later go online for free to everybody.  That happens on the National Archives website and on our own.  We also do stuff immediately for free on both websites.  I want to open members' minds to a range of possibilities of how these things might look.  I dislike the fact that we might end up with a Government decision that we will do everything one way only.  That would preclude all the diversity and innovation that might take place among public organisations, voluntary groups and private companies.</p><p>  Another question was about the diversity of records that could be digitised.  We addressed this in the second point of our ideas on what should be done.  Perhaps Ms Fitzsimmons might discuss this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Fitzsimmons" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013121000018#T00300"><p>I will do so, and I would also like to respond to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Deputy Murphy.  I was very interested to hear both of them talk about diversity.  First and foremost, digitisation of records can secure the assets of our cultural heritage.  Dr. Gamble referred to wear and tear.  Where there is wear and tear, digitisation is particularly relevant.  It is part of the modern conservation of records.  It means that we can digitise records and then create a searchable index.  People can actually find their ancestor in the index, click and then see the image.  In the meantime, the actual paper record can be conserved and put away, so that minimises the actual use and any further damage to the record.  There are also digital standards for preserving records and Mr. Donovan has touched on that.</p><p>  The digital revolution to which Mr. Donovan referred in his short presentation is very real.  It has led to over 100 million records being placed online in the last 15 years or so, but there is also a much greater understanding that genealogy is not just about births, marriages and deaths and parish records.  It is really about the records that have survived.  We have lost almost the entire 19th century census, so what can we use to track people down?  There is a diversity of records available and I would like to emphasise three huge collections that are available, to a greater or lesser degree, to researchers.  I have used all of them in the course of my career as a professional genealogist.   The first is the Registry of Deeds.  That registry is very often misunderstood as being simply legal records and the records of the ascendancy.  They are not.  The Registry of Deeds contain the records of the Irish middle class.  We always had a fairly sizeable middle class and the records cover the entire island of Ireland.  If those records were to be digitised, it would transform the record from being a big and unwieldy archive into something that can be searched and be used to trace ancestors.  If those records were digitised, we could go beyond simply looking at the townlands index.  We would be able to start looking below that level of middle class people who have assets that they are trying to protect, and find people who did not usually have assets and who do not appear in any other records from that time.  I am talking about school teachers, small shopkeepers, people who run businesses, the law clerks.  These are the approximately 30% of Irish people who were literate and who were then called on to act as witnesses when any of these deeds were being drawn up.</p> <p> The other point about the Registry of Deeds is that everyone assumes these are simply records of the ascendancy or of people who belonged to the established church.  As a matter of fact, when a person registered a deed, it immediately meant that his or her document had priority over an unregistered deed.  This meant that right from the get-go, from the day it opened, people who were Catholic, Presbyterian or dissenter made a beeline for the Registry of Deeds to try to guarantee the greatest security possible and keep control of their assets.  That is one of the major points to be noted.</p><p> Ms Helen Moss and I researched President Barack Obama's ancestry.  In fact, he was a Senator when we first began researching, which shows for how long it had been going on.  We made significant use of the Registry of Deeds.  His family was not wealthy.  One branch became super-wealthy or did very well.  While his family was not wealthy, it did have assets.  These details are not easily available to researchers.</p><p> Another great set of records is the Land Commission's records.  They are probably the best archival source for the Irish population in the 19th century and one must jump through a series of fiery hoops to gain access to them.  Again, I emphasise the Land Commission's records are not about the wealthy.  One will find records of estates and landed families, but what I find more important are the details of the rentals and the ordinary people on five, ten or 15 acres.  They included farmers, a portion of whose rent was covered by their labour.  My family is well represented among these labourers and I am keen to gain access to the records.</p><p> The third set of records is the records of the Valuation Office.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to census substitutes.  Many of us have come to use the Valuation Office's records as an excellent census substitute because one can see how long a family remained in an area.</p><p> There is another point I am keen to emphasise on diversity.  We do not have 19th century census returns, but we do have statistics taken from them before they were destroyed.  In the 1841 census some 36.7% of the Irish population was not Catholic.  For "not Catholic" read Church of Ireland and dissenter.  Genealogy can help us to connect with our own past and have a greater understanding of who we are and from where we came.  That cohort is a major part of the Diaspora, with which we are not really connecting.  I refer back to the President Barack Obama case.  His family were southern Protestants which I emphasise as being an identity quite distinct from that of the Ulster Scots.  The people concerned were southern Episcopalian - that was how they were known in the United States - and once they had emigrated to the United States, within one generation they had assimilated and all knowledge of their Irish origins had been lost, as happened in the case of President Barack Obama's family.  I do not believe we are reaching out to this section of the Diaspora.  Again, that brings me back to the idea that there was emigration from Ireland throughout the 1600s and 1700s.  The Irish built America, but they did not simply build the railroads or the great buildings.  Often, they were the nation's builders; they were there from the start.  I refer the committee to some cases on which I have worked recently.  Samuel Ogle was Governor of Maryland in the 1740s.  He had spent most of his childhood and his entire early life in Ireland.  Richard Montgomery who was the senior general active in the field during the American War of Independence had grown up in Charlie Haughey's old house, Abbeville - surprisingly.  This is a section of the Diaspora to which we are not reaching out.</p><p> I liked what Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; had to say about bringing the community together.  If anything, that is, ultimately, what this is about.  We have seen a major increase in interest among Irish people.  It is also great to be able to connect with that part of the Diaspora overseas.</p></speech>

That picks up closely on Ms Fitzsimons's point.  One of my points relates to handling records.  As a professional archivist, digital preservation and creating digital copies is definitely the way to go.  As Mr. Donovan remarked, there are many standards for how to digitise records properly.  It is "watch out" when we have many voluntary groups with the best intentions wishing to start digitising material, perhaps local parish records or other local material, without having true sight of what constitutes proper standards.  When people are working with limited resources, they can sometimes be throwing bad money after good and someone may have to come along three or four years down the road and redigitise the records.</p><p>  There is work to be done.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked about the plan and what was next.  One of the next parts of the plan is putting together a set of standards that will be readily available for people who are not part of a larger institution or do not have access to a professional archivist.  These standards should outline what a digital preservation plan looks like, how people can go about digitising records and keep the context in which the records were created.  As archivists, we are always big fans of context.  A record is not created in isolation.  At a simple level, that is what we have done with the Guinness archive.  We have data about the individual and his date of birth.  However, we have introduced a contextual element which explains the department and where the person worked.  Adding this contextual information and keeping the context is interesting.</p><p>  A point made by one of the previous speakers earlier this afternoon resonated with me.  It was related to the overall plan and creating an inventory of the genealogical potential of the resources available.  That rings true in trying to create a first base.  We cannot decide what we are doing with the records unless we know what we have available.  The second part is to create a plan of what we do with them.  The idea is to try to identify an inventory or a resource in order that we all know exactly what records are available.  We should then centralise them in order that we do not have visitors who are completely new to Ireland having to go to three or four websites to try to find the same information.  It would be preferable to have the material centralised.</p></speech>

One of the best placed organisations to reply to it is the Irish Family History Foundation.  I noticed, however, that the deputation was somewhat reticent in its response.  Perhaps I can give the committee some ideas which are a little clearer.  It is very difficult to bring in untrained young inexperienced people and involve them in transcribing historical records.  It requires a certain degree of expertise to be able to do this.  I am not necessarily referring to university based expertise and have no wish to try to remove it and place it out of the reach of everyone.  A great deal of training is required.  Most heritage centres put a major effort into training people to do the work.  I am keen to ensure we do not end up making the mistake where, it could be argued, we could potentially turn heritage centres into training institutions.  In fact, what they are supposed to be doing is delivering a genealogical product.  Their purpose is to try to generate something.  However, if we were to turn them into training institutions, they would become derailed from what they were supposed to be doing.  If it would help them, that would be great, but they can make the decision themselves.  Where a local youth employment scheme could work really well is in doing the things on the ground which are difficult to do.  This includes identifying and transcribing gravestones, most of which are in a dreadful state of disrepair throughout the country.  Also, collecting oral history is valuable.  Something we have not had for a long time is an oral history project.  We could try to determine what survives locally from the folklore project in the 1930s.  These are projects in which they could play a role, but throwing them into historical record projects may not be the best use of their efforts.</p><p>  Another point raised by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was interesting and, if committee members do not mind, I will address it.  It relates to how engagement will work between all interested parties.  It is a complex issue because there are many vested interests and stakeholders.</p> <p>It would probably be partially collaborative and competitive in looking for their slice of the pie.  Ultimately, however, it is mainly a collaborative approach.  Must we set up an organisation to do this?  What might be more useful is to have a regular meeting point where all of these organisations - private, public and voluntary - could meet and engage with their ideas.  Better still, the State could facilitate that innovation, making it possible for more things to happen.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Dara Murphy and Senator Kathryn Reilly.</p><p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has special responsibility for European affairs.  The Minister of State will deal with two distinct matters, first, next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council and, second, the review of foreign policy and external relations that will be undertaken by his Department in the next few months.  I propose to deal with these subjects separately and suggest we begin by discussing next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels.  The Council is expected to consider the European External Action Service, the preparations for the December European Council and the subject of enlargement.  When we have concluded our discussion on the Council, we will then turn to the review of foreign policy and external relations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000003#B00100"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to appear before the joint committee this afternoon.  As the Chairman has said, I will speak first about the General Affairs Council meeting that will take place next Tuesday, 17 December.  I have agreed with the Chairman that in the second half of the session I will run through the foreign policy and external relations review.</p><p>  As I indicated at our most recent encounter, the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, which took place on 19 November last, was quite straightforward.  We received presentations on the European Commission's work programme for 2014, the roadmap for European semester implementation in 2014 and the annual growth survey for 2014.  The Lithuanian Presidency put forward a report on implementation of the European Council conclusions.  We also had a very preliminary discussion on the agenda for the December European Council.  In general, the response to the Commission work programme was positive.  There was wide support for its prioritisation of the jobs and growth agenda and the need to complete banking union.  The annual growth survey and the roadmap were also generally well received.  The Chairman raised the Dutch subsidiarity review at our last meeting.</p><p>  As planned, there was a short discussion on the Dutch subsidiarity review, which the Chairman of this committee raised at our last meeting, under any other business.  The Dutch Foreign Minister, Frans Timmermans, set out some of the Dutch thinking on subsidiarity and drew attention to a conference on the subject in The Hague in January.  I confirmed our interest in this initiative and made it clear that we will continue to follow the evolving discussion.</p><p>  Since the last General Affairs Council, I participated in the Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius on 29 November and attended the OSCE ministerial council in Kiev last week.  Although the meeting in Vilnius was somewhat overshadowed by events in Ukraine, we were pleased that the EU was able to initial association agreements with Moldova and Georgia on that occasion.  This was a historic step in deepening the EU's relations with both countries.  Members will have been following the subsequent developments in Ukraine.  Deputy Eric Byrne asked me specifically about this issue at our last meeting.  Naturally, it was disappointing that Ukraine was not in a position to sign its association agreement at the Eastern Partnership summit.  The door remains open to the Ukrainian authorities and the decision will be theirs.  During last week's OSCE ministerial council, I was in a position to personally observe the protests in Kiev.  When I spoke there, I called on all sides to show restraint, respect the rule of law and resolve their differences peacefully.  I would like to take this opportunity to call on them to continue to do so.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I will attend the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 17 December next.  Today's meeting is taking place a little earlier than usual.  Preparations for the meeting are well under way.  The last agenda was relatively straightforward, but next week's agenda is very full.  The Council will consider a review of the EU External Action Service.  It will have a detailed discussion on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process.  It is also expected to adopt a negotiating framework for Serbia which I welcome.  In addition, we will also be asked to prepare the agenda for the December European Council later next week.  This important European Council will also have a significant agenda including banking union, the economic and monetary union, the common foreign and security policy, migration and energy.  It is a lot to cover.</p><p>  The review of the EU External Action Service is expected to be the first item for discussion at the General Affairs Council.  The Council will adopt conclusions on the matter.  As members of the committee will be aware, the European Union's diplomatic service was established in 2010 following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  The service has been gradually evolving over the past three years.  It is timely to take stock of the progress achieved to date and to consider areas that might be further improved.  The External Action Service comprises some 3,400 staff drawn from the EU Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council and national diplomats from the EU member states.  It has 139 delegations around the world, which have taken on the task of local EU co-ordination and representation formerly carried out by the rotating Presidency.  Much has been achieved over the past three years, not least considering the difficult economic context in which the new service was born.  The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, can point to a number of policy successes, including the historic breakthrough in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and the recent agreement brokered by the E3+3 with Iran in relation to its nuclear programme.</p><p>  The EU External Action Service has also contributed to the development of a more strategic and comprehensive approach to EU foreign policy.  It avails of all of the political, economic and developmental instruments and tools that are at the EU's disposal.  Ireland has joined other member states in welcoming the achievements of the new service.  I wish to comment on the recommendations contained in the review of the service.  We have expressed particular support for efforts to streamline the service, maximise efficiencies, and further develop the already good co-operation with the EU Commission.  It is important that the member states retain a sense of ownership of the EU External Action Service.  In this regard, we welcome the progress achieved in reaching the target of one third member state diplomats at the operational level.</p><p>  As is usual in December, the General Affairs Council and the European Council will consider the EU's enlargement strategy for the year ahead and adopt formal Council conclusions.  This is an area of reoccurring interest for this committee.  I have been asked about it every time I have appeared here.  I believe this reflects Ireland's commitment to enlargement.  This has been a year of good progress, including under the Irish Presidency.  Enlargement remains one of the EU's most successful policies.  The objective is to examine how we will move forward next year.  At our last meeting, Deputy Eric Byrne asked about developments regarding Turkey.  As he knows, our Presidency secured agreement on the opening of a new chapter in the accession negotiations for the first time in three years.  Our sense is that there is significant support among member states to build on this momentum by opening negotiations on the key issues of fundamental rights and the rule of law, but there is not yet consensus on whether we can open these discussions until other issues are first resolved.</p><p>  Progress is continuing in other important areas.  Talks will start shortly on the issue of visa-free travel between Turkey and the EU.  At the same time, accession negotiations with Montenegro are continuing.  We expect talks on the two key areas of rule of law and fundamental rights to be opened by the end of December.  This will open the way for progress to be made in other areas.  Following a decision by the Icelandic Government, accession negotiations with Iceland are currently suspended.  We will make clear that the door remains open to Iceland if it decides to re-engage.  A key issue for us to consider at the Council will be the adoption of the EU's negotiating framework ahead of the opening of accession talks with Serbia.  The Irish Presidency secured agreement in June to open negotiations with Serbia by January 2014 at the latest.  This was possible due to the significant progress in that country's relations with neighbouring Kosovo.  The further normalisation of relations between the two will be an important issue in Serbia's accession negotiations.</p> <p>Negotiations are also under way with Kosovo with a view to signing a stabilisation and association agreement next year, which is a significant step on its path towards the EU.  The<i></i>General Affairs Council will also consider two specific recommendations from the European Commission: first, to grant candidate status to Albania and second, to open accession negotiations with Macedonia.  The new Albanian Government has set out a strong commitment to making the necessary reforms for EU membership although some member states believe that more needs to be done before the country can be granted candidate status.  Ireland supports granting candidate status to Albania.  We also support the opening of accession negotiations with Macedonia although there continue to be concerns about the situation in that country, particularly around freedom of expression.  The name issue with Greece also remains unresolved.  As a result, it remains to be seen if consensus on Macedonia will be possible.  Finally, the EU will consider the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is lagging behind its neighbours.  The EU is working hard to facilitate agreement among Bosnia's leaders on necessary reforms but we recognise that an agreement must come from among the leaders themselves.  The EU cannot impose a solution. Unfortunately, as a result of the lack of progress in Bosnia's accession process, it risks losing pre-accession funding.  Ireland is committed to Bosnia's EU perspective and we are very concerned at the lack of progress.  Overall, I look forward to an ambitious EU enlargement strategy for 2014 and a good discussion at the General Affairs Council.</p><p> The other issue on the agenda next Tuesday is, of course, the preparation of the European Council, which will take place on 19-20 December.  As I mentioned earlier, the Council has a particularly heavy agenda, including many issues of importance for Ireland.  Banking Union, of course, remains a priority for this Government and we want to see decisions taken on the outstanding issues, including putting in place a single resolution mechanism.  As the Taoiseach has repeatedly made clear, we need to follow through on the 29 June 2012 statement by heads of state and government and break the link between the banks and the sovereign.  The markets have priced in the banking union and we need to adhere to our timetable and deliver in full.  Finance ministers are discussing this in Brussels today and, if necessary, I expect that they will continue to do so in the run up to the Council.  This is an urgent task.</p><p> Parallel to this, work on strengthening the EMU is continuing and the December European Council will discuss proposals for contractual arrangements.  While good progress has been made, we believe that greater clarity is required as to how such contracts would operate, and in particular, how solidarity mechanisms would be designed and funded.  It will be important to approach the debate from the perspective of adding value to the existing framework and avoiding duplication.  We would also want to see new arrangements operating within the framework of the European semester process.  I believe that this issue is now close to being agreed.  The Chairman asked last time about the social dimension of EMU and the use of social indicators.  The December Council will revert again to this issue.  As the Chairman is aware, Ireland supports the social dimension of EMU and the development of the new employment and social scoreboard.</p><p> At their meeting next week, Heads of State and Government will also discuss the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  This will be the first such discussion in five years.  It is taking place in response to a request by the European Council in December last year calling on High Representative Ashton and the European Commission to develop further proposals and actions to strengthen CSDP and improve the availability of the required civilian and military capabilities through a strengthened European defence industry.  Ireland has been actively engaged in the preparatory process for this discussion which included the recent agreement of very comprehensive CSDP conclusions by foreign and defence ministers, including the Tan&aacute;iste and the Minister for Defence.  These conclusions together with earlier reports by the Commission and High Representative Ashton have been sent to President van Rompuy to allow him to prepare next week's discussion.  The CSDP as set out in the Lisbon Treaty is intended to equip the Union with an operational capacity for missions outside the EU aimed at strengthening international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  After ten years in existence, however, it is generally accepted among EU member states that the CSDP needs to be reinvigorated if it is to remain an effective and credible tool.  The European Council is likely to suggest ways in which this can be achieved.  Ireland supports this effort.  We currently participate in six civilian CSDP missions and three military CSDP missions.  It is important that we continue to improve and develop the capabilities for future CSDP missions and that we work closely with partners, notably the UN.  </p><p> Economic and social policy also features on next week's agenda.  Heads of State and Government will consider the Commission's annual growth survey as well as implementation of the compact for growth and jobs.  Deputy Durkan asked at our last meeting to what extent the EU was studying ways to promote growth.  This is being done actively, including through the compact, which was a key political commitment to support recovery in the real economy right across Europe.  On this occasion, I expect that there will be a particular focus on the further development of measures to underpin the financing of the economy.  This follows the investment plan agreed in June mobilising the &euro;10 billion increase in the capital base of the European Investment Bank, EIB.  This will support a 40% increase in lending capacity over the period from this year out to 2015, bringing annual EIB lending volumes to between &euro;65 and &euro;70 billion.  The report from the Commission and the EIB that was presented in June indicated that the bank had already identified new lending opportunities of more than &euro;150 billion in agreed priority areas.  These are innovation and skills, SME access to finance, resource efficiency and strategic infrastructures.  These are projects that would be unlikely to proceed without EIB support.  The investment plan agreed by the European Council in June also develops important synergies between enhanced EIB lending capacity and the new and settled EU budget.  Resources here will be combined to support a significantly expanded volume of new SME loans across the Union.  Work being led by the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance will see almost &euro;1.2 billion worth of project signatures and loan approvals through the EIB in Ireland in 2013.  This represents an increase of just over one-fifth on 2012 levels, which were in turn up more than four-fifths on the previous year.  We also see room for further progress here.  Under the economic and social policy agenda item, the European Council will also look at taxation and review progress in this area since it was discussed by heads of state and government last May.  This is an issue of domestic concern and sensitivity and we will follow the discussion closely.</p><p> Finally, rounding out a very full agenda, the European Council will also discuss migration, enlargement and energy.  As in October, the migration discussion will take place against the background of the recent drownings off the coast of Lampedusa and with the objective of working to reduce the risk of similar tragedies in the future.</p> <p>Ireland supports the Council in its efforts to deal with this extremely complex and difficult problem.</p><p> The discussion on energy is expected to be relatively short and will emphasise the need to implement the guidelines agreed at the European Council under the Irish Presidency last May.  The February Council meeting will revert to this important issue.</p><p> This has been an overview of discussions both at the GAC and at the European Council.  Next Wednesday the Taoiseach will make a statement to the D&aacute;il on the European Council.  I look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

The EEAS is a very important result of the Lisbon treaty.  I was concerned to read reports in the newspapers about the level of expenditure on the EEAS since its inception.  The figure is currently &euro;400 million a year for 139 embassies or about &euro;3 million per mission.  Ireland runs missions for one tenth of that sum.  I am glad to hear that we will be looking at a review of the efficiencies.  The average European citizen would expect no more.</p><p>  I refer to the Minister of State's comments on a review of the visa regime for Turkish citizens and that is welcome.  I have met some of our Turkish colleagues recently and I am aware that this matter is one of their concerns.  They hope to see some form of lifting of the visa restrictions so that they can become more integrated with the European Union.  </p><p>  We share the Minister of State's concerns about the lack of progress on Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I acknowledge the situation is complex.  The committee visited the region about 15 months ago and we would hope to see improvements in the situation in the near future.</p><p>  The committee completed its work on the social dimension of EMU at a recent meeting last Tuesday and has compiled a report which has been issued to the Commission as recently as last Thursday.  We will provide the Minister of State with a copy of the report in advance of the GAC meeting where it may be discussed.  It would be useful for the Minister of State to be informed of the committee's comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000005#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his very comprehensive presentation.  As always, he sets out issues clearly and concisely and often detailed questions are not required.  However, I have one or two questions.  I ask the Minister of State to expand on the banking union.  He rightly identified the heads of state and government Council decision of 29 June 2012 to break the link between banks and the sovereign.  Mr. Klaus Regling is very familiar with the situation in Ireland as he carried out a detailed report in 2010 on behalf of the then Government in an effort to understand the reasons for the banking collapse.  He is now chairman of the ESM.  In a recent statement he has indicated that the process of retrospective recapitalisation by the ESM is less likely.  I ask the Minister of State to comment although I accept he may not have all the details to hand and he may be prepared to provide those at a later stage.</p><p>  I refer to other reports that seem to emanate from the European Commission that it will retain some form of surveillance on the Irish economy up to the year 2031.  The media are making a certain amount of this statement.  The various agreements such as the six pack and the two pack have been agreed with all members of the European Monetary Union.  Is it not the case that the Commission is undertaking a level of shared co-operation and shared surveillance of various budgeting processes in particular?  I ask if the Minister of State has any further insight into this surveillance which will last until 2031.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000005#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I will get the simple questions out of the way and then ask the more substantive questions.  I fully agree with the European Union that the new government in Albania has made huge strides in reforming the judiciary and the institutions of state.  I applaud the direction in which Albania is moving.</p><p>  I have previously raised the old chestnut of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I had the opportunity to raise it with the United Nations military representative at the COSAC meeting in Dublin Castle where he spoke about Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He admitted in a public forum that the UN had failed the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that it was assumed over the years that the countries would move in tandem with Serbia and Kosovo and that beautiful country, Croatia - where it is planned to locate an embassy.  It was acknowledged that the UN had failed.  The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now very dangerous and volatile and there needs to be constitutional reform.  Will this issue be recognised with an intensity that has been lacking to date?</p><p>  I refer to the 2,500 scientists and academics meeting in the National Conference Centre in Dublin to talk about an &euro;80 billion fund for science and research, of which it is hoped that &euro;1 billion will come to Ireland.  With that as the backdrop and applauding the European Union I wish to tease out with the Minister of State his personal views and those of the Department on our attitude towards the Ukraine.  I have formed the distinct impression in the past five years at least that the EU and the West sell the EU in a very improper way in the context of the divisions which are indigenous to Ukraine, the east-west divide, the Russian-western link, Tymoshenko and the party of the regions.  Is the Minister of State happy that the EU has sold the message of the benefits of EU alignment to the Ukraine, to the extent that the mission has been extended into the Russian-speaking, eastern region of Ukraine?  All I ever hear in Ireland - it is probably replicated in the international media - is the name of Tymoshenko  Ukraine is more than Tymoshenko it is a unitary state not a two-state nation.  Given the eastern partnership and that we were all sold the line that it is nearly sure that Ukraine is over the line, I noted the palpable sense of disappointment when the talks collapsed.  The Russian diplomatic corps at that stage had sent out warnings with regard to the reasons for Armenia pulling out.  Ukraine subsequently gave its reasons for pulling out.  The Russian form of diplomacy is extremely strong on the issue of energy resources.  Is the Minister of State focusing too much on that half of Ukraine which is pro-West, and neglecting the diplomatic programme that must be carried out in the eastern region?</p><p>  We have been rather dismissive of the role of Russia and we know its negative role.</p> <p>For example, it has been supportive in Iran.  When the Americans were going to bomb Syria over weapons of mass destruction, lo and behold the Russians came to the rescue and succeeded in implementing a policy of discussion.</p><p> I ask the Minister of State to review the role of Russian diplomacy in Europe and the world, which has often been negative in terms of influencing decisions through fear or the deprivation of resources, but which appears to be playing a more important role in greater world events.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments.</p><p> Reverting to the question of the EU as an entity, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia must be called that despite the fact we all know it as Macedonia.  What progress has been made with the Greeks on what is a sensitive issue for them?  Macedonia submitted its application for EU membership in 2004, making it one of the longest application periods.  The name seems to be the issue delaying matters.</p><p> What is the Minister of State's brief opinion of events in Slovenia?  We always suspected that it was heading towards a bailout.  Today's or yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i>reinforced that suspicion.  Does the Minister of State have advice?  Does the Government act in a bilateral way with the likes of Slovenia, which is confronting economic difficulties?  Given our experience as a nation, have we extended a hand of support to help Slovenia in its crisis?</p><p> We can attempt to solve all of the problems of the world from Macedonia to Albania, but why do we never mention issues on our own doorstep?  A member of the EU, Cyprus, is a divided island.  Famagusta, a major port and city in Cyprus, is lying in mothballs.  Is it not time that we as Europeans began discussing a resolution to some of our own conflicts in more depth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000006#E00200"><p>I thank members for their questions.  I will take them in the order they were asked.</p><p>  Regarding the Chairman's question on the review of the European External Action Service, EEAS, it has achieved much despite the youth of the organisation and the difficult circumstances it confronted during its establishment.  I understand the Chairman's concern about the service's cost.  Like him, I am well familiar with the general concerns that people articulate regarding the cost of any public service.  For this reason, the review is a valuable process.  We must ensure that, for the amount of resources and number of people involved, it achieves its objectives.</p><p>  Two areas are important.  First, the EEAS supports through complementarity the effort of member states to deliver on the agreed objectives of the EU.  Second, it represents those interests that have been agreed by member states and are articulated through European institutions, for example, the Commission.  I am certain that the role of the EEAS, which has been good in many respects, can be enhanced once the review has been completed with a view to ensuring value for money.  We should all be concerned about the money spent in any public service, be it in Ireland or abroad.</p><p>  Regarding Turkey and visa liberalisation, Ireland is working hard to support Turkey in its journey through negotiating with the EU.  We will participate in those negotiations in a positive way.  Turkey and its Government recognise this, given the role that our Government was able to play in opening up the chapter for Turkey during our Presidency.</p><p>  A common theme raised by a number of members was that of Bosnia-Herzegovina, BiH.  The October European Commission report recognised that progress was at a standstill.  We need time to evaluate how to proceed, particularly in light of the fact that, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, many of its neighbours in the region have found a way of engaging with the EU in its processes and satisfactorily meeting the benchmarks laid down by the Union and their own governments.  Therefore, the issue about BiH is a visible and important one requiring our engagement.  However, I must emphasise that ultimate responsibility for the process sits with the home country.  A country must be willing to embrace it and take ownership of it.  A mantra used in respect of other challenges facing us is often used in this respect, namely, the EU cannot impose solutions on anyone.  Similarly, we cannot impose ownership of a process on anyone.  I hope that the opportunity to take cognisance of where we are will be grasped within BiH as it will be within Europe and its member states, including Ireland.</p><p>  I am delighted to hear that the report on the social dimensions of the economic and monetary union, EMU, has been finished.  I was a member of the committee during the report's early phases and look forward to reading it.  We strongly recommend the inclusion of social indicators within the scoreboard, as we cannot achieve an evaluation of the situation within the Union without considering the social consequences of decisions alongside the economic ones.  However, we will continue to emphasise the need for caution about treating such indicators like economic indicators.  In other countries, deficits and debt levels have clear spill-over effects on other EU member states, effects that are of a different nature to the spill-over effects picked up by social indicators.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Dooley for his two questions.  I am aware of the comments of Mr. Regling, whom the Deputy acknowledged did some valuable work in Ireland by conducting one of the inquiries into what happened within our banking sector.  The Government will continue to emphasise the statement made by the Eurogroup in June setting out the role of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in direct bank recapitalisations and making it clear that this must be agreed by all member states on a case-by-case basis.  Our Government will continue to pursue such a mechanism as an option for ensuring that we can rebuild our banking system and, importantly, the health of the sovereign.</p><p>  The Deputy raised a topical point about the role of the Commission post bailout exit.  While Ireland remains inside the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, which members will be familiar with, we will continue to be subject to an additional layer of monitoring.</p> <p>I have always felt that if the challenges which Ireland faced had been relative to Ireland alone, regardless of how bad they were, we would have had the measure of them quickly.  Not only did Ireland have to deal with its own intense difficulties but it also had to deal with the confluence of other problems which arose in other member states at or near the same time.  This put Ireland in a very vulnerable position.  This is the reason we campaigned with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il through the chairmanship of Deputy Dooley for the fiscal governance treaty.  We believe that for the euro not only to survive but to be stable and prosper it must be acknowledged that the difficulties being experienced by any one country can have a huge affect on every other country.  These types of mechanisms are to ensure that does not happen.</p><p> I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for his questions.  I take his point in regard to Albania.  Ireland is strongly disposed to supporting it on its journey.  I have already responded on the issues relating to Bosnia Herzegovina.  Deputy Byrne also posed a number of important questions in relation to the Ukraine.  I had the privilege of attending the partnership summit in Vilnius, at which these discussions took place.  I also attended some of the private meetings in this regard.  I also had the privilege of representing Ireland last week at the OSCE conference in the Kiev where the consequences of all this were visible.  I took the opportunity of my visit to Kiev to meet with and talk to the protesters in Independence Square, which allowed me to gain a better appraisal of where things stand.  We now need to develop a model of association that is not seen by other countries as being mutually exclusive or binary.  In other words, we must ensure that countries can further develop their relationships with the European Union in such a way that is not either-or.  We need to reflect now on how to move this forward.  In doing so, we need to make clear to the Ukrainian Government, as we did last week, that it is its decision to make, while recognising that we must continue to find a way to develop our relationship with the Ukraine.  Despite the difficulties being experienced by the Ukraine we expect all sides to be aware of the impartial rule of law and to uphold their responsibilities in that area.  Following the developments over the weekend and, conscious of the depth of feeling in the Ukraine in this regard, the coming days and weeks will be a hugely important time for the Ukrainian Government and its people.</p><p> Mention was made of the significant role played by Russia, particularly in the discussions which took place in Geneva in regard to the nuclear negotiations of Iran.  My response would be to dovetail that situation to the point I made in regard to the Ukrainian situation.  We now need to focus on relationships and how best we can work together in the same region.  As part of this process, there will be greater direct engagement with the Russian Government and its foreign Minister and the foreign Ministers of the European Union in the near future.  It is in the mutual interests of Europe and Russia to have a good relationship and to ensure that the region in between is stable, secure and prosperous.  Both parties are aware of the challenges in that regard. </p><p> On the question of Slovenia, we are very much aware of the challenges that Slovenia and its people face.  It was asked if we should offer advice to Slovenia.  I am regularly asked in the context of my work abroad about how Ireland deals with other countries, particularly given where Ireland now stands in terms of the bailout programme.  My response always is that every country is different.  Therefore, the needs of each economy are different.  We are very much aware of the difficulties which a country can experience.  In the same way as other countries worked with Ireland we, through the European Union, ECOFIN and the Eurogroup, will support Slovenia in the changes it may need to make.  We will use our experience in this regard to try to support it and any other country.</p><p> With regard to other conflicts within the European Union, I am very much aware of the level of difficulties being experienced in many member states, particularly those member states that are engaged in neighbourhood or accession policy discussions and negotiations with the EU.  The Union at that point is as much a process based on values that hopefully will allow and enable people to resolve their internal difficulties and other difficulties which they may have with other countries.  I believe that the accession discussions and neighbourhood policies are important because they put in place a fora that requires that all members of society talk to each other.  This is the most important mechanism for dealing with the type of difficulties to which the Deputy referred earlier.</p><p> I hope I have responded to all of the questions asked.</p></speech>

I also met last week with representatives of the Government of Moldova.  During the partnership summit I expressed the view that while the focus on the difficulties being experienced in the Ukraine is important, it is also important we do not lose sight of the commitments made by Georgia and Moldova in what could be a challenging external environment.  To do this - I had this discussion with the foreign Minister - we need to ensure that the European Union puts in place methods of supports for those countries in the coming months, in particular throughout the winter.  I believe this will be done in two ways, namely, support for Moldova in moving beyond initialling of the agreement to signing of it in as prompt a manner as possible and address of its concerns in relation to visas in the context of its people being able to move around with greater ease.  This must be given careful consideration.  It would be a pity if in the midst of engaging with one country that did not decide to go down that path, which is its right, we did not continue to support it directly.</p> <p>I have engaged with Moldovan representatives twice in the past week and a half and we will give them any support we can.  In the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, along with many of our neighbours we will be saying we need to support them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000008#G00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the review of foreign policy and external relations, which we are undertaking in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The purpose of the review, which was launched by the T&aacute;naiste on 8 October, is to provide an updated statement of Ireland's foreign policy and external relations, and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.  As the T&aacute;naiste said when launching the review, Ireland's foreign policy and external relations are fundamental aspects of Government.  They represent the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad.  Through them, we pursue Ireland's economic prosperity, and promote peace and security, both at home and in the wider world.  Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people and how we wish ourselves to be seen by the outside world.  Through my work as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I am aware on a daily basis of the central importance of these facts.</p><p>  Following our successful EU Presidency in the first half of this year, the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012, and our election to the UN Human Rights Council, we have an opportunity to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy, the values and interests we seeks to promote through it, and how it contributes to achieving Government objectives.  I wish to reflect on the trio of objectives I mentioned: the very successful European Union Presidency; chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012; and Ireland's election to the UN Human Rights Council.  With everything else that was going on in the public and Government sphere at the moment, it is a real tribute to everybody who works in our foreign policy sphere and representing our country.  I am happy to say that as somebody who only came into this role after all those achievements were in place, but it adds to the reason for saying it.  A gigantic amount of work was very well done by all of our colleagues, diplomats and officials, who represent our country on a daily basis, not to mention the work by our Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  With that in mind this is a perfect point to take a step back and think where we want to go to from here.</p><p>  The vital work of restoring our international reputation and promoting our economic recovery are priorities for the Government.  The international leadership roles we have undertaken as a country have done much to achieve this goal, as has the building of political relationships with European and other partners, through regular participation by Ministers at Council meetings in Brussels, and through trade missions and visits abroad.</p><p>  In our last meeting, I emphasised the importance of taking every opportunity to ensure that Irish positions are understood at political level and of keeping up to date on the developing priorities and challenges for our partners.  Our foreign policy is central to both of those goals.  This has been particularly important during the EU Presidency and the important negotiations in Europe on banking and fiscal issues.  Political contact at the highest levels has been central to this.  Our embassies and other diplomatic and consular offices in Europe and around the world have also made a vital contribution.  They are working hard to realise our goals through presenting the best case for Ireland and influencing decisions that affect us.  Together with the State agencies, they work with Irish business, promoting our trade, tourism, education and investment.  In addition, they provide a full range of services to our citizens abroad, sometimes in difficult and tragic circumstances.</p><p>  As we look to the future, and as we exit the EU-IMF programme, it is timely to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy.  The review will consider a broad range of issues, reflecting the breadth of our external engagement.  Issues to be considered will include: how we set our external priorities; how we engage as an EU member state; how we contribute to economic recovery and growth through promoting our trade, tourism and investment; the pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland; the services we provide to our citizens abroad and our relationship with the Irish diaspora; the contribution of our international development policy; and how we ensure Ireland is a respected international actor.  These are all important issues, as are other aspects of our foreign policy which the review will consider.</p><p>  Membership of the European Union is fundamental to our interests, both in foreign policy and domestic terms.  Indeed, our EU membership is inseparable from the pursuit of our foreign policy, as it is from so many aspects of domestic policy.  As our engagement with the European Union is wider than the foreign policy sphere, being at the core of the day-to-day business of all Departments, the review will not examine our EU policy in detail.  Instead, the focus will be on the contribution of our foreign policy and external relations, as well as the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across Government, to the promotion of Ireland's interests within the EU, on the one hand, and to ensuring that Europe's voice is stronger at a global level, on the other.  The extent that we are able to promote a strong image of ourselves through our foreign policy outside the EU will contribute to our ability to pursue our objectives within it.</p><p>  Ireland's foreign policy has been greatly influenced by our engagement in the EU since joining in 1973.  Our EU membership influences our relations with third countries, for example, in shaping trade policies with key partners.  In turn, our relations with those countries also strengthen our voice at the EU table.</p><p>  Many of today's challenges, such as cyber security, climate change, and migration, are not defined by borders and regions, but require global solutions.  With 28 countries speaking as one, Europe's voice is stronger in the world and this allows the European Union to speak with authority at a global level.  The EU is uniquely placed to shape the way the international community addresses these and other global challenges, and Ireland is committed to playing its part in shaping how the EU engages on these issues.</p><p>  I will now outline how the review is being taken forward.  Given the wide-ranging nature of our foreign policy and external relations, it is important that we consult widely.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is facilitating a broad-based consultation process, involving all Departments, State agencies, academics and experts, business organisations, interested stakeholders, and civil society.  This is being complemented by a detailed process of consultation and analysis being undertaken within my Department, involving our network of embassies and other offices abroad.</p><p>  A public consultation exercise was launched on 4 December, in the form of an invitation to members of the public and interested stakeholders to contribute written views.  The deadline for submissions is 4 February 2014.  Information on how to make a submission is available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p> <p>I hope those with an interest in Ireland's foreign policy and place in the world will seize this opportunity and contribute views and inputs to the review process.</p><p> It is important that the Oireachtas should make its contribution to the review, as it does to the process of shaping and overseeing foreign policy, through the work of this and other committees on a ongoing basis.  The T&aacute;naiste last week met the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade for a broad-ranging discussion on the review.  A meeting also will be arranged with the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to discuss issues arising from the review that are within that committee's remit.  Issues raised here today, as well as at these other meetings, will constitute an important input to the review process.  The Government also welcomes written inputs from this committee and of course from individual Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p> The review also will take account of a number of recently concluded or ongoing review processes, including the Government's new policy for international development, namely, One World, One Future, adopted in May this year; the White Paper on Defence currently being prepared by the Minister for Defence and the review of the Government's trade, tourism and investment strategy, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.  The purpose of the review is to provide an updated statement of Ireland's foreign policy and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct with a view to ensuring the Government is equipped with the right mix of policies and instruments to protect and promote Ireland's values and interests in a changing international environment.  This is a timely and important review.  Its outcome will guide Ireland's external engagement in the years ahead.  The outcome of the review, scheduled for the second quarter of 2014, will be a policy document setting out the core objectives of Ireland's foreign policy and the measures and instruments required to secure their delivery.</p><p> I look forward to working with the Chairman, members of the joint committee and the Oireachtas to ensure the right polices are crafted to promote Ireland's values and interests.  I look forward to today's discussion, to hearing members' views and to receiving further input in due course.  With the Chairman's agreement, I do not propose to respond in detail to policy suggestions at this time.  I assure members however that as always, I will take careful note of all proposals, as will the officials who have accompanied me today, and these will be fully taken into account when preparing the outcome of the review.</p></speech>

I perceive today's meeting to be a commencement of the process and I would like to think the joint committee will submit a statement to the review in advance of the deadline on 4 February.  Consequently, members probably will have a number of discussions in this regard in the new year and can feed back the outcomes of those discussions to the Minister of State in due course.  However, I will make a few points while the Minister of State is present.  I welcome the breadth of the review and it is excellent that the relationship with the Irish diaspora is being considered.  The Minister of State is aware of how important the diaspora has been to the country over the generations.  I did not hear the Minister of State indicate members of the diaspora would be consulted in some way but I assume that organisations such as, for instance, the Federation of Irish Societies in the United Kingdom or the American organisations will have some input into this process because it is important to maximise the use of the diaspora abroad.</p><p>  I note the Minister of State's reference to the need to examine how Ireland's embassies can contribute towards economic recovery and growth through the promotion of trade and tourism, which is an excellent point.  I am reminded of a visit I made to Ireland's consul in Hong Kong some time ago.  From recollection, Ireland's trade with Hong Kong alone - not with China - is approximately &euro;1 billion per year, yet we do not even have an office there.  While we have an excellent part-time consul, he can only spend a certain amount of time on issues regarding Ireland and promoting trade and tourism.  There are opportunities for Ireland that must be maximised but which are not being maximised at present.</p><p>  As for where Ireland's embassies should be located, there are some examples arise within the European Union.  For example, Croatia joined recently and while Ireland has no embassy there, it does so up the road in Slovenia, which is a country of half the size and with which Ireland has half the trade.  Consequently, there may be ways of rationalising or altering some local arrangements.  We have an excellent diplomatic corps, which on the whole is extremely cost-effective.  I will give some examples to the Minister of State.  The joint committee recently visited the Baltic states and our embassies in Tallinn and Vilnius are examples of what can be done efficiently and well on extremely tight budgets.  The review should consider this issue and should consider how Ireland's representation abroad can be maximised through the most cost-effective means possible.  I look forward to forming part of the review and the joint committee will return to the subject early in the new year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000009#H00300"><p>This is an excellent and timely measure.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State is not taking detailed comments at present, I will mention something that I have noticed a lot since the economy went into recession in 2008-09.  In the 1990s, for example, Ireland had quite strong relations with other peripheral European countries and had an informal alliance with, for the sake of argument, Spain, Portugal, southern Italy to extent and other countries that suffered from some of the same broad issues of peripherality as did Ireland in the 1990s.  This is a broad comment but given that Ireland still remains a small open economy that still suffers greatly from its peripheral location and given that Europe, as members discussed earlier, is expanding quite significantly more to the East, does the Minister of State envisage it might be wise for Ireland, in a much larger Europe, to build up again more bilateral contacts or to strengthen its bilateral arrangements with other countries that are more at one with Ireland in respect of the difficulties and challenges they face?  I refer in particular to their geographic location and the type of social policies they pursue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013121000009#H00400"><p>I agree this is a timely and interesting discussion that is to be had.  If we are doing as well as we are, I am unsure how matters can be improved and I will be fascinated to find out about what routes and restructuring members will be discussing.  The Chairman has already referred to Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which are three countries bordering each other with three embassies and three small populations.  Given that I also wear the hat of a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am always slightly embarrassed when dealing with ambassadors or visiting dignitaries from countries who remind me that while the population of their countries is vast, with 108 million or 96 million people, they complain of a lack of representation.  I do not refer specifically to Singapore or Malaysia - I do not have the detail of the top of my head - but there are countries whose embassies refer continually to the need for representation.  I am aware the Department and the Government are under pressure from certain sectors to reopen embassies and for some peculiar reason, it is obvious they want to reopen the embassy in the Vatican more than the one in Tehran.  If the Geneva peace talks and developments in Iran continue, I understand it has a regional catchment of interest of approximately 800 million people.  Consequently, when considering the review and the question of religiously-based or economically-based embassies, members might consider that aspect.</p></speech>

I concur with what has been said regarding the embassies, which are an important asset for the country.  The review should consider the area of trade and the most important trading links.</p> <p>There are too few embassies.  Their location and the large areas not covered by embassies should be part of the review, which should also consider the need to encourage links with new trading partners.  The review will be an important process and I look forward to the joint committee participating in it.</p></speech>

I fully accept Senator Hayden's point on the value of bilateral relations.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of the Taoiseach attach great importance to developing bilateral relations.  I travel extensively to what could be inelegantly described as multilateral gatherings, for example, European Union and OSCE gatherings, at which many countries are represented.  We should never assume such forums amount to the same thing as building a direct relationship with another country.  I am proud to note that in all the work I have observed, this mistake has not been made and we do all we can to develop good relations with EU member states and non-EU countries.</p><p>  This leads me to the point made by other speakers regarding embassies, which are at the core of bilateral work.  The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that the allocation of embassies is under review.  Members referred to the work the embassies do and the resources available to them.  The many embassies I have dealt with do extraordinary work.  Their staff work extremely hard and they are an invaluable asset as we seek to chart a way out of our current difficulties.  </p><p>  I will leave it at that as it is not my role at this stage to engage in the work of the committee.  If members were to develop the themes they have raised in a report, it would make a valuable input in the process.  </p></speech>

They also cause angst to members of staff who must wear headsets.</p><p>  The purpose of the meeting is to consider some European Union legislative proposals regarding the regulation of medical devices - COM (2012) 541 and COM (2012) 542 - and the pricing of medicinal products for human use - COM (2013) 168.  We considered this issue earlier in the year and will now receive an update and clarification on same.  We also requested an update on the position on De Puy hips and PIP breast implants, information on which was circulated to members in advance of the meeting. </p><p>  I welcome from the Department of Health Mr. Paul Barron, assistant secretary; Ms Teresa Cody and Mr. Patrick Creedon, primary care unit; and Mr. Hugh Drumm, medicines unit; from the Health Service Executive Dr. Ian Carter, national director for acute services; from the Irish Medicines Board Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Mahony, chief executive; Dr. Joan Gilvarry, director of human products monitoring; and Dr. Niall MacAleenan, clinical assessment manager and medical devices lead.  They are all very welcome and I thank them for being here.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Barron" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013121000003#B00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss three proposals under deliberation at EU level.  The first is for a draft directive on the terms on which medicinal products are covered by the public health insurance systems of member states.  This is generally referred to as the transparency directive.  The second and third proposals relate to general medical devices and <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices, respectively.</p><p>  I will begin with the transparency directive.  In March 2012 the European Commission adopted the proposal for a new transparency directive to replace Directive 89/105/EEC.  It deals with measures regulating the terms on which medicinal products are covered by the public health insurance systems of member states.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is that since 1989 reimbursement systems have become increasingly complex and that a new directive is required to address these complexities.  It is also intended to incorporate European Court of Justice case law which has developed and is relevant to the directive.  </p><p>  Member states had concerns about many of the proposed measures and the administrative burden which would be placed on member states arising from the proposal.  On 6 February 2013 the European Parliament introduced amendments in an attempt to address these concerns.  These amendments were largely adopted by the European Commission in its modified proposal adopted on 20 March.</p><p>  Under the Irish Presidency, the working party on pharmaceuticals and medical devices chaired by Ireland held four discussions on the modified proposal, about which many delegations continue to express various degrees of concern.  Further detailed discussions are required at the working party before the proposal will have support at the Council.</p><p>  The Department of Health had substantial concerns about the original Commission proposal.  However, the amendments proposed by the European Parliament which were largely adopted by the Commission went a long way towards resolving our main concerns.</p><p>  I will now deal with the medical devices proposals published by the Commission in September 2012.  There are two related proposals, one of which is to regulate general medical devices, while the second is to regulate <i>in</i><i>vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices.  The proposals are designed to provide a legislative framework for the manufacture and placing on the market of both medical devices and <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices in order to ensure a high level of protection for patients and health care professionals.</p><p>  Under existing legislation, medical devices, unlike medicines, are not subject to pre-market authorisation by a regulatory authority before being placed on the market.  Instead, medical devices undergo a conformity assessment to confirm that they meet specified safety and performance requirements.  Assessments are conducted by independent certification bodies, known as notified bodies, which are designated and regulated at national level.  One of the main criticisms of the current regulatory system is that notified bodies operate to different standards.  It has also been suggested it may be possible for notified bodies to undertake conformity assessments of categories of medical devices for which they may not have the requisite expertise.  Consequently, it is recognised that improved and harmonised regulatory oversight of notified bodies is needed.</p><p>  The Commission has proposed a scrutiny mechanism whereby new applications for conformity assessment of high risk devices, once the assessment of the notified body is complete, could be subject to a second look by the medical devices co-ordination group, a new expert committee composed of member state officials and chaired by the Commission.  It is intended that this mechanism will serve to increase the scrutiny of new high risk medical devices as they come on to the European market and allow for enhanced oversight of the performance of notified bodies.  The Council does not yet have a position on this issue.</p><p>  The Commission proposes a rigorous process for approving notified bodies, with strict standards to be met by notified bodies, strengthened criteria for determining the scope of competence of a notified body such as the types of device a notified body may assess, and a joint approach to assessment of notified bodies.  The European Parliament ENVI committee and member states both support improved oversight and regulation of notified bodies.</p><p>  To date, the Council working party on pharmaceuticals and medical devices has met on 16 occasions during the Cyprus, Irish and Lithuanian Presidencies.  The examination of the medical devices proposals constituted one of the four key priorities of the Irish Presidency health agenda.  During the Irish Presidency substantial progress was made in the examination of the two proposals.  In parallel, informal technical expert meetings were organised by the Irish Presidency to discuss technical aspects, submit wording suggestions and help in identifying key issues.</p><p>  In the European Parliament the proposals were examined by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, known as ENVI.  This committee has voted in favour of pre-market authorisation for high risk medical devices via a centralised EU structure of notified bodies approved by the European Medicines Agency.  The Council does not yet have a position on this issue.  The ENVI report has proposed many useful amendments.  On 22 October the European Parliament voted on the reports and amendments submitted to the plenary session.  The vote on the First Reading resolution was postponed; however, a mandate was given to the rapporteurs to commence negotiations with the Council.</p><p>  The Department of Health is actively engaged in the negotiations on the medical devices proposals, with the support of our colleagues in the Irish Medicines Board.  We support the development of a robust legislative framework for medical devices in Europe which will ensure all medical devices placed on the European market are safe for both patients and health care professionals and that European patients have access to new innovative treatments.  In our view, a proportionate balance must be achieved in the new regulatory system between ensuring appropriate pre-market oversight of the conformity assessment of high risk devices before being placed on the market and facilitating innovation in the sector and timely access by patients to new treatments.  </p><p>  We will be happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

We are grateful for the opportunity to update the joint committee, as requested, on the PIP breast implant and the DePuy ASR hip recall issues.  In addition, we would like to take the opportunity to provide committee members with an overview of the implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s joint plan for immediate action on medical devices which was put in place in response to these crises.  Members may recall that in September we provided an update on the PIP breast implant issue.  We advised that we anticipated imminent publication of the report from the European scientific committee on emerging and newly identified health risks - its second comprehensive review of these implants.  The SCHENIHR committee's report, published on 29 October, states:<blockquote><br /><font color="#004080"> T</font>here is currently no convincing medical, toxicological or other data to justify removal of intact PIP implants as a precautionary approach.  Implant removal in the absence of malfunction may be considered for women who are experiencing significant anxiety because they have a PIP breast implant.  However, the decision to remove an intact PIP implant for this reason should be based on an individual assessment of the woman's condition by her surgeon or other treating physician after consultation.</blockquote>The SCENIHR opinion correlates with the advice of the IMB and the Department of Health to the women affected that &quot;there is no current evidence of health risks associated with PIP implants and concerned women should seek clinical advice from their GP or surgeon&quot;.</p><p>  In 2012 and, more recently, September 2013 we outlined to the committee the details of the worldwide recall of DePuy ASR and ASR XL hip implants.  The recall of these products was based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales which showed higher than expected implant revision rates at five years.  At the time of our update, approximately 3,500 ASR hips had been implanted in Ireland.  The IMB has since worked closely with the HSE and Irish orthopaedic surgeons on the recommendations for individual patient follow-up.  When we met the committee in July 2012, the HSE had outlined that at the time 96% of patients had attended review appointments and over 350 had had revision surgery, with another 166 scheduled for surgery.  We understand all patients have been reviewed and the HSE representatives will give details of updated figures for revision surgeries.</p><p>  The IMB continues to assess the reported incidents received and analyse data generated from revisions, joint registry data, as well as from clinical studies.  Independent analysis of explanted devices which have been returned for investigation is being conducted in the United Kingdom at the London Implant Retrieval Centre.  The ASR recall experience has been central to wider international discussions on metal on metal implants.  The research in this area suggests increased revision rates associated with large diameter-head metal on metal hip implants.  Mechanical wear of an implant is experienced with all types of hip replacement implant over time, as the femoral head and acetabular cup component surfaces rotate against each other.</p> <p>With a metal on metal hip system, this can lead to the production and accumulation of cobalt and chromium metal ions within the area surrounding the implant.  While many patients have no significant reaction to these materials, for some, there may be an inflammatory response which can lead to problems such as local bone and tissue reactions.</p><p> The SCENIHR has been mandated to conduct a review of the safety of metal on metal implants.  This investigation is focusing on the potential health effects caused by metal ions resulting from the implanted medical device.  We advised the committee in September that the opinion from the SCENIHR was expected shortly.  We have recently been informed that it is now expected in mid-December.  The IMB will consider, with the HSE and orthopaedic surgeons, the implications of the review for Irish patients.</p><p> I wish to provide the committee with an overview of the implementation of the European Commission's joint plan for immediate actions which was published in early 2012 in response to the crises relating to the PIP breast and metal on metal hip implants previously mentioned.  At the time, as a result of the issues identified by the PIP breast and metal on metal hip implant crises, the Commission took a series of initiatives which included a stress test of the then draft proposals to revise the medical devices legislation to assess its ability to manage such issues; mandating specific reviews of the scientific and safety aspects to be conducted by the SCENIHR; and publication of the joint plan for immediate actions to strengthen and restore confidence in the regulatory system for medical devices.  The joint plan recognises the need to further develop and strengthen the existing regulatory system in advance of the broader revision of the legislation which is ongoing.  Focusing on measures to strengthen oversight of notified bodies, increase market surveillance activities for medical devices and increase inter-authority collaboration and information exchange, the purpose of the joint plan was to enhance the existing regulatory framework.  These objectives were set out as a series of short and medium-term actions for member states, competent authorities and the Commission.</p><p> The implementation of the joint plan is nearing completion across Europe.  Overall, it is judged to have been a highly successful programme resulting in significant action and development of the regulatory regime since its publication.  In the context of the important area of notified bodies, the plan has led to the introduction of a voluntary joint assessment scheme for the designation and oversight of notified bodies.  The assessments involve an independent review by the European Commission, assisted by appropriate experts selected from member states.  The purpose of the review is to assess the competency and performance of national designating authorities such as the IMB and ensure they are applying designation criteria in a harmonised way.  Some 20 joint assessments have been conducted to date in 2013 across Europe.  The programme continues to have a positive tangible impact on the oversight and functioning of European notified bodies.  In addition, the Commission has published its recommendation for notified bodies.  This provides guidance for those bodies on best practices relating to their assessment and monitoring activities.</p><p> The joint plant has also led to the introduction of new and enhanced legislative requirements for notified bodies and the authorities responsible for their oversight.  These include a more specific definition of operational requirements for notified bodies and mandatory joint assessments to be conducted on an ongoing basis.  There is also a requirement for notified bodies to conduct unannounced inspections of the manufacturing facilities for which they are responsible.  The positive impacts of these inspections have been evident throughout the Europeand Union.  The plan also put in place a requirement for notified bodies to update their contracts with manufacturers to ensure proactive communication of important vigilance-safety information.  This requirement has yielded positive benefits in terms of increased proactive communication throughout the European network.</p><p> In the context of market surveillance, co-operation between authorities and communication, the joint plan has resulted in the establishment of a forum, led by the European Commission, for a regular exchange and sharing of information on emerging safety issues.  The forum has been operational since July 2012 and successful in further developing collaboration and achieving a collective resolution of key issues.</p><p> The joint plan has also given rise to a review of the scope of current market surveillance activities on medical devices conducted by member states.  This has provided a platform from which a co-ordinated approach to surveillance can be developed, allowing for enhanced co-operation and targeted proactive market surveillance, including joint activities.  Under the plan, there has also been a detailed review of the European regulatory authority structures to promote co-operation, communication and work-sharing.  This review is nearing completion.  It will not only enhance co-operation and communication between authorities but also seek to increase the management and transparency of the system.</p><p> Another initiative for authorities to promote as part of the joint plan has led to an increase in the number of reports received by the IMB from health care professionals on medical device issues.  Dialogue with clinical societies and professional bodies on medical devices has increased and become commonplace at European level.  It allows for key input and advice from expert clinicians and device users.  </p><p> The plan has led to increased discussion on the use of registers for medical devices at European level.  This is under way and the European Commission's so-called cross-border PAtient REgistries iNiTiative, PARENT, initiative is seeking to ensure such registers are appropriately established and have datasets which can be compared and analysed cumulatively across the European Union.</p><p> The IMB has been strongly committed to the joint plan from the time of its introduction and contributed significantly at both national and European level to ensure realisation of its objectives.  The IMB considers that the plan has been critical in ensuring the existing regulatory system is enhanced to provide for increased levels of protection for patients.  We are also committed to the future development of the plan which we believe can play a vital role in ensuring continued strengthening of the regulatory framework in the interim period prior to the adoption of the new legislation.</p><p> In the context of future developments to build on the existing regulatory system, it is anticipated that the European Commission will publish a report on the implementation of the joint plan either during this month or early in 2014.  In response to appeals from several authorities, including the IMB, the Commission has indicated its intention to build on the principles of the existing plan and is shortly expected to make an additional formal proposal with details of further actions to develop the regulatory system during the period 2014 to 2015.  Specific areas which the IMB has proposed for inclusion in the future development of the plan include placing further emphasis on practical measures to enhance market surveillance of medical devices; a continued focus on notified body oversight; enhanced emphasis on clinical data for medical devices and, in particular, assessment by notified bodies; and the development of further mechanisms for improving the availability of information on medical devices, particularly in the context of adverse incidents and safety issues.</p><p> The IMB will work to optimise and develop the regulatory activities conducted for medical devices at national and European level.  This will include ongoing provision of dedicated support for developments at European level.  We recognise that, in order to meet increasing challenges and requirements, it is necessary to continue to review and improve our approach to providing for regulatory oversight.  Specific objectives in this regard include developing cross-organisational, that is, within the IMB, co-ordination of medical device activities to ensure a sufficient focus on new and emerging requirements; developing existing resource capabilities in line with advances in technology and innovation; and fostering and developing international collaboration within the medical device authority network at both European and international level.  This will ensure our continued capability in providing a robust and relevant system of regulation for medical devices which affords the appropriate level of protection for patients and device users.  </p><p> We will be pleased to take whatever questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

The briefing note we have received refers to proposals designed to ensure all medical devices are safe for patients and restore public confidence in the European medical devices regulatory system.  It is fair to state said confidence has been significantly dented and that it is important that it be restored.  The debacles involving DePuy hip implants and PIP breast implants have had an impact on Irish people and I have no doubt that this impact has been replicated - it may even be more pronounced - in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>The briefing note sets out several bullet points under the briefing summary.  One I highlighted is that of more powers and obligations for notified bodies to ensure thorough testing and regular checks on manufacturers, including unannounced factory inspections and sample testing.  That would most certainly address the issue of the PIP implants where wholly and totally inappropriate material was being used, which would have been established if such unannounced factory inspections were taking place regularly and we had a robust examination and testing of the quality of materials and their suitability for <i>in vitro</i>use by humankind.</p><p> Mr. Pat O'Mahony might update us on where things are with regard to both of these matters.  Can we have some assurance as to the steps that are being taken collegially across the European Union?  These directives are part of the response I expect, yet as Mr. Paul Barron indicated, the Department of Health has concerns about the original drafting and some other member states still have concerns about it.  In his address to the committee, Mr. Paul Barron mentioned that member states had concerns regarding many of the proposed measures.  Will he elaborate on which member states they are?  Clearly, we must number among them.  He also indicated in the course of his opening statement that some of these concerns were shared and that he believes the Department's concerns have been ameliorated by amendments that have been adopted by the Commission.  The phrase he used is that they &quot;went a long way towards resolving our main concerns&quot;.  Will he elaborate on what concerns remain?  He did not suggest that they were all addressed comprehensively.  Are they of such minor nature that he considers we should have no issue with the adoption of directives at this point and that we are in a position to proceed positively with the proposals?</p><p> Mr. Barron made the point that the ENVI committee &quot;has voted in favour of pre-market authorisation for high risk medical devices via a centralised EU structure of notified bodies approved by the European Medicines Agency&quot;.  He indicated that the Council does not have a position on this issue as yet.  It is ancillary, I guess, to the substantive issue being addressed, but what of the Department of Health's view on that specific area?  I would be grateful if he could give us a further insight into that.</p></speech>

At what stage are we at in being able to guarantee that these difficulties will not arise again?  Are there pre-inspections and unannounced inspections of materials and the manufacturing of these implants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-10a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013121000005#D00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I wish to briefly touch on one or two issues.  On the issue of the defective devices, a system know as RAPEX was set up under the toys directive, which provides that if a defective item is identified in a country, that country has an obligation to notify the other 27 member states.  The RAPEX system is a fast-track procedure for ensuring the market becomes aware of defective toys.  Is a similar procedure or structure available or in place in respect of medical devices?</p><p>  My second question relates to the Irish Medical Devices Association.  Following a meeting of 27 November 2012, more than 12 months ago, it wrote to the Irish permanent representative at the time and expressed concern that the product scrutiny as structured in the Commission proposal would not increase patient safety.  It expressed that concern in 2012.  What is its position on the Commission's proposal and what is being talked about among the member states?  Is the medical devices industry happy with the progress that is being made or does it still have some concerns that need to be dealt with?  We are taking those concerns on board as we have a large number of people employed in the medical devices industry.  The delegates may have touched on this but I would like further clarification.</p><p>  The third issue on which I wish to touch is that of insurance.  It comes back to the issue of breast implants.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill that provided for placing an obligation on all people involved in medicine to have adequate insurance.  The Department intends to move forward with that proposed legislation over the next six to nine months.  On the current structure in place covering medical devices, the people involved in plastic surgery in Ireland, in particular Peter Meagher, are concerned about the number of people coming from abroad, providing a service and not having adequate cover.  They are also concerned that we do not have the power to close the operations of those practitioners if they are not providing a structured service.  They carry out the procedure but provide no backup support in the event of anything going wrong and, as a result, our health service has to deal with those difficulties afterwards.  How far advanced are we in ensuring that in respect of everyone who provides medical care in this country - we are talking about the use of medical devices - there is a structure in place and adequate insurance cover and supervision in place?  I understand the legislation in place does not cover all that area.  How long will it take the Department to come on board with regard to that amending legislation?</p></speech>

The part of my opening remarks to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred related to the transparency directive which is the directive that deals with the terms under which medical products are covered by health insurance systems.  On the second page of my presentation, I stated that the Department had concerns about the original Commission proposal but the Commission proposal, to which I am referring, is the transparency directive rather than the medical device directives.  I apologise if I caused confusion over that.</p></speech>

Very tight timeframes are being proposed for - in our case - the HSE to come to a decision on whether a product should be placed on the reimbursement list.  Our view was that the timescales originally proposed would be too onerous on our system.  Thankfully, the proposed timeframes have been changed to give us some more time.</p> <p>The timeframes now proposed under the legislation marry up with the timeframes in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act that was enacted during the summer.  Our concerns on that score have been addressed.</p><p> A question was asked about what I said towards the end of my statement on the environment, public health and food safety, ENVI, committee.  There was one error in my statement, which I dealt with when I delivered it.  I said the proposals were examined by the ENVI committee in the European Parliament, and I then said the ENVI committee had voted in favour of pre-market authorisation, but that is a mistake.  When I delivered the statement I said the ENVI committee had spoken in favour of pre-market scrutiny.  The difference between the two is that pre-market authorisation would mean it would have to be authorised by a third party before it could be placed on the market.  That is not where the committee is at.  The committee is looking for pre-market scrutiny, which would fall somewhere short of authorisation.  Again, I apologise for that.</p><p> Some of the other points might be more relevant to the IMB.  Deputy Healy asked what was the current position with regard to unannounced inspections.  The IMB might be in a better position to deal with that.  In response to Senator Burke, my understanding is that there is a RAPEX alert system, but my colleagues from the IMB might address that.  He also asked about the views of industry.  It is fair to say that the industry, both at Irish level and at European level, is quite exercised about the proposals.  There is an intensive lobbying campaign under way, particularly at European level.  There are concerns among those in the industry that the proposals, if adopted in their current form, could give rise to delays in products coming on the market and additional costs.  I could go into more detail but that is a good summary of the position.</p><p> Senator Burke also asked about plastic surgery.  He is aware there are concerns about plastic surgery and cosmetic clinics.  The Department intends to address that through legislation on the licensing of hospitals and health facilities generally.  The intention is that the legislation would be broad enough to cover the activities of the cosmetic surgery operators to which the Senator referred.  The proposals on that are at a very advanced stage in the Department.  We would hope to go to the Government in the new year.  In the meantime our chief medical officer has agreed some advice for people considering cosmetic surgery.  The advice has been agreed with the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons and it is on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></speech>

We are advised in one of the briefing notes that there are four categories of medical device.  They indicate that class 1 encompasses everything from sticking plasters to the items on which Mr. Barron and I depend.  It goes all the way up to class 3, which concerns implants.  If the highest level is three, is there a fourth category?</p></speech>

First, I made it very clear the previous times I appeared before the committee that as the competent authority for patient safety we were very unhappy with the situation with regard to medical devices at that time and how pre-market approval was operating.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, it suffered a severe dent.  Two things happened in response to that: one is the proposal for the new legislation, and the other is what is happening, as I have described, under the joint plan.</p><p>  Mr. Barron has captured the issues on the legislation.  In essence, we rely on the policy lead from the Department and it is still early days for the proposals.  Much of what is required is captured in the legislation.  To respond to the question about the scrutiny mechanism, it was in the Commission's proposal, which was that a certain percentage of files that would be looked at by the notified bodies would also be examined by another committee as a separate pair of eyes.  The proposal as I understand it from the ENVI committee is that there is the scrutiny mechanism and a centralised committee looking at all high-risk devices.  We still do not know where that debate will end.</p><p>  From a competent authority perspective, whatever the outcome is along those lines that would increase protection for patients, that would be perfectly okay with us, and we will work within that system.  There will be resource implications, but we will work within it.  In the certain knowledge that legislation takes time, we are trying to make real progress on the joint plan in the meantime.  Since we last met, as I described, all this stuff has been going on around joint assessments of the notified bodies.  We identified before that the big weakness in the pre-market piece was the lack of consistency across notified bodies across Europe.  As I said in the note, up to 20 countries have now had visitations.  The joint visitation consists of the Commission, the national competent authority and experts from other competent authorities.  It is a very rigorous review of the approach of the national authority and the notified body.  They have targeted first of all the notified bodies involved with high-risk or class 3 devices.  That has worked very well and progress has been made during the second half of this year, and a legislative basis is being provided now by the Commission to make that mandatory, which is very helpful.</p><p>  With regard to unannounced inspections, the answer is that they are under way.  Our own notified body, the NSAI, is doing that, and it is happening across Europe.  With regard to the RAPEX system, we are also involved with cosmetics and others are involved with food in other areas, and the RAPEX system is in place for that.  The Commission has in place a similar system for medical devices, which it is currently suggesting will remain as the system.  It is similar to RAPEX but it has a different title and it operates in a different way, but it means that if an issue is notified in a country it will be disseminated throughout the rest of the competent authorities via this process.</p><p>  I will make a quick comment on insurance.  The new proposals make provision for a manufacturer's liability if the manufacturer goes bankrupt.  It would have applied, for example, in the PIP case.  There is also a requirement in the proposal for notified bodies to have specific insurance to cover their liabilities.  The issue of health professionals such as surgeons does not seem to be addressed in the current proposal.  The fundamental issues raised in the question about insurance are captured in the current Commission proposal.  They are the main questions to which I needed to respond.</p></speech>

I refer to products coming in from outside the European Union, for which we will not have the same powers of inspection.  How will we control that area?  If there is a lower level of scrutiny in non-European jurisdictions, does that cause problems from an industrial point of view for medical device companies in this country?  How is the issue being addressed?</p></speech>

Dr. MacAleenan has recently been appointed to the management board of an international body on medical devices.  We are very pleased about that, as there are just three European nominees - one from France, one from Germany and one from Ireland.</p> <p>If a product is coming in from outside Europe it must still have a CE mark in order to come onto the market in Europe, which requires the company to submit the file to a notified body.  The notified body has the authority and the power to carry out inspections, no matter where the plant is located.  </p><p> On the question of putting any industry here at an advantage or a disadvantage, that is a fundamental part of free trade in Europe and whatever rules apply here have to apply right across Europe.</p></speech>
