I welcome Mr. Hugh Kelly, president of the Irish Exporters Association and chief executive of Associated Marketing Limited, and Ms Nicola Byrne, council members of the association and managing director of Cloud 90.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act, 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

We offer practical help and support to Irish exporters under the following three main pillars: acting as the voice of the Irish export industry; providing practical knowledge; and connecting Irish exporters.  We represent the whole spectrum of companies within the export industry, from indigenous SMEs to global multinational companies.</p>  <p>  There is no sustainable employment without business and there is no business without the entrepreneur.  It is the contention of the Irish Exporters Association that if we want to build a stronger indigenous economy, we need to foster greater entrepreneurship in Ireland.  To encourage an entrepreneurial culture, we must acknowledge and reward the risk takers who have the ability and courage to step away from secure employment to become Ireland&rsquo;s next entrepreneurs and future employers.  These are individuals who are willing to invest their experience and energy in new ventures that offer many possibilities, including the very real possibility of failure.  They are men and women who offer to risk their savings and, very often, mental and physical well being to venture outside their comfort zones in the hope of achieving something exceptional.  Individual success inevitably leads to wider benefits for communities and the country.  It generates employment and higher taxes for the Exchequer and delivers to those who might otherwise be unemployed a strong message that society needs and values them, too.  The benefits of entrepreneurship are far reaching.</p>  <p>  Most entrepreneurs are not solely motivated by money.  If they were, we would have to characterise many Irish entrepreneurs as unsuccessful compared to their peers in the established corporate world.  Among other things, entrepreneurs are motivated by the challenge and desire to make a difference, reach their full potential, provide employment, serve a happy customer and contribute to their community.</p> <p>However, entrepreneurs have families and responsibilities and, like the rest of society, must eat, pay medical bills, house and educate their children and plan for their retirement.  Starting a business carries significant risk to the individual.  If the Government shares our belief in the importance and value of entrepreneurs and is genuine when it says it wishes to foster entrepreneurship, why does it support policies that fail to acknowledge those risks?  Current policies send a very clear message to would-be entrepreneurs, and it is not always one of encouragement, support or appreciation.</p> <p> In addition to all the inherent challenges to be faced in starting a business, entrepreneurs continue to be refused a PAYE tax credit.  If they succeed, their marginal tax rate is 3% higher than that of the rest of society and they must pay capital gains tax of 33% if they try to realise gains.  Our tax legislation encourages families to sell out rather than keep building on through the generations.  If entrepreneurs' businesses stumble, they carry the full cost of redundancies, despite paying hefty employer PRSI contributions, and are provided with no safety net from social welfare.</p> <p> If legislators really want to deliver sustained economic growth, higher exports and lower unemployment, they need to show, not just tell, our entrepreneurs, risk takers, business owners and employers that their efforts are truly appreciated and valued.  The penalties suffered for being an entrepreneur and an employer in Ireland are not only unjust but dangerously undermine one of the very important foundations of wider economic development.  These issues affect all entrepreneurs.  I will hand over to my colleague, Nicola Byrne, who will talk about how these and other challenges affect female entrepreneurship in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700004#H00200"><p>We are not short of data about entrepreneurship.  Reports are coming from every corner and every angle.  Given that members have copies of our presentation, I will speak off script.  I am a high profile female entrepreneur.  I established 11890 in 2006 and before that I had other small businesses, for example I did all the advertising on Eircom telephone boxes.  During that time I have raised three children, now aged 10, 12 and 16.  I have continued to work and now, again, I am stepping into the face of entrepreneurship and feel like a start-up again with our new product.</p>  <p>  The challenges for women are completely different from those of men.  While I was running those businesses and was pregnant, as the leader of the project it was a minefield trying to take on staff who could hold the fort while I was away, or even believing I could afford staff while I was away.  The Government has many policies, such as the latest Momentum scheme which encourages other entrepreneurs to start businesses to take long-term unemployed people and turn them into entrepreneurs.  This is where my debate on entrepreneurs begins.  Why do we want entrepreneurship?  It is a word which embraces much and which many do not understand.  Do we want people who cannot find a job to work for themselves?  Is it because people have a desire to be innovators and want to work for themselves?  The male-female issue does not catch us at the beginning, rather it is the reason we want people to be entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  According to the lip service, people become entrepreneurs because people believe they can work for themselves and do better.  However, for some people, after this recession, there is no choice and entrepreneurship is the only path open to them because no employment matches their skill sets and they need to be retrained and given an opportunity to go back out and work.  While the Momentum policy of taking lots of entrepreneurs off the long-term unemployed lists is brilliant in one way, if there is no other funding available to an unemployed person the guaranteed way for him or her keep all benefits is to become long-term unemployed and stay with his or her long-term benefits for two years after having successfully completed the course.  This is not an equal treatment of entrepreneurship.  A person who leaves a job and sets up a business gets no benefit, reliefs or rewards for the risk.  Yet we have policies to take a different section of society, turn them into entrepreneurs and fund them to the tune of &euro;40,000 per year.</p> <p>I have been on the board of the local enterprise office, and the enterprise boards before that, for a long time.  I also sit on corporate boards.  We see a large female participation rate on enterprise boards and yet the reality is that we still see 60% to 70% of these businesses set up by men because they are export growth.  For the Irish Exporters Association, that is a perfectly valid remit for the enterprise boards.  The reality is that women coming into these enterprise boards want to set up lifestyle businesses and not all of them want to export.  There are no supports for them on the ground.  They set up lifestyle businesses because we have the babies and need nine months out to bring a child into the world and then we need time off afterwards to bond with the child and be with it.  The reality of modern family life is that Mammy is still the centre of family life.  We cannot have Mammy the entrepreneur and Mammy the full-time carer.  It is not realistic because, unless one has an amazing family that is willing to support entrepreneurial adventures, we cannot achieve it.  There is no child care that suits the hours I work.  I leave for a week to go to the United States because the reality is the business needs and there are 70 jobs at stake.  I must find child care that suits the father's lifestyle and my lifestyle in order to make it happen.  I get no help and no support.  If we want female participation, we will have to address this.</p> <p> For every job a female creates, she does it as a last resort.  The evidence shows the last thing women do is recruit.  It is hard enough being responsible for oneself and we force ourselves to recruit thereafter.  The support women need are not necessarily financial but could come in many ways.  There is a huge amount of mentoring and there are so many things open to me as an entrepreneur.  Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Exporters Association, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and others offer support and facilities.  There is a huge amount of networks available but none of them get to the fundamental point that I need help and support with my children when I am away.  It is a reality that is obvious but often we talk around it by pointing out the good cr&egrave;ches.  Tax breaks are available to cr&egrave;ches but not to the parents.  There are facilities for children to be minded in formal, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. arrangements but in the modern 24 hours a day economy means those hours do not suit.  I cannot have a cr&egrave;che closing at 6 p.m because I might not get home until 10 p.m.  I need a different environment and I need to be able to employ people in the environment who are formal child care workers and not in the black economy.  I want to be able to recognise them and support real jobs rather than taking my family and friends and support an economy that exists elsewhere.</p> <p> I have suggested looking at the local enterprise offices and committing to export businesses.  It would be of great support to be able to widen the net rather than turn away applications from people who want to open hairdressers or lifestyle businesses in their communities.  We cannot turn people away when we are the place of last resort.  There are no banks and there is nowhere else to go other than family and friends.  There is no State support.  Other than the Government running a dual system of encouraging the long-term unemployed back, while retaining their benefits, people who walk in and want to genuinely set up have no incentive to do so.  A phrase mentioned to me early in my career was that big risks require big rewards.  Everyone in the economy, after the boom we have just gone through, assumes an entrepreneur is off making gazillions in Silicon Valley.  Technology is only a tiny piece of this.  As a woman in tech, I find it frustrating that, although I do not programme, without technology we could not have created the unique product we have.  We are the only people in the world to have written software to do things where we are doing it.</p> <p> I do not have a degree in technology, nor do I need one.  There are enough resources in the community for female entrepreneurs to be able to employ the talent they need.  What I need as a female in tech is not to be told that I must do an IT degree and mathematics.  We need universities and support in technology but not necessarily in coding.  We all have CoderDojos and we are trying to encourage young girls.  I have two girls and one boy and they are not interested in going into a room of men and coding.</p> <p>It is not their environment.  It is not where they want to be.  It is not where I want to be.  My skills are people, human resources and sales.</p> <p> Women's skills do not necessarily reflect the mathematical nature of men's skills, and we should not be trying to create a community of female technology entrepreneurs.  I have female friends who code.  They are not the majority of my female friends.  My female friends are going to the National Digital Research Centre, NDRC, which has a fabulous concept that teams them up with a programmer.  All the skills they need are met but they do not have to be the source of those skills.  We have to consider that women&rsquo;s role in technology is not as it has been traditionally seen, that if every girl had a science degree and a technology degree they would all be coders and the world would be brilliant.  That would be forcing square pegs into round holes.  As soon as we recognise this we can embrace the talents women do have.  Every piece of technology needs a sales person.  Every piece of code requires somebody to sell it, negotiate it, and recruit the staff.  There are many skill-sets around this that we are not harnessing in women.  As long as we keep throwing money at coding and trying to force women into technology in a way that suits a traditional model it is time to change that model.  It is time to stop trying to compete with silicone valley and bring out one woman in every hundred and say there is one woman who can code and do this.  There are plenty of ways to work in the technology sector that do not require this skill-set.</p> <p> I would like to see a broadening of skill-sets in the universities, start recognising there are many support services that degree courses could be built around.  The fashion at the moment seems to be the more mathematics, science and coding courses we can get our hands on, the better.  There is no sales degree course, unless there might be one in Dublin City University.  There is no direct sales course for women in technology that we could start to harness.  These are real ideas that we could implement very simply.  Female participation could be increased not by the current narrow definitions but by putting women into technology and into a sector where they can be part of the game but not the game politicians see and have been building policies towards.</p> <p> My daughter will go for higher level mathematics.  She is struggling to sit in that class.  We barely got her through junior certificate higher level mathematics.  She is staying in that course because we were warned that with 25 extra points even if she gets a D in her honours maths that is far better than an A+ in her pass maths.  We are rewarding the wrong policies for these young women.  That is the case from education through to employment.  We do not recognise that women bring a different set of skills to the game.  They are not necessarily the skills on the table before the committee.  I have many very successful female entrepreneurs as friends and colleagues.  Our problems are unique but not to women.  They are unique to each business as we face our challenges on the road ahead.  We do take on probably more than we should as females.  Our genetic make-up is flawed.  Our mothering nature will always mean that we are more likely to drop our job and dash home to our children because that is way we have been built, not because that is the way the world has decided it will be.  It is my choice.  Yet, policies reward the wrong behaviour, so at junior and leaving certificate levels the points system encourages us into something.  Why not give 25 extra points for English?  A command of the English language is useful in a sales job.  Why did we take mathematics?  It is because we are building a world that is trying to create programmers and people who think technically.</p> <p> When we get out into the business world and employment, as an entrepreneur I compete.  I lost a staff member recently to a very big multinational.  This staff member was a key part of our organisation but Oracle doubled her salary.  As an entrepreneur I cannot afford to compete in that world.  Multinationals in this country have a lot tax breaks and I have to compete in that market.  I am part of the world they exist in.  I am sore that they get lots of tax breaks and rewards for creating employment and I get none.  I am penalised with an extra 3% in universal social charge, USC, if I break &euro;100,000 in my salary.  I am penalised for no pay as you earn, PAYE.  If I fail I get no tax benefits and there is no social welfare net to catch me.  I am sore about that.  If I had been an employee and chose to take myself out of employment and put myself into entrepreneurship the best route to market is to remain long-term unemployed so that I can maintain my benefits for a further two years to encourage that entrepreneurship.</p> <p>At every point it has been designed for me to fail as a female.  Politicians have done nothing with consistent policies to take it from one end of the game to the other to encourage me to want to work for myself.  Yet, in not doing so, the skills I possess may never reach the market.  All the women in the generations before and behind me have been met with policy after policy with no joined-up thinking except for men and it is a different world.  It is as if we had two standards with one for the behaviour we are trying to get.  It is like trying to get orange juice out of an apple and honestly politicians are failing and failing miserably.</p> <p> What I am suggesting today - I would be happy to take questions - is that we actually go back to the beginning to the school system and we work from education right through to employment.  Members recognise that in the real world, as an entrepreneur, I compete with multinationals.  They get all the breaks; I take all the risks.  They get all the rewards and I get all the pain.  When they fail they lose nothing - they lose faceless money.  When I fail, I lose everything.  I lose dignity.  I lose respect.  I lose my confidence.  I lose everything.  Starting again in this country once one has failed is not the easiest place in the world.  So until politicians start to reward my risk as a female and introduce work policies from beginning to end, women will not to participate in that.  They will opt to stay an employee in a safe job with a multinational and we will lose all the innovation and job creation that goes along with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700007#L00200"><p>I thank Ms Byrne for that.  One could hear a pin drop in the room when she was speaking.  I know Mr. Hugh Kelly from his oration at the Irish Exporters award gala dinner.  He is an excellent public speaker.  I thank them both; it was really fantastic.  My colleagues and I are looking forward to working with them both and also with Mr. Simon McKeever.</p>  <p>  When Connie Doody and I started Lir Chocolates in 1987 in no time at all we came up against this thing about the multinationals, particularly in the years from 1989 to 1992.  Multinationals were paying huge salaries to people coming from the food industry and from universities.  We could not compete with those salaries.  I identify with Ms Byrne completely.  I am talking about the late 1980s and 1990s.  We could not compete with the salaries the multinationals were offering to food graduates.</p>  <p>  The downside was that we were getting a second or third tier, who could not do it as Connie and I could do it.  So we ended up doing all the key management functions ourselves because we could not afford to pay the high rates that the multinationals were paying to super-duper people.  We had to do everything ourselves and that is why we had to work 24/7, but it was a pleasure.</p>  <p>  I got a thrill seeing a person getting a job, thriving in it and developing social skills.  I saw with my own eyes the human tragedy of unemployed people coming to us.  There was huge unemployment then as we had up until recently.  There was 40% unemployment in some parts of the country in the 1980s.</p>  <p>  We ran a matriarchal company.  We interacted with the staff.  They worked as hard as we did.  If we saw one who looked a bit tired we asked, "Do you want to go home?"  We had a woman's way of doing it.  That was the very positive aspect.  However, we definitely could not recruit people into management functions who could do it as well as Connie and I could because we could not compete with the multinationals' salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700007#L00300"><p>That was a very powerful presentation from which I have learnt a lot.  My first question is on general exports.  I have read that Denmark has ten times more exporting companies, both FDI and local, than Ireland has even though it has a similar economy.  I ask the witnesses to cast some light on that.</p>  <p>  The witnesses are right that FDI is given a competitive advantage in this State over indigenous businesses.</p> <p>That is a policy-driven outcome and has not happened by accident.</p> <p> I agree with Mr. Kelly that risk aversion is rewarded in this country to a certain extent through the lack of social protection for sole traders, especially.  Most people who evolve as entrepreneurs do so having started out as sole traders, who are even more exposed.  Has the Government in discussions with the IEA given a reason for not creating the safety net for the self-employed that PAYE workers have?  I regularly meet people in my clinics who say they would not want to be self-employed again because they were toasted previously and there is nothing for them.</p> <p> With regard to child care, can Ms Byrne point to an EU model?  Would this involve the provision of 24 hour care?  Child care is provided 24 hours a day in some states and if people work shifts or difficult hours, they can avail of this.</p> <p> Capital gains tax is an important issue for self-employed people.  There are two types - employment-related and speculation-related.  Can they be separated in order that the Government could promote the lower employment-related tax rate?</p> <p> One of the major arguments is that the State is incentivising individuals to go down the technology route.  A reason for this is the major staff shortages worldwide in technology companies.  Ireland can compete in this area because other countries cannot provide people for those roles.  Traditionally this was one of the reasons we incentivised students to progress through technology.  I acknowledge Mr. Kelly's comments about a points advantage for, say, English but while that benefits the individuals who receive the education, it may not necessarily lead to the challenges faced by the IDA when technology jobs are attracted to the country being addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kelly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700008#M00200"><p>I am no expert on this but I understand the reason for the differences with Denmark is the tax issues we have raised, which do not disincentivise the market.  Linked to that and the capital gains tax question, it is also my understanding that in Germany, for example, where they have managed to build a fantastic family business culture, a business of any size can be passed on without suffering a penalty.  That is not the case here.</p>  <p>  The Government has not given a commitment regarding the safety net.  I have not come across any mention of that.</p>  <p>  As an employer, at one stage I had 12 staff and three were on maternity leave.  I was, therefore, down 25% of my staff.  Female entrepreneurs come out of the experience of working for other people.  I hate to say it and most people do not say it out loud but there is a worry as a small business about taking on women who may have children.  One wants to be supportive of the family.  I have a family and I understand the role my wife plays and how important it is to the family but the lack of support for businesses with ten or fewer people when staff go on maternity leave - which is for a long time and this is positive - is a significant difficulty for the owners.</p> <p>It is an extra challenge when one competes against much larger employers who have the resources to sustain and weather gaps that result from maternity leave.  It is an important challenge that must be overcome.  If some businesses do not take on female employees it will cut off the future supply of female entrepreneurs.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700009#N00200"><p>I shall answer the questions in a different order by first dealing with the query on capital gains tax.</p>  <p>  In terms of capital gains tax, it was assumed that entrepreneurs earn enough to pay the tax.  One cannot make that assumption because 50% of entrepreneurs here barely cover salaries for their organisation and capital gains tax is not the place to start to provide help.  The assumption relates to the old myth that entrepreneurs make so much money that they can afford to pay capital gains tax.  One does not have to separate taxes between speculation and employment.  A problem will not arise because there are so few entrepreneurs in that bracket.  The big four accountancy firms can fix it for the Government but in the real world all the small accountants prepare accounts for small businesses.</p>  <p>  I suggest help is provided by way of tax in the PAYE system.  I also suggest giving an employee grant for every employee taken on which might allow an entrepreneur to pay oneself.  Typically, an entrepreneur pays everybody else first and themselves last.   The chance of earning enough to pay capital gains tax is low.  By the time one has paid back a bank loan, paid PAYE, and paid employer's PRSI and everything else on top of that there is nothing left to pay capital gains tax on.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy was referring to large entrepreneurs that employ 150 people or more and make money - which are few and far between in this country - then I would say, "Fine, you are in the right bracket".  For the entrepreneurs that I am talking about, very few of them will make it into that bracket.  </p>  <p>  The definition of technology is too narrow.  Government policy says we cannot attract jobs but it should dig down to what those jobs actually are.   I reside in EastPoint Business Park and can see every multinational around me.  I work in the heartland of Enterprise Ireland, which is located in the midst of all of its employers, and know there are not too many female coders even in such a place.  For the ones that are there, the definition of technology has become so narrow and comes down to coding.  It means that all the ancillary skills that I would deem to be technology have been written off into some other category as marketing, branding, public relations or whatever.  The definition of technology is too narrow and is the Government's mistake in terms of future jobs.</p>  <p>  The next item is 24-hour child care and supports.  The problem with Ireland is that we have a very small population.  Before I came in here I read in a newspaper that Ireland has one of the highest fertility rates in Europe at 1.99 and that Germany's fertility rate has hit 1.6 or 1.4 but is declining even though it has one of the best child care systems around.  The issue is a tiny bit more complex.  The fairest way is to sort it out at each family's level.  Everyone's circumstances are unique so it would be fairer to give people the money and let them decide what kind of child care suits them best.  It comes back to giving help to the individual at source.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's small economy would not suit a one size fits all child care system.   It would not suit the small business owner in Tullow who has no child care facility available.  It would also be unfair to say that someone like me, who lives in a large urban area, has a choice of child care.  One must bring the measure right back down to the individual.  It would not be difficult to link child care provision with maternity leave.  In this country once a birth is registered one is sent the children's allowance so everything is connected.  There is nothing to stop the Government saying: "We know a child has been registered because we have sent social welfare and children's allowance."  There is nothing to stop the Government linking a child care payment because it knows that a person with a child needs to care for it.  If I can prove I employ people then the Government may be able to increase the allowances thereafter.  If a payment is given at source then a person can choose how to handle child care.  The Government would not be giving me money for nothing; it would be giving me money because I can prove that I want to create jobs and to employ people.</p>  <p>  We must dispense with the mentality that entrepreneurs avoid tax, live in the black economy and do not do anything.  There is a professional category of entrepreneurs.  Whether they are sole traders moving into creating employment or not, it is easy to find out the information, particularly for female entrepreneurs.  The Government will know when a female entrepreneur has a baby so it is not difficult to follow the system along.  The system is well capable of doing so at this point with the technology that is in place throughout government and it is not a mystery. </p>  <p>  The other queries were covered by Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>

We nearly have the document written.  Mr. Kelly and Ms Byrne have put into words what many of us believe, but then it goes to officialdom.  Perhaps we might bring them back when the officials are before the committee.  Mr. Kelly challenged us to show, rather than tell, how good we were.  What exporting country does he see as being the model for sustaining entrepreneurship and providing support for start-ups?</p>  <p>  I agree absolutely with the views of Ms Byrne on there being no support from local enterprise offices for what she termed lifestyle businesses.  The argument relates to displacement.  If I was to set up a company called 118901 beside Ms Byrne's company with the support of Enterprise Ireland and so on, she could justifiably say it was unfair competition.  The same applies to other industries.  What is Ms Byrne's view?  Would she let the market win?</p>  <p>  We have made this point before, but I am keen to tease it out a little.  Ms Byrne said there was no such thing as a sales course or a course in selling available in Ireland.  Will she expand on that statement?  Is there nothing on offer in the institutes of technology on how to sell?</p></speech>

I know this because I went looking to see if I could send staff members to attend such a course.  I was trying to recruit sales staff and looking for a course that would offer me a channel or pipeline.  I went on an exploratory mission to see what I could find, but there was nothing available at degree level.  Recently, a course has become available as an add-on or an adjunct.  There are numerous modules, in which sales is included, but there was nothing available focused on selling.  It is just one of those things in a nation like ours which relies on exporting its people, as well as services.  As we all have them naturally, there may be an assumption that we do not need to learn such skills or qualify in any meaningful way.  I will look up the exact details.  This was the case one or two years ago and it is my recollection that there is only one degree course which is run in DCU.  I could be wrong and things might have moved on subsequently, but at the time there was no sales course available.  I was fascinated and a little shocked to learn that it was not a skill we associated with degrees.  It is a skill that is necessary in every business.  I had thought the most obvious thing in the world would have been to provide such a degree course.</p>  <p>  Deputy Dara Calleary referred to displacement.  I do not think it is displacement.  What happens is that we have people who have no job and no ability to create employment.  The market could sustain some fair competition.  It is said the best way to set up a business is to take an existing business and do it better.  That is the rule of thumb.  If I was in a room full of people learning about entrepreneurship and asked whether they should invent something, I would tell them to take an existing business and do it better.  The idea is to open a shop next to another or a hairdressing salon next to another because that is what constitutes market forces.  Setting up a new business in a field ten miles away from the nearest business is not the solution; we need to create healthy competition.  If we are to stay competitive and keep prices down, the more competition we can bring to the market, the healthier it will be.</p>  <p>  I do not think it is unfair.  However, it is unfair to build a nation in which there is no equity or humanity so as to leave people unemployed and at home without dignity or telling them that there is nothing we can do for them and that they should figure it out for themselves.  We should respect the fact that we can actually share the country together, as opposed to leaving a cohort of society disadvantaged, unemployed and sitting at home.  Many people would have a go at something if the risk of failure or losing the dole and so on was not as great.  If that were the case, we would have completely different behaviour, but that is a personal view.</p>  <p>  The third question was about exporters.  I will allow Mr. Kelly to answer that question.  I will pass on the hard questions posed.</p></speech>

We need to draw a distinction between entrepreneurship and sustainable entrepreneurship.  The Irish have proved that they are entrepreneurial.  We need only consider all of the entries in the BT Young Scientist competition and so on.  We are entrepreneurial and great inventors.  The problem is sustaining it.  The problem is not in selling or giving it away to multinationals; we should instead be the inventors.  I am keen to see Ireland become a country in which we can build a business, pass it from generation to generation and provide long-term employment, rather than one in which, if a person is fortunate enough to have equity in an idea, he or she will get to the point where his or her primary concern is the rate of capital gains tax on its disposal.</p> <p>I prefer to see one incentivised to keep it.</p> <p> I also wish to comment on sales courses.  I, too, have struggled to find anybody with good sales training.  There appears to be a believe that we have the gift of the gab in this country and there is not much more to be taught.  It is a science, especially as we move forward with the use of technology.  There is a cultural issue with getting people to go on sales courses.  I recall when I eventually saw such a course launched, it was a sales management course.  It was as if everybody was above a sales course and it would have to be a sales management course.  We must have selling courses.  I give credit where it is due to Enterprise Ireland in terms of export selling.  It runs some excellent courses in export.  I believe they are called "Excel at Export Selling" sales courses and they are very good, but we must conduct such courses for selling domestically as well.  The same science applies.  The courses through Enterprise Ireland are only available to indigenous Irish exporters and their staff.</p></speech>

Ms Byrne speaks with a powerful voice to express herself very well.  I was a little concerned to hear the comments that there were tax breaks for multinationals, but not for nationals.  Will she elaborate on this and explain it?  Certainly, I got a jolt when the Minister, in the middle of the Budget Statement, referred to the different tax rates and said that the highest tax would be on the self-employed.  It appeared to be a discrimination.  It is almost telling people to stay with their nine-to-five jobs because there is a discrimination against them should they open their own business.  That is something we must confront.</p>  <p>  The other matter that jolted me was at the beginning of Ms Byrne's contribution.  When she said that women have babies and families and men do not, was she suggesting there should be a positive discrimination against men or in favour of women?  I am not sure if it is the case but there appeared to be a danger that she was saying that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015012700011#P00300"><p>I will cover the universal social charge, USC, because that is the one I almost took personally.  Over the years our business has gone from 110 jobs to approximately 70, and there are many part-time workers included in that.  When the USC was announced, I thought the Minister must be kidding.  It is as if he segregated a part of society and said: "You have worked your butt off for eight years and you might get to the point where your salary might just barely tip that".  Then I thought of my 26 year old employee who might go off to earn close to that figure as an employee for a multinational.  However, I have taken all of this pain and risk, but the Government goes out of its way to create a category that targets just me.  I thought, "You must be kidding me".</p>  <p>  The Government's policy is for the IDA to bring multinationals into the country.  We seek to put packages and deals together to entice them to this country to create the jobs.  We need all of that and I am not seeking that we discriminate against it.  I do not wish to have anybody remove anything we are currently doing.  However, the Government must be realistic.  It expects 10% to 15% of people to employ themselves in this country - there are 700,000 people who work for themselves - and that is a large amount of the population.  It has basically told them that there is a tax just to attack them if they earn more than &euro;100,000 and are working for themselves.  At the same time, the IDA is going abroad and bringing in business with millions of euro worth of tax breaks and lower cost premises, on the basis of a guarantee of 2,000 jobs.  One must wonder why one has been discriminated against.  One is a citizen, one has paid taxes all one's life and one has done nothing but work.  One pays tax into the tax system, pays one's VAT returns every month, pays one's PAYE and so forth, then the Government introduces a special section just to get at that person.  I have a big issue with all the Government's policies to tax self-employed people.  It is not just USC, but a rake of things such as no pension, no health cover and no unemployment benefit after it all fails.  I do not understand the reason for it.</p>  <p>  With regard to positive discrimination, I would love to tell the Senator that I am equal to a man.</p> <p>I would be the first to say I am, but I think I am even a little better.  The reason I say this is I have three kids and believe I can do something no man can do and that this is quite special.  This is not because I chose to be the female, but because I am a female.  It was not a choice; I was born this way.  I believe this is a gift I have been given.  I cannot change my nature.  I would love to say: "There is my child.  Please breastfeed it."  I would love to hand it over and let somebody else do it, but that is not possible in the real world.</p> <p> I believe I need a little positive discrimination that recognises it is not that I do not have the brain capacity to be a super employee, super entrepreneur or super mother, but that I have made a choice to try to do something a little different and to push my limits out a little further, a by-product of which is that I create employment.  I would like to see some positive discrimination because I have taken the effort to take that risk and would like some reward for that.  I would like it to be acknowledged that I am not a multinational and that from nothing, I have had a payroll for 70 people for the past eight years.  I would like this to be acknowledged in some way.  Therefore, I would like some positive discrimination.</p> <p> At the beginning of this meeting, I was not advocating for that, but now that the question has been asked, I believe all females would like some positive discrimination.  That would be very nice.</p></speech>

This has been an interesting exchange and it is important they attended this committee to highlight some of the issues we should focus on.  I support them strongly in their grievance that self-employed persons would be penalised if they earn more than &euro;100,000 while somebody who works for the State or a company and earns a salary of over &euro;100,000 is not discriminated against in the same way.  There is no reason this should happen and it is certainly a disincentive to people becoming entrepreneurs.  We want to do everything possible to promote entrepreneurship and to encourage as many people as possible to take that risk.</p>  <p>  Following the collapse of the construction sector, many of those who had taken risks and employed significant numbers of people found that following the collapse of their business, their employees were in a position to get social welfare while those who took the risk and put their livelihoods and resources on the line got nothing from the State unless they were almost destitute.  After being means tested some of them got some employment assistance, but if their spouses were working, there was a limit to what they could get.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The witnesses mentioned there was no support through the LEOs for lifestyle businesses, but pointed to the fact that somebody on social welfare who was starting a lifestyle business would have their social welfare payment protected for up to two years.  Can they suggest how that anomaly might be addressed or how it could be dealt with?</p></speech>

There are so many solutions that I am not sure one solution would fit all.  With the MOMENTUM programme, the Government is doing a superb job and hats off to it on that.  The people involved are incredible.  For many of those who were involved in construction who have found themselves unemployed, this is their opportunity to go back and follow a dream they have always had.  These people are motivated and determined to create employment for themselves.</p>  <p>  With regard to people who want to work for themselves and to make that worthwhile, the reason the situation is more complex for women is that if they are home with their child, whether a single mother or not, and decide they want to return to work, the complication of child care has a particular effect on that person.</p> <p>They have been at home and have to make a significant choice.  Going back to work without a safety net and losing all benefits immediately is not viable.  Bills have to be paid.  For males and females, it is very difficult and if one does not put a safety net in place, people will not show innovation and will continue to live in a welfare context that encourages them to stay in it rather than to leave.  The solution is a mix of child care services, tax reliefs and supports.  It is not a simple solution because people who have jobs and whose taxes are going towards paying for this may look at it in a very negative way.  They will say they have taken jobs all their lives and taken no risks but now see their tax money being taken to pay for the person mentioned.  However, everyone would benefit as a member of society.  When we there was full employment, we had a vibrant and rich economy.  If we could recreate it, the tide would rise for everybody.</p> <p> There is a danger that after the Celtic tiger, we have castigated everyone, not just those who took silly risks.  Not everyone went off on the construction lunatic risk tangent.  There were some very hard working people who, through no fault of their own, lost their businesses because of the downturn in the economy.  We cannot brandish that one brush across everybody's failures.  There are different types of failure and different reasons for it.  The problem is for people sitting on the outside having never taken a risk in looking at what they consider to be all of these cowboy entrepreneurs.  They often risk everything for us, but they are branded in the same way when it is not true.  There are some really amazing entrepreneurs who were hurt and never had the chance to take their talents back out again as there is no safety net and no way to put them back out.  A multidisciplinary approach to solving the problem is required.</p></speech>

I welcome, from the Association of Irish Local Government, Councillor Padraig McNally, president and cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council; Councillor Colm Brophy, vice-president, whom I know from my previous incarnation as a councillor on South Dublin County Council; Councillor Sinead Guckian, member of the executive committee and also a member of Leitrim County Council; and Councillor Damien Geoghegan, member of the executive committee and also a member of Waterford City and County Council.</p> <p>From the county council group, I welcome Mr. Tim Lucey, chief executive, Cork County Council; Mr. John O&rsquo;Neill, director of planning, Cork County Council; Mr. Richard Keating, senior executive officer, property and management, Cork County Council; Mr. Andrew Hind, senior planner, Cork County Council; Mr. Frank Curran, chief executive, Leitrim County Council; and Mr. Jim Keogan, assistant chief executive, Dublin City Council.<br/>From the Local Authority Members Association, I welcome Councillor John Sheahan, Limerick City and County Council, Councillor Sean McGower, Leitrim County Council, Councillor Bobby O'Connell, general secretary, Kerry County Council and Councillor Noel Bourke, Offaly County Council.<br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has requested the committee to scrutinise the heads of the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill 2014 and to report to him on it prior to its publication.  The committee has already met with officials from the Department, as well as representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, the Housing Agency and the Irish Planning Institute.  It has also received written submissions on the issue from several other organisations.<br/>I call on Mr. Padraig McNally, president, Association of Irish Local Government, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We bring to the table the experiences of elected local authority members for whom planning related issues are a central concern in their work as public representatives.  With the possible exception of roads, there is no other local government issue which generates so much of a councillor&rsquo;s workload as planning.  That planning law and practice is an ever-evolving area is underlined by the fact that the Bill under discussion is the latest in a series of legislative Acts brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas since the first Planning and Development Act in 1963.</p>  <p>  The committee will notice a diversity of viewpoints in our presentations today.</p> <p>This reflects the reality that our members represent a great variety of planning environments across the country.  Some of our members are rooted in Ireland at its most rural, where councillors are working to sustain communities badly in need of new development of all kinds.  Yet more of our members are based in city centre or inner suburban communities where there are extensive vacant or brownfield sites which could prove a viable solution to the demand for more housing sites in such urban locations.<br/>Therefore, the Association of Irish Local Government<b></b>represents a broad church and essentially our role is to act as a conduit of opinion and information from elected members and how they see the new Bill in terms of its contribution to their communities.  This can lead to quite different viewpoints as regards the individual amendments specified in the new Bill.  This is not as a result of a difference of opinion, rather it indicates our determination to ensure that the Bill does not become a &quot;one size fits all&quot; piece of legislation but rather has the flexibility to enable local government to do what it does best &ndash; plan for the circumstances unique to the locality in question whether that be a rural, suburban or urban locality.<br/>Having said that, the association appreciates the intention of the Bill which, among other initiatives, is to bring clarity to the operation of what are termed the Part V requirements regarding the provision of social and affordable housing by developers.  There is also a welcome for the provisions designed to prompt the resumption of construction on land areas zoned for housing where construction is not actively under way arising from the wide variety of circumstances &ndash; some of them outside of the planning remit such as the availability of finance and mortgages.  Similarly, the Bill also has relevance to what are termed &quot;brownfield sites&quot; where sites in inner urban areas lie unused representing a loss in terms of the public investment in utilities which serve such central urban areas.<br/>We would now like to make some specific points regarding individual measures in the heads of Bill as published.  I wish to draw attention to the provisions on voluntary housing agencies in Part V.  We feel they carry out a very important function, however, there is a need for greater regulation of them.  We need more joined-up thinking by the voluntary housing agencies with local authorities and other bodies in trying to solve the problem of housing.<br/>Issues may evolve as a result of our discussion with the joint committee.  We as an organisation would be willing to meet at short notice if that would benefit the committee's examination of the plan.<br/>I now hand over to the vice president of the Association of Irish Local Government, Mr. Colm Brophy, who will make specific points on the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill.</p></speech>

There are a number of aspects which we are very happy to see and welcome.  I would like to comment on one aspect from the association's perspective.  Part V deals with social and affordable housing, the removal of the reference to "affordability" is something that we believe needs to be looked at and examined, in particular we want to flag the situation that affordability of houses is still an issue for a large number of people who are looking to get on the housing ladder.  While fully recognising the major fall in house prices and the changes during the past number of years, for many people in employment and looking to get on the first step of the housing ladder, affordability is still an issue.  We believe the issue of affordability should be looked at in the context of addressing the question of housing.</p>  <p>  We broadly welcome the reduction of the threshold of social housing from 20% to 10%.  This is a welcome measure and should incentivise developments.  However, while we recognise that at the heart is the need to have integrated developments, we think that extra flexibility in terms of the location of social housing should be looked at.  As part of the remit of the local authority, the elected members could have a role in this if that is their view.</p> <p>Local authorities might take the view that it is preferable to locate the social housing element in an area that is accessible to public transport and has more direct amenities.  That type of flexibility should be strengthened in the context of preserving the desirability of integrated social housing alongside privately owned homes.  Where a local authority can make a better area available for social housing, in terms of amenities and services, it should be allowed the flexibility to act accordingly in conjunction with the developer.</p></speech>

I will make particular reference to head 5, which enables local authorities to incentivise the development of vacant sites.  As is clear from our written submission, our members acknowledge the good intentions behind this proposal.  There are vacant sites in the centre of towns in every county.  They are not only unsightly but they also hinder our development plans.  Most councils outside of the largest urban centres are trying to bring life and vibrancy back to the smaller town centres.  A core objective of our county development plans and local area plans is to seek the development of the lands we have zoned.  In that regard we broadly welcome the proposed levy.  We also welcome the proposal that the introduction of levies will be decided locally as a reserved function under the development plans.  As we believe in retaining and strengthening local democracy, we would like to see a greater emphasis on allowing decisions to be made at a local level where this is possible.</p>  <p>  While the vacant site levy will have the greatest impact on large urban centres like Dublin, the proposed population threshold of 3,000 means that it will have limited applicability in smaller counties.  In my own county of Leitrim, the only town that meets the criteria is Carrick-on-Shannon.  That means many towns and large villages around the county will get no benefit from this provision.  I am sure that will be the situation in other counties.  In regard to the potential for implementing the levy in Carrick-on-Shannon, the land that we would like to see developed, which is in the centre of the town, is likely to be exempted under the provision as proposed because parts of it are tied up with title or financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  We were unable to ascertain from the heads how agricultural land would be treated in respect of towns with a population of more than 3,000.  Carrick-on-Shannon is more than 400 years old and history as much as local government has dictated its development plan.  In our case, agricultural land is zoned "general", which permits agricultural use.  However, the introduction of the vacant sites levy may put the land into a grey area.  By taking out a pocket of land, would the council open up the possibility of other land owners coming forward to make a case for their own properties?</p>  <p>  From the perspective of implementing the levy in a more rural county, very few local authorities have managed to overcome the obstacles to implementing the derelict sites levy.  We are concerned that the introduction of a vacant site levy would face similar obstacles.</p> <p>There are concerns about whether local authorities would have the resources or expertise to carry out the work to introduce any levy.  There is a question about how local authorities would be expected to establish the status of sites.  I imagine many committee members are aware that many sites can have complex ownership or legal questions.  Our members have suggested that each planning department would need dedicated properly-resourced enforcement offices and officers to carry out any implementation of a vacant site levy.</p></speech>

Leitrim County Council, Cork County Council and Dublin City Council were asked to do a presentation.  We have presented a paper which we believe encapsulates a range of issues from the three authorities.  The authorities cover a rural area, a rural and urban area combined, Cork county, as well as the urbanised area of Dublin city.  We are presenting on behalf of the County and City Management Association in this regard.  We will make one presentation but we are open to the participation of the representatives of the three authorities.</p></speech>

The document is presented primarily as an aide to the committee.  It presents a range of matters which we believe require consideration by the committee prior to finalisation of the legislation.  The presentation is based on the experiences of officials in the three authorities as they relate to the practical application of the existing legislation as well as in consideration of any implementation matters that might arise in respect of the proposed vacant sites levy and the modification of planning permission legislation.</p>  <p>  Our practical experience primarily relates to working with Part V legislation and development contributions.  Rather than present a commentary on the proposed legislation we have taken the approach of setting out issues that we believe require to be addressed.  We have listed some practical matters that might be of benefit to the committee's deliberations.</p>  <p>  We will set out some observations on the proposals in the areas of Part V and development contributions.  We will also highlight, particularly in respect of Cork County Council and Dublin City Council, how the Part V legislation has been of benefit.</p>  <p>  The achievements of the existing Part V legislation have been manifold.  The Cork county joint housing strategy initially set a 5% social housing figure and a 15% affordable housing figure.  This was changed to a 10% social figure and 10% affordable figure in 2009.  It responded to the demand at the time.  This has been the case in all local authorities in that the Part V legislation has allowed us to respond flexibly to the demands and economic conditions in each authority.</p>  <p>  The scheme was widely applied throughout Cork county on zoned land and through development boundaries and smaller settlements.  In summary, some of the achievements in Cork county include the delivery of 460 social built units, 1,208 affordable built units, four land parcels and 13 individuals service sites.  Significantly, we believe, the scheme delivered &euro;16.2 million in financial contributions.  This money was then used for the purposes of aiding the delivery of housing thereafter.  In the case of Dublin City Council, a total of &euro;7.8 million in financial contributions has been paid, while the council acquired 1,177 units.  This breaks down into 812 affordable units and 356 social units on two sites.  In the case of both these authorities and in Leitrim some outstanding agreements are in place but they are not yet completed due to the inability of the authorities to fund the acquisitions at the moment.</p>  <p>  The existing legislation is of critical importance.  The delivery from that legislation demonstrates that the outturns reflect the good working relationship between the local authorities, developers and the Construction Industry Federation in implementing the Part V legislation.  I believe this view is accepted generally by the CIF.  Although the federation may have a different view I believe it has worked well.</p>  <p>  One question that requires consideration on foot of the proposed legislation is that while the immediate requirement for affordable housing may be diminished there may be a renewed requirement in future as the market develops.  It is likely that as prices increase in the market, wages may not increase to the same extent.  This creates issues for the model upon which the affordability of housing will be achieved.</p> <p>Is it reasonable or prudent to apply a 10% Part V requirement across the board, that is, equally to all authorities?  Cork County Council's current Part V requirement in our adopted development plan, having looked at the model of housing and the model of affordability, is 14% social and 0% affordable.  In the case of Leitrim it is 12.5% social and 0% affordable.  That is on foot of extensive analysis of the various criteria impacting on affordability in particular.  Therefore, is it reasonable to apply a simple 10% across each authority and thus take away the local decision making which reflects local conditions?</p> <p> The continuation of the role of financial contributions as an option requires careful consideration and must consider key factors.  Where a development has fewer than nine units it will not deliver anything under the proposed legislation.  Sites where 10% results in a fraction of a unit or units arising must be considered.  Will there be a social housing need in all areas?  In other words, there might be areas in local authorities where there is not a social need to the extent that could be met by the delivery of houses.  In addition, in many cases 10% might only yield a small supply in rural areas, particularly as the proposal is to apply Part V only to ten or more unit developments.</p> <p> Increasing the exclusion threshold from four to nine is not recommended for smaller counties such as Leitrim, where the majority of housing developments will have potentially fewer than nine units.  It is understood that the proposed threshold provides consistency in the context of the proposed social housing obligation of 10%.  However, as I said earlier, in the case of Leitrim its social obligation in its adopted plans is 12.5%.</p> <p> Another significant factor will be the availability of funding to enable the purchase of Part V units into the future.  That is linked with the fact that the proposed options in the legislation provide for compliance of Exchequer funding at the time of validation of planning applications.  This might result in difficulties if the national finances at a time of completion of units cannot meet the commitments that were made at the time of validation of planning applications.</p> <p> Some issues arise in respect of valuation and price calculation.  This comes from the practical application of the existing legislation.  These require clarification in the legislation and involve matters such as the format for payment and the calculation of price.  The concept of a nominal sum should be removed completely.  The definition of existing use value requires elaboration and clarification.  How would lease to rent accommodation be valued?  There may be a difficulty with excluding the value of existing buildings that are to be demolished.  These are just some practical implications of the legislation in terms of its application if it were adopted.</p> <p> Circular 11/12 of 2012, dated 29 February 2012, from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government advised that, in negotiating agreements under section 96, Part V obligations should be discharged through mechanisms that place no additional funding pressures on authorities.  This led to arrangements being made to accept financial contributions in compliance with Part V requirements.  Is it the intention of the new section that these commitments be retrospectively revisited and replaced by one of the proposed options?</p> <p> We would be supportive of the concept of the vacant sites levy.  However, some issues arise.  The principle of a vacant or under-utilised sites levy is worthy of consideration, especially if applied within larger urban areas.  The process that is set out appears to be unnecessarily long and protracted and, as a result, may prove to be administratively challenging and incapable of delivering the desired results expeditiously.  The definition of areas to which this is to apply requires careful consideration.  There is reference to a reliance being placed on the definition "census towns", and this could exclude a number of large urban areas in County Cork, for example, Ballincollig, Glanmire, Douglas, and other urbanised areas.  There are significant urbanised areas that would have sites to which this proposed vacant sites levy would be applicable, but in the published Central Statistics Office, CSO, data they are not classified as "census towns".</p> <p> Questions also arise as to whether it is intended to apply this to greenfield land identified for urban expansion on the periphery of towns and cities and whether the lower threshold of a population of 3,000 is too high.  Another issue is the definition of under-utilised.  For example, is farming land on the edge of a town location under-utilisation?  Is application of the levy on private land ownership alone reasonable?  The categories for exemption require clarification in that regard.</p> <p>Is there a role for the vesting of sites that remain under-utilised after a prolonged period and where the levy remains unpaid?  The combination of matters and circumstances being considered under the hardship clause could also, we believe, severely limit the potential application of the provision.  Too large a proportion of developers and landowners may use this provision, which may render the provision ineffective in its application.</p> <p> On the head covering the reduced development contributions on permissions not commenced, a table in the submission we forwarded to the committee in advance shows an example of the benefits that arose from the general, special and supplementary schemes that were adopted by Cork County Council.  For example, in 2006, those combined development contribution schemes delivered &euro;57.4 million to Cork County Council for the provision of infrastructure.  In 2007, the amount delivered was &euro;58.8 million.  This amount has dropped at this time.  In 2013, it was down to &euro;3.2 million, reflecting construction activity.  It should be noted in this regard that the entirety of this funding was expended on capital infrastructure projects of benefit to the county and to the development of a significant supply of housing, office and other development over that period.  Without that level of contribution, the Exchequer would have been required to fund this level of investment in infrastructure provision in support of economic growth.  Therefore, there is a significant issue in regard to how infrastructure which aids economic growth is to be funded into the future, in the event there is a significant or further reductions in development contributions.</p> <p> As an example of adjustments made already to some of the schemes, most authorities across the country have made adjustments to reduce development contributions, reflecting the guidelines issued by the Minister approximately 12 months ago.  In Cork county for example, indexation of 8% per annum was suspended from 1 January 2009, water and sewerage contributions were reduced by 50% for non-residential developments with planning decisions made on or after 1 January 2011 and also in respect of developments permitted prior to 1 January 2011 and to commence in 2011.  Warehousing charges for other non-residential developments were reduced by a further 50% for water and sewerage services in respect of similar planning decisions.  Horticulture enclosed development and intensive animal husbandry charges for other non-residential uses were reduced by a further 50%.  Clearly, with Irish Water having been established from 1 January 2014, water and sewerage elements of the general scheme are no longer applied by the local government sector.  In regard to the supplementary scheme, which supported the development of suburban rail from Cork to Midleton, the charges on office type development within 1 km of that rail line have been reduced from &euro;92.82 to &euro;52.00 per square metre, with effect from 1 January 2014.  These are just examples of how Cork County Council is dealing with the situation and reflects the position across the country in regard to how local authorities have responded to the issue of the impact of development contributions on development.</p> <p> Key issues that may require consideration on foot of consideration of the current proposed legislation include the issue that in order to release housing land, for example in the metropolitan area of County Cork, significant infrastructural development is required, particularly in the area of non-national roads.  Therefore, the local authority and that sector across the country needs access to capital funding to initiate works to secure the supply and release of land for housing.  This is a significant and pressing issue in metropolitan Cork and is an example of what will be replicated throughout the country in terms of the pressures on local authorities to provide infrastructure to support development.</p> <p> In the same way, funding is also required to ensure that new residential neighbourhoods are provided with appropriate recreation and commercial facilities at an early stage in their development.  The proposals, as set out in the legislation, will be difficult to implement in areas where verification of what is sold or unsold required.  It is difficult and resource intensive to inspect all partially completed developments on ongoing basis.  The status of units owned by a developer but let for rent also requires consideration.</p> <p> In regard to the section on modification of planning permissions and permissions part of which have not commenced, we list a range of issues that may require consideration.  The first issue concerns whether it would be constitutional to have a "use it or lose it" policy.  We put this as a question.  Would the proposed legislation be akin to the current section 35 provision, where planning permission can be refused due to past failures to develop?  However, it is extremely difficult to implement or enforce this.</p> <p> The provision as set out is predicated on each developer outlining a development schedule at planning application stage. </p> <p>The question arises as to whether this is reasonable and-or binding.  It is not so provided and may be difficult to implement.  The provision for the extension of the duration of an appropriate period seems to conflict with this provision and requires consideration and clarification.  This provision might work best in the case of sites in the centre of large urban areas in a buoyant market.  There may be a potential adverse effect on the supply of housing by calling into question the duration of permissions granted, thus creating a level of uncertainty in the decision-making process surrounding the funding and activation of development.</p> <p> It is hoped the aforementioned matters which are based on the practical experience of officials across the three local authorities in working to support development under the current legislative provisions will be of value to the committee in its deliberations.</p></speech>

I am PRO of LAMA and joined by my colleagues Councillor Bobby O'Connell, general secretary, and Councillor Sean McGowan, assistant secretary.  The Local Authority Members Association was founded in 1980 and is a prescribed organisation working on behalf of local authority members.  Our membership is made up of members from all 31 local authorities, while our executive is made up of a representative from each authority to give us an inclusive and holistic representation of councillors on the front line of local government.<br/>LAMA welcomes the general scheme of the planning and development legislation and support efforts to kick-start growth and jobs in the construction industry.  To date, planning in Ireland has been retrospective and policy has been changed or adapted to react to the needs of a changing society.  We zoned massive tracts of lands in boom times in the belief demand would continue at unrealistic levels.  Proper planning can only be achieved when the proper infrastructure is put in place, including water supply, waste water treatment facilities and connectivity with the services a modern society like Ireland requires.<br/>The general scheme proposes to retain Part V but reduce the percentage of social housing required from 20% to 10%.  It is also proposed that the 10% be provided in actual social housing units, rather than as land or money, as was previously the case.  This is positive and LAMA supports it.  We also welcome the closing of loopholes, whereby money in lieu of social houses was acceptable.  The last policy failed in this respect, with less than 2% of social housing having been provided nationally since Part V was introduced.  A Part V style provision needs constant monitoring.  Provision should be properly dispersed throughout developments and thought given to flexibility within the relevant percentage so as to accommodate future demand.  What works in large cities may not work in rural areas and <i>vice versa</i>.<br/>A vacant site levy is to be applied to vacant sites in towns with populations over 3,000.  The vacant site levy should be tied with development plans and local area plans.  Currently, local area plans are for towns with populations of 5,000 or more.  This should be the starting point for the levy, as lands in towns without plans have no structure outside the core strategy policy.  A provision should be inserted into the Bill to cover <i>force majeure</i>cases in relation to sites where an owner has fallen on hard times or is suffering from ill health.  No site should be developed just to avoid a levy and each site's case should stack up in the interests of proper and sustainable planning.  Levies collected should be ring-fenced for the regeneration of the centre of the town in which they are collected.<br/>We welcome the changes to have reduced development contributions in the interests of supporting the kick-starting of developments with existing planning permission.  With this change, more favourable contributions under new development contribution schemes could be applied to developments with current live permission.</p> <p>We also ask that support be given to developments that lead to manufacturing jobs in local communities and that these be exempt from any development contribution. </p> <p> I now turn to the modification of the duration of planning permissions.  The "use it or lose it" principle will allow local authorities to remove planning permission from a developer if he or she does not use it.  Permissions granted prior to 1976 were for life, but post-1976 the five-year permission rule applied.  Permissions should still last for five years, but in the case of large developments a planning schedule from the developer containing commencement dates, phasing proposals for building and proposed finishing dates should be agreed with the local authority.  If these are not adhered to, planning permission could be removed.  We recommend this schedule be put in place two years into the life of the permission and work similarly to seeking permission consequent for developments with outline planning permissions.  As local area plans are reviewed every six years, five-year planning permissions should still suffice.  </p> <p> We thank the committee for its time and hope our concerns will be taken into account in framing the Bill.  We also request feedback on our presentation and welcome questions from members of the committee.  Part 2 of the Bill deals with the introduction of a planning regulator.  We have views and concerns in this respect and would welcome an opportunity to relate them to the committee at some stage in the future.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the overlap between the Government's announcement last November on the provision of social housing and the amount of funding supposedly tied with it. Listening to the county manager in Cork talk about funding, infrastructural deficits and negative aspects such as its inability to meet the demands placed on it, I wonder what consultation has taken place between the Local Authority Members Association and the Department on the provisions to deliver that element of the social housing policy that is at the forefront of the Government's mind when one thinks it is to spend in the region of &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion.  If it is the case that the association does not believe many local authorities will be in a position to meet the demands placed on them because of the deficits, how are the two combined to deliver where there has been a failure to do so in the past?</p>  <p>  The other point I want to make to local authorities and representatives of management and the executive concerns how successful they believe the enforcement offices within the various local authorities have been in enforcing, reviewing and contributing to better planning legislation, given that it is my considered opinion that they were not adequately resourced or funded, in monetary and personnel terms, to enforce planning legislation the way it should have been enforced in the past.  Many have looked at the failings in oversight and signing off, to which local authorities were central.  They, including management, have an obligation to have an enforcement office in place to have the oversight needed and reflect the thrust of planning legislation.  I do not believe that was the case in the past and I have not heard local authorities coming out loudly, clearly and forcefully enough in the meantime to ensure the issue will be addressed in the future.  I am surprised that issue has not been mentioned.  </p>  <p>  My other point concerns the vacant site levy.  If the example of the derelict site levy is anything to go by, huge improvements must be made.  Again, there have been failings on the part of local authorities, particularly management, to advise members to deal with these issues appropriately.  In my time on a local authority I saw no success in addressing the obvious dilapidation in many towns and villages, as Councillor Guckian said, despite the best intentions of members to achieve success.</p> <p>The excuse, either stated or withheld, was that local authorities did not have the resources to deal with the legal issues and bring them to a successful conclusion.  Again I have not heard the local authority management or executives coming out and identifying the deficiency and saying how it might be improved.  I am disappointed that I have not heard it today either.  I hope the witnesses will identify the deficiencies in a succinct and straightforward manner in which the members can achieve the wishes of the people who give them the privilege to sit in the chambers throughout the country.  That issue was left behind and it is vital at this stage to deal with it in view of the way that towns and villages have deteriorated during the bad times.  They will continue to be left behind if collective action is not taken to address those issues.</p> <p> I take the point made by the Local Authority Members Association on the caps on populations.  That is right and proper.  It is a case of horses for courses.  County Leitrim was described as a case in point and that is replicated throughout the country.  There should not be a national figure of a population threshold of 3,000 that is applied across the board.  That is leaving many small towns and villages behind.  I hope the Department does not think the vacant site levy will be a revenue generating exercise, which is what has been made of the local development contributions in the past.  There is an expectation, rightly or wrongly, on the part of management to believe that some funding can be generated from this source because we generated money in the past.  Again it is horses for courses.  We are in a new situation, whereby that stream of funding is not available to most local authorities, and most definitely not to rural local authorities.  I know the situation has improved and is improving in the cities and large towns, but that is not the case in most local authorities.  Again, the vacant site levy should not be viewed as a revenue generating exercise.  I hope the Department will be conscious of that when bringing forward new planning laws.</p> <p> The various exemptions to the planning laws needs to be teased out more.  I understand that many landholders are in the position that they cannot commit to developing the land, as much as they may wish to, because of financial difficulties and liens on the property from other institutions.</p> <p> Land that is zoned for agricultural use should not come into play.  The local authority members, in conjunction with the local authority management, devise development plans every six years.  I am sure the planners, management and local authority members are in tune with their area when they are devising the new development plan.  We all know the procedures for making changes to the development plan.  If land is zoned as agricultural land, one cannot expect to see it developed for residential or commercial use.  We have all learned lessons from lands being developed on the edge of towns, when lands were rezoned for commercial use.  This has added to the problem of dilapidation and a dearth of activity in town centres.  I expect that in the time that remains we would hear some specific recommendations or opinions on how we revitalise our towns and villages throughout the country.  I brought forward a paper to my party in recent times.  This is an issue that must be tackled.  If the Bill offers an opportunity to deal with the lack of life and vitality in towns, which is very debilitating, we should all take it on board.  I know that local authorities have a role in the setting of rates.  Provision must be made in legislation to give local authorities an opening to be more imaginative in addressing issues, as well as in the planning and development legislation.</p> <p>We should be seeking ways and means in which we allow people to live and reside in these areas to bring back some vitality to them.  Having done that, the opportunity will then arise for other ways to encourage civic activity in those areas.  I thank the delegations for their presentations.  We will digest and investigate them further over the coming weeks before we finalise our own recommendations to the Minister and the Department.  I hope they will not take offence from anything that I said earlier as we are all working in the best interests of all those we represent.  That is our duty and our role.  This process is about teasing out issues to better the legislation and to make it more appropriate to the needs of the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Lucey" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700013#P00200"><p>Several of the questions raised are outside of the Bill&rsquo;s remit but we will be happy to address them.</p>  <p>  There has been significant engagement between the county and city managers, local authority chief executives and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the Government's social housing strategy.  There is no issue in Cork County Council in meeting the delivery of social housing that is expected over the next four to five years in the social housing strategy.  The council is awaiting the formal notification of funding for this.  It has actually identified the sites required.  In those sites in its ownership, it has identified the extent of social housing that can be delivered in them.  It has also identified the various lead-in times, etc. required to get houses to the construction phase.  Clearly, it is in the business like any other private developer.  Over the past four to five years there has been no housebuilding in the local authority.  Accordingly, there is a lead-in time associated with going to tender, etc.  In a nutshell, the sector is well prepared and is working in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement in progressing the procurement of external services if required.  It is probably our highest priority in our engagement with the Department.</p>  <p>  On the delivery of infrastructure and development contributions, my comments on provisions for development contributions in the legislation were primarily around our capacity to supply infrastructure to service land to, in turn, support private sector housing as opposed to public sector housing.  There is no doubt that in some parts of the country in order to meet the demand for private sector housing that will arise over the next several years as set out in Construction 2020, as well as in other various government action plans, there is a need to invest in road and public water infrastructure.  For example in metropolitan Cork, we have identified nine masterplan areas which are the ideal locations for housing.  We will be working with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and local developers on this.</p>  <p>  However, there is an infrastructure cost to ensure those sites are capable of commencing development.  The cost is either met directly by the Exchequer or through development contributions.  That is the real issue that arises from the proposed legislation.  We are concerned the level of development contributions required may not support the development of infrastructure.  It is either the Exchequer puts money in to put in place road or water infrastructure to release land for development or it is done through development contributions.  Once the funding is there, there is no issue with delivering the infrastructure.  Neither is there an issue with the capacity of local government to respond and support the private sector in that regard.</p>  <p>  Between 2005 and 2013, through development contributions, Cork County Council spent &euro;47 million on roads infrastructure to support private sector housing development in particular.  Indeed, the growth in metropolitan Cork and the CASP, the Cork area strategic plan, area was above the national average.  That demonstrates the impact the development contributions have had during those years.</p> <p>If that source of funding had not been available, the Exchequer would have had to provide direct funding to local government.  This again raises questions about whether the Exchequer or developers should make this contribution and what funding model will apply.  The model will have to emerge from the proposed legislation. </p> <p> I will ask our director of planning or another colleague to speak about enforcement issues.  Reference was made to the derelict sites levy.  The legislation in this area is extremely cumbersome and we are fearful that implementing the provisions of the proposed legislation on vacant sites will be equally cumbersome.  We support a vacant sites levy because such a levy is needed in urban areas.  It is a facility which could be activated to try to force development in towns and town centres in larger urban areas.  However, the proposal includes a significant number of hardship clauses.  The test of the legislation will be whether its implementation will be as problematic as implementing the legislation on derelict sites.  This latter legislation provides for a series of processes, appeals, engagement with developers, etc., which means it can take two or three years, notwithstanding the best intentions of local authority staff, to apply a derelict site levy to a site.  Again, the concern is that a similar scenario will arise unless there is a significant tightening of the proposition regarding vacant sites.  That addresses the key issues arising in that regard. </p> <p> We will be pleased to comment on enforcement, even though it does not fall within the scope of the proposed legislation. </p></speech>

The key issues in respect of enforcement are staffing, resources and a will to act.  We have applied the staffing and resources in Cork.  We did an exercise in recent years which found that we have received &euro;3 million in back-payment of fees and contributions arising form enforcement activities.  The exercise demonstrated that a strong enforcement regime and inspectorate will largely fund itself.  In our case, it has provided resources and given us the confidence to have a good regime.  We report on an annual basis to our members, which challenges us with respect to the various issues that arise.</p>  <p>  While I take the points the Deputy raises, in our case resources have been provided by management and members and we have a good regime in place.  I emphasise also that the inspectorate is largely self-financing.  Enforcement is such a wide ranging issue that it often begs the question as to how long is a piece of string.  The larger local authorities, those with greater resources, have a fairly successful regime.  Nevertheless, it is clearly a challenging issue and difficulties will always arise.  The courts also have a role to play in supporting local authorities in their enforcement efforts.  My experience is that we have been given resources to address enforcement at local level and we are doing so reasonably successfully. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700014#Q00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the Oireachtas to discuss planning legislation, one of the most important issues for councillors, Deputies, Senators and society as a whole.  As one of the witnesses stated, planning is a broad church and views about it differ in rural and urban areas.  There are guidelines in place on good planning.</p>  <p>  Given the serious housing shortage, I hope the Bill will result in housing being built faster and in the right places at the right time. </p> <p>As stated by one of the councillors, it is important that we do not take a broad brush approach to the Bill and that we bear in mind the submissions made.  </p> <p> Councillor Brophy alluded to the removal of the word "affordability" from the Bill, which issue was also raised during previous hearings.  It is important that this issue be addressed, particularly in the context of the increase in house prices in the Dublin area.  I understand the reasoning behind the removal of the word "affordability" was to make it more affordable for developers to build houses.  However, if affordability continues to be an issue in terms of ever increasing housing waiting lists, we need to discuss it further.  I have taken on board the point that permissions should continue to be valid for five years.  </p> <p> The voluntary housing agencies were mentioned.  There is in place legislation governing these agencies.  However, it was mentioned that this legislation needed to be strengthened in the context of how voluntary housing agencies worked in concert with the local authorities.  I have taken on board this point also.  </p> <p> On having additional flexibility in regard to location, this also relates to the broad brush approach.  As Ms Guckian said, some areas may not need social housing, while others may need more.  There is much discussion of the issue of devolution of functions to local government.  This is one area that could be considered in that context.</p> <p> In regard to housing need, there are 15 counties that do not require development.  In Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and surrounding areas huge development is needed, while in other counties some development is needed.  There are some counties in which there are many vacant properties.  How in the delegates' view should this issue be addressed?  While in Dublin generally more than 2,000 acres of land has been rezoned, there is still a shortage of housing.  In Dublin city only 1,200 planning permissions have been granted.  </p> <p> Ms Guckian referred to head 5 of the Bill which deals with vacant sites and populations.  There was a contradiction between what two of the representatives had to say in that Ms Guckian said a population threshold of 3,000 could leave many places and counties exempt from development, while the representative of the Local Authority Members'Association, LAMA, said a 5,000 threshold was acceptable.  We will have to tease out that issue further.  The point about provision in the legislation for a 3,000 threshold is valid, as is the one about land zoned for agricultural use and where, because of historical use, it fits into all of this.</p> <p> The issue of affordability, again, is one for the Government, the banks and councils in working together.  One cannot expect that just because the word "affordable" has been removed from the Bill, this will result in housing being more affordable.  The availability of funding is another important issue, on which we have heard the delegates' views loud and clear.  </p> <p> The issue of land use and value and how it is calculated was raised by one of the delegates from Cork County Council.  I think it was Mr. Justice Clarke who set out how calculations were to be made.  There is a need for further discussion of the issue of values, land use and the calculation made by Mr. Justice Clarke, including whether we need to designate in recommendations how calculations should be arrived at or if this should be determined on the day by each local authority.  This is a matter that caused great difficulty in the court case, leading to Mr. Justice Clarke's determination in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700016#S00100"><p>I welcome the CEOs and the representative organisations, the AILG and LAMA.  It is important that they are following on from work they have done on other Bills in making contributions and submissions on them.<br/>On Part V, concern was raised earlier in the submissions about the regulation of the voluntary housing bodies, because these organisations are providing housing, are providing for a need.  However, a significant amount of housing stock is under the ownership and control of organisations that are officially listed as charities, but that are not under the control of local authorities.<br/>I have problems with the removal of the affordability concept and I ask for a response on the matter because across the country, certainly in my own county, Laois, there is a need for affordable housing.  Although housing prices have dropped, people are not able to buy housing.  There is a role for providing affordable housing.  <br/>On the increase of exclusion threshold so that Part V would only apply to developments of nine houses or more, even in the town of Portlaoise I have seen a situation where five houses were built and the local authority acquired one of those houses.  I must say &quot;buy&quot;, because there is a myth in some areas that the local authority gets a house <i>gratis</i>from the developer.  It does not.  There is a formula for calculating the price of it.  It is important that is retained, particularly in small counties.  Five houses might be built on the edge of a village and it is important that one of those houses is social housing.  This brings me to the 10% rule.  It is too low.  I would welcome the views of the organisations on this.  It needs to be near to double that.<br/>The other question is where Part V housing is located in estates.  I have seen greater social segregation as a result of Part V than there was with straightforward local authority developments.  I could show the witnesses examples of it, developments where up to 500 houses are built, including 30 or 40 social houses.  These social houses are not peppered throughout the estate.  They are built in the furthest corner of the development, out of sight.  It has led to huge difficulties.  I have come up against it in Portlaoise and other towns.  I would particularly welcome the views of the CEOs on this.  The remit of the planners has been to sort this out and, for whatever reason.  I am not saying the CEOs here have done it but CEOs and planning staff seem to have given in to the wishes of developers.  Not alone are they pushed over in one corner, they are also of the lowest quality.  Everything is cut-price and of a low standard.  The back gardens are very small.  They are the same size as, or smaller than, some people's kitchens.  I would welcome views on the need to stitch quality of housing into the Bill, as well as its location in estates.<br/>There are huge weaknesses in the proposals in regard to vacant sites, although I am in favour of a vacant sites levy.  I brought forward a Bill last year on derelict sites.  In theory we have a 3% levy on derelict sites, but we all know - the councillors in particular - that it is very ineffective.  The issue is around policing and enforcing it.  During the boom, 3% of a site could have been a sizeable amount of money, but 3% of the value of a property now could be only a few hundred euro in some cases.</p> <p>We need to change that.  I would welcome the witnesses' views in that regard.</p> <p> I also welcome the suggestion by the AILG that councillors should have a reserved function in this area.  Mr. Tim Lucey suggested this would be a protracted process.  I see it going the way of the Derelict Sites Act in terms of it being on the Statute Book but lying in a cupboard.  What revenue could a local authority accrue from policing derelict sites?  At the very least, they would have to bring in sufficient money to pay for enforcement.  That is not happening at present.  A local authority might bring in a few hundred euro but it will spend &euro;10,000 trying to police these sites.  That balance has to be tipped.</p> <p> Reference was made to a reduction of 50% in development levies in Cork for non-residential developments.  However, Cork is contending with deficits in its infrastructure.  While we want to offer incentives for commercial development, we also want a degree of flexibility.  Elected members are responsible for making the development contribution plan.  If we are going to have commercial development, we need infrastructure.  We cannot continue the practice whereby the infrastructure follows the development.  Both must be constructed simultaneously.  In regard to the two year reduction in the planning duration, my experience is that it is always a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, in other words, the developer's cash-flow, regardless of whether it is a private house or a much bigger development.</p></speech>

Our senior planner, Mr. Andrew Hind, has experience of dealing with the issue of the 10% and affordability, most recently in the context of developing our own housing strategy for the next six years.  He will be able to comment in depth on those issues.</p></speech>

This ruling brought clarity to existing use values and development values, as well as the dates to which they would be applied.  We are concerned that the Bill as it is currently proposed does not take existing buildings into consideration for arriving at existing use values.  Does this mean the property would be treated as a greenfield or brownfield site as if the buildings did not exist?  The benefit of Part V depends on the difference between the existing use value and the development value.  In the interest of local authorities, the lower the value for the existing use value, the greater the benefits from the whole operation.  This needs to be clarified because it could give rise to disputes in the future.</p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Stanley's question on grouping, the practice in Cork County Council has always been to cluster social housing in large developments.  If we were taking 20 units, for example, we would take five in each of four different areas.</p> <p>If we were taking 20 units, for example, we might take five together in four different areas so that there is integration and completeness and they can be managed by the Housing Authority.  This is our recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraig McNally" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700018#U00200"><p>Senator Keane and Deputy Stanley made some particularly apt points.  The concept of Part V is not a bad idea, in an ideal world.  I fully agree with Deputy Stanley and I know of instances in which these houses were pushed into corners.  The way they made them affordable for the councils to buy them was not necessarily lack of quality but a much plainer design.  This led to a scenario in which it was obvious which houses in an estate were the Part V houses because of where they were and how they looked.  They were a much cheaper option and the developers did not lose.  Although we would love to see a rate of 20% affordable housing, in reality the developers add what they lose on those houses to the cost of the others.  I have a difficulty with the term "affordable housing".  We should aspire to a situation in which all family size houses should be affordable.  Instead of trying to identify a house that should be cheaper than the one next to it, the houses should be the same.  The question is how to deliver them.  We need to seek to make all three-bedroom houses affordable, although it would be very complex.  This is what happened in the past.  A few got affordable houses through the affordable housing scheme while others paid the balance and are still suffering.</p>  <p>  Where a farm is on the edge of a town, in general it is because the town moved out to the farm.  The farmer did not move the land into the town.  I would be very hesitant to agree to anything that would involve a levy being put on such land if it is being actively farmed.  We must be very careful as there would probably be legal issues.  I accept that the legislation on vacant sites is weak and probably has not been enforced.  Every town or village, no matter how vibrant, going in the opposite direction has suffered and one can see the reality.</p>  <p>  The lack of joined-up thinking has left a situation in which voluntary housing agencies are coming in and buying houses and the first the local authority hears of it is when the agency contacts it asking for tenants from the waiting lists.  This has happened in at least three counties.  There was no knowledge of the fact that the voluntary housing agencies were buying houses.  It would be different if they were building because everybody would know who they were.</p>  <p>  In another capacity I am a member of a body that is trying to identify hurdles to fast-track development and there are some very obvious ones.  While it may not be in the committee's remit, I have a particular issue with the lack of zoning in some areas, where there is too little land in the ownership of too few people, many of whom do not want to sell, for example because they are elderly and do not want millions or hundreds of thousands of euro.  I have an issue with that because of the reduction forced on councils a few years ago.  Almost every major planning application is referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the process takes 12 to 18 months.  Major reform is needed  if we are to achieve fast tracking.  This is especially true of commercial development where it is the easiest thing in the world to delay a project for a year or two by referring it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is the same for many housing developments.  This may not be in this committee's remit.</p></speech>

The problems with its enforcement  and what one would get from the levy have been outlined.  When the development contribution scheme was introduced it was contentious.  It became a revenue generator for the local authorities and contributed to the infrastructure that was needed for future development.  Unfortunately, it was frozen with the general Government balance.  There is a lot of money in local authorities that cannot be spent.</p> <p>If we got that alone lifted, it would help with putting in some of the infrastructure, which would help kick-start the construction industry.</p> <p> On the issue of the difference between the councillors on the 3,000 limit and the 5,000 limit, to us, a vacant site levy is for vacant sites within large towns and cities, not for agricultural land on the side of towns.  As Councillor McNally said, the towns moved out to meet them.  What we need to do is bring life back into our towns because there is nobody living in them, as there is nobody living in parts of our large cities.  Most of the upstairs units in commercial premises are empty and are going to rack and ruin.  It is those places we need to regenerate in order to bring life back into the cities.  When it comes to 7 p.m., there should be an evening economy in a city or town, rather than everybody moving to the suburbs and leaving a desolate city or town.  To mix it up with agricultural land is to take the wrong way.</p> <p> We suggested the 5,000 limit for population because the Bill contains so many get-out clauses for not developing the site.  If one goes into the smaller towns, the footfall is not there at present because the economy has not yet reached those places.  We have to start with areas of larger population, where we would hope the economy will come back to first, and then get those vacant sites developed.</p> <p> We had a difficulty with the previous overall affordable housing scheme, which was cumbersome both for the local authority and the person buying the house.  Deputy Stanley referred to flexibility on the percentage in Part V.  We are saying that has to be flexible because there will be places where more or less flexibility is needed.  We said in our presentation that dispersal of Part V, which the Deputy referred to as the pepper-dusting rather than the clustering of Part V houses, is very valid.  However, through the regeneration programme in Limerick, we have found that this only works if the local authority can put in place a system whereby the people being housed are integrated, that is, that there are residents associations and everybody is up to speed on what is happening.

It is just a matter of looking at it and saying that, instead of having a prescriptive way of removing the affordability element completely, we should allow for that, because the fundamental problem of affordability, which was alluded to by Deputy Stanley and Senator Keane, is still there.</p>  <p>  Ironically, that affordability problem is becoming most acute in large cities, particularly in Dublin, where, even though there has been a substantial fall from the peak of house prices, it does not take much, on a 20%, year-on-year house price point, for a three-bedroom semi-detached house to become completely unaffordable again for people on average incomes.  Therefore, if we are putting in place a legislative approach to this, it must not only address the immediate next few months but address what will be needed a few years down the line.  If things continue as they are, there is no question that affordability of housing will become an issue.</p>  <p>  I agree very much with Councillor Sheahan that how Part V is handled in developments is crucial.  We alluded to the fact there are different approaches to this by different local authorities and I do not believe there is one definitive way that works for everything.</p> <p>By being too prescriptive in national legislation we are running the risk of removing the flexibility of local authorities to develop a local dimension, which should be led by local councillors as representatives of the public.  They can determine the best use of the Part V provisions in a particular area and could decide, for example, not to allow one house to be built in a development of ten houses but three houses to be built in a development of 30.  That might be a far better use of every aspect of the Part V process as well as of our infrastructure resources and the resources of the local authorities themselves.  From my perspective it all boils down to subsidiarity and allowing flexibility to be devolved down rather than being too prescriptive and trying to shoe horn it in.</p></speech>

Under the current legislation, the requirement for affordable housing and the overall percentage of housing development to fall under Part V is established through the preparation of the housing strategy.  The methodology for preparing the housing strategy was issued by the Department to local authorities as long ago as 2000.  In our most recent exercise in connection with the review of our development plan, we used the model set out in the existing guidance from the Minister.  We were very concerned that the model, having been issued in 2000, might no longer be fit for purpose but actually, in our exercise it worked very well.  In fact, this time around it worked better than in previous development plan cycles mainly because there is more and better data available on house prices through mechanisms like the Residential Property Price Register and so forth.  The picture we were able to build of the local housing market was a better and more accurate picture than before.  As a result of all of that, in Cork, the city and county councils reached the conclusion that the right level of provision of social housing was 14%.  That was how the model worked out and that was the percentage we reached.  Our colleagues in County Leitrim reached 12.5% having gone through a very similar exercise at a similar time.  While not everybody fully agreed with that process, there was a large degree of local consensus among the stakeholders that the figure was right.  Having gone through that process, our concern with the proposals in this Bill is that if the national requirement is to maximise the delivery of social and affordable housing then setting a 10% cap nationally might not deliver the full potential of all the markets around the country.  Our view is that the existing mechanism works and indeed, it works better than it did in previous years because of better data.  Therefore local authorities should be allowed to reach their own conclusions.</p>  <p>  On the question of affordability, when we ran the model issued to local authorities by the Department over the past two years we found that market prices had fallen so much that the cost of building an affordable unit was greater than the market price achievable.  As a result, we included no requirement for affordable housing in our housing strategy.  However, our concern would be that as the market improves and prices rise, that may open up a gap between house prices and income levels, thus introducing a future requirement for affordable housing.  Again, we would be concerned that taking affordable housing off the Statute Book altogether might foreclose the options available to local authorities in future circumstances.</p></speech>

The method of calculation is not complicated and includes looking at future household formations, future population trends, market conditions, income projections, housing needs assessments and at housing provided by the local authorities themselves.  Each area can come up with a particular percentage based on that data.  We came up with 12.5%, while in Cork, the authorities came up with 14%.  We too had a 0% requirement for affordable housing because house prices in Leitrim are so low at the moment that people will either require social housing or they will be able to purchase a property.  However, that might change in the future so the Bill is quite prescriptive in that sense.  We also feel that the nine houses figure is too high.</p> <p>This is because in a place like County Leitrim, the majority of housing developments in the future will be small and consequently, in our opinion this number should be lower and the other percentage should be higher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700021#X00200"><p>I welcome the representatives of the three associations.  In particular, I thank the Chairman for inviting the council associations before the joint committee on foot of a proposal from Senator Keane and me.  It is very important that these associations appear before the committee in respect of any pre-legislative scrutiny pertaining to legislation dealing with local government.  As this Bill is in that realm, I welcome them to the meeting.  I must also get my head around the new title, namely, the County and City Management Association, as opposed to County and City Managers Association, because of the change in respect of the chief executive officers.  I also welcome the association to the meeting.</p>  <p>  I have listened closely and intently and while I will not go back over what already has been said, I will make a few points.  I agree completely with the flexibility concept with regard to the 10% social and affordable provision but the difficulty is how does one put that into legislation.  What happened previously was that the default position was flexibility.  Consequently, members have seen what happened in the past where there was a movement from houses being provided to a position in which money was paid instead and the entire concept of social housing was lost.  It is a challenge for the Minister in the first instance to include this in the Bill and then for members to respond to it.  However, it is important to be cognisant of the points that were made regarding flexibility as one size does not fit all.  I come from a small rural town - I acknowledge some of the councillors present come from major urban areas - and one must look at both contexts and some flexibility must be built in.  Perhaps a default position should be considered in which the legislation sets out a particular position but that there could be a default from that for which local authorities could apply on a case-by-case basis.  There may be some scope in this respect.</p>  <p>  I have a question for the witnesses from the County and City Management Association.  In their submission, they made a comment regarding the potential delays in collecting the levy.  How do they think that process could be speeded up?  I raised the issue of the 10% and the ten units with previous associations.  I reiterate that I come from rural Ireland where even now, some of the limited developments are of seven and eight houses.  As 10% of seven housing units is no house or unit at all, this issue must be examined, flexibility must be considered in that context and members must be forceful with the Minister on this point.</p>  <p>  In his submission, Councillor McNally referred to approved housing bodies, which also are known as voluntary housing associations.  He called for their regulation, which is something for which I have called since entering the Seanad.  There are hundreds of voluntary housing associations and the word "voluntary" with regard to housing associations is a misnomer, because nothing is voluntary.  The funding for such associations is provided in the main by the Department.  I acknowledge that of late, they have been obliged to come up with some money themselves but up to then, it was provided by the Department.  The counsellor might expand on the benefit of regulation with regard to how the local authorities do their business.  In addition, I believe Councillor Guckian referred to the levies being used at local town level.  I seek her opinion in this regard but the difficulty is that since last year, a new local government system has been in place and whereas previously, there were distinct town council areas, in some cases there now are municipal districts encompassing a number of towns.  If this is a reserved function, will it fall to the elected members of the municipal district to decide where the money is to be spent within that municipal district or will it stay in the town in which it has been collected?  This is a major issue because as the witnesses are all aware, geography plays a massive role in how the municipal districts now are configured.  Off the top of my head, I can name four or five places in this context.  For example, I note Councillor Geoghegan is smiling at me, if the money was collected in Dungarvan, it could end up being spent in Lismore.  I seek the witnesses' views on how that can be tightened up.</p>  <p>  The final issue on which I wish to make a point is whether this provision would apply to towns with a population of 3,000, as was mentioned, or to towns of 5,000.  The town of Templemore in my native county has a population of less than 3,000 and has a development plan.  On the enactment of this Bill, does one run the clock on the current development plans and the lands that were zoned therein or does one start afresh from the time the Bill is passed?</p> <p>That is another imponderable to which I do not have the answer.  Perhaps Mr. Sheahan might like to comment, given that he has spoken about the issue already.</p></speech>

Clearly, market valuations have to be made and there will potentially be appeals to the Valuation Tribunal and so on.  While the legislation is being developed, our commentary is based on our experience, in particular, our experience of the application of the derelict sites levy, which almost appears to be replicated.  It is inevitable that there will be time delays in a system of appeals, which is a concern.  Even before we get to set a market value, there will be a situation where there will clearly be interaction between the local authority and the site owners on whether the site is under-utilised, whether there are hardship clauses or whether particular circumstances are set out in the legislation which would apply to the site.  That is the concern.  However, the concept is good, but it will only remain so if it is reasonably efficient and quick in its application.  Obviously, the concept is to try to ensure development commences.  However, if we are held up in a series of processes which results in a year or 18 months passing by, it will have failed in its original objective.</p>  <p>  On the spending of development contributions generally, in our own circumstances we believe the system was very well received by our own local authority members in that it certainly added significant benefits to infrastructure in the county.  To revert to my previous point, it was of significant benefit in aiding development coming on stream.  It is a good system and should be continued, although at what level is a matter for consideration.  They are probably the two key issues.</p></speech>

If local authorities cannot agree with developers on the options under Part V, the matter is referred to an Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The important point concerns how the legislation is implemented.  Our priority was always to acquire houses where there was a need and the houses available were suitable; there was never a suggestion of entertaining anything other than this.  We had a policy of pepper-potting clusters of a similar-type of house.  What I am saying is that it concerns how the legislation is implemented.  There is a proposal that the financial contribution be removed, which could be of benefit in certain areas.  Is there any other issue?</p></speech>

We do not want everything to end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We want to avoid this because it would leave everything in abeyance.  That is the idea in bringing this forward.  I am asking for the delegates' views on how we can get around this.  I am talking about the default position being the opportunity for each local authority to go to the relevant Minister and say, "This is not workable in our area because...".  We are at scrutiny level and I do not know whether that would be feasible, but that is the point I am making.</p></speech>

All of these levies have been introduced to try to kick start things, but they will not work unless we pick strategic sites and target those who are sitting on properties and could well afford to develop them but who are not doing so because they want to wait until the potential return increases.  There is no point in chasing the fellow who does not have a bob in his pocket and telling him to develop his site.  There is no point in this if the individual does not have the wherewithal to develop it.  That is why I suggest we allow the current local area plans to run their course before the new system kicks in.  That said, local authorities should flag all strategic sites in areas proposed for development with 5,000 people or more well in advance of finalising future development plans.  In that way, nobody would be able to cry and say, "it was not in the plan before."  We should start on a new playing field.  If the economy recovers in the way we hope it will, that will affect the areas with larger populations first.  We will have more success in pursuing the development of vacant sites in these areas than in in areas with smaller populations.</p></speech>

Let us say a developer has a substantial site that is capable of holding 30 houses but decides to build four separate developments, each with eight houses.  In that way, he or she would be building 32 houses, but he or she would not have to provide 10% of units for social and affordable housing.  That is an escape clause.</p></speech>

We are not opposed to the whole concept, but we believe it must be tightly regulated for a number of reasons.  First, the voluntary housing bodies appear to be buying houses without consultations with local authorities on where houses are actually needed.  I could give the committee several examples of houses acquired by voluntary housing bodies 18 months ago, 30% to 40% of which are still vacant because they are in locations in which people do not want to live.  These houses were bought only because they were very cheap.</p>  <p>  Second, housing provided by voluntary housing bodies is often expensive.  I know of one woman who left such a house because her rent was so high.  She was an old-age pensioner who was being charged &euro;76 per week in rent, which she could not afford.  She only stayed in the accommodation for eight months.</p>  <p>  Third, there is no ability to buy from voluntary housing agencies.  These bodies have vacant homes because families, in particular, will hold out and resist entering a scenario where they will never own their own home.  Given that Government money was provided - in the initial period at least - it is regrettable that there is no requirement for voluntary housing bodies to sell a percentage of the properties they own to people who will remain in them for the rest of their lives.</p>  <p>  Fourth, voluntary housing bodies are not required to take account of an individual's position on the housing waiting list.  They are contacting people whom they think are suitable, regardless of where they are on the list in terms of points acquired for waiting and so forth.  A lot more regulation is required in this area.</p></speech>

That certainly has presented an even greater challenge since the abolition of town councils.  We had a system in place under which money could be retained at local level, but town boundaries no longer apply.  It is a question of councillors within districts deciding, in a fair way, how the moneys raised should be allocated.  We had a good system in place previously.</p></speech>

The first time Mr. O'Connell was here was as general secretary of the Local Authority Members Association, a position I held for a number of years.</p>  <p>  What the Bill needs to provide for is a better social mix.</p> <p>All members have experienced situations where local authority houses have been constructed and then, in a 20-year lifespan, visited thrice for total refurbishment.  This costs local authorities a great deal of money; therefore, the issue of the social mix within local authority estates must be addressed.  Housing design must be improved because there should be no need to distinguish a council estate from a private estate.  This will be important in the future.  In addition, citizens are and have been the real victims of bad planning during the years.  Bad planning has had an appalling impact on the lives of people nationwide, in particular in the midlands, the Shannon region and the mid-west.  The report of the Mahon tribunal, which everyone has probably read, showed what happened when vested interests became involved in the planning process and there is evidence that Part V of the legislation was also interfered with.  This undermined and corrupted the entire planning system and destroyed the countryside.  In the future a more accountable and transparent planning system will be needed, with no room for corrupt practices.  How will this feed into the national spatial strategy which is under review?  I understand work is ongoing on the strategy.  We have local, county and regional development plans and so on, but while there is a lot of planning, there is very little action afterwards.  How do the representatives feel about this?</p></speech>

I will not repeat some points that have been taken up.  </p>  <p>  Affordability is certainly an issue.  As Councillor Brophy noted, it will be difficult for anybody to get onto the first rung of the housing ladder.  It is up to members to try to ensure it will be easier to get on the ladder.  If social housing is located in areas in which infrastructure is not in place, it must be provided in the form of roads, water and transport services, etc.  This is very important.  </p>  <p>  The Part V provisions have been mentioned by many speakers, including Councillor John Sheahan.  I personally support the provision of housing in preference to any financial contribution to local authorities.  While I must admit and recognise that contributions have been made and used wisely in several local authorities, some local authorities did not follow up on the contributions and consequently the requirements in some housing estates were not met.</p>  <p>  I seek opinions on two matters, now that new laws are being compiled.  On unauthorised developments and enforcement issues, in the opinion of the delegates as councillors and chief executive officers, is there a legal way by which the enforcement laws could be strengthened?  Could they be tightened or do the delegates have suggestions for improving the laws as they stand?  I am personally aware of unauthorised developments that have been in place for six and seven years and it appears local authorities are reluctant to avail of court procedures.  I will not use the word "threaten", but it is seen as a last resort.</p> <p>The local authorities are reluctant to threaten court proceedings as it an option of last resort.  There must be some way of ensuring that unauthorised developments that were built without planning permission or turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la are dealt with by local authorities.  </p> <p> I was in a housing estate just before Christmas with 26 or 28 houses and was amazed at the number of cars and vans parked in the estate, some of them on the footpaths, some out on the public roads and the rest in driveways.  Should we look at the law in the context of providing more space for cars in our housing estates?    Most households have two cars.  Indeed, with grown-up sons and daughters, there could be three or four cars in a household.  Is it time to look at the density of housing and the number of car parking spaces that are required?  Could we improve our planning laws in that regard?  Should we do so?  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that matter.  The number of vehicles parked in the aforementioned estate took away from the beauty of what is one of the best county council estates in the country.  I returned last weekend because I thought that on my previous visit there must have been a carnival happening but that was not the case.  Is there anything we can do?  Better planning is required in this area.</p></speech>

We have had some very serious problems in north Kerry in that regard.  When a private estate is being planned, architects will make sure that there is enough room for cars to be parked in a proper fashion without interfering with the flow of traffic and so forth.  There is one particular housing estate in Listowel where it is quite difficult for two cars to pass one another and that is not right in the context of health and safety.</p>  <p>  I apologise for being late but I had to attend another meeting.  I welcome the representatives to our meeting and in particular, it is nice to see the city and county managers here as a recognisable force with whom we can deal.  They were always able to identify us as public representatives.  On the issue of representation for councillors, when the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, was subsumed I was concerned about what might happen in the future but, along with most of the public, I am impressed with the way things are shaping up.  With the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, we have readily identifiable organisations representing local government and the councillors who have to work the system.  Those two organisations seem to be working well together.  I must give a special welcome to the General Secretary of the LAMA, my old friend, Bobby O'Connell.  We were elected together 22 years ago.  </p>  <p>  I will not delay proceedings as I have to be back in the Seanad Chamber at 4.30 p.m. but I wish to assure all of the representative organisations that they have the goodwill of Senators.  We will support them in every way we can with the new system.  When I was elected to the county council it was like the wild west and anything went.  We have seen the price we had to pay for that.  Mr. Keating made a very valid point earlier which resonated with me.  The new system will work because the people involved will make it work.  The representatives here are at the coal face now and it is up to them.  There was a famous councillor in Kerry called Danny Kissane who always finished up by saying, "Therefore, is".  It is up to the councillors and the staff of the local authorities to work it out and I am sure they will.  </p>  <p>  I am available to meet the witnesses afterwards on a social basis.</p></speech>

Pre-legislative scrutiny is very useful in that it gives us the opportunity to put together legislation that has a practical effect.  Those of us who were members of local authorities for many years often came across actions that were possible in theory but not in practice.  Some of the points that were made regarding the Derelict Sites Act, for example, are relevant.  That Act is cumbersome and, as referred to at last week's meeting, there are good reasons that legislation does not work.  Regarding the vacant site tax, therefore, we need to hear suggestions on how to make it workable.  It is very good in theory but we want to make sure that it is also very good in practice.  In that context, Cork County Council deserves some credit for its work in Clonakilty, which is the one place where it was shown to work well, once real efforts were made.</p>  <p>  The submissions were very useful.  There was quite a bit of cross-over between the various submissions but the one from the County and City Managers Association sought clarification on numerous issues.  The submission suggests, for example, that the format, payment and calculation of the price in terms of Part V developments requires clarification, as does the definition of "existing use" value.  I ask the witnesses to expand on the difficulties they would see in terms of how this will all work in practice.  There has been a variety of outcomes under the scheme up to now.  It is important to bring the coal face experience to bear on the more academic process of preparing legislation.  It would be useful if the witnesses could provide an additional submission on those particular areas.  </p>  <p>  The issue of affordable housing and the 10% limit also came up at last week's meeting.  When dealing with any proposed legislation, we should not just view matters from today's perspective and the current very difficult economic environment but must take a longer-term view.  In that context, I suggested the inclusion of a sunset clause because while there are difficulties at the moment the market may well be much improved in four or five years time.  We may have to revise the legislation then so is there a way of making provision for that now?  A sunset clause in the legislation which commits the Oireachtas to revisiting certain aspects of the legislation might be the way to deal with this, rather than having certain provisions fixed in stone.  I would welcome suggestions in that regard.</p>  <p>  Town centres were also mentioned and it will be up to the members of the local authorities to determine, in the development plans, their locations.  In the initial stages it would probably be wise to limit their size, particularly in the context of determining how things work out with the vacant site tax.  A lot of the vacant units in town centres were speculative developments and many would not be big enough to be in NAMA.  They are probably going to be more difficult to work through because in some cases there are encumbered debts on them.  We must think that through carefully.</p>  <p>  The suitability of units is also an issue in many places.  I have come across many examples of units that do not match the accommodation needs in an area.  In many places, for example, developers were only offering apartments but there was a need for three or four bedroom houses.  </p> <p>Then, of course, this management company charges it as well.  It would be useful to hear how the witnesses think that might be predetermined in a mixed development because it can cause problems further into the future.</p> <p> In regard to the reduced development contributions, of course, there are no longer development contributions in regard to water and wastewater since the establishment of Irish Water.  There was supposed to be pick-up whereby the local authorities lost the ability to apply development contributions but there has not been a comparable piece of legislation that will permit Irish Water to invest in that area from the point of view of development contributions.  I believe this will be a double disadvantage to the local authorities in that they will not get the contributions but, at the same time, there will not be another authority that has gathered development contributions that could be spent in the location they are collected from.</p> <p> I would be interested to know, although not necessarily today, some of the things that have been identified as administratively challenging.  I want to know what exactly would make it workable.  In regard to the points that require clarification, it would be useful if the witnesses could flesh out this area so we get a fuller understanding in order that we might be able to meaningfully get some changes in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraig McNally" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015012700027#DD00200"><p>Deputy Bannon rightly said that everybody wants houses, not cash, because there are too many temptations for local authorities to siphon off money to do other things, given the demands are so great in other areas.  Members themselves would be at fault in many cases for jumping on the bandwagon and taking money that was given in lieu of houses.  Once a person gets a house, it is there forever unless the person decides to sell it.</p>  <p>  Senator Brennan spoke about the priority of getting people on the housing ladder.  I believe any legislation should always aim to make it easy for the first-time buyer or builder because a house for them is a necessity whereas it is a choice for people beyond that.  Whether people get into a house that is affordable forms the rest of their lives, in particular their working lives, so I believe that is very important.</p>  <p>  With regard to unauthorised developments, all local authorities are accused of allowing the big man get away with murder.  The reality, in my experience, is that there are several reasons for this.  In particular, the courts are too lenient.  All that a person summoned to court has to do is put in a planning application and the judge will adjourn the case pending the outcome of that, and he will further adjourn it because of an An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeal.  Then, when it goes beyond that and if the people are determined enough, the councils, because of their lack of funding, are afraid of their lives to incur big legal fees by losing the case.  We have had a few cases of that.</p>  <p>  Parking is a particularly interesting issue.  Every estate built in the last 20 years is totally inadequate in terms of parking.  I believe lowering the density is an area that could certainly be looked at as it would obviously have an effect.  There are huge issues regarding access for fire vehicles and ambulances, and I have seen streets too narrow to allow these vehicles through.  We must examine the design of parking outside front doors where, for example, a long narrow strip might accommodate three cars but the owners will not park in the space because they would have to move two cars to get to a third car.  In many cases, people are parking on the street even though there is off-street parking.  There has to be better design and I believe regulation is needed in this regard.</p>  <p>  That is all I wanted to say although there are many other areas I could expand on, perhaps on a future occasion.</p></speech>

The town councils that have been abolished have since come into the municipal districts, where there would be a number of town councils.  My opinion is that any development levies should be pooled for the municipal district and that the executive would spend them wisely.  Given there are smaller villages and areas that would not have benefited at all, the development levies should be spread out to provide footpaths, lights and so on in those small villages and towns.</p>  <p>  Councillor McNally alluded to the issue of car parking.</p> <p>When many estates were built, including when local authorities were developing estates some years ago, they put just one car parking space outside the house and there was no proper planning or foresight with regard to what would happen.  Nowadays, there are two or three cars at every house so, going forward, we must look to a situation where adequate parking is provided, perhaps at the end of the estate.  We also have to look at access and exit routes from estates to allow for emergency vehicles to get in and out.  With regard to private estates, when the submissions are being made to the planning officer and there are pre-planning meetings, the issues are well teased out and the plans are pretty good in regard to providing enough car parking facilities for the estate.</p></speech>

The first is the link to the national spatial strategy, NSS.  In broad terms, the concept behind this Bill is to try to facilitate a quicker supply of housing, both in the private and the public sectors, how to incentivise this and how to support infrastructure development, where required, particularly from a private sector housing point of view.  Therefore, it clearly has a link to delivery of housing supply, whereas the review of the NSS is some time away.  This Bill is certainly linked in this regard, in that the conditions around supply of housing will be set very much by this Bill.</p>  <p>  Other attendees have commented on unauthorised development and enforcement.  One thing of benefit, and which could be significant, is the new building control management system.  In law, a person cannot occupy a house without a final certificate of completion, which, in essence, means a house cannot be sold without a certificate of completion.  I suggest this is a very effective deterrent in terms of moving ahead with an authorised residential development in particular.</p>  <p>  To be fair, Deputy Catherine Murphy picked up on a number of the issues we raised.  On completion of this session, we would certainly be happy to send a note to the committee, particularly in regard to the land valuation issues we have raised, with some thoughts on the practical issues that might be of benefit to the committee in considering how those issues might be clarified.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Department Mr. Gary Tobin, assistant secretary, and Mr. Des O'Leary and from the Revenue Commissioners Mr. Gerry Smyth, assistant secretary, and Ms Jean Kelly.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des O'Leary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012700003#D00200"><p>I propose to describe the main features of the legislation and the reasoning behind the proposals included in it.  Mr. Smyth will address a number of issues that are of particular interest to the Revenue Commissioners.  As the joint committee has a copy of my statement, I do not propose to read it in full and it might perhaps be accepted for the record.  </p>  <p>  In budget 2014 the Minister announced a reform of the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and the tax appeals system.</p> <p>The commissioners hear appeals against assessments, decisions and determinations of Revenue on a variety of taxes and charges that are under the care and maintenance of the Revenue Commissioners.  Most of those appeals relate to the amount of an appellant&rsquo;s liability.<br/><br/>The Minister&rsquo;s stated objective was to ensure an enhanced and cost-effective appeal mechanism, which provided transparency and increased certainty for taxpayers.  I should point out at this stage that the Minister is on record in the D&aacute;il in noting the important role that the Appeal Commissioners had to play in the operation of a fair and efficient system.  He has also specifically acknowledged the important contributions of the current Appeal Commissioners, Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan and Mr. Kelly, since their appointments in 1992.<br/><br/>Since the budget we have had a public consultation process.  We received a number of submissions, in the main from tax and legal representative bodies and from the Revenue Commissioners.  These have been made available to the committee.  Subsequent to the public consultation, we have had further contact with these parties about their recommendations.  We have also consulted with the Attorney General's office about some of the proposed measures and have discussed them with the Appeal Commissioners.<br/><br/>To give a quick run-down of what the process is like at the moment, not all taxpayer grievances come within the remit of the Appeal Commissioners.  Where a taxpayer does not agree with a monetary penalty, his or her recourse is through the courts.  Grievances about how the Revenue Commissioners handle cases can be dealt with by way of judicial review.  There is also provision for going through the Ombudsman in the case of people who feel that they have been unfairly treated. <br/><br/>I will give a quick outline of the present appeals system.  At present, a taxpayer appeals directly to the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Appeal Commissioners, and Revenue then liaises with the Appeal Commissioners to set a date for a hearing.  Appeals are held <i>in camera</i>- in private - following which the Appeal Commissioners make their decision.  Hearings are held in various locations throughout the country and are much less formal than a court situation.  A taxpayer can represent him- or herself or can be represented by a legal or taxation professional.  Decisions by the commissioners are given orally or in writing and, while they can be published, publication has been limited in practice.  In recent years it has certainly not been the practice to publish the decisions that are issued.  There is no register of precedents as the Appeal Commissioners are not a tribunal of record.<br/><br/>Decisions of the Appeal Commissioners can be appealed to the courts.  Appellants may seek a complete rehearing of the appeal, from the very start, by a judge of the Circuit Court or, on a point of law, they can go to the High Court.  The Revenue Commissioners are restricted to an appeal to the High Court only on a point of law, except in the case of capital acquisitions tax, where they may make an appeal to a judge of the Circuit Court.  This is one of the inconsistencies that are evident throughout the current system.  A taxpayer has to pay his or her self-assessed liability before an appeal can be made but any disputed amount between the appellant and the taxpayer is not payable until the matter is completely determined through the appeals process, even when that involves going to the superior courts.<br/><br/>Over the past 15 years, a number of reports have examined the appeals process.  These include the DIRT enquiry and the Revenue powers' groups in 1999 and 2003.  The Law Reform Commission issued a report in 2004 and there was a commentary from the Commission on Taxation in 2009.  The recommendations in these reports focused on the importance of ensuring the independence of the Appeal Commissioners through appropriate appointment procedures and by providing an enhanced, cost-effective appeal mechanism.</p> <p>The objectives of the proposed legislation are to enhance the independent status of the Appeal Commissioners while ensuring appropriate accountability, to make the system more transparent, and to make the process more efficient. <br/><br/>The current legal provisions dealing with the appointment of the commissioners are contained in a very small section of the Taxes Consolidation Act - it is only a few lines.  Effectively, the Minister has discretion as to who is appointed and on what terms, subject only to laying details of the appointment before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposal in the legislation is to change this by specifying that an appointment will in future be made by the Minister following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  Appointments would be for a fixed term which may be renewed once.  There are various provisions on such matters as disqualification and removal from office, which are broadly in line with the arrangements for other independent office holders.  The Bill also provides for the Appeal Commissioners to report annually on their work and for that report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no provision to that extent at the moment.  <br/><br/>Currently appeals and rehearings by a Circuit Court judge are held <i>in camera</i>.  The Bill proposes that they would in future be held in public.  However, the Appeal Commissioners would have scope to hold hearings, or parts thereof,<i>in camera</i>in certain circumstances, for example, where confidential information is being discussed, or where they felt the issue was not of great consequence.  There is no reason in principle why tax appeals ought to be heard <i>in camera</i>.  Appeals to the High Court from decisions of the Appeal Commissioners and from the Circuit Court judge are held in open court.  There is also a trend internationally, in the UK and Australia, for example, which have a comparable legal background, towards public hearings for tax appeal cases.<br/><br/>As part of the consultation process, practitioner and representative bodies have argued that public hearings for tax appeals are not appropriate as they may deter individuals from appealing.  The argument is also made that cases sometimes require that information about third parties is divulged.  We feel that the provision for Appeal Commissioners to hear some cases in private at their discretion would continue to deal with such issues.  The Minister has been advised by the Attorney General's office that public hearings would not breach the constitutional right of privacy or confidentiality of appellants if such hearings were to be provided by law, and that the legislature is not precluded from providing by law that hearings of the Appeal Commissioners are to be held in public.  Notwithstanding the concerns that have been expressed, the Minister considers that the holding of tax appeals in public would improve the operation of and confidence in the administration of the tax system.  He is very conscious of the differing views on this issue and is willing to engage on the matter as the proposals are taken forward.<br/><br/>As regards efficiency, the proposed reform has significant implications for the Exchequer given that the current appeals process can extend over a number of years, with collection of the disputed tax liabilities being suspended until the appeal process, including all appeals to the courts, has been exhausted.  As of last January, Revenue estimated that &euro;770 million was in question where assessments had been raised but collection could not proceed pending resolution of the disputed issues.  At any time, the total amount of tax that is in dispute is in excess of &euro;1 billion when account is taken of tax not yet assessed pending the outcome of some other case which was under appeal, as well as claims to repayment which are disputed by Revenue.</p> <p>In the case of almost 600 appeals more than five years has elapsed since the appeal was lodged, with almost 30 of these cases under appeal for more than ten years.  It is important to bear in mind that these statistics relate to the amounts in dispute.  The amount in taxes that may be liable for payment depends on the outcome of the appeals process.  Furthermore, even where liability is determined, there is no guarantee that all of the amount subject to appeal will actually accrue to the State.  In many cases, the proposals contained in the Bill will not change the amounts in dispute, but they are intended to speed up the process of resolution of disputes. <br/><br/>From the Exchequer&rsquo;s point of view, it is important that tax due is collected as quickly as possible.  Mr. Smyth will in due course outline some of the concerns Revenue has about the effect of delays in the appeals system.Equally, of course, taxpayers ought to be able to obtain certainty about their financial affairs, something that is not possible if the appeals process is long drawn out.  A number of procedural changes are being proposed which are intended to streamline the process.  I do not propose to go into them in detail.  However, one of the main changes is that an appellant will now make his or her appeal directly to the Appeal Commissioners, rather than via Revenue.  Also, the Appeal Commissioners will decide the timing of hearings and have the power to deal with an appeal, in some cases without a hearing, provided there is no objection from Revenue or the appellant.  This will possibly suit cases which are not of great import or significance.<br/><br/>Appeals in respect of which there are common or related issues can create an unnecessary burden on the appeals system.  For example, if a large number of a people used the same tax avoidance scheme, it does not make sense to allow each appellant to insist on a separate oral hearing.  The new Bill will allow the Appeal Commissioners to make the decision in one case and notify the other appellants of that decision.  Unless the other appellants can explain why a hearing is necessary or it would not be appropriate to have regard to the first decision, the commissioners will be able to decide the other appeals without a hearing.  Where there is an appeal to the High Court, the Appeal Commissioners will be responsible for drafting the case stated and the current practice of delegating this task to the party seeking the case will end.  The commissioners will also be required to draft the case stated within three months of being notified of the appeal.  This is an area in which there has been considerable delay at times in that where a case stated is being put together, the two sides may disagree and it can be a long time before the text is ready to go to court.  Originally, this process was dealt with by the Appeal Commissioners, but this has been the responsibility of the appellants and Revenue since the 1980s.  <br/><br/>In summary, the procedures set out in the heads of the Bill are aimed at preserving fairness, while reducing scope for delay.  The key policy change aimed at reducing the scope for delay is the abolition of the right to a rehearing before a judge of the Circuit Court.  As matters stand, a complete rehearing of an appeal is available to a taxpayer in the Circuit Court and such appeals are also held <i>in camera</i>.  Appellants are not confined to arguments made to the Appeal Commissioners.  There is some evidence that this right to a rehearing means that the initial appeal hearing can be a dress rehearsal.  If that does not work, we may change tack.</p> <p>Significant delays can arise in this process, particularly in court areas outside Dublin where it can be difficult to get a case listed for hearing.</p> <p> A complete rehearing would be justified if there were reasons to suppose that poor decisions on matters of fact were a particular problem in the decision making process of the appeal commissioners.  We are not aware of any evidence that this is the case.  I understand that of the 14 cases appealed to the Circuit Court in 2013, the court found in favour of the appellant in one case and in most of the others, it repeated the decision of the appeal commissioners or a settlement was reached outside the court.</p> <p> The planned reform of the appeal system envisages a better resourced and more efficient appeal commissioner stage with, for example, more flexible and active case management by the appeal commissioners.  As this will have resource implications, we have entered into discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.  </p> <p> Consideration was given to the option of continuing with the Circuit Court rehearing for cases, particularly where they involved small amounts of disputed tax liability.  However, according to the legal advice received, this would effectively mean that an appellant who was in dispute in a case involving large amounts of tax liability would potentially be treated less favourably than appellants disputing minor tax liabilities.  Having taken account of all the expressed views and arguments, the Minister considers that, on balance, the provision for full rehearing by a judge of the Circuit Court should be removed.</p> <p> I hope I have given members an understanding of the thinking underlying the legislation and the reasons the Minister believes it will enhance the independence of the appeal commissioners and increase transparency.  I will be pleased to answer any questions members may have about the proposed legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Smyth" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012700007#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to give the views of Revenue on the proposed reform.  The tax appeals system has a long history that dates back to the 19th century.  Despite the odd adjustment here and there, it remains largely unchanged since that period.  For this reason, Revenue welcomes the Minister's proposal to introduce a significant overhaul of the system.  Revenue believes the appeal process should be fair, easily accessible, expeditious and efficient and the proposed legislation will achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>  I will refer to several of the proposals that are of particular interest to Revenue.  On the proposal to allow for temporary appointments, a scenario could arise where all of the permanent appeal commissioners recuse themselves because of a conflict of interest, which would mean the appeal could not proceed.  The proposed legislation addresses this gap by allowing for temporary appointments. </p>  <p>  On the issue of independence, Mr. O'Leary has explained how the process will change from someone making an appeal via the Revenue officer to making an appeal directly to the appeal commissioners.  While this may appear to be a small change, it is an important one because it will emphasise the independence of the appeal commissioners.  Under the current system, the suspicion could arise that Revenue somehow controls the timing of the listing of appeals.  Clearly, this will not be the case under the new arrangements.  This change and some of the other changes proposed will, of necessity, impose an additional administrative burden on the commissioners.  This reform will only be successful if the Tax Appeals Commission is adequately resourced.</p> <p>As regards the procedures on appeal - there are some quite detailed provisions in the heads - it is important to understand that the cases dealt with by the Appeal Commissioners range from those where the law is clear but the facts are in dispute to very complex cases where both the facts and the law are in dispute.  To add to the commissioners&rsquo; difficulties, some of these complex cases, particularly where there is a tax avoidance scheme, can involve a large number of taxpayers.  The challenge is to come up with a system which allows for informal procedures in relatively simple cases such as situations, for example, where the taxpayer is not professionally represented, while, at the same time, giving the commissioners&rsquo; clear powers to manage more complex cases in as efficient a way as possible.  Revenue believes the proposed legislation strikes the right balance in that regard.  We also believe it is important the legislation proposes to maintain the current arrangements where an appeal can be settled by the Revenue and the appellant at any time.  This is to avoid overburdening the system.<br/><br/>As Mr O'Leary mentioned, Revenue has been concerned for some time about delays the appeals system.  There is evidence some taxpayers use the system as a way of delaying payment, as a way to buy time to dissipate assets.  The result is that even if Revenue wins the appeal, the Exchequer and the compliant majority of taxpayers still lose because in the end there are no funds to pay the tax.  An appeals system that is open to this kind of abuse is not efficient or fair to the compliant majority.<br/><br/>Delays in the courts are a wider issue which is beyond the scope of the current legislation.  However, significant delays can occur before a case gets to the courts.  These delays have been criticised in the past quite heavily by the High Court.  In short, we are hoping is that the greater power given to the Appeal Commissioners to manage their cases will help to speed up their stage in the process.<br/><br/>Another source of delay, as Mr. O&rsquo;Leary mentioned, is that the procedure for appealing to the High Court is done by way of a case stated.  This requires the Appeal Commissioners to give a statement of the facts they found, the reasons for their decision and then to ask the High Court to rule on whatever the point of law is.  This practice developed in the 1980s of delegating the drafting of the case stated to the party that was seeking the appeal.  This gives rise to inevitable delays because, of course, the parties are still in dispute and are, accordingly, reluctant to agree on anything in the circumstances.  Each party will argue over the terms of the case stated for fear of losing some advantage in the High Court.  The result is the exchange of numerous drafts of the case stated between the parties before a final draft is agreed.  The heads make it clear that the responsibility for drafting the case stated is that of the Appeals Commissioner which is what it was always intended to be.  In other words, it cannot be delegated and should be done within three months from the date the commissioner is notified that the party wants to appeal to the High Court.<br/><br/>The Circuit Court is another source of delay.  Mr O'Leary has already explained the policy in that regard.  Revenue notes if the right of a rehearing by a judge of the Circuit Court remains, then to some degree part of the reform of the Appeal Commissioners is undermined.  This is because the Appeals Commissioner will be required to issue and publish written decisions and to draft cases stated while the same requirements would not apply to a judge of the Circuit Court.  It seems incongruous to establish an expert tribunal such as the Appeal Commissioners but then allow an appeal by way of the total rehearing to a forum which does not profess to have the same expertise in tax matters.<br/><br/>On the question of transparency and the <i>in camera</i>rule, Mr O'Leary has explained the reasoning behind this proposal.  Revenue notes the argument that it would deter taxpayers from appealing.  In the past there was an <i>in camera</i>rule High Court and Supreme Court tax appeals which was removed the 1980s.  We would note that change has not deterred people from proceeding.</p></speech>

The issue of transparency is the most contentious aspect of the Bill.  It has long been a feature of our taxation system that the identity of taxpayers would remain confidential and that the detail of their dealings with Revenue would remain confidential.  What is the justification for identifying the taxpayer and the details of the case if the taxpayer takes an appeal to the Appeals Commissioner?</p></speech>

The idea in regard to the position of the Appeal Commissioners is to bring us into line with arrangements in other jurisdictions and other appeal processes in Ireland.  The Appeal Commissioners are the first forum of appeal beyond the position of dispute between the individual and Revenue itself.  As in other forums - the Information Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and so on - once the case moves beyond the relationship between the Revenue and the taxpayer, it is appropriate to have greater transparency in the process.</p></speech>

That should always be a matter of public record and will inform the approach taken by others to taxation issues but I do not grasp immediately the need for a person's identity to be revealed.  Whatever Mr. O'Leary says, it is likely to be a deterrent.  People guard their private financial information closely and the reality in Ireland is that when information is published in respect of a person's taxation affairs, it is associated with wrongdoing and under-declaring tax liability.  There will be serious resistance in that sense.  Perhaps Mr. O'Leary could talk us through the logistics.  The hearings of the Appeal Commissioners will now be held in public, so the media will, presumably, be free to attend, along with everybody else.</p></speech>

The default position would be that hearings would be in public.  It is felt that would enhance public confidence in the process and provide clarity to both taxpayers and practitioners as to the effectiveness and transparency of the system.  In the default situation the hearing would be open to members of the public and the press but there would still be a provision for the commissioners to decide that in various circumstances, such as where the case involves confidential information, sensitive commercial information, or in cases that are not of great importance - possibly if there was a small appeal on a property tax case-----</p></speech>

That is a fundamental shift in terms of the administration of taxation law in Ireland over many decades.</p></speech>

We would contend that currently there may be some people who do not know that they may have grounds for appeal.  In other words there may be people with particular tax situations, which may be grounds for appeal, but because there is no information in the public domain they do not know they could appeal them.  It is not the case that everybody will be deterred by this.  Rather, a particular group of people who, unknown to themselves have grounds for an appeal, will know, once more information becomes available, that this option is open to them.  More generally, this is becoming increasingly the norm in countries where the appeals process is held in public, including the UK, Australia and Canada.  In a sense, we believe it is important that the citizenry at large should have confidence that these appeals are conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner.</p>  <p>  In regard to the change in relation to the Circuit Court appeal, as things stand - I am open to correction by Mr. O'Leary and other colleagues on this - under the new system a taxpayer who is unhappy with a determination by Revenue can request an internal Revenue appeal or employ an external operator to undertake that appeal; choose to take a judicial review or to take up the matter with the Ombudsman; take a case to the Appeals Commissioner; take the matter to the High Court and then, if unhappy with the High Court, take up the matter with the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>Then, presumably, they could ultimately go to the European Court.</p> <p> There is a significant number of avenues for appeal, even under these streamlined proposals.  It is about trying to strike an appropriate balance in terms of the right of the citizen on the one hand, and an efficient system on the other.  In a sense, that is what we are discussing here.  As Mr. O'Leary has said, we remain open to suggestions and this is the usefulness of this process, to hear people's ideas and concerns.  We are at heads of Bill stage.  There is a balance to be struck between the appeal process being fair and the length of the appeal process.  I think Mr. O'Leary has articulated well the length of some of the appeals at the moment.</p></speech>

That needs to be dealt with.  I am sure my earlier remarks will not be misinterpreted.  If somebody is guilty of wrongdoing, I have no difficulty with them being named, as happens under the current system.  There is certainly a need for transparency in terms of the interpretation of tax law and how it is administered, but what I do not grasp - I accept that this is only heads of Bill stage - is what is being added to that by identifying the person who legitimately takes a case to the Appeal Commissioners, who holds a genuine view and whose professional advisors also hold a genuine view, that Revenue's interpretation of the law may be flawed in some way.  They are entitled to take that case and retain the principle of anonymity.  Without that, the cost of an appeal is severely increased - not the financial costs, but the cost of that veil of secrecy being removed.  That is a fundamental shift in taxation practice in Ireland and we should think long and hard about it.  That is just a view, and I accept that it is early days.  It is a debate we will have.</p></speech>

Why, though, are appeal hearings taking so long?  The question here is whether this is about revenue collection or transparency - that cuts to the heart of it.  There could be a small sole trader in business, under enormous pressure, with a practitioner advising him one thing and Revenue assessing him another way.  In some cases it could mean the difference between staying in business and going out of business.  Without anyone having committed a criminal offence, there is a dispute in interpretation between a tax practitioner and Revenue.   There is discretion with the Appeals Commissioner as to whether to hold the hearing in public or in private but that comes down to the individual type of person the commissioner is or whatever view he or she takes.  Let us say the trader runs a small shop in a village, and suddenly it is decided to hold the hearing in public.  It would destroy that business, for the sake of something relatively small.</p>  <p>  Mr. O'Leary is saying there is roughly &euro;1 billion uncollected because it is tied up in appeal hearings.</p> <p>Mr. Smyth made reference to the lack of resources.  Is this about lack of resources and revenue collection or transparency?  On the issue of transparency, there are features in the Bill which are clearly to be welcomed.  Why are appeal hearings taking so long?</p></speech>

There can be a dispute which is really only about the facts.  Take, for example, a tax payer who has not kept proper records.  There is no real dispute about the law.  The dispute is about the amount of profits for the year.  In a situation such as this, there is a dispute between the Revenue officer and the individual.  There are no records so it is necessary to make some kind of an estimate.  A lot of haggling goes on as people try to decide what is acceptable.</p></speech>

There could be a range.  Many of these cases will be settled before they go near an appeal hearing.  When it is not possible to reach agreement, some third party has to make a decision on it.  This is the Appeals Commissioner.  I would not expect a case such as this to take very long to be decided or that there would be a delay.  Delays tend to arise in higher value cases and in tax avoidance cases in which a person will go to the Appeals Commissioner because it is the first stage, but there are other stages afterwards.  The last very big, high-profile tax avoidance case that was heard by the Supreme Court was in 2011.  I can speak of it because it was a reported case.  In that case, the transactions took place in 1991.  It took 20 years before it was completed.  The Deputy is correct.  In the small cases, there is no reason why it should take a long time.  However, in the big ones, where big money is at stake, those kind of-----</p></speech>

If there is an abuse of the system, it must be curbed.  Some people may be using the system to kick the can down the road for ten or 20 years.  The small shopkeeper or the small businessman will not have the resources to do this.  However, he could find himself in a public hearing with his customers in attendance and it being reported, and it could destroy his business.  What can be done to curb the abuse of the system and to speed up the collection of taxes but at the same time to strike balance which avoids a public hearing with unintended consequences that could be very damaging?  This is fair comment.  We are at pre-scrutiny stage.  I am always looking for balance and fairness.  If there are people who abuse the system, they should be pursued.  However, if there is a legitimate dispute between Revenue and a tax practitioner or a person in business, which is why we have the Appeals Commissioner, is the balance of fairness tipped too much by holding these hearings in public?</p></speech>

We cannot argue that we are getting rid of the Circuit Court because the appeals commissioners stage is a dress rehearsal and then argue that the point of law is so broad that the High Court hearing is really a rehearing of the case.</p>  <p>  It appears that the system is broken.  We have unacceptable delays, and I do not support these delays, but our justice system is not fit to cope.</p> <p>I am sure people tear their hair out when they see how long appeals are on the books and how assets disappear by the time a decision is made.  The system is broken, it is not being fixed, therefore the option should be taken away.</p> <p> The problem is that six individuals in the past four years won and justice was served in their cases because they had the right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  Without that right they might not have been in a position to receive justice and in one case the State, through the Revenue Commissioners, would have been in similar circumstances.  Is there another way of doing this without removing the right because I would be very reluctant to withdraw a pillar of justice from individuals?</p> <p> Mr. Smyth asked why the High Court should be allowed to re-hear this when it does not have the expertise.  However, is that not a challenge to our entire legal system?  Why allow the system adjudicate on anything because in many matters that come before it, whether financial wrongdoing or criminal activity, is it not the case that the adjudicators in our Circuit Court have the expertise to weigh up the arguments on all sides and make a decision in a formal way, as opposed to the informal way the Appeal Commissioners would have made decisions in the past?</p></speech>

Can he clarify whether somebody who loses after an appeal to the appeals commissioner before taking it to the next stage, whether that be the Circuit Court today, or in the future to the High Court on a point of law, pays only the disputed amount or pays the amount the appeals commissioner has adjudicated on?</p></speech>

The current appeals process, for whatever reason, is cumbersome and does not seem to be capable of delivering decisions within a reasonable period.  The proposed legislation will effectively disenfranchise people from a particular right they currently have to appeal to the Circuit Court for a full re-hearing.</p>  <p>  To what extent could many of the difficulties with the delays in the system be dealt with by putting relevant time limits into the existing legislation?  There is no prohibition on that.  I am thinking of planning law, for example, and other quasi-judicial functions operated by other bodies where there are appeals to the Circuit Court.  If time limits are an issue and if the capacity of the system to process correctly and deliver timely decisions is at issue, I am not necessarily convinced that removing somebody's legal rights to a particular avenue, namely access to the Circuit Court, is the way to go.</p>  <p>  It is not as though many people are using this access.  When I first heard the officials' statements, I had the impression that access to the Circuit Court for re-hearings was being used by hundreds of people as a way to avoid paying up.  However, their response to Deputy Pearse Doherty suggests that 14 people used that avenue, which is hardly a very significant number of people.  Have the officials thoroughly considered putting additional measures into the existing legislation, in other words, time limits whereby decisions could be reached in a timely manner because it is not just in the interests of Revenue, but is in the interests of people who are challenging Revenue to ensure that time limits are within legislation and are robust?</p>  <p>  Would the officials accept that people are afraid of the Revenue Commissioners because it is certainly my clear view that they are?  I certainly accept the concern that has been voiced by Deputy O'Donnell.  It is my experience, having worked as a solicitor, that people are terrified of the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>The notion of an appeal requiring people to go public on their tax affairs would do what Revenue is tying to achieve, which is exact greater compliance, but for all the wrong reasons and from all the wrong taxpayers.  The small taxpayer who does not have the resources to go to the High Court on a point of law and who lives in a small community where the people most interested in their tax affairs are from the local newspaper or radio station would not use an appeals system under which their tax affairs would be brought into the public domain.  The Irish Tax Institute requested that cases in which smaller amounts are in dispute, say of less than &euro;50,000, should be exempt.  Some Revenue legislation has too much of a one-size-fits-all approach and it is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Why has the Department ruled out a more user-friendly system for those with smaller issues with Revenue?<br/><br/>Mr. Tobin and Mr. Smyth said that holding appeals in public as opposed to<i>in camera</i>, as is the case currently, would give people more information about the issues in respect of which a taxpayer could make an appeal.  There is a role for the Revenue in this regard to ensure whatever means is available, including the Internet and liaising with tax practitioners, is used to make sure people know the grounds on which successful tax appeals can be made.  Mr. Smyth suggested his organisation is not doing that.<br/><br/>Why are no registered precedents from the appeal commissioners published?  Surely the place to start if Revenue wants to improve compliance and give the public information about its processes is to ensure there is a register of precedents, with the names of individuals redacted, which makes clear the grounds for making decisions.<br/><br/>Can Revenue deal with delays by amending existing legislation to ensure timelines are complied with?  Mr. Smyth is correct that compliance will improve because people will not appeal.  The bottom line is they are afraid of Revenue.  The organisation should examine its own practices.  The improvements Mr. Smyth says changing the system will bring about will make small taxpayers, particularly in rural areas, more uncomfortable.  The improvements could be brought about through a more robust public information campaign without destroying the current <i>in camera</i>scenario.  Unfortunately, there is a perception that if people's names appear in connection with the Revenue Commissioners at all, it is because they are not being compliant.  The organisation will have a difficult job to get over that hurdle with ordinary taxpayers who are not into it for millions of euro and who would not use the High Court or the European Court of Justice on a point of law.</p></speech>

One of the issues is the appeal system has not changed for a long time.  Mr. Smyth said it goes back to the 19th century.  Our reason, and that of the Minister for Finance, for bringing forward the legislation is to modernise and improve the process.  A number of years ago, the representative bodies and stakeholders, including the Institute of Taxation and Chartered Accountants Ireland, came to us and asked for reform of the system.  Were it not for the financial crisis and other issues, we would have liked to reform the system sooner but, unfortunately, we have the system we have and we are now trying to reform it.</p> <p>If there are any concerns about proposed reforms then sometimes nothing can happen and perhaps that is what has happened in the past.  Therefore, one is left with a very imperfect system and nothing changes.  We have deliberately tried to put forward a very modern and transparent system.  We have been mindful of the fact that this is the way in which systems, increasingly, are moving.</p> <p> It has been alluded to that taxpayers are afraid of the Revenue Commissioners.  I work for the Department of Finance and do not think anyone is afraid of us.  One of the ways in which we could reduce some of the fear - if there is any - about the Revenue Commissioners is if there was more transparency around some of the appeals processes.  It seems to me that this matter is a bit of a black box.  People do not know how the appeals system works and one could rightly accuse various stakeholders for that situation.  Perhaps a bit more transparency would help reduce some of the fear but that is just my thought on the matter. </p> <p> There is a danger that if we do not grasp the nettle, in this whole area, it is quite likely we will be left with a very imperfect system which would be a pity.  Clearly, there are differences on specific points, around some of the issues mentioned, between us and the stakeholders.  However, there is probably more on which we agree on in terms of the need for reform.  My colleague, Mr. O'Leary, will comment on time limits.  </p></speech>

The Office of the Attorney General has advised us that, on equity grounds, one would leave taxpayers with a much larger case in a less favourable position than the person who had a small amount at stake.  My answer also relates to leaving the Circuit Court stage in or not.<br/><br/>On whether some limits could be set below which cases could be heard <i>in camera</i>by the commissioners, even within the proposals that would be a decision open to the commissioners.  Under the new provisions they could decide, on a number of grounds, whether a case should be heard <i>in camera</i>.  Whether it should be specified in the legislation is something that we could consider.</p></speech>

Without wishing to dismiss Senator Hayden's suggestion, which is interesting, I think time limits can be very difficult to enforce unless there is some kind of real sanction.</p> <p> On the question of it being Revenue's job to inform people about tax law, we do have that responsibility and we take it very seriously.  We publish all our manuals indicating our practices and our interpretation of the law.  The difficulty concerning the appeal commissioners is that they do not publish written decisions.  It is impossible for Revenue to take on that role when we do not have a written decision from the person who is actually making it.  That is part of what the heads of Bill are trying to do.</p></speech>

If that happens, I think the problem to which Senator Hayden has alluded will go away.  In all the debate about transparency, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that there are a lot of other ways of trying to address the problems in the system, such as delays and the lack of written decisions.  We should not just concentrate on the transparency issue - these other things are also quite important.</p></speech>

How many commissioners are there, how many staff do they have, and what sort of budget are they operating with?</p>  <p>  Regarding the six Circuit Court cases that went in favour of the taxpayer, to which Deputy Doherty referred, was any of those cases appealed by Revenue or was the Circuit Court opinion accepted?</p>  <p>  Regarding the maximum assessment that Mr. O'Leary mentioned, he said there might be an issue about inequality between those paying a lot and those paying little.  How strong is that?  I have no doubt it will come up in discussion when we talk about this legislation on later Stages.</p>  <p>  Regarding the fact that an individual can go back to the Circuit Court after going to the Appeal Commissioners, did a constitutional issue crop up during the discussion on this?  Why can the person go right back to stage one again?  Is there a constitutional issue that means we have no choice but to let this option be available?</p>  <p> This next question probably cannot be answered now but details might be submitted to the secretariat.  Could Revenue give some background information on the individuals or groups it sees as having gotten away with it by dragging the appeals for so long?  Is there evidence that assets were disposed of and that, when Revenue came knocking, there was nothing left to take?  Could we also have a little more detail on the &euro;1 billion breakdown?  I know we are talking about 600 or 700 cases at any one time, which would also reflect on other cases.  Does that broaden out to 1,000 cases?  If we are talking about 1,000 cases and &euro;1 billion, we are not talking about small change but significant assessments that have been made and have been delayed.  A little more detail on this would help us in our deliberations when this comes to us as a piece of legislation.  </p></speech>

We anticipate this.  The six appealed cases were appealed mainly by the individual taxpayers, not by Revenue.  The capital acquisitions tax is the only tax in respect of which Revenue has scope to appeal.  Mr. Smyth may wish to comment further on this.<br/><br/>On the issue of maximum assessment, if one were to decide that certain cases could go to the Circuit Court and that other cases would have to go before the appeal court, there would be a reverse equality issue as one would be giving less favourable terms to a taxpayer in dispute with Revenue over a much greater amount of tax.  This person is also possibly more likely to be someone using the system to his or her maximum advantage.  <br/><br/>On Senator Aideen Hayden's suggestion of setting, at Appeal Commissioners level, an assessment level below which any issue could be dealt with <i>in camera</i>, we have left scope within the legislation for the commissioners to decide, on various unspecified grounds, if a case should be held <i>in camera</i>.  There may be a case for having a specific limit.  However, if an amount is specified, we will automatically have to deal with cases with figures slightly below or above it and how to revise the level over time.  However, there is scope for looking at the issue further. <br/><br/>The possibility of there being a constitutional issue was mentioned in respect of the Circuit Court.  There is no constitutional reason requiring a Circuit Court appeal, nor is there a constitutional ban on removing it.  There is also the issue of assets disposed of and the amount in dispute.</p></speech>

To clarify one point in the statistics quoted by Mr. O'Leary for the Circuit Court, these are cases in which Revenue has appointed counsel.  I cannot say these are all of the cases involved.  If a case has gone before the High Court or the Supreme Court, counsel would definitely have been engaged.  It is possible that there are cases in the Circuit Court in which what is really in dispute is the facts and the amount of the profits involved.  It is possible that some of these cases are not included in the numbers provided.</p></speech>

These may be very noble, honourable people and it may bring a bit of realism to what is happening.  It is a bit too much.  I have raised the following matter in regard to other legislation and perhaps there is a reason it is not in this proposed legislation.  While a person who is standing for election to the European Parliament, D&aacute;il or Seanad cannot be an Appeals Commissioner, a person standing for election to the Presidency can.  I am not sure what the difference is, because we all have a role in legislation.<br/><br/>There has been a discussion on tax transparency.  While I support tax transparency and understand the concerns raised, Deputy Rabbitte is one of the people who put on the record here a statement about a decision by a former Appeals Commissioner to overturn the Revenue's decision on the &euro;2 million liability of the late Charles Haughey, a former Taoiseach.  The Appeals Commissioner in question was appointed by another former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who happened to be his brother in law at the time.  Tax transparency is very important not just to ensure that the public sees justice being administered publicly but also to ensure the Appeal Commissioners make their decisions in the full glare of public scrutiny and thus have their integrity upheld.  It is very important that it happens and I support it.  The witnesses' submission referred to broad scope and the concept that the Appeal Commissioners could decide that a hearing would be held <i>in camera</i>.  I would not like that to be abused when larger firms or corporations, the so-called more important people in society, come before the Appeal Commissioners.</p></speech>

Finance Bills are often associated in the public mind with the question of how much tax gets collected.  This proposed Bill, is no less important because it focuses on how tax in dispute is to be collected.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts an unusual degree of latitude in the conduct of its business.  An efficient and effective mechanism for the resolution of disputes between Revenue and taxpayers is, therefore, essential.  This Bill redefines how the mechanism should work.</p>  <p>  My organisation represents the 40,000 or so accountants working in Ireland, many of whom are involved directly with the operation of the tax system.  We had been making the case, long before the consultations in 2013 which preceded this Bill, that the Office of the Appeal Commissioners must be organised in a cost efficient manner.  The appeals process should be informal and easily accessed by taxpayers.  Tax is a cost to the taxpayer as is the tax compliance process.  A remedy for overcharged tax which itself is too costly is no remedy nor is the necessity from time to time to make an appeal confined only to business or to the self-employed taxpayer.  All taxpayers need a right of recourse, whether their appeal concerns a matter as complex as their trading status, or a matter as apparently straightforward as a local property tax postponement.</p>  <p>  The key criterion for evaluating this Bill, which creates a new tax appeals commission, is straightforward.  Will a taxpayer be able to remedy an incorrect assessment or resolve a difference of opinion with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners without undue delay or cost using this new Commission?  If the answer is "Yes", then all else being equal, the legislation should proceed.  A new tax appeals commission will not eliminate the adversarial nature of the tax collection process, nor should it.  It will also not  result in the simplification of the tax process.  However, the legislation underpinning the new commission should attempt to avoid two major pitfalls. </p>  <p>  The first of these pitfalls is that delay gets built into the system.</p> <p>In this regard, it would appear that the commissioners will have extensive powers to determine the conduct and timing of appeals.  The second matter to be avoided is undue secrecy, while having proper regard to the privacy and confidentiality of the taxpayer's affairs.  A major drawback of the current system is the lack of clarity on matters and outcomes already considered by the Appeal Commissioners.  The proposed new regime has provision to reduce, if not entirely eliminate, the waste associated with rehearings on similar issues, coupled with measures to make the precedence value of previous determinations more accessible.  The heads of the Bill we have been asked to consider for this meeting reflect genuine attempts to avoid these two pitfalls.  We will be happy to explore these points further with the committee over the course of the discussions.</p> <p> Many taxpayers have in the past opted to avail of professional representation when dealing with matters coming before the Appeal Commissioners.  There has been a tendency in recent Finance Bills to favour the legal profession over representatives from other professions when acting on behalf of taxpayers.  For example, members of the legal profession do not have the same obligations to report tax avoidance schemes to Revenue and while Revenue has the power to report misconduct to the professional accountancy bodies as represented by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies - Ireland, CCAB-I, my organisation, this power does not extend to similar reporting in regard to the legal profession.  We would be keen to see that this thread of preference would not get extended into the current Bill. </p> <p> We believe that the type of legislative process currently being exemplified - legislation produced following public consultation with the heads of the Bill being discussed at Oireachtas committee as we have today - contributes to the formulation of good and consistent law and we are happy to contribute to the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cora O'Brien" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012700024#BB00200"><p>Reform of the tax appeal system has been a priority for the Irish Tax Institute for many years.  As far back as 2008, we published a comprehensive report on the rules and procedures governing Irish tax appeals.  Our appeal system has been very outdated and in need of reform for a long time.  This consultative process is therefore an important step in getting our system right.  We welcome the fact that major reform of the appeals process is now underway, by way of new legislation, and that attention is being given to the matter by the Government and by members of the Oireachtas, especially this committee.<br/><br/>An appeals mechanism is an intrinsic part of an equitable tax administration system and should deliver equal treatment for all taxpayer groups at low compliance cost.  That is why this issue is so important and deserves attention.  A number of measures in the new heads of Bill are very welcome, including the publication of determinations in an annual report, tighter and more transparent procedures, generally, governing the management of the appeals process for everyone, and a better regime for the appointment, tenure and removal of the Appeal Commissioners.  However, there are two fundamental changes proposed in the heads of Bill that are of concern to the Irish Tax Institute.  These are the abolition of the <i>in camera </i>rule so that all tax appeals will be heard in public and the removal of the taxpayer's option for a Circuit Court rehearing.<br/><br/>Taking the first of these issues, the new Bill proposes to remove confidentiality in the appeals process after 50 years by abolishing the <i>in camera</i>rule.  Taxpayer confidentiality has been at the heart of the Irish tax administration system for almost 50 years and it has been one of the pillars on which our system has been built.  The 1967 Income Tax Acts introduced solemn declarations to be made by the Appeal Commissioners and by Revenue officers which included references to keeping taxpayer information confidential.  It has served the system well and we have compliance rates on tax of up to 99% in this country.  There has been talk in this session about the practice of other countries and a move towards publication.  We need an appeals system that is suitable for our country.  We are a small country in terms of population, no bigger than a mid-sized city in the UK.  Countries such as New Zealand do not have publication.  It is a small economy also and points to the fact that not everyone is going down this road.<br/><br/>The removal of the right to confidentiality is even more serious because the consultation carried out did not mention or propose this issue.  Any proposed change to the <i>in camera</i>rule goes to the heart of the system.  This was not made clear to the public in the consultation.  Taxpayers may feel that they have a genuine case to appeal but they are going to be forced to reveal the most personal aspects of their finances in order to enter the appeals process.</p> <p> While it is clear that all parties here seek transparency of process, this can be done without naming taxpayers and putting under the spotlight their financial information.  There is precedent for this in the family courts that is worth exploring.  The Irish model of publication for tax defaulters has been in existence for 20 years and rightly or wrongly, the public associates publication with wrongdoing.  Publishing taxpayer names and details in appeal cases could infer easily in their minds that the taxpayer has not behaved appropriately or has done something wrong.  It is not clear whether there will be any limitations on media access to these hearings.  Media interest is likely to be high and the taxpayer could be portrayed wrongly as having problems with Revenue or being somehow non-compliant.  Experience to date is that the reporting of taxpayers who have a Revenue issue can portray them as tax evaders, which is not the case in this regard.</p> <p> The second issue is that taxpayers will be forced to appeal to the High Court, should they not accept the decisions of Appeal Commissioners.  At present, a taxpayer has the option of having the facts of the case reheard at the Circuit Court if he or she loses the appeal.  This is an important option for taxpayers because few can afford to take the matter directly to the High Court.  It appears as though this option is being removed in the heads of the Bill and taxpayers who do not agree with the decision of the Appeal Commissioners must appeal directly to the High Court.  This is a prohibitively expensive option for all but the biggest taxpayers.  As losing at the High Court will cost a taxpayer approximately &euro;100,000 at a minimum, no average taxpayer could afford this process.  It therefore discriminates against the average taxpayer and will be a significant deterrent to average taxpayers seeking a hearing on a tax issue.  It is not clear why the Circuit Court rehearing before the taxpayer has been removed.  In summary, the combined effect of holding the case in public and removing the taxpayer's option for a Circuit Court rehearing means that a taxpayer must now make a stark choice either to pay the amount Revenue states he or she owes - even if the taxpayer does not believe it is correct and fair - or have his or her financial details published for everyone in the country to see and, if they lose at appeal, to go directly to the High Court with all the expense involved.  We do not believe this is fair to taxpayers.</p> <p> There are a number of other related issues in the heads of the Bill, including the need for timely issuance of determinations, the importance of appropriate staffing for the office and the need for a hearing in each individual case.  In our submission on the consultation, the Irish Taxation Institute also recommended the establishment of a separate forum for small cases involving less than &euro;50,000, which is not mentioned in the heads of the Bill.  I am conscious that there is limited time to address these issues and have focused my opening remarks on matters of greatest concern to taxpayers.  I thank members for the time and look forward to any questions they might have.</p></speech>

I am a tax partner in William Fry's tax advisers, Tax and Ireland, and have experience in tax litigation matters.  In summary, we welcome many of the proposals.  We seek greater clarity in some areas and the main proposals with which we have concerns are the holding of tax appeal cases in public, the removal of the right to a full rehearing in the Circuit Court and the proposed case stated procedure.</p>  <p>  I will now give my comments on the main sections of the Bill and in areas to be welcomed, I refer to the independence of the tax appeal commission.  To have an effective tax appeal system in Ireland, the tax appeal commission must be and must be seen to be a totally independent body.  Any measures enabling the development of a wholly independent appeals body are to be welcomed.  In respect of the withdrawal and dismissal of cases, this section gives legislative effect to the pre-existing practice set out in Revenue's tax and duty appeals manual and this is to be welcomed.  On flexible proceedings, a flexible approach to tax appeals is practical and is to be welcomed.  There may be an opportunity in this regard to include reference to the burden of proof.  We do not believe that the burden should rest on the taxpayer in all circumstances and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis as a preliminary matter by the Appeal Commissioners.  As for pre-hearing proceedings, it is clear that a significant focus of the new legislation is on settling the matter before reaching a hearing.  Mechanisms that enable this, such as deciding the issue at a preliminary hearing or adjudication without a hearing, are positive developments so long as the taxpayer always maintains the right to choose a full hearing.  Such mechanisms, if used by parties, should reduce waiting times and make the tax appeal system more efficient.  In respect of determinations, it is essential that a comprehensive database of decisions is created.</p> <p>We submit it is possible to achieve this without the introduction of public hearings.  Taxpayers and their advisers should have access to previous determinations, as it would assist them from the outset in deciding whether it is appropriate to take an appeal against any matter in the first place.</p> <p> Areas to be clarified include the issue of temporary commissioners.  This section should outline specific criteria as to when a temporary commissioner should be appointed.  As we set out in our submissions, a defined set of criteria is necessary to ensure that temporary commissioners are in fact used.  We note that the Bill does not envisage a body of suitably qualified persons being formed from which to appoint a temporary commissioner.  The use of such a body may be easier and more efficient.  As for notice of appeal, this section does not appear to include a time limit in which the taxpayer must issue a notice of appeal.  For the sake of clarity, it is suggested that a time limit be inserted.  In respect of valid appeal, it is suggested that the definition of "appealable matter" be made more clear.  On the refusal to accept an appeal, the wording currently is highly subjective and to safeguard the taxpayer, we suggest an objective, reasonable standard should be required such as, for example, where the Appeal Commissioners conclude on reasonable grounds that an appeal is without substance or foundation.  Denying a taxpayer access to a hearing must be done in an objective and transparent manner.</p> <p> I will now turn to the main areas of concern.  In our opinion, the introduction of the public hearing of tax appeal cases before the Appeal Commissioners will constitute a disincentive to taxpayers appealing a tax matter on the basis that individuals and corporate bodies generally wish to maintain privacy over their tax affairs and finances.  The grounds listed as reasons for holding a hearing in private are limited and vague.  In addition, the threshold for maintaining an application based on these grounds is unclear.  If ultimately it is considered necessary to introduce public hearings, we submit the reporting of such hearings should be restricted to protect the privacy of the taxpayer.  For example, in family law proceedings, although reporters are allowed access to hearings, their reporting cannot identify parties expressly or implicitly.  In addition, a party to the proceedings may apply to the court to have reporters excluded on the basis that the facts of the case are so specific that any degree of reporting would identify the parties.</p> <p> In respect of appealing against determinations of the Appeal Commissioners, we disagree fundamentally with the removal of the rights for a full rehearing before the Circuit Court.  It removes a fundamental safeguard to the taxpayer.  An appeal by way of case stated is a highly specific form of legal appeal based solely on a point of law.  Therefore, the taxpayer has no general right of appeal against the decision of the Appeal Commissioners, which is highly unusual in the context of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.  In respect of the envisaged case stated procedure, it is unclear from the Bill but in our opinion, the parties to the proceeding should be given a right to agree to the content of the case stated as drafted by the Appeal Commissioner before it is transmitted to the High Court.  We also believe that if the Appeals Commissioner drafts the case stated, then the commissioner should transmit it to the High Court.</p> <p> In respect of evidence, we query the appropriateness of the ability of the Appeal Commissioners to admit evidence regardless of whether the evidence would be admissible in proceedings in a court of law in the State.  This has the potential to deny parties fair procedures.  The criteria for the admission of evidence should be based on more objective grounds.  For example, evidence should be admissible if it is reasonable to consider that the admission of evidence is necessary to decide the matter.  This concludes my opening statement.  I am happy to discuss any points raised and hope my comments will inform the committee in its finalisation of the Bill.  I reiterate that I am grateful for the opportunity to make a presentation to members today.</p></speech>

I have them all to myself today, apart from the Vice Chairman.  While the committee agrees to a lot of different hearings, many members then fail to turn up.  I acknowledge that Deputy Michael McGrath is attending to banking inquiring matters and I have been caught up in some of those as well.  The core area the witnesses have in common with one another - they should correct me if I am wrong - is that the main concern is the holding of the appeal in public.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether the witnesses are aware of this but I mentioned a case earlier that already had been mentioned on the record here in which an Appeal Commissioner overturned a decision of Revenue and which involved two former Taoisigh through the appointment and the person involved.</p> <p>Questions were raised on that case but we are not here to adjudicate on it.  The fact is that the case was held in private.  We will never know.  Is this not about creating transparency, accountability and more faith in a system that was previously closed and heard by commissioners who were appointed by the politicians of the day?  I do not see the extent of the issue.  </p> <p>  Let us get to the core of the question.  We heard earlier that in 2013, there were 14 appeals to the Circuit Court.  I am sure that the Revenue Commissioners made many decisions and in my view that number of appeals does not seem very large.  We are told that of the 14 cases that were appealed, the original decision was upheld in nine cases, three cases were settled and in one case, it went in favour of the individual.  In the nine cases that were upheld, there may have been an option to appeal further, however if there was such an appeal it would be heard in open court.  Do the witnesses know the number of cases that were appealed to the High Court in the past number of years?  Is the fact that a case in the High Court is heard in open court a deterrent to individuals exerting his or her right of appeal?</p></speech>

The Appeal Commissioners' system is not a court, it is an administrative adjudication process.  Whereas there are certain rules around publication and public hearings that are right and proper for a court, this is a process that happens before one gets to court.</p>  <p>  I will deal with the points raised earlier.  If a taxpayer has a dispute with Revenue - one of my colleagues mentioned the various routes open to the taxpayer- we must strike a balance between the rights of the taxpayer and the issue of transparency.  If there is a disagreement on a point of law, the taxpayer has only one choice, he or she must go to the Appeal Commissioners.  The Appeal Commissioners' process is independent and is set in a pre-court setting where an independent person makes a decision or an adjudication.  That has worked very well up to now.  We have a very good compliance rate in this country.  Part of the reason is that there is a respect for taxpayer confidentiality.  My concern is with perception, something that is very hard to gauge.  When a taxpayer gets an assessment from Revenue, he or she must decide whether to appeal it.  In reaching that decision, he or she is setting out on a path which could ultimately lead him or her to the High Court.  Some taxpayers will be prepared and will be able to afford to go all the way.  That is their choice.</p>  <p>  However, there is an interim process, where one can have the facts of the case heard and as long as the facts are published, what is including the name of the taxpayer going to add to the information that is in the public domain?  One can have a transparent process and everybody acknowledges the need for a such process because we all need to find out what is happening in the cases that go to the Appeal Commissioners.  We do not even know how many cases are going through in a year at this stage.  It could be 50 or up to 300 cases.  It is very important to have the process, and the facts and the decisions of the cases published.  However, our members, who are working with taxpayers and dealing with the day-to-day practicality of facing the possibility of having all of one's data in the public domain, question whether the taxpayer should be named publicly.</p></speech>

Is she suggesting she would like to see all of the data, bar the name of the taxpayer concerned, in the public domain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cora O'Brien" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012700028#FF00200"><p>I am indicating what would happen if the process of going to the Appeal Commissioners was fully public - I am not saying it is the right thing to do - with access to media and full reporting.  All of the information, including personal information, by necessity, would have to come up for discussion at an appeal hearing to enable the Appeal Commissioners to make the proper decision.  They often need details of assets, bank accounts and income.  If that information is in the public arena, it will be fully on display for the world to see.  The problem is that it will not encourage taxpayers to take that path.  It is already difficult because of the cost of appealing an assessment and many choose not to take it, perhaps because the tax amount at issue is not large enough to warrant incurring costs and fees.  They also face the fact that, whatever way the case goes, everybody in town will know their affairs and what they have.  That is not exactly conducive to engaging in the process.  What is the cost benefit to the system from having done it?  As my colleague pointed out, this is what is done in the family courts.  One can have the principles ventilated in public and everybody knows what the Appeal Commissioners think of an issue, without having a person's name published with the information.  We are concerned to get the balance right.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that tax law is laid down in legislation and that if one decides not to pay one's tax liability - I am on record as not having paid my local property tax voluntarily which is being deducted from me at source - one is in breach of the law?  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners who are empowered by law to actually make the adjudication have found an individual to be in breach of the law.  If the individual decides to appeal Revenue's decision, why should the case not be held in public?  Is the fact that High Court cases are heard in public a deterrent in taking an appeal to the High Court?  On the other countries that have moved in the direction of providing for transparency in tax matters in the case of appeal - Ms O'Brien mentioned New Zealand - is she aware from studies or research of a drop-off in the number of appeals?</p></speech>

It is not a case of the taxpayer not paying his or her tax liability when he or she decides to appeal but of him or her not agreeing with the assessment.  A person is fully entitled to appeal an assessment and still be within the law.  This is part of the problem.  There will be a mix-up of what has happened in these cases.  People reading about them will think the taxpayers concerned have breached the law. They have not; rather, they are availing of their entitlement to disagree and take the case to the Appeal Commissioners.  Everything surrounding the issue is then attached to that person and his or her personal reputation.  There are so many grey areas that I have concerns that people will be afraid to appeal because it will look as if they have done something wrong, that they have breached the law, when they have not.  That is a very important principle that we need to ensure is enshrined.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on whether the fact that cases are heard in public in the High Court acts as a deterrent to appealing Revenue's decisions to the High Court, I am not aware if any study has been conducted, but I can check to see if there is research on what happens to the pattern if the rules are changed.  A person who goes through the appeals process has to sit down and reach a decision on whether he or she will take the next step and incur very large expenditure in taking the case to the High Court.  He or she has to answer that question.</p> <p>It is a big decision, to which there are many aspects, and he or she takes it when he or she has exhausted the appeals process.  I do not think it warrants him or her having to make it at the outset.  The person is not being given a chance to explore the possibility that his or her view of what should be paid, which is different from that of Revenue, might be right.  He or she has not had a chance to have that issue discussed and adjudicated on in a confidential setting and then to move to the open public court.  Everybody fully agrees with this.  We do not agree with imposing the publicity and everything that goes with it on the person concerned, taking the whole set of rules from the judicial system and placing it in this process.</p></speech>

In a dispute between an individual and Revenue does the individual have no ability to engage with Revenue as it comes up with that determination?  Is it not the case that the individual is engaging with it and that, therefore, there is a confidential process in which that engagement with Revenue happens, directly or indirectly, through the person&rsquo;s accountant?  Only after a determination has been made and the confidential process exhausted does it go to a public process.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right.  Having agreed to disagree, the only place to take it is into the appeal regime.  In the initial forum, with an independent person adjudicating, it is right that it should not be aired in an open forum.  I would have to be convinced of the benefits to the system versus the downside - disenfranchising people or making them unwilling to engage in going further or even beyond the first step of the assessment.</p></speech>

I agree with everything Ms O&rsquo;Brien said.  My fear is that making the tax appeal system open to the public would be a disincentive to taking a case.  One has a constitutional right to access the courts, but if one is afraid to have one&rsquo;s affairs dealt with in open court, that right is infringed.</p>  <p>  In respect of the case stated, I do not think the Deputy will find the information he wants such as how many cases do not reach High Court level.  From recollection, the Revenue Commissioners publish details of cases stated that are in being, dealt with or withdrawn.  Unless one has a poll of tax practitioners around the country, I do not think one would find that information.</p>  <p>  In terms of what comes before the courts in a case stated document, under the current system, the Appeals Commissioner is in charge of that document.  The aggrieved party asks for a case to be stated and signed for the opinion of the High Court.  The aggrieved party drafts the case stated and inserts into it a summary of the facts found and the determination of the Appeals Commissioner.  There could be a summary of oral evidence given and the question is posed for the determination of the High Court.  That is a written document which goes into the High Court office and presented to the parties on the day and handed to the judge.  Parts of the document may or may not be read in open court.  Copies should probably not make their way into the public domain, but anyone present is perfectly entitled to listen to the discussion and so on and may or may not be able to follow it. </p> <p>In terms of the deliberations it is not like the Circuit or District Courts where one would expect to see cross-examination of witnesses and so on.  The High Court judge is presented with a question of law: has the Appeals Commissioner erred in a point of law in finding for or against the tax payer.  A very limited amount of information gets into the public domain.</p></speech>

I do not subscribe to the notion that because somebody is in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners everybody will assume he or she is a defaulter.  The public is far too clever for that.  It is well able to distinguish between somebody who is genuinely in tax default and somebody who has a dispute over the way his or her tax affairs are being handled.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s point that from time to time in the course of appeal hearings matters which may be commercially sensitive might be discussed, such as the kind of margins the taxpayer&rsquo;s business has, or some research and development it is engaging in which, if it was discussed in open court, could damage the business.  We need to be careful when we talk about hearings in open court that we do not damage those kinds of commercial considerations.</p>  <p>  One point in the heads of the Bill that might be worthy of further exploration is that the appeals commissioners are given extraordinary discretion in this proposed Bill as to what should or should not be publishable, who can or cannot attend an appeal hearing, and we would, as a minimum, like to see those powers a little more tightly defined and a little better scoped.  That kind of approach might just as easily help deal with the kind of concerns rightly expressed about tax payer confidentiality.</p></speech>

How many appeal hearings take place annually?</p></speech>

Perhaps our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners could help with that because they would be party to every appeal.  As a representative body we have no published information about how many appeal hearings there are.</p></speech>

The kind of data that would be made public in an appeal case would be extensive.  Do any data protection issues arise?  What a field day for anybody trying to pull a scam or steal an identity on the Internet, to be sitting in one of these public hearings where the person discloses all sorts of private financial information.  To what extent does a privacy issue arise?  For those 50 or 60 cases do the Revenue Commissioners really require this type of power, which seriously invade privacy, to do their job properly?</p></speech>

We had difficulties identifying how many cases were going through the process.  We have to try to reconcile the very legitimate concerns about taxpayer privacy and confidentiality with the legitimate concern to ensure that adjudication is seen to be open, transparent and fair.</p> <p> Another problem with the Appeal Commissioners' process that can be overlooked is where the rubber hits the road.  One of the great values of the process is that it tells us, for example, that if one hires somebody on these terms will Revenue treat them as an employee or does a certain kind of research qualify for research and development exemptions?  There is great precedential value out of the Appeal Commissioners&rsquo; hearings.  If we lose that, we will lose an intrinsic part of the appeals process.</p> <p> Perhaps we need to have a little more regard for what happens internationally.  For example, in the UK it is an open court.  I am not in a position to say if that type of process has damaged businesses there but I believe we could benefit from studying that much more.  The trick will be to ensure that we know, to a reasonable extent, what is going on with the appeals process and the precedential value of those kind of decisions while, at the same time, ensuring no taxpayer is put at a commercial or personal disadvantage by how the hearings are conducted.  It is not clear to us if the heads of the Bill will achieve that.</p></speech>

Do we know the value of those cases in tax terms?  In his opening statement, Mr. Des O'Leary from the Department of Finance stated, "As of last January, Revenue estimated that &euro;770 million was in question where assessments had been raised but collection could not proceed pending resolution of the disputed issues".  That would imply the issue around Revenue disputes is enormous.  To what extent is this to do with the appeals process?  Alternatively, is it due to other processes in the revenue system?</p></speech>

We are in an abyss in that we do not know what is happening.  That is the way we have been working for the past 30 years with this process.  We do not know what cases are going through, or the issues or how much tax is involved.  We do not know how many times the same type of cases are heard and a decision made.  We do not know how many people have to go through the system again and pay all the money when publication of a decision could have enlightened them that they were right or wrong.</p>  <p>  I have a concern about the grounds when the Appeal Commissioners can take the matter to a private hearing.  Those grounds are in the heads of the Bill.  They specifically state nothing in the section shall be taken to mean the grounds on which access to the hearing is restricted extends to maintaining confidentiality of a person's tax, financial or business affairs.  That cannot be a reason that it will not be held in public.  There has to be a much bigger public policy reason for not having an appeal heard in public, which would be very exceptional grounds.  We are then looking at a large percentage of these cases being held in public.</p></speech>

There is limited publication of determinations, which does not help in giving any guidance.  However, now everything is going to be in public and it will all be in the public domain.  Is there no better way to achieve the kind of knowledge the delegation is seeking that will not require serious public disclosure of an individual's financial situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Duffy" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012700031#JJ00500"><p>The example of family law matters is a good one.  The reason restricted reporting was introduced in that arena was basically because plaintiffs, defendants and practitioners had no idea of the basis of decisions made by the family courts.  It was decided that limited reporting would be introduced.  Reporters are allowed into certain sessions but must report under very restrictive conditions.  This was only introduced in 2013 but what has happened slowly is that there is more transparency with reports published.  While names and other details would be redacted, people are able to see the basis of the legal decisions made.</p> <p>That is a good example of how one can get transparency in the system while protecting the privacy of taxpayers.  At the moment, there is a legislative basis for the Appeal Commissioners to publish their determinations.  I suspect that because they have a big enough workload, they cannot get around to this or that they do not have the resources to delegate that function.  The only party that actually knows about the jurisprudence value of the Appeal Commissioners is the Revenue Commissioners because they are on the side of all tax appeal cases.  They have the knowledge but do not share it necessarily with the taxpayer.  A taxpayer can go down the route of an appeal without knowing a case similar to theirs has already been determined and losing.  By taking a leaf out of the family law book, it would be helpful to set up a precedent bank.</p> <p> It also seems the Office of the Appeal Commissioners will have the power to increase its staffing levels.  Currently there are only two Appeal Commissioners but that number will increase to three.  Perhaps, the office might envisage court reporters doing technical analysis of and research into cases.  If it will now be the job of the Appeals Commissioner to draft a case stated document, it sounds like the process is moving in the right direction in producing a proper jurisprudence to which taxpayers will have access.</p></speech>

That clearly has to change.  Obviously, there are concerns about delays.  Canada, Australia and the UK have moved towards public hearings.  However, the bottom line here is that Ireland is a very small country.  We have to bear that in mind when we are talking about openness and transparency in public hearings.</p>  <p>  Much can be done to improve this process.  Is the delegation happy that anything that can be done to expedite the process is contained in the heads of the Bill as they stand?  Given we do not know the value of claims, is their merit, as has been proposed by others, for a more informal small claims court style set-up where the financial value of an appeal is less than a certain amount?</p></speech>

There are legal and constitutional difficulties in having different rules for different taxpayers within the Circuit Court.  Our suggestion for minor issues involving a small amount where one did not agree with Revenue was for a different venue where one would not incur legal or professional costs.  The Office of the Appeal Commissioners was originally set up as a cheap and cheerful way of giving a quick answer to a reasonably small issue.  However, as issues have become very complex, it has become very formal with counsel and all kinds of other costs.  We still believe there is a role for another process.  People with cases involving small amounts of money even now do not go to the Appeal Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Another issue which can speed up the process involves the determinations produced by the Appeal Commissioners.  Under the new rules, they go to the parties involved and are then published.  The drawing up of the determinations in the first place is stated as being as soon as practicable after the completion of the appeal.  That could mean anything.</p> <p>As the witnesses from the Revenue Commissioners said earlier, it is difficult to enforce rules but there must be some time limit because we cannot publish a determination that has not been written up and presented to the parties to the case.  There must be some way a time limit is put on the process of drawing up the determination and giving it to the parties.  I do not think it is unreasonable.  There are three months for a case stated to be prepared for the High Court.  I do not know if something similar could be done in respect of determinations.  Perhaps it is not realistic but perhaps it could be examined.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is an area worthy of further exploration, where the adjudication process stops short of a full open hearing and enables taxpayers to come to a speedy resolution, particularly if the issue is relatively straightforward or if the amounts are relatively small.  If the idea got more prominence, as enunciated in the heads of the Bill, it could be helpful.</p></speech>

There is a report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on how the new office is conducting its affairs.  A second aspect of reporting concerns the determinations and adjudications arrived at.  They are two separate matters and one helps to police the other.  In any annual report, there should be some record of how many adjudications were published.  One could contribute to the other but they are not mutually exclusive.</p></speech>

Prior to self-assessment, people argued with the Revenue Commissioners when cases were listed for hearings.  Suddenly, an onerous and stringent self-assessment system came in and it has a 99% compliance rate.  It has worked.  Could a more efficient appeals system be implemented?  It appears it is open to abuse because people can use the legal system to push it out.  Some cases have been going on for ten years, which seems crazy.</p></speech>

There are time limits and certain things the Appeal Commissioners will have to do.  They will need more resources and, if they must write, issue, and publish determinations and produce annual reports, there must be flexibility in staffing to provide legal expertise in the office.  They cannot do it on their own.  It is worth investing in.</p></speech>

It is a key point that the three witnesses have raised.  While Mr. Keegan referred to the sophistication of the members of the public, with which I agree, I also agree with Ms O'Brien that when someone's name is associated with the Revenue Commissioners there is an automatic suspicion that the person has done something wrong, broken the rules or withheld tax.  The same can be said about our courts when someone is charged with a serious offence.  When cases are going through the courts, the full details are published.</p> <p>At the end, when a jury adjudicates, the person may be acquitted.  However, this does not seem to matter.  The principle which Ms O'Brien seems to be arguing, if we were to apply it to the courts, is that we should not publish anything until the determination is made and someone is found guilty.  This is my problem with the argument she is putting forward.</p> <p> In the previous hearing, serious claims were made regarding evidence that some taxpayers are using the appeal system as a way of delaying payment so as to buy time to dissipate assets.  This is trying to ensure, to quote what was said, that "the Exchequer and the compliant majority of taxpayers still lose".  Some of the delegates are practitioners.  In their experience, are there practitioners who are advising clients to use the appeal process for this purpose?</p></speech>

For anyone embarking down the appeals road, it is not a frivolous action to take.  It comes with a high cost and a lot of time and effort.  It is something taxpayers take very seriously.  Just because a large amount of tax is at stake does not mean that a person is more likely to be involved in bad behaviour or messing around.  The person could simply be a large taxpayer.  This in itself means nothing.</p>  <p>  I have not seen the evidence to which the Deputy referred.  I would like to see evidence of people deliberately delaying the process.  It is not in anyone's interests if it is happening and I do not think it is.  However, the structures envisioned, with strict time limits on cases stated and determinations, will go a long way towards dealing with it if it is happening.  Perhaps the Deputy thinks this is the reason or a motivation for people to bring appeals.  This argument could be levelled, perhaps, at 1% of them or at someone with a particular axe to grind.  The vast majority of people want to get through the system as fast as they can and they are frustrated because they cannot do so.</p></speech>

I am not involved and have no experience in this area, but Revenue is saying there is evidence of this problem and it is the taxpayer who loses out.  Revenue has provided the numbers.  A determination issued and it was found that in some 600 cases, five years have elapsed since the appeal was lodged.  In 30 appeals, ten years have elapsed.  The Revenue is suggesting that the assets are gone in some of these cases.  It is not suggesting that this is the case in all of them, or anywhere near that, but it is saying that there is evidence of some taxpayers using the appeals system as a way of delaying payment so as to buy time to dissipate assets.  The result is that if the Revenue wins the appeal, the Exchequer and the compliant majority of taxpayers still lose out because there are no funds to pay the tax.  If the system is so messed up that 600 cases are still going on after five years, with the suggestion that there will be no assets at the end of it, I can understand why people might consider taking this course of action despite the impropriety of it.</p></speech>

I would really like to see a system which can deal with the extremes rather than a system which is designed for the extremes.  Revenue has sight of all of the cases in the entire country and I have no doubt it has come across things I cannot even imagine.  However, if we start going down the road of designing an appeal system which highlights one or two egregious examples and, as a consequence, does not address the requirements of the more average and ordinary taxpayers, the kind of guys our members are dealing with it all the time, we are missing something.  </p></speech>

I have never requested the figures from Revenue or from the Minister.  I will table a parliamentary question this evening and look for the figures over the last number of years.  However, when we asked for the figures from Revenue or the Department - I am not sure which official gave the figures - we were given the figures for 2013 freely and openly.  This suggested there were only 14 appeals.  I am not sure if that is the case year-on-year or if that was just a low year.  However, I assume, given the quantum of money that is being disputed, that these are not people appealing the local property tax of &euro;200 or so being levied by the Department.  These are individuals who have a serious amount of money at risk if the appeal fails.  Is this not the case?  It is not a huge amount of individuals appealing on a year-on-year basis.</p></speech>

This is one of the issues and one of the things we are hoping this new legislation will address.  The overriding concern is that, in the taxes Acts, there are several grounds for raising an appeal against a determination by the Revenue Commissioners.  Are we going to design a system which works at its best when it is dealing with the kind of appeals which the average taxpayer wants to bring?  These are cases where too much income tax is being charged, there is a problem with the local property tax or the taxpayer has been disallowed a capital allowances claim for his or her business.  Alternatively, are we going to design a system which deals with the very extreme forms of tax avoidance, in which, as I think it admitted in the earlier session, Revenue has already taken measures to ensure it is getting its cash in under the Finance Act 2014?  My concern is that if we over-emphasise one aspect of general taxpayer activity over another, we are going to end up with the wrong answers.</p></speech>

It is about corporation tax, capital acquisitions tax and the majority of the tax heads.  Is it not in the interests of, and of financial benefit to, high net worth individuals - which some of the delegates may represent - to buy time and restructure rather than pay a tax liability?  This is not about an overemphasis.  It is about the quantum of money involved.  There were 13 appeals in 2013.  If 1,000 people appeal the local property tax, this will tie up the system.  It will not be a huge loss or gain to the State.  However, if 1,000 people challenge their corporate tax liability or their liability under one of the other tax heads, it is probably more significant.</p>  <p>  I am not in favour of the idea of moving beyond the Circuit Court, for costs reasons and so forth.  Also, the Circuit Court seems to have got it right in six cases since 2010 in which the Appeal Commissioners' decisions were appealed.  Further, if it can take up to two years to have a Circuit Court appeal heard, how can we justify, as the delegates seem to be arguing, keeping the Circuit Court procedure?</p></speech>

Just because it takes a long time to access the Circuit Court does not mean it should be withdrawn.  I want to ensure the Deputy is clear on from where I am coming in relation to this point.  If there are cases of delay, the best way of dealing with them is through quick throughput of the system.  People cannot then delay.  In fairness, what is proposed is, I believe, a big step forward in terms of ensuring this happens, provided it is adequately resourced.</p></speech>

The points made by her in that regard and by myself are at least in the same area.  I am playing devil's advocate here.  We are all aware that our courts system is blocked and that different measures, including the establishment of the Court of Appeal, have been introduced to deal with problems at the higher level.  I am speaking about delays in respect of the Circuit Court.  Revenue has stated that there is evidence that people are using the delays as a mechanism of buying time.  Is there anything that could be done that would support the retention of the Circuit Court and would also seek to speed up delays in that area?  Does Ms O'Brien believe that the automatic right to a full hearing in the Circuit Court is a principle that should be retained regardless of the delays?</p></speech>

That might help.  At the bottom end, the establishment of a smaller forum to deal with minor cases, thereby removing them from the main body of the Appeal Commissioners, would free up the system and enable quicker throughout of bigger cases.</p></speech>

A person must in the first instance apply for the hearing to the Inspector of Taxes.  It is then sent to the county registrar, following which it is listed to the next available date.  In regard to appeals, a person is required under legislation to pay his or her tax prior to taking an appeal.  If that person cannot pay the tax, a question then arises as to whether he or she was ever able to pay it.  Such a person would then probably have to enter into negotiations with Revenue in relation to his or her inability to pay the tax and the taking of an appeal in that regard.  Any agreement reached in such a situation would be on the understanding that if the appeal goes against the applicant penalty interest of 11% would apply from the date on which he or she should have paid the tax.  The Deputy might also query that in the context of his parliamentary question to Revenue.</p></speech>

Reference was made earlier by the Revenue officials to &euro;770 million in respect of which assessments had been made but collection could not proceed.  Some of that &euro;770 million is in relation to cases which arose prior to the 2014 change.  As I understand it, if Revenue determined that I owed &euro;1 million and I assessed myself as owing &euro;500,000 and appealed on those grounds I would not be required to pay the &euro;500,000 outstanding until the appeals process has been exhausted, a process we know can take a number of years.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I ask members and delegates to be conscious of the fact that we have a great deal of work to get through.  Delegates will have six minutes in which to make their opening remarks and I would prefer if members confined themselves to asking questions.  I call Mr. Boylan to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Last week's proceedings seemed to concentrate almost solely on the financial, as opposed to the, human cost.  There is a need to introduce a legal duty of candour to underpin and underscore an ethos of open disclosure when medical accidents which are preventable occur.  The United Kingdom, following a long battle on the part of our sister organisation, Action against Medical Accidents, AvMA, introduced such a duty last November.  I urge members, as legislators, to consider this in an Irish context.  A duty of candour would make a huge contribution towards reducing the trauma caused by medical accidents.  Ultimately, it would also reduce costs.</p>  <p>  There is a need for doctors to learn from errors they make.  No doctor begins his or her day intending to hurt anybody, but doctors do make errors.  In order to learn from them, they must accept that they occur in the first instance.  Unfortunately, there is a widespread culture of defend and deny which has the undesirable effect of poisoning the doctor-patient relationship.  If errors are admitted to when they should be, doctors can learn and the doctor-patient relationship can be preserved in many cases.  In cases in which an error has only resulted in modest injury, patients may not sue at all.  It might be counter-intuitive, but it is the international experience that patients are very forgiving of doctors when there is candid communication at an early stage.  What poisons the entire relationship is the putting up of unmeritorious defences.</p>  <p>  It is already the case that too few patients are obtaining access to justice.  That is the problem.  There are 84,000 medical accidents reported to the State Claims Agency each year.  At last week's meeting Mr. Ciaran Breen informed the committee that there had been 609 new cases in 2014.  They represent a tiny proportion of the number of people who were injured in medical accidents.  There are too few lawyers who specialise in this area acting for plaintiffs.  On the other hand, as is only right, doctors have the best of legal representation.  It is an unequal struggle for justice for patients and we would be opposed to anything which would make that struggle more difficult.</p>  <p>  In the context of the presentation made at last week's meeting, the idea of reducing the damages awarded to catastrophically injured patients is completely objectionable to our members.  For somebody who spends 40 years in a wheelchair, the cost involved comes to just over &euro;200 per week.  I challenge any member to say &euro;200 per week for a lifetime spent in a wheelchair constitutes overcompensation.  That to which I refer is not the solution to the problem.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the data provided for the committee by the Medical Protection Society, MPS, completely lack transparency.  No details were provided of premium or investment income, nor was information forthcoming on the actual cost of claims to members of the MPS.  Buried in one of the submissions I discovered that 238 claims had been made against MPS members last year.  This figure was not included in its glossy report, but it can be found in one of the supplemental documents provided for the committee.  The MPS has 16,000 members, against whom 238 claims were made last year.  If that is correct, on average, this represents one claim per every 67 members.  Something just does not add up.  The MPS did not provide details of the total amount it had paid out; rather, it supplied a graph which I could not understand on which projections of future costs were made.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by introducing one of our members, Ms Deirdre Courtney.  Many of our members wanted to come before the committee to tell their stories.  However, we could only select one.  Ms Courtney is going to recount for members her story and that of her family and the struggle in which she engaged in her quest for justice.</p></speech>

They will have had the opportunity to read my statement.  I am here to inform the committee of how difficult it was for my husband, Brendan, who is with me today, and I to go through the legal process and how difficult it is for other families to do so also.</p>  <p>  The current system is clearly not working well.  There is an emotional cost for families, notwithstanding the financial cost to the State when it insists on going as far as the steps of the court before it concedes.  The position in this regard must change.  No family should have to go through this horrendous process which is lengthy and intrusive.  Up until the day on which the final settlement is reached, there is a huge elephant in the room for every family.  If legislation which compelled doctors to answer questions and provide honest and truthful explanations for individuals and families with queries was enacted, this would surely be the right thing to do.  I understand no doctor gets out of bed in the morning intent on making a mistake.  However, mistakes are made and it should be incumbent on the medical profession to come clean and be truthful, open and honest.  Those involved in the profession should not be afraid to be any of these things.</p>  <p>  When we made our first foray into the High Court on behalf of our daughter, Br&iacute;d, we were obliged in advance to bring her to see 27 professionals who were going to be acting as witnesses.</p></speech>

This had to be repeated for our return in November 2012.  The cost of these witnesses alone must be colossal, and had we not taken our solicitor's advice in 2012 but done as the State wanted us to do, we would have been back in the High Court again in November 2014 and would have had to revisit all the experts again.  How much does the State think a family can take?</p>  <p>  Br&iacute;d is the youngest of our five children.  Her elder sister is aged 22 and the boys are 19, 17 and 14.  Having a child with Br&iacute;d's needs impacts hugely on a family.  The dynamics change and as parents we were always acutely aware of ensuring the other children always felt as cherished as Br&iacute;d.  Extended family also feel the impact of it.  Br&iacute;d's grandparents moved house from Cork to Kerry in order that they could help and through the years have helped with the care of Br&iacute;d and her siblings.  They provide an almost constant taxi service to activities such as football, athletics, rugby and matches.  They are still very much involved in Br&iacute;d's care.  In defending cases such as Br&iacute;d's, the State never sees the child or the family.  I would ask any of the members to come and live in our house for even a day and see the reality of our situation.  We are not statistics.  Our daughter has significant needs that must be met every day.  She is a wonderful, happy, vibrant young lady and is an inspiration to us all.  Her determination never ceases to amaze us.  However, she will always and forever need care.  That is our and her reality.</p>  <p>  We often ask ourselves what the medical profession learned from our negative experience.  Did they, as a team, sit down after Br&iacute;d was born and ask themselves what happened at her birth and whether they gave the appropriate care and paid enough attention to all aspects of the her antenatal care and delivery, and if they did not, what they would do differently next time?  If I thought they had learned from this and that it would help another family, I would be happy.  However, the policy seems to be to defend and deny at all costs, and therefore the platform is not there for openness and frank discussion.  I beseech the members, who are the legislators, to introduce the appropriate legislation that would compel our medical profession to be open, honest and candid.</p></speech>

The Law Society represents almost 14,000 members who are entrusted to represent defendants and plaintiffs.  In the context of today's discussion, solicitors represent the best interests of injured patients, health professionals, hospitals and the State.  We are thus uniquely positioned to comment on the matters that are of concern to the committee.  The Medical Protection Society, MPS, report on the cost of medical indemnity contained a number of statements that the society believes are erroneous and misleading.  We are here to outline our commitment and active engagement on reforms that seek to create a culture of fairness, equality and justice.<br/>The society was struck by the testimony of the witnesses last week and the relegation of the patient in their presentations.  The economic interests of the MPS and consultants working in private practice must be measured against the welfare and rights of patients.  Crude discussions on economic costs fail to encapsulate the human cost of medical negligence.  The consequences for a plaintiff and his or her family arising from a catastrophic medical injury must always be at the forefront.  The trauma, anxiety and financial impact must be acknowledged, appreciated and addressed.  The root cause of medical negligence claims, quite clearly, is that medical negligence occurs.  A patient who has been a victim of medical negligence is entitled to seek redress.  The committee members are to be congratulated on drawing attention to the impact of hospital resourcing on patient safety.  On behalf of patients and legal advisers on all sides, a focus on minimising these occurrences and creating a culture of safety is to be welcomed.<br/>Based on the evidence and the case for balance, we would say that access to insurance on the part of doctors in the private sector should never trump the patients' access to justice.  A balance must be struck between the commercial interests of insurance companies and medics, and a fair and just system for patients who have suffered harm.  The State Claims Agency confirmed that the increase in the cost of claims handled by it in recent years was attributable to several factors, including the expanding remit of the agency, which now oversees the claims of 117 agencies and bodies.  Another factor it cited was the spike in clinical claims in recent years arising from a number of specific actions.  The agency also cited the effect of 2,500 consultants joining the agency's clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, from February 2004 and the effect of the judgment in Yun <i>v.</i>Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) and Tao, 2009, which increased the cap level of general damages in catastrophic injuries to &euro;450,000.<br/>Other contributory factors that the MPS, Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, and Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, omitted from their recent presentation include the level of market penetration MPS has in Ireland compared with other territories and how it impacts on its exposure.  They also omitted to mention the extent of private medical care cover in Ireland compared with other territories and the expanding range and complexity of medical procedures undertaken by their members in recent years resulting in a higher risk profile.  Unlike the SCA, the MPS chose not to disclose its claims outcomes, recovery of costs or litigating strategies, nor did it clarify its distribution of claims by specialty.<br/>While it might seem counter-intuitive to many commentators, litigation can be a force for good.  Professor Crown touched on this when he noted that there is such a thing as constructive litigation.  While the injury should have been avoided, the transformative impact of litigation creates a more responsive and safe health care setting.  Efforts to stifle or prevent claims from being taken serve no one, including doctors.<br/>Less than 3% of CIS claims are resolved through the courts.  The cases that go to court are generally those involving infant cerebral palsy or other catastrophic injuries.  In recent years, the State Claims Agency has reduced the fees paid to solicitors and barristers by 25%.  For solicitors working on behalf of plaintiffs, there have been similar fee pressures, with many reducing their fees by 30% to 50% in recent years.  Other factors that impact on total cost include level of activity, VAT, the extensive number of expert reports required in medical negligence litigation and the increasing complexity of cases.  In 2014, the SCA reported a saving of &euro;97 million, inclusive of third party recoveries against projected costs.  In 2013, these savings were &euro;34.3 million.<br/>In respect of the MPS's proposal to cap general damages, the MPS is cherry-picking from various sources.  In Northern Ireland, the guide figure for general damages for a quadriplegic injury is between &pound;400,000 and &pound;575,000, which is much higher than the &euro;450,000 cap on general damages for catastrophic cases in this jurisdiction.  Also suggested by the MPS and endorsed by the consultant representative groups is the proposal to cap special damages, in particular future earnings and future care costs.  On behalf of the patient, the Law Society asks why a patient who has already suffered immeasurably due to medical negligence should be penalised once more.  Neither the MPS nor the consultant representative bodies referenced the deteriorating impact that lower interest rates and bond yields have on premia income returns.<br/>The Law Society supports the proposed reforms of the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments.  Reforms in the area of open disclosure promote a culture of openness and trust, where communication is the first step in resolving a claim.  Delay does not suit either side, especially the patient who is seeking to move on from a traumatic period in his or her life, in so far as possible.</p> <p>Delay can arise in respect of securing medical opinions, tracing medical statements and teasing through the complex issues of causation.  In that regard the Law Society supports the recommendation of pre-action protocols where issues in dispute are identified much earlier in the process.  Calls for shortened limitation periods, that is, the period within which a claim should be initiated, have a clear economic benefit, namely, more claims run the risk of being barred.  The rights and circumstances of the patient should be carefully considered in any discussion on reducing periods.  The Law Society believes access to justice for all parties to be paramount.  In this case, barriers to accessing the courts system underscore the need for increased judicial resourcing and supports.</p> <p> The Law Society appreciates the tension that might naturally occur between the parties to a claim and the impact claims have on the parties.  The role of the courts and an ethical, professional approach on the part of the respective legal teams must seek to ensure a fair outcome in accordance with the law.  The Law Society supports the existing judicial reasoning for both general and special damages with a particular focus on the rights to fair damages for the patient who has been injured through medical negligence.  The Law Society reiterates its support for improved education and training, the roll-out of open disclosure policies and other reforms that operate to reduce medical errors and injury.  In this regard, we support the duty of candour as a professional and ethical one.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. David Barniville to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Barniville" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015012700005#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee.  I am accompanied by a fellow member of the Bar Council, Ms Sara Moorhead, senior counsel, and we are anxious to assist the joint committee in its deliberations on this difficult and important issue.  One point that struck us was that it is important that this session is taking place because it is critical to ensure there is a balance in the debate, that is, balance between the interests of patients and their families who have been damaged or harmed by the medical negligence of doctors and the interests of the medical professionals involved and their insurers.  There also is a further critical public interest that the system is designed to work and works effectively in the interests of the administration of justice.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a couple of points, the first of which is on the role of barristers and where they fit in all of this.  Second, I wish to consider some of the reforms that have been proposed, with some of which we agree and with others of which we do not.  Finally, I will say something about fees.  I first should note the Bar Council is the representative body for all barristers practising in Ireland.  Barristers act for plaintiffs and defendants in cases.  As we are an independent referral Bar, work comes from solicitors to barristers and we are instructed by solicitors in these difficult cases.  The area of medical negligence work is difficult, complex and requires a high degree of specialisation on the part of barristers, solicitors and other professionals working in this area.  It is not an area of work that is easy to jump into and jump out of or to transfer into at short notice or in times of economic difficulties in other areas of work.</p>  <p>  I will turn to some of the suggested reforms, some of which are referred to in the recent MPS report, and they refer to both procedural and other substantive issues.  I will deal first with the procedural and other issues, and it is fair to state that as with many of the organisations that spoke to the joint committee last week, we are agreed that there are a certain number of critically important procedural reforms that should be introduced in this jurisdiction.  They have been the subject of a number of reports already of the working group on medical negligence, to which I will turn in a moment.  However, the first and fundamental point to make in this respect is the question of delay.  Delay is bad for everybody in the system.  It is appallingly difficult for plaintiffs in these cases to have to wait months and years in many cases for their cases to proceed.  It also is difficult for the medical professionals involved to have to wait to have their cases decided by the courts or resolved.  It is bad for lawyers because if the case is delayed, lawyers do not get paid, and it fundamentally is bad and damaging to society.</p>  <p>  I turn now to the question of the duty of candour.  The Bar Council is in full agreement with the comments already made today and before this joint committee last week.  It is essential that there is a statutory duty of candour in this jurisdiction to encourage medical professionals to come clean at the very beginning and to ensure that by so doing, they do not prejudice the defence of cases in due course.  There should be a statutory requirement to this, as well as ethical and professional underpinning.  A series of recommendations has been made by the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments initially chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke, a former judge of the High Court, and then by Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  We agree with, fully support and participated in those working group reports and agree that a number of things are essential to try to cut down on the delay and waste of resources and trauma caused to people in these cases.  The first is the question of periodic payment orders.  The court should have the statutory jurisdiction to make such orders in appropriate cases.  Not all cases are appropriate for such orders to be made.  There should be pre-action protocols in cases in order that there is the facility to have an early admission of liability in cases, because what happens in many cases is that liability should be but is not admitted at an early stage.  This leads to enormous trauma and a huge waste of costs and resources.  There should be case management of cases and there should be legislation enacted and rules of court amended to implement them.  All the relevant legislation and amended rules of court have been proposed by the working group reports I have mentioned.  There should also be greater use of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, and mediation.</p>  <p>  We disagree with a number of things in the report and we set them out in our paper.  We do not agree that there is a tolerance for unmeritorious claims in this jurisdiction and we do not agree that the type of specialised and expert work involved in medical negligence cases makes it amenable to the jumping from conveyancing to medical negligence work that has been suggested.  We disagree with a number of the substantive reforms proposed.  We do not think there is a need for a tort of clinical negligence and we do not think there is a need for caps on special damages, as that would be highly unfair.  We do not agree that it would be necessary to reduce the limitation period and we do not agree with the concept of caps on costs.  On the question of fees, a fundamental point must be made.  In the absence of an adequate and satisfactory system of legal aid in this jurisdiction, those barristers and solicitors who act for plaintiffs in effect provide legal aid to their clients.  They take on this difficult work with no guarantee of payment and in many cases will not be paid.  They will only be paid if the cases succeed and, ultimately, if the indemnifiers of the doctors pay their costs.  This can be many years after the work has been done.  If there is a dispute on the question of fees, there is an independent statutory body to determine them.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill will enhance and make more transparent the system for the adjudication of such costs.  Those who act on the defendant's side generally agree the fees with the client, whether it is the MPS or the State Claims Agency.  In general, fees for barristers, and I believe for solicitors, in this area have come down significantly since 2008.</p>  <p>  We commend the joint committee on introducing this balance into the debate.  We have set out in our paper those areas of reform that we support and those with which we disagree, which paper the joint committee has to hand.</p></speech>

At the outset, I note members have received a lot of correspondence from all sides and none, including people with a particular interest and those with specific cases and views as to how the system may not have worked for them when they were taking medical negligence cases.  While this issue is quite complex in many ways, one point that is obvious is that when a person is injured, he or she is entitled to seek redress.  This is a simple fundamental.  Another obvious point is the State is very often picking up the tab in many cases and a third is that people are left with catastrophic injuries and must live with them for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and will be as brief as I can.  There are a few obvious issues.  A fact of life we must address is that our legal system is adversarial in its nature.</p> <p>A more open approach and honest and candid sort of disclosure in these discussions will take a mindset change.  It is not just a few of us in a committee room.  It is embedded in our adversarial legal system.</p> <p> Obviously we need to look at it in the context of a duty of care that must be provided by the State in terms of public hospitals - the duty of care provided by those carrying out procedures on behalf of the State in our public hospitals.  There is also the MPS, whose representatives made a presentation here last week.  I suggest to the Chairman that we should contact the MPS to seek clarity on certain issues raised today because we did not have time to do so last week.</p> <p> On the issue of open disclosure and the duty of candour, I believe Ms Courtney summarised it very well in the context of her experiences with her daughter Br&iacute;d.  Many people feel frustration even at the initial stages to get the basic information from the HSE and medical professionals merely to find out what happened before they ever contemplate taking a case.  There is a secretive culture instilled in the HSE and medical professionals that the patient or the person who is acting on behalf of the patient is the last person to know what happened.  That is just beginning to change now.  We talk about the HSE becoming more accountable in terms of discussions with its clients - patients of doctors acting on behalf of the HSE.  It is something that will take a long time.  It is evident that we have a long way to go.  Before we ever go down the litigation route, there must be a more open approach by the HSE and those acting on behalf of the HSE.</p> <p> When we get to the further issue of cases, the State Claims Agency now acts on behalf of the State on the issue.  It is promoting mediation, for example.  However, of approximately 460 cases it handled in 2013, only about 19 or 20 were concluded through mediation and the rest of them ended up going through the adversarial legal route.  The losers in that are those who are seeking compensation or redress and also the State which often picks up the tab.  The money that is being wasted through the adversarial approach ends up coming from the taxpayer and not going to people who need it.</p> <p> We need to see if we can do something and we would appreciate advice from the representatives of the various organisations present.  How do we make it more efficient and streamlined?  In whose interest is it to try to keep it as it is at present?  We need to be honest; the legal representatives will be paid.  Those acting for the plaintiff might find it more difficult at times, but those acting on behalf of the defendant will always be paid.  The only people really throwing the dice in this are sometimes people acting on behalf of the plaintiff, but the defendant's lawyers will always be paid.  We should try to encourage the HSE and the State Claims Agency, given the mentality of the legal profession-----</p></speech>

I suppose this is part 2 of our two-part engagement on this particular and vexed issue.  I would like to ask a number of questions.  I took a little note.  Mr colleague, Deputy Kelleher, spoke about encouraging.  I am more of the view, after last Thursday, that encouragement is not enough.  That is my certain view, having listened to the Medical Protection Society and the State Claims Agency's contributions.  I would like to ask the panel, but Mr. Boylan initially, a question.</p> <p>The focus has to be on the patient.  Doctors must admit avoidable errors that have resulted in some harm being done.  I believe, and am more certain in that belief after last Thursday,- that there needs to be a legal duty to inform the patient.</p> <p> How would Mr. Boylan respond to the Medical Protection Society, MPS, and the State Claims Agency?  What if it were the case that they were to proactively encourage disclosure? I am anxious to have this matter dealt with.  "Encouragement" suggests a voluntary code.  I am very much of the view that what has happened on the neighbouring island, and is applicable north of the Border, is what should happen here in terms of a legal duty of candour.  We need to look at this as committee members and on a societal level.  This is not about somebody we do not know - it is not always the other person.  It could be you or me.  It could be any of us at any point in our lives.  We all have a requirement to use our health services.  I would like to know that from the get-go until I am - hopefully - discharged, I will be treated openly and honestly and will be kept informed of all that takes place.  I would like the Mr. Boylan to address the issue of a voluntary code as against the legal duty of candour.</p> <p> Many of the high-profile cases over the years have gotten significant coverage on television.  Listening to Ms Courtney's contribution, for which I thank her, I recall situations in my own home over tea when the six o'clock news was reporting on different events, and my wife and family were commenting on how disgraceful it was that the State had actually sought to contest a case that was beyond question.  We felt such disgust that this was being done in our collective name.  I have no doubt that situation was replicated at family tables throughout the land.  People have no wish for further hurt and pain to be brought to families who have already suffered so much.  </p> <p> How would the panel reflect on the Medical Protection Society's recommendations regarding the new statute of limitations of ten years for brain injury in children?  I would be particularly interested to hear the response to this.  </p> <p> We watched and listened here last week and a number of comparisons were made between the situation here and in the neighbouring island.  We are not comparing like with like.  We have a very different health delivery system.  At times, one wonders if it should be called a system at all.  There is a national health service on the neighbouring island, which is a very different scenario.  Would the panel like to offer a view on that?  The MPS would have used statistics to suggest these were comparable situations but they are not.  Furthermore, how would the panel respond to the MPS claim that we have seen a doubling of claims over a relatively short period?</p> <p> I would like to take the opportunity on all our behalf to extend our very best wishes to Ms Courtney's daughter Br&iacute;d and to wish her every blessing in life.  That there was no admission of liability and no apology is a very serious matter indeed.  In many other collective cases, in terms of neglect through the years, a State apology has been hugely important.  Members of this committee are more than conversant in that.  It can be no different for an individual experience and a family's hurt.  An apology and an admission are hugely important.</p> <p> When discussing organisations that have appeared before the committee, particularly the MPS and the State Claims Agency last Thursday, it was observed that they have failed in their own stated intent - and I would place question mark over that intent - to deal with people's claims with integrity and honesty.  There is scant evidence of that intent and the honesty factor certainly goes out the door when they are aware of the facts having been reported for their evaluation.  If they are not proactive in encouraging that information to be shared with the individual patient, in my opinion as a layperson, they are then complicit in the withholding of critical information that could concern me, or any individual.  As well as having neither integrity nor honesty, there is clearly no compassion whatsoever in their respective approaches.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

What we have heard today is the other side of the coin.  It gives us a much more balanced view of the whole issue following on from last week.  Particularly welcome is the indication from all parties that they would be in favour of a statutory duty of candour.  This is vitally important and is probably the cornerstone of changing the system and making it fit for purpose.  The system as it stands is not fit for purpose, based on what we have heard today and last week.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome and thank Ms. Courtney for giving us her story and that of her daughter Br&iacute;d.  She has given us a real insight into what it means to be involved in a situation where there is an adverse medical event, such as clinical negligence.  She described it as being horrendous, lengthy and invasive, including having to contact and be examined by 27 different professional witnesses.  </p>  <p>  Ms Courtney also put her finger on something else when she said it is a very unequal struggle.  That is another key part of this debate because it is very unequal.  The inequality starts from the very moment the event takes place.  The manner of dealing with these events continues to be to deny, defend and delay.  That area, as well as the whole question of open disclosure as soon as possible, the question of getting misinformation or being misled, continues to be a problem for families.  The statutory duty of candour is a key element of this.  As much information as possible should be given as quickly as possible.</p> <p>For families, that is most important.  I wonder how we can ensure in the future that families and patients are treated properly, are give correct information early, are not misinformed and are not give misleading information.  That is probably my only question.  How do the various witnesses see that being put in place and being effective?  How can that be done?  Is it done in other jurisdictions and if so, has it been successful and how has it been done?</p></speech>

He made a telling point, that there needs to be a mindset change generally.  Litigation is generally adversarial.  There are some cases, however, in which it certainly merits consideration that it be less adversarial.</p>  <p>  Fundamentally, two things play in to this in these kind of difficult cases.  The first, a point on which we all are agreed at this table and on which there was substantial agreement on Thursday, is there should be a statutory duty of candour.  It works elsewhere and the experience so far elsewhere has been positive on that.</p>  <p>  The second, another point raised by Deputy Kelleher, is the use of mediation and alternative dispute resolution.  It is used in medical negligence cases, but not enough.  It should be encouraged to be used much more often than it is.  It is something that was addressed in the second two reports of the working group on medical negligence, Mr. Justice Quirke's and Ms Justice Irvine's reports.  From the Bar's point of view, mediation affords the sort of facility for people's grievances to be aired and resolved in a way that is generally much more effective than open court.  For those reasons, we have been encouraging people to train as mediators and we have been generally trying to ensure that there is a greater use of mediation, and we feel there is greater possibility for mediation to be used in these cases.</p>  <p>  Turning to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions, the first point touched on the question of the statutory duty of candour and whether mere encouragement would be sufficient.  The Bar Council does not believe that mere encouragement is sufficient.  We think that there should be a statutory duty.  It should be enforced that way and it should underpin the professional and ethical duties that are already there.</p>  <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's next point, he mentioned seeing cases where he was appalled that they could have been run and how they could have been defended for so long.</p></speech>

Those sort of cases do happen.  It should be encouraged that there should be as early an admission of liability in such cases as possible.  That means that if it is clear at the very outset that liability cannot be resisted then it should be admitted at that stage.  If it means during the course of the case that something emerges that shows a case that looks like it could be a case that could be successfully defended no longer is, there should be an encouragement to admit liability at that point.</p></speech>

Surely that is part of what we should be trying to change as well.</p></speech>

That applies cross the board.  I am not casting aspersions on anybody in or beyond this room, but that should not be the way of doing business.  At times, that is the way it comes across.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Barniville" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015012700009#K00900"><p>The Chairman is right about that.  We should not have cases such as Ms Deirdre Courtney's case.  We should not be hearing about those kind of experiences, whether from either the legal system's point of view or the medical system's point of view.  One thing that will help this early admission of liability is to do something that was recommended in 2012 by the working group on medical negligence, that is, to have pre-action protocols, where there is engagement from an early stage and where, therefore, there is the opportunity to have an early admission and to engage and have communications and discussions with the other side at that very early stage, rather than leaving it late in the day so that it certainly gives the impression in cases that they have been either wrongly defended up to a point or dragged out when that should not be the case.  One answer is this pre-action protocol.</p>  <p>  The next question Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised is whether the Statute of Limitations should be amended in some way in these cases.  We do not believe that it should.  Already, the Statue of Limitations period in personal injury cases was reduced, from three years to two years.  The working group felt it should be increase, back up to three years.  In cases that are brought within that period but in which, because the plaintiff may have been an infant at the time the accident happened, that time can run on, the court has a discretion not to dismiss cases after a fairly long period of time.  In those cases, the court will look at what is fair and what is not fair.  It has to look at fairness from both sides of the equation.  Obviously, the plaintiff or injured patient is a critically important person in the equation but, equally, in these cases, there is another side - the doctor.  In many cases, the doctor may feel that he or she has done nothing wrong and is entitled fully to defend the case.  It is important, in all of these cases, to look at both sides and to have, as the committee is looking at, balance in the debate.</p></speech>

He inquired about the adversarial system.  It is an adversarial system and it would take a mindset to change that.  There are pros and cons of it.  Those, such as Ms Br&iacute;d Courtney, can have their cases advocated in a strong sense.  Some of the patients feel that getting their say out there publicly and having persons publicly accountable for what has happened to them in the court setting has a positive effect in trying to balance the scales.  It comes at a cost.</p>  <p>  The principal focus on the costs that we have been considering here is the late occurrence of the settlement and how can we bring that forward.  The fact that it is not brought forward means that there is a significant human cost to people, such as Br&iacute;d and her parents, but there is a significant financial cost.  There is a problem.  Those on the defence side will tell one that the doctors themselves have difficulties in accessing hospital records, the doctor wants his or her position vindicated, etc.  The defend and deny policy has overridden all of those.  I see, day in, day out - Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated that he sees it on the "Six One News" - parents coming out of the Four Courts stating that their daughter was born five, ten or 15 years ago and they miraculously settled it two hours earlier.  What were they doing for the past 15 years and what light shone on them that illuminated them in the Four Courts that could not have been shone into the risk management department of the hospital so many years previously?</p>  <p>  The key to this is to obligate the medical people to tell what happened.  In fairness to the Medical Council, it has brought this in as a professional guideline, but we do not have it in the legal arena.</p> <p>In some cases, a doctor may want to admit liability but is told by the risk management department of a hospital not to do so as it could prejudice the hospital's defence.  This is a nonsensical approach because any liability issues will come out.  In that case, why not bring them out at the outset? </p> <p> On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point on the Statute of Limitations, the statute was reduced some years ago at the behest of the Medical Protection Society, MPS, and State Claims Agency, SCA, from three years to two years.  People such as Ms Courtney do not come running to their solicitors the day after an adverse event occurs.  They first try to cope with the consequences of the event, which may take a year or two.  The case then has to be investigated.  The Medical Protection Society and State Claims Agency complain about cases being taken late in the day.  Meritorious cases are being taken late in the day and it is opportunistic to try to deny people justice if their cases are meritorious.  On the other hand, if a legitimate defence can be made on the basis that the staff nurse in the hospital has died or some other prejudice can be shown, that is fair enough and there may be some argument for prohibiting such cases.  However, the use of the mere passage of time, without there being any prejudice, seems to be an opportunistic attempt to exclude people from justice.</p> <p> To respond to Deputy Healy's point, it is an unequal struggle and scales, as I stated, need to be recalibrated.  This can be done by the doctors in question making an admission as to what occurred.</p> <p> The Deputy asked what is the experience in other countries.  Studies have been done in this area.  Dr. Timothy McDonald of the University of Illinois, who addressed the Medical Injuries Alliance in the past year or thereabouts, has introduced a duty of candour, under penalty, at the university.  If a doctor does not admit he has had an adverse event, he may have six months' salary deducted or may be held back if he is in the progression from junior doctor to senior doctor.  This approach has resulted in the number of adverse incidents being reported multiplying.  However, while the number of adverse incident reports may have increased from perhaps 100 to 1,000 per annum, the number of claims has declined because patients were dealt with fairly and honestly.  In addition, those patients who proceeded to litigation were easier to deal with and settled their cases easier.  Dr. McDonald's statistics on the issue are startling.  There is evidence throughout the world to show that the defend and deny approach, such as we have here, is costly, whereas the alternative process works. </p></speech>

The Deputy noted that only 19 of the cases involving the State Claims Agency were mediated.  My experience is that mediation takes place much too late in the process, generally in the month before trial when patients and their lawyers and legal teams have incurred great expense and experienced much stress.  Mediation is usually viewed as an alternative to settling a case and can create a further delay and more expense.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I agree with Mr. Barniville that a voluntary code will not work because there will always be people who act like dinosaurs and resist change.  </p></speech>

The Medical Council changed its code of professional conduct around ten years ago, yet we still have denial of liability and a defend and deny approach.  There must be a legal duty to report.  We should also take the same approach as has been taken in the United Kingdom in respect of hospital administrators because I detect that much of the problem does not lie with doctors.  I have been told by doctors that they wanted to be candid with patients and admit fault but were prevented from doing so by the hospital administration.  The United Kingdom has introduced a duty on hospital administrators as well as medical consultants.  This approach should be examined.</p></speech>

We invited Dr. McDonald to a conference at the end of last year.  It was startling to note the difference between the system in Illinois and the system here.  They were like parallel universes.  He explained that the University of Illinois had saved substantial amounts of money and pointed out that if patients are dealt with fairly, humanely and candidly, some would accept an explanation and apology and did not seek compensation, seriously injured patients who needed financial help were much reasonable to deal with.  He described a case where a girl had died completely unnecessarily in the operating theatre and rather than suing, her parents donated all of her organs to the hospital as a result of an open, candid admission of liability and fault.  These are the types of things that can happen if people co-operate rather than taking a head in the sand approach.</p>  <p>  The suggestion of a ten-year or long-stop statute of limitation in all circumstances will lead to manifest injustice.  As Mr. Cantillon stated, the parents of many seriously injured children will struggle with the burden of care and will have accepted explanations they were given at the time of the adverse incident.  One of the individuals present has gone through this experience.  The family of another patient who wanted to speak today would have been able to get through a ten-year statute of limitation by the skin of their teeth because they were misinformed at the time of birth about the circumstances of the birth and did not-----</p></speech>

I am merely pointing out that the family was misinformed, with the result that legal advice was not sought for eight years and proceedings were taken just before the tenth birthday of the child.

People do not understand why, when the light has suddenly dawned and &euro;7 million, &euro;8 million or sometimes more has been paid over in damages, an admission of liability or apology is not forthcoming on the steps of the court.  This causes great bitterness and is totally unnecessary.  Everybody in this room knows that no one will pay out &euro;8 million or &euro;10 million without realising he or she is at fault.  This approach is wrong and much change.  </p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their attendance and the comprehensive presentations they have provided on the issues.  Ms Courtney's story about the difficulties she experienced was telling.  I read the full report she provided, which highlights the difficulties people experience and the hurdles they must jump when dealing with issues of this nature.</p> <p>It was in the context of addressing the substantial increase in MPS premiums that I became involved in inviting the various witnesses last week.  The MPS is one of the few insurance companies left.  The Medical Defence Union has left the country.  There has been much speculation over 12 months about the MPS because of the increase in premiums, in some cases by 68% over two years.  I became involved because of the capping levels and the point at which the State takes over after the MPS pays out.  We have a problem in the sense that insurance premiums have increased substantially.  A number of medical personnel have left the country for various reasons, but including for insurance reasons.  We must face this problem.</p> <p> There is also a problem in that, although there are approximately 2,500 consultants in the HSE and another 400 in the private sector, there is a shortage of consultants in many areas.  Therefore, we must be very conscious of the need to keep consultants here and make it attractive for them to stay.  On the other hand, we must ensure there is balance in regard to compensation.  People must be compensated adequately if errors are made.  All members of the committee are of the view that victims should get adequate compensation.  The main issue is trying to reduce the number of errors.</p> <p> On the case itself, Mr. David Barniville talked about the Bar Council of Ireland and Mr. O'Higgins talked about the Law Society of Ireland.  What changes to current procedures could be made immediately without having to legislate?  If they cannot be made, why?</p> <p> With regard to legislation, could the witnesses provide clarification on discussions they have held with the Department on the timeframe for putting in place the necessary legislative measures, particularly legislation on periodic payments?  This has been talked about for a long time.  Has any indication been given to the witnesses at this stage?  I have raised this in the Seanad on numerous occasions over the past three years.  I believed we would have had the legislation.  Even over the next 12 months, what could be done to make it far more easy to deal with the very difficult circumstances in which an error is made and when a person needs to be compensated adequately?  We do not seem to have made significant progress on this in the past ten years.</p></speech>

I have nothing but admiration for Ms Courtney's courage and conviction in fighting the case of her lovely little lady.  She is the spit of her mammy.  I congratulate Ms Courtney and thank her as I acknowledge it must be difficult to attend today.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether the witnesses can answer my questions.  I agree absolutely that there needs to be a statutory duty of candour.  I am still not sure whether people would continue to fight cases, perhaps in earnest.  Mr. Ernest Cantillon was first engaged in 2004.  Why in God's name did it take until 2012 for the institution to finally admit it was wrong and write a cheque?  What happened during that very lengthy period that could not have happened much earlier?  I refer to the changing of limitations and pre-action protocols.  What could we do to reduce the duration of case proceedings from 11 years to perhaps two or another acceptable period such that, at the beginning of the fight, one would know the end date, regardless of the result?  Obviously, one begins in the hope that the result will be in one's favour.</p>  <p>  Do any of the delegates in the legal profession have any idea what it would cost the State to defend a case such as that of young Br&iacute;d?  If I were a doctor and admitted liability in a case such as that of Br&iacute;d after week one instead of week 4,001, would there be a difference in my insurance premium after the settlement?  If the hospital in the case in question had said in 2004 that instead of fighting the case it would acknowledge what occurred and pay out the &euro;11 million, or another agreed sum, the tone of the discussion would have been entirely different.  It would have been different had the authorities sat down with Ms Courtney and treated her in the humane and compassionate way in which she should have been treated.  Are there other jurisdictions with a duty of candour?  If so, has it had a massive impact on how litigation proceeds and on the level of medical insurance costs?  I would be very grateful if the witnesses could tease that out for me.</p></speech>

My question is for Ms Courtney.  Her husband Brendan is present.  I saw a picture of their little daughter on Deputy Doherty's iPad.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to point 11 in Ms Courtney's submission.  Perhaps my question is too personal to answer.  Ms Courtney was waiting until 2010, I believe, before getting some money towards the care of her daughter, who at that stage was six or seven.  To do the right thing, Ms Courtney had to support her daughter and get the best she could get.  Money must have been an issue for her.  She had appointments with solicitors, doctors, etc.  When she needed the most help for her daughter, there was actually no money available and no resources.  Bearing in mind that it has taken so long to bring that case, is there a way in which money could be made available to the parents towards the care of the child who has suffered from medical negligence?  That would be useful and helpful until the legal people, doctors and hospital administrators decide who is liable.</p>  <p>  We are like Solomon here.  We heard the perspective of the consultants and insurers last week and we are hearing a very different one today.  Last week I asked whether the new legal duty of candour in the United Kingdom has resulted in a change of policy on the part of insurance companies.  I asked whether it will result in less aggressive policies in hospitals and insurance companies.  Could the legal practitioners who are present state what we could expect to happen if we introduced the duty of candour?  How would circumstances change, including for Ms Courtney?  How would circumstances be different for families?  I am really interested in the victim.</p>  <p>  I do not believe the second question I asked on the last occasion was answered.  I asked about the statute of limitations.  I am a little confused about it.  I believe I was told there was a period of two years, but then I heard Mr. Boylan mention something about ten years.  Has the period changed in the meantime?  Could the delegates fill me in?  I am concerned about what occurs when children are involved.  The statute of limitations for children involves a very short period.  Perhaps a child will grow up and want to take a case himself or herself, despite the views of his or her parents.  I am concerned about that.  Perhaps the delegates could answer my questions on this.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  Having read Ms Courtney's statement, I was astonished to learn she had to go to England to have a doctor make a diagnosis or participate.  It was unfortunate that no Irish doctor would support the case.  I find that tragic.  It tells us an awful lot about what happens when people fall victim to medical negligence.  Ms Courtney is a victim of circumstances that went really wrong.  That no doctor in this country would support her case or help to bring her to a place where she could gain some kind of satisfaction or relief is astonishing.</p>  <p>  According to Mr. Boylan, the Medical Injuries Alliance has been in operation for the past four years.</p> <p>How many cases has it dealt with in those years that are similar to Br&iacute;d's<font color="#FF0000"></font>case?  I did not read it.<br/>The only thing I can say to Ms Courtney is that I have a good friend who had a little boy four years ago.  They are at the first stage of deciding whether they should do what Ms Courtney is doing.  I have been trying to convince them, not as a politician but as a friend, that their beautiful little son is going to need a great deal of care, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  As many have said, some people do not want to go to court.  Ms Courtney is not going for money or for compensation.  She is going in order to make the journey of her child's illness a little better.  As these children get older, their needs are progressing all the time.  I have been trying to hammer this home to my friend.  Finally she has agreed to go to see somebody and have a talk with them.<br/>I am a mother of five beautiful children, the youngest of whom is 21.  Men will not understand this, but from the first day a woman feels the first pain that she is going to deliver her baby in the next 24 to 48 hours, one goes in with great excitement and joy, but also with a great deal of fear, because one tries one's best during the nine months of pregnancy to do everything that is right for one's baby.  When the baby is delivered and everything is normal, it is wonderful.  When the baby is delivered and everything is not normal, it is still a wonderful experience because a new life has been brought into the world.<br/>I was taken aback when Ms Courtney spoke about the great joy that Br&iacute;d has brought to both their lives, because I know with my friend it is exactly the same.  Her little son has brought great joy to them.  However, their needs are huge.  Things like getting a wheelchair, access to specialists, getting a vest that could help him because he has scoliosis, and so on are so important to them in the very early stages to take away the stress they are under and help them make their journey.  That is what has put my friend off.  She said: &quot;I can't do this.  I'm not able to struggle on.&quot;  I want to tell Ms Courtney that I will see my friend this evening and I will hand her Ms Courtney's statement and tell her to read it, because Ms Courtney and her husband are an inspiration to everyone who has come through what they have come through.  It is shocking that they have had to wait so long for somebody to tell us what all our mothers told us, &quot;Tell the truth and shame the devil&quot;.  Well done to them.</p></speech>

There are cases that should not be defended, which put families through years of unnecessary stress when they should be at home, caring for and spending time with the loved ones who have been at the centre of all of this.  Ms Courtney stated that had the admission of liability been given, the cost of pursuing the legal case would not have been incurred.  She also mentioned that her husband inherited a very small farm and should they have lost the case, they would have lost that farm.  It is ridiculous that there has never been legal aid in this type of case in Ireland.  Why not, particularly in this kind of case?</p>  <p>  Ms Courtney said she had to travel to the UK to have her daughter examined because no Irish doctors would support this case.  Is this normal practice?  Do Irish doctors just not get involved in these cases?  That is disgraceful.  The defendants make a settlement at the eleventh hour and then there is no admission of liability and no apology.  Everybody can see that if they make a settlement, they are wrong.  They should have the decency to at least accept liability and apologise.</p></speech>

Surely the delays in the conducting of claims will add to the costs.  How can we expedite the process of admitting liability and ascertaining quantum?</p>  <p>  If we focus excessively on the costs, are we missing the key issues of how to reduce the incidence of medical negligence and how to put in place measures to reduce the number of adverse incidents?  The medical profession have seen the costs of professional indemnity insurance go up.  Is there a way they can be assisted in reducing that?  If one takes the consultant doing his work, in some cases 40% to 50% of their pay is going towards the cost of this insurance.</p>  <p>  I apologise to the witnesses and the members.  I must attend another meeting at 6.40 p.m.  As a committee, we will review the evidence of the last two days before deciding what we will do next.  We may have to take another set of hearings, but we will take time as a committee to review what we have heard today and last Thursday before deciding where to go next.</p></speech>

It always strikes legal practitioners that the model of a commercial court that everyone would have heard of, a court that shows it is possible to expedite a trial, is only available for commercial practitioners and not for people in circumstances like this.  That is not to denigrate what an excellent model it is, but there are many days where the rest of us regret that we are not commercial law practitioners.  If one went into commercial law court in the Four Courts when Mr. Justice Kelly was there and or now, when Mr. Justice McGovern is there, on the day one is listed, there are pre-action protocols, there are time limits and everything moves on.</p>  <p>  Mr. Cantillion and Mr. Boylan can tell of days even when their cases have been specially fixed, meaning there is supposed to be a judge available for them, and they have waited up to seven days for the case to come on.  Those who have been down to the Four Courts know that facilities are not great.  That is a dreadful experience not only for the plaintiffs, but also the medical professional involved, for whom this is a very traumatic time.  It is also a ridiculous waste of hospital resources, because one cannot schedule witnesses or have any idea what is going on.  Medical negligence, and many other areas of law, should be treated in the same model as the commercial court, namely, judges should be assigned to significant cases from the outset, directions should be given from the outset, there should be a designated judge, and there should be a guarantee to all parties that when their case is listed for hearing, it will come on and be dealt with.  That is a resources issue and, like every other sector of Irish society, the courts' resources have been significantly diminished.  It is hard to explain to people how big a stress it is for somebody to come down, having psyched themselves up for their case to come on, and there have been cases which do not get on at all.</p>  <p>  That is probably the most immediate thing that could be done in the absence of reform, but we urge reform from the side of both parties.  It is in no one's interest, whether the doctor or the patient, that this process should be delayed.  If there is a case to answer, it should be dealt with earlier.  I do not want the message to go out that the Bar Council does not believe there are many cases to be defended, because there are.  If there are cases to be defended, each doctor is entitled to the best representation and robustness in the system.  At the moment, in the absence of pre-action protocols, early exchange of liability reports between the parties may help, so that if there is something there, or an issue to be identified, everybody knows what they are talking about - early mediation, as Mr. Boylan said.  Mediation is very important for two reasons.  It involves the lawyers in the compensation issue, but it is also a major opportunity for people to get answers, to go into a room with the doctor involved and have a chat, ask the questions they were too overwhelmed to ask at the time.  In my experience, that can have a huge effect on the settlement of a case, because many people come to court.  Many doctors are very willing to come to mediation to explain their position.</p> <p>Mediation does not have to mean settlement, although it often does.  It can often assist in the process thereafter.</p> <p> To answer Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's question on the Statute of Limitations, which I appreciate is confusing, for an adult the Statute of Limitations was reduced from three years to two years from date of knowledge.  A child is permitted to bring a claim throughout the currency of his or her infancy, that is, to the age of 18, and for a period of two years thereafter.  With regard to the ten year limit for a brain injury, irrespective of the Statute of Limitations, by the time a child is aged ten, he or she should not be entitled to bring a claim.  As Mr. Boylan pointed out, in the early years of many cases parents are so overwhelmed by the nature of what they are dealing with that the last thing they are speaking about is taking action.</p> <p> Many of these cases are not about negligence.  They are actually about causation.  It struck me that the Medical Protection Society, MPS, report stated a new law would have to be introduced to deal with causation.  Most practitioners would state that negligence is often very obvious but causation is often very difficult because something could have happened to the child in the womb before the negligent act.  This is a huge issue.  Getting doctors to deal with the question of causation is often very difficult.</p> <p> To answer Deputy Doherty on the question of insurance, I do not claim to be an expert on it.  The point of the State Claims Agency taking over was, to a large extent, to absorb all of the insurance issues for many doctors, and this should have happened.  Many doctors are now represented by the State Claims Agency, unlike previously, but there are doctors who have separate representation.  As I understand it, in some cases they may choose to do this and in others it may be because it involves their private work.  Undoubtedly, there may be ramifications for them in the private area.  I do not know.  There certainly should be fewer ramifications than previously because of the introduction of the State Claims Agency and the clinical indemnity scheme, which was introduced so that irrespective of the apportion of liability between the hospital, nurses, consultants and registrars, there would be a joint approach which would result in an earlier settlement.  Unfortunately, this has not proved to be the case.</p> <p> It is also a resources issue for the State Claims Agency and the doctors.  It is tremendously expensive to investigate medical negligence.  They end up with the same difficulties as the plaintiffs in terms of commissioning expert reports.  An issue one hears often from the State Claims Agency is that it has very short time limits for investigation.  Late admissions of liability are often because much of the period involved will have been spent continuing to investigate, and by the time a formal defence must be entered, this investigation will not have been completed.  For the avoidance of doubt, just because a case is settled for significant money, this amount may not be the full value of the case and there may be significant issues which made it legitimate for the defendants to defend it up to a period of time.  There is a level of commercial reality.  What we are speaking about with regard to early admission of liability are very straightforward cases and there are some whereby it is inexplicable to people that it took three or four years to do so.</p></speech>

We seem to have jumped to focus on the costs and not looked at how to reduce the error.  We need to look at reducing the incidence of error; Senator Crown raised this issue last week.  According to a report today, we are now 22nd in the European league of health care providers.  All doctors will always say if resources are slashed, they will have problems.  No one comes out and says if resources are slashed, someone will be injured as a consequence, but it is obvious this is happening.  We need to focus on the primary problem, which is reducing the incidence of medical errors.</p>  <p>  Senator Burke asked about non-legislative intervention and rightly highlighted problems regarding capping levels and trying to get them reduced, and the problem of doctors leaving.  This is undoubtedly a problem.  I am not so sure the legal profession is the cause of this problem.  Perhaps we contribute to it, but I do not believe we do.  He asked for non-legislative changes.  Ms Moorehead made an obvious point that introducing rules of court which would make the system somewhat akin to the commercial court could assist in information being disclosed at an early point in time.  The State Claims Agency or the MPS could be encouraged to have early settlements voluntarily.  Deputy Doherty asked what Ms Courtney might do from the date of birth to the time of settlement, given the costs which would be associated.  The State Claims Agency and the MPS could be encouraged to make interim payments to people, without an admission of liability if needs be, to put some money in their pockets so they can provide the required therapy for the children.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty also asked about insurance premia and whether a claim against a doctor resulted in an increase in the premium.  I do not believe it does.  Many doctors complain about cross-subsidisation.  All practitioners, for the plaintiff and the defendant, will have experience of the same names coming up with appalling regularity in certain areas.  The rest of the doctors are carrying the can for this.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, the position on the Statute of Limitations has been adequately explained by Ms Moorehead.  With regard to the ten year position, the MPS advocated that once ten years had elapsed from an event irrespective of any mitigating circumstances, it should be out the door and one should not be able to claim, irrespective of its merits.  Certainly from the Law Society's point of view and, as I understand, from Bar Council's point of view, they see the unfairness of this.</p>  <p>  Deputy Byrne asked about Irish doctors not supporting cases.  Unfortunately, this is the situation.  From a plaintiff's point of view, by and large, one cannot get an Irish doctor, with a few honourable exceptions, to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff.  Unfortunately, this adds to the costs because the doctors who come from abroad are expensive.</p>  <p>  Deputy McLellan rightly drew attention to the absence of legal aid.  We do not have legal aid.  This is slightly overstating it as there is theoretical legal aid, but there are no specialists and the numbers of cases brought by the legal aid board are minimal.  I do not know whether any of them have come through.</p>  <p>  A question was asked about delays, and certainly they add to the costs because every step taken must be paid for by somebody and a whole pile of unnecessary steps are taken because one is asked to prove what is ultimately admitted, which should have been admitted at an earlier stage and, if it had been, other costs would not have been incurred.</p>  <p>  Deputy McLellan raised the question of defending the indefensible, which unfortunately is the experience.  One should try to be balanced and ask what is the defence's explanation for this.  It is hard to see what it is except, in fairness, that doctors may state they do not believe they did something wrong and want their professional reputations vindicated.  These doctors should be told they are wrong, that their colleagues who are independent experts have said they are wrong, and that no one is prepared to waste taxpayers' money defending them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Boylan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015012700013#O00300"><p>Many of the points have been covered.  I apologise if I get the names of the Deputies and Senators wrong.  Somebody asked what changes could be made now to improve the situation in the absence of a legal duty of candour.</p> <p>The pre-action protocols have the potential to hugely transform and improve the situation.  I was a member of the working group, which helped to devise these.  There was a difference of opinion as to whether they could be introduced as rules of court - whether the rules making committee had the power to introduce them as rules of court or whether they needed legislation.  The view which prevailed was that they needed legislation.  It could have been put into a miscellaneous provisions Bill but I have been led to believe that the Department of Justice and Equality has decided it needs a whole new raft of primary legislation.  If that is its attitude, then it will probably take a long period of time.</p> <p> If it was introduced, it would set a seven-week limit for the HSE or the doctor to reply to a letter of claim.  I wonder will they be able to comply with the seven weeks given that our experience has been that sometimes it can take seven months or seven years for the penny to drop.  The idea is that following a letter of claim, the obligation will be that the HSE will the provide all of the relevant records by way of voluntary discovery.  In fairness, the plaintiff would have to set out his or her stall in the letter of claim and itemise specifically the allegations of negligence.  There would be a responsibility on the HSE to respond point-by-point.  A mere denial of liability or breach of duty would not suffice.  It will have to give specific responses and if it is going to rely on a defence, it will have to set out exactly what the defence is, what is its explanation is and what is its excuse.  There is no question but that will be a challenge.  However, that seven weeks has been set as the period of time.  That would hugely transform the situation.  This was all before proceedings are issued.</p> <p> This has been copied from the UK and the reforms Lord Woolf drove more than a decade ago.  The UK had the system that exists here.  He described the ethos in his landmark report as mutual suspicion and hostility between practitioners.  After those reforms were introduced, there was mutual co-operation and it helped hugely.  That is what has to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-27a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Courtney" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015012700014#P00200"><p>I thank all the members for their kind comments.  There was a question about cost and things like that.  When an incident occurs, obviously, it must be proved legally that mistakes were made or that the medical profession is liable.  I suppose it will come into being if the periodical payments order is brought in but there should be a fund from which one could draw.  I mention early intervention because Br&iacute;d has cerebral palsy and it affects her four limbs.  As members will have noted from the statement, she needs help with everything.  Early intervention for children who have such difficulties, or who have any difficulties, is vital.  One needs money to put those early interventions in place.  That is the bottom line.</p>  <p>  There were times my husband would ask me where I was getting the money because we used to take Br&iacute;d for physiotherapy and at one stage, it was costing us &euro;400 per week.  We kept that going for 18 months and then less frequently for another two years.  When my husband asked where I was getting the money, I would say to him not to ask.  We have four other children.  One would hope and have aspirations that they would all get through their education and go to college.  One was putting money in different pots and it was not easy.  There should be something there from which one could draw and then move forward from there.</p>  <p>  The fact this takes so long is beyond me.  The proceedings were issued in 2006, so Br&iacute;d was only three years of age.  She was seven years of age when we went to court the first time and nine years of age when we went the second time.  If we had not taken our solicitor's advice, we would have been going to court for a third time.  I just cannot understand it.</p>  <p>  What I do not understand either is how the State can hand over &euro;11 million, as in our case, but nobody has ever said sorry to us or that it was somebody's fault.  Nobody has ever admitted it.  How the State can do that and hand over the money is beyond me.</p></speech>

In regard to doing anything, even in case management terms, that has all been recommended as part of the working group report by Mr. Justice Quirke and Ms Justice Irvine.  At present, there are simply no resources to do anything in the courts with medical negligence.  It requires to be done as part of a very significant picture.  One of the difficulties is that the courts are spending a huge amount of time dealing with these periodic payments on an informal basis.  People are coming back to discuss the price of nappies in the High Court for a day every two years.  They are virtually finished with one set of periodic payments on an informal basis and they are back again because there is no statutory scheme in place.  It is an appalling waste of court time.</p>  <p>  The periodic payments should be brought in.  It would bring certainty to everybody and would mean the likes of Ms Courtney would not be bringing her daughter to all the expert witnesses.  One of the things about the situation, as it stands at, is that because no structure is in place for periodic payments, everything is up for grabs when they come back every two years, which is no good to anybody.  It is no good the people involved and to the doctor who cannot bring finality to the case.  It results in fresh legal costs every time.  Since 2012, the Legislature has been urged to act and it has the support of all parties.  The 2010 report and the second report in 2012 recommended that there should be periodic payments.  It would not be a huge difficulty to bring it in.</p></speech>

A doctor in Ireland has one of the highest chances of finding himself or herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit of any country in the world.  Primarily, this is not the fault of lawyers but of the health system.  I am afraid all the craw thumping by the full-time politicians about how much they really want to fix the medical problems here rings hollow with me when they have had ample opportunity to do so.  Certainly over the 22 years that I have been working in this country, no one has ever shown the slightest interest in actually trying to fix the health system.  We have a health system which is right at the bottom of the charts-----</p></speech>
