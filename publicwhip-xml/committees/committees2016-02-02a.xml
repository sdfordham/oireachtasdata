I draw the attention of members to three pieces of correspondence, first, correspondence from the Office of the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to today's meeting; and, second, correspondence from Ms Mary Farrell about the wards of court.  It is disappointing that at the final meeting of the PAC, this issue still has not been dealt with.  We issued the report last June and at this stage we should have had a formal response to our recommendations.  It will now be a matter for the next committee.  I urge this Department and all other Departments involved in this to deal with the issue of the wards of court as quickly as possible.  Wards of court are very vulnerable individuals and the funds in this instance are about to run out.  Following the request of the Committee of Public Accounts at its previous meeting for this information, I would have expected those concerned to provide a speedy response.  We have not had a response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-02-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016020200002#C00300"><p>Chairman, I was going to say that was astonishing, but it is not, in some ways it is nearly par for the course in terms of the slow response rate of certain Departments and agencies to this committee.  I have had correspondence from Ms Mary Farrell on behalf of the families of the wards of court.  They are extremely disappointed, frustrated and angry at this stage that not alone is the committee left waiting for the Department's response but, more important, they are left in this position.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Department that they can disregard the committee.  They have had the report provided by the PAC since July 2015 and have had ample time and opportunity to respond, and now at the conclusion of this D&aacute;il we have not received its response.  It will fall to the next committee which must be firm and insistent that when a response is sought by the Committee of Public Accounts, it is supplied in a speedy fashion.  It shows the level of contempt for the Committee of Public Accounts and the parliamentarians who are on the committee, but most disgracefully it shows a level of contempt for the families who are directly affected by the issue of ward of court and the fund itself.  The families have been left hanging.</p> <p>  In the course of today's meeting with the representatives from the HSE, we will discuss the culture of that organisation, the deficiencies and the issue of accountability.  The attitude of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Committee of Public Accounts and the families involved reflects a major problem of accountability and an issue around its response to the families and to the committee.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy McDonald's comments.</p><p>What concerns me most, beyond the lack of respect for this committee, is the situation regarding the victims in terms of wards of court.  We are talking about vulnerable people, and it is very shoddy that we have not had a response.</p></speech>

That will be circulated, and we will note it and publish it.</p> <p>  The next business for today is the HSE report.  We will call in the witnesses.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order No. 163 that the committee should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, Director General, Health Service Executive, and his officials to the meeting.

As members are well aware, this involves allegations of abuse and neglect of the most egregious nature.  The committee has asked the HSE to provide clarity on two particular matters of concern, which have emerged over the past week, and I am conscious that recent media coverage may have raised other issues that it may also wish me to address.</p><p>In addressing the committee today, we will be mindful of the fact that this matter remains subject to a live investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we will be careful not to prejudice or impede that process.</p><p> The committee asked the Health Service Executive, HSE, to address specifically a number of key issues which I will deal with in turn.  Before addressing those issues I wish to place on the record that I met the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, yesterday during which meeting we discussed the recommendation to Government for the establishment of a commission of investigation into this matter.  I welcome such a commission as it would provide a statutory mechanism to conclude this drawn-out process and allow the 47 users, their families and other interested parties to get answers to the questions they have been asking for many years now on this deeply concerning and dreadful case and to achieve some level of closure for all concerned.</p><p> Turning now to the issues and regarding the apology, the intention in early December 2015 was for the HSE to provide an update and an official apology to the 47 users, including Grace, who had contact over the years with the foster home at the centre of the abuse allegations.  Letters, which included official apologies, issued by registered post to 43 families.  Three service users were untraceable by the HSE or by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On 9 December, a verbal briefing, to include an official apology, was to be given to Grace and her mother the next day, 10 December.  While the 43 letters issued as planned, the HSE mishandled issuing the important apology to Grace and her mother.  In considering how to communicate to Grace in the most appropriate way, the view was taken that this should be undertaken in person in the first instance rather than by letter.  With this change in the mode of communication in the case of Grace, it is now evident that the official HSE apology that was intended to be issued to Grace and to her mother was not made at that time.  Unfortunately, the desire to offer a formal HSE apology was lost in the communication to the staff members who were to conduct the meeting in person with Grace.  Having personally reviewed the situation with those staff involved, I am satisfied that it was the intention to offer a full and frank apology to Grace.  I confirm that the HSE has since apologised officially to Grace and to her mother.  This official apology has been made by the chief officer both in person and in writing with the assistance of the professionals now caring for Grace.  There is correspondence in this regard appended to the opening statement.</p><p> As the director general of the HSE I wrote yesterday to the 44 families to let them know that I am unhappy with the way the HSE mishandled the apology and I also apologised to them for the further distress this mishandling may have caused them or their family member.  That letter is also appended in sample form.  Furthermore, it is clear from both of the unpublished reports that there were significant failings in the care provided by that foster family and significant failures by the former health board, and subsequently the HSE, to make the situation safe.  For this, I offer them and their family member a full, sincere and heartfelt apology.</p><p> With regard to the communications to the Committee of Public Accounts, the HSE became aware of concerns being raised in the public domain on 20 January following a report in a national newspaper.  The HSE sought reassurance at local level that the apology had in fact been given.  As a result of this, a report was provided confirming that an apology had been offered.  The report formed the basis of the submission to the committee by the HSE on the morning of 21 January.  However, it is the case that the assurance given to the chief officer, which she in turn passed upwards, referred to an individual expression of regret of the senior staff members to Grace and her mother.  This expression of regret was then mistakenly taken as confirmation of an official apology on behalf of the HSE.  I wish to take this opportunity to offer, in person, an unreserved apology to the Committee of Public Accounts and its members for submitting a document that contained erroneous information at that time.  I assure the committee that having met the principals involved, I am satisfied there was no intention to mislead the committee.</p><p> Regarding the question of other placements after 2009 when Grace was removed, it is important at this point to assure the committee that based on all the information available to the HSE and having regard to the two investigation reports, the best information currently available is that (1) no new placement was made by the South Eastern Health Board after the primary decision of 1995.</p><p>(2) Grace was the only health board placed person to remain with the foster family after 1995.  (3) The South Eastern Health Board, now the HSE, is aware of one other person having contact by living arrangement with the family after 1995.  I confirm today that she - Ann, as I will call her - remains in full-time, seven-day residential care with a voluntary provider and takes regular visits home to her mother.  I also note for clarity that a different name has been used by Fergus Finlay in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>today.  I believe Fiona is the name he has assigned to her.  I want to be clear that we are talking about the same person, but this document was written before we knew that Mr. Finlay was using that name, so I have referred to her as Ann.  4) In April 2015, following a national broadcast, the provider, as full-time carer, contacted the HSE, having reflected on their involvement in recent years, and indicated concerns regarding historical unexplained bruising.  Two professionals independent of the case were commissioned by the HSE to examine this matter.  The investigation report was provided to the HSE yesterday, and nothing untoward is evident in the findings.  The provider has also provided information to HIQA and Tusla, and the HSE remains in contact with those organisations.  Within the limited powers it has, the HSE is pursuing references to alleged non-residential contact between Ann and her former foster carers.  I can confirm she is in a residential placement and this is her primary source of protection.<br/><br/>From the summary review of the information based on files reviewed by Resilience Ireland, I can now summarise the position in respect of Ann.  I am conscious that this will be the subject of further detailed consideration and therefore I emphasise that this is a high-level overview.  Ann was born in 1980.  She is now aged 35 years and has had a severe intellectual disability since birth.  Her contact with the foster family, with whom she lived on a part-time basis, commenced when she was 12 years old.  All her arrangements were conducted privately by her family.  During June 2011, having been contacted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE team at local level engaged with the family again to confirm that there was a Garda investigation, to advise them of concerns and to invite them to make direct contact with the Garda if they wished.  In October 2011, Ann, then 31 years of age, was residing in a five-day week residential placement with a voluntary provider.  A seven-day week service was offered with the same provider, but her family confirmed they had no concerns regarding the foster family and wished to continue their part-time contact with the foster mother and had confirmed this to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The seven-day week placement was not taken up at that time.<br/><br/>In early 2012, a local HSE team sought legal advice on the case of Ann, which informed them that they could take no further action regarding her placement at that point.  From 2011 to 2013, there were various engagements with Ann's family, essentially to persuade them to cease contact with the former foster family.  In October 2013, the HSE formally demanded that the foster family cease all care activity which was either current, as in Ann's case, or which they might be minded to engage in towards the future.  Later that month, Ann's family was formally written to requesting that they cease the placement, and it ceased shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Regarding the care needs of those who had any contact with the foster home in question, I confirm to the committee that the service user, who was removed from the foster home in mid-2009, has been fully cared for in full-time residential care by a voluntary service provider since mid-2009.  The HSE chief officer and her team in the south east will continue to work collaboratively with the service provider, the service user and advocates to ensure the highest quality of service and support continues to be provided to the service user involved.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the Resilience Ireland report commissioned by the HSE was to look back at all service users who had any contact with the foster home in the south east and to have their care needs reviewed to ensure the necessary supports and services were in place.  In the main, the service users were either in residential placement or living at home and availing of day services.</p><p>As a result of the review, increased respite was provided where needed to those living at home, and specially tailored supports were provided in some other cases.</p><p> Other matters were raised by voluntary providers in correspondence.  In relation to equity of funding for providers in the south east, outlined in my handout is the funding relevant to the provider in question, from 2009 to 2015.  We have full detail in two categories, totalled, with an indication of the percentage changes from year to year.  This includes additional funding in 2015 for a new service regarding named individuals, sleepover costs, school leavers and changing needs.</p><p> Between 2008 and 2014, the five largest funded organisations in the State providing intellectual disability services received an average reduction in funding of 12%.  Since 2009, the disability sector has been generally protected from any decreases in allocation, except for those due to Government reductions such as pay reductions, the Haddington Road Agreement and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  Based on the percentage increases or decreases of the three main providers in the area from 2009 to 2014, the voluntary provider in question had a 4.9% reduction in funding, while the average nationally was 12%, and in the local area the average reduction was 9% for the major providers.  The increases in 2015 reflect the intention to support the provider, particularly in the context of the needs of individuals highlighted in the Resilience review.</p><p> It is important to assure committee members, those concerned and the wider public that the HSE did not wait for the publication of reports to take actions to improve the service and management failings identified in child care and disability services and to act on the recommendations of the reports.  A comprehensive action plan is in place to address the combined recommendations of the reports.  A number of the key recommendations implemented include those related to child care and fostering services in Waterford, for which a full review was undertaken.  Recommendations were implemented between 2010 and 2012, with investment in staff and improvements in practice and supervision.  Intervention with vulnerable adults is limited in the legislative and policy framework.  A key recommendation of the Conal Devine report was the implementation of a HSE safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults.  This policy was published in December 2014, with an immediate implementation plan which has progressed through 2015.  This included the establishment of professional, resourced safeguarding teams in the nine community health care organisations.</p><p> The HSE is establishing a national independent review panel with an independent chair and review team for disability services.  Establishment of the panel has been included as a priority in the HSE's national service plan for 2016.  It is intended, in the first instance, that the review panel will focus on serious incidents that occur in disability services across the HSE and HSE-funded services.  The review panel will be modelled on the Tusla review panel, which reviews cases in which children die or experience serious harm while in the care of the State.  In December 2014, I appointed Ms Leigh Gath as an independent confidential recipient to examine concerns and provide help and advice to vulnerable adults, or anyone concerned about a vulnerable adult in a HSE or HSE-funded service.</p><p> The HSE received confirmation in writing from An Garda on Friday, 29 January 2016, that its investigation remains ongoing and that clearance is not provided for either of the reports to be published.</p></speech>

I presume that committee members will want to ask questions after me, so I will go ahead, and I might speak again afterwards, once everyone else is done.</p><p>I thank Mr. O'Brien and his officials for coming in today.  In the third line of his opening statement, Mr. O'Brien referred to allegations of abuse and neglect "of the most egregious nature".  Thanks to a number of national newspaper reports, the nature of the alleged abuse has been publicised.  It is worth repeating that information here today because it has never been articulated or verbalised at this committee.  According to those reports, and I know this to be the case from meetings I have had in my own constituency, we are dealing with allegations of rape with implements.  These are allegations of horrific sexual abuse.  At previous meetings, I alluded to the fact that this was probably the worst example of abuse I had ever come across.</p><p> It is worth pointing out what has been publicised and the horrendous nature of what we are talking about here.  Mr. O'Brien referred in his opening statement to allegations of abuse and neglect "of the most egregious nature".  He admitted in his report to serious poor care failings and has made apologies.  Can Mr. O'Brien, to start with, give us a description of the failings he is talking about and the kind of neglect he referred to as taking place over the course of 25 or 30 years?  What exactly, in his own mind, is he apologising for?  Can we start with that?</p></speech>

In the two reports, and the Devine report in particular, there is considerable detail which I cannot go into in the specifics because of the nature of those reports.  They relate, in essence, to opportunities that might have been taken to deal with the allegations that were known at the time, which, had they been dealt with in a different way, would almost certainly have produced a different outcome.  This occurs on a number of occasions in the period essentially back to the mid-1990s.  While the allegations are just that - allegations - and are not probative at this stage because of other processes, they are of a sufficient nature that they could have triggered different actions by the persons dealing with the case.</p></speech>

It is probably a good example.  Mr. O'Brien is probably aware of comments that Ministers have made in recent days on individuals who made the mistakes about which we are speaking and who were responsible, in large part, for the neglect, poor care and, potentially, the very serious sexual abuse that occurred or is alleged.  To cut the chase, outside of Garda investigations and commissions of investigation, there are people still in the system, by which I mean the HSE, who have graduated to other organisations dealing with child protection whose work and involvement in this, in some cases, goes back to the 1990s.  They are still in the system and are still dealing with children and making very serious decisions at a very senior level when it comes to children.  What is Mr. O'Brien doing about this?  I want him to answer this question, considering he is the director general of the organisation.  What is he doing?  He must have concerns that if there are people who are responsible for this and for the neglect, as he put it, the poor care and the failings then surely the most basic and obvious step would be to have these people step aside until any investigation is concluded.</p> <p>  The public interest dimension of this now requires, in my opinion, these people to step aside while an investigation is concluded.  What is not tolerable by the public at this point is for those people who were responsible for this to continue in their jobs, based on the fact they still have senior positions dealing with child protection in this country.  If Mr. O'Brien's organisation does not understand this, it understands nothing.  This is really, I think, the kernel of the matter today.  Mr. O'Brien should probably have addressed it in his opening statement, and I am surprised he did not.  Before he leaves the committee room, he will have to address this and satisfy the members of the committee that the individuals involved and responsible for this will account for themselves.  That is critical, necessary and obvious.</p></speech>

I know the Deputy will allow me to do so.  I referred in my first answer, when the Deputy asked me for what I was apologising, to a specific decision that was made to leave Grace in the foster home in the 1990s.  This was made by a three person panel, for want of a better word, and those three persons are no longer in the public service to be clear about that.</p> <p>  The Conal Devine report was commissioned specifically to lay out in full unvarnished detail who did what and when, and would be the basis upon which any action in the disciplinary space would be taken.  From the outset of its commencement, there was close liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it was always understood and intended that the report would be published and available, whatever action may be necessary.</p><p>However, since its conclusion in 2012, it has not been possible to use it for that purpose, and that is why no disciplinary action has been proceeded with on foot of the Conal Devine report.</p></speech>

I am saying this has gone on for 30 years.  We talk about the circumstances of Ann, in particular, in 2013 and maybe before then.  Considering that we are talking about a current situation and that very serious issues were raised in the early 1990s, Mr. O'Brien's answer is not sufficient.  He cannot stand over what he just said with regard to the means of dealing with the people who are potentially responsible for making these mistakes, which are very horrendous and serious.  It is just not going to wash any longer.  Mr. O'Brien has got to accept that.  The public will not allow it to wash.  This matter dates back 20 or 30 years.  We are talking about something in 2013 that was raised back in the early 1990s.  Mr. O'Brien is going to have to come up with something better.  I am sorry, but he will have to deal with the issue of those individuals who were responsible for this, who allowed it to continue and who have not been brought to book by his organisation because it would actually become an issue for it in terms of its corporate culture and the fact that the HSE's attitude to everything has become so defensive and litigious.  The HSE has become incapable of dealing straightforwardly with problems and, as a result, it has actually become a danger to the very people it is meant to protect in the first place.  That is the issue.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien again - I am sure other members will ask him as well - what he is doing about the individuals who, from the early 1990s, made these decisions and who are still in the system in some cases.  Mr. O'Brien should please not hide behind the Conal Devine report and the Garda investigations any longer.  He will have to come up with a better answer with regard to making these people account for themselves.  They are within his organisation in some cases.</p></speech>

If the committee has any doubt that I am not in a position to publish and proceed, it is able to take its own legal advice.  I imagine and am certain it would be advised in the same way that I am advised, that is, that I cannot use that report in any way until I am cleared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to publish it.  If I were to do so, I would be prejudicing an ongoing criminal investigation, which I do not have the right to do.  If one had an unfettered ability to rewrite the law book, one might do things differently.

If this is basically going to be the stonewall here today, as has been the case in every meeting with Mr. O'Brien at which this issue has been discussed, we are probably not going to get anywhere.  With regard to the reports the invocation of one of the health Acts so the Minister and the junior Minister involved can finally request the reports after all this time is curious.  It is curious and problematic for us that, after years and months of being told that "there is no way we can actually get or read these reports", they finally have the reports.  All that had to be done was to read an Act and see that the definition of the Acts does allow these reports to be obtained.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has got to let me finish.  Again, the kernel of this is the public interest dimension.  Now Mr. O'Brien has admitted the mistakes and the failings - we know the detail of the allegations involved and we know the people who are still within the system in many cases while some have moved on to other organisations dealing with child protection.  The reality is that a previous Garda investigation collapsed.  This second Garda investigation may not go anywhere and commissions of investigation takes time.  People retire or leave the system.  The people who are actually charged with making these mistakes remain in situ and have access to files and e-mails and are sitting on potential evidence.  That is a big issue.  If Mr. O'Brien is so frustrated legally and is saying "Oh my God I cannot do anything ... these people", has he asked anyone whether or not there needs to be a change of course with regard his powers internally?  If it is the case that he is going crazy in not being able to deal with this and not being able to make these people account for themselves, has he just given up and left it at that?  Is that effectively the answer to the committee here today?</p></speech>

I know the term "stonewalling" has a certain cachet.  I am not stonewalling the committee.  I am prepared to answer any question I can that does not involve me effectively publishing the two reports that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has asked me not to.  I want to be very clear that this is the only reason they were not published.  The reports were accepted when they were submitted; the Conal Devine report in 2012 and the Resilience report in March 2015.  The recommendations are being pursued and the intention of the commissioning of the Conal Devine Report - which preceded my own time - and it is written in to the terms of reference, was that it would be for publication.  It has been prepared carefully so it can be published but it cannot be published in the face of a Garda objection to its publication.</p></speech>

It was the case that I had not read them, although I was obviously aware of the recommendations and monitoring their implementation.  When I was last here and we talked about this, I shared correspondence with the committee concerning the decision of the Information Commissioner and the pending cooling-off period, subject to whether there would be an appeal, etc.  In that period, recognising that it was likely that the recommendations would all be in the public domain, I took the opportunity to read the full reports.  I re-read them last weekend and I am now very familiar with what they say, but I still cannot tell the Deputy all that they say.</p></speech>

When Mr. O'Brien has asked questions about this issue in the past couple of years, is he happy that the information he received was accurate?  Is he happy that he was not misinformed?  Is he happy that the people whom he asked to deal with this gave him the correct answers at all times?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-02-02a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016020200002#N02700"><p>I am certainly happy that every effort has been made to give me the correct information.  On occasion I have had the opportunity to question something - is that complete, is that whole, is the sequence of that correct - but on the broad issue of trust, the answer is "Yes."  From time to time I do not trust everybody, but on this one, given the existence of the two reports which are clear and unambiguous and the other information that has been provided, I have a good degree of trust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-02-02a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016020200002#N02800"><p>Finally - for the time being, anyway - on the issue of the apology, Mr. O'Brien mentioned the rebuttal to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  Frankly, if Daniel McConnell had not written that story in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, we would not be sitting here talking about this today.  With regard to Mr. O'Brien's two-page rebuttal, which was very detailed and very specific with regard to individuals - how they did it, what they said - is he comfortable that he was given the correct information?  He stated that it was a misunderstanding; I do not believe that.  I think it was dressed up.  I believe the two individuals who were meant to give that apology were never instructed to give the apology, and they made it clear to people after the fact that they did not give the apology.  With regard to Mr. O'Brien's version of events, which I will not go into, I do not believe it occurred the way it has been characterised.  In some ways that is a good thing, because we would not be talking about this and we would not have a commission of investigation if Mr. O'Brien had not gone to the bother of rebutting that story in the two-page letter to the committee.</p><p>It was, as it has turned out, not a negative thing.  The director general can go ahead.</p></speech>

I also saw the correspondence.  I should say, at the outset, that I was not happy with the nature of the apology at all in relation to the 44 letters that went out, which is why I have subsequently issued a much more appropriate apology myself and there is a copy of that attached to the opening statement.  That is the first thing to say.<br/><br/>In relation to the miscommunication, misunderstanding, mis-interpretation or whatever we care to call it, I have spoken to all of the parties involved, including those two.  Having looked at the whites of their eyes and sat down with them for over two and half hours, I am satisfied that there was a miscommunication and that there was no intention to mislead.  I cannot imagine why the people involved - the chief officer, for example, has been working in Ireland for about four or five months, having been in Australia for a long time.  The two individuals concerned, I cannot imagine why they would wish or have any motivation to concoct a story in relation to this apology given that the three of those, and those to whom they sent that information, but the three of those had no hand, act or part in the previous substantive issues that we are talking about.  I do not see any motivation there either to misunderstand or mislead and I accept their bona fides.<b></b>I agree that the net effect is that an incorrect story was told and this committee was given incorrect information and, again, I apologise for that.</p></speech>

I will come back in later after other members have contributed.  The hallmark of this entire issue with Mr. O'Brien's organisation has been when anyone asks a question, in here or at ministerial level, they are given just enough information to suffice with regard to kicking the matter down the road.  The hallmark of this matter is that full information has not been given by Mr. O'Brien's organisation at times.  The HSE, as the Chairman has said, has been dragged kicking and screaming, in many respects and on many occasions, to give us that information.  That is the hallmark of this entire issue and that has been our experience in this committee.</p><p>I am afraid that is a big problem for me.</p></speech>

If we were able to do that, many of his concerns would be addressed in that he would have full information.  The reports pull no punches.  They lay this out in full detail and the issue that creates this difficulty is that we cannot give him those reports.</p></speech>

He should have read those reports a long time ago.  He tells us he has read them now, when these allegations date back to the early 1990s and are very serious.  For Mr. O'Brien to feel compelled now to read them tells me everything.  He should have done it a long time ago and it is inexcusable that he did not considering what we have brought up in this committee, what the concerns have been and their seriousness.  That tells us an awful lot.</p></speech>

For the information of members, Deputy Costello has indicated, as have Deputies McDonald, Dowds and McFadden.  That is the order in which members will contribute.  Before I call Deputy Costello, I want to bring the meeting back to the reason we are here.  It arises from poor information or misinformation, the work of the whistleblowers and their bravery in coming forward.</p> <p>  I would have thought, Mr. O'Brien, given the content of what has been told to the HSE by the whistleblowers and the extreme nature of the abuse we are speaking about, that you would have availed of the opportunity to be a lot more open in your opening statement.  I see the English language being used to strengthen the veil of secrecy around what is going on.  It is a pathetic attempt to continue what happened at our previous meeting.</p> <p>  I want to answer the question that Mr. O'Brien asked Deputy Deasy.  He might answer it in a different way, having reflected on it.  Mr. O'Brien asked him if he understood the legal advice and the legalities of where Mr. O'Brien stood.  Let me be clear about this.  Mr. O'Brien said that he shares our frustration.  He has no idea of the degree of frustration and anger that exists throughout the country, beyond this committee, concerning this issue.  As we get nearer to the centre and to the families concerned, and we experience the sadness and watch on their faces the question marks and the fact they have misplaced their trust in Mr. O'Brien's organisation, one cannot even begin to answer them or to understand that sadness.  I do not know how the individuals who suffered in this foster home feel.</p> <p>  To answer the question about this legal discussion that Mr. O'Brien had with Deputy Deasy, what about the rights of the 47?  What about the breach of their rights?  What about the fact their rights were trampled upon, kicked around and ignored by the State and Mr. O'Brien's organisation?  What about those rights?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien can find all the fancy words in the English dictionary to describe this.  It is alleged rape.  It is alleged sexual abuse of the most horrific kind.  It is physical abuse.  It is in the form of evidence where the clients appeared in hospital, battered and bruised.  It is in the form of evidence from the whistleblowers as to what happened.  Yes, we speak now about Grace and Ann, but there are 47 people affected by this who cannot speak for themselves, who could not speak for themselves at the time and who are intellectually disabled.</p><p>Your defence is not of them; your defence is of those who ignored that house to one degree or another, those who failed in their duty of care.  That would seem to be your defence.  I find that absolutely shocking because of where we are today and because we are here today.  I understand the legalities around the publication.  However, I want you to understand this - it is not about the members of the Committee of Public Accounts and what we feel.  It is about you giving some sort of comfort to these 47 and to all others in care in this State on this day, but I do not get that comfort from your statement.  I do not get a sense that the HSE gets it.  That is what is coming across in the opening questions from Deputy Deasy and the conversation around those questions.</p><p> I will call Deputy Costello next, and I am honestly asking you to please reflect on the state of play within the HSE and on those within the HSE who know exactly what happened because they do know.  I wish to remind you that in 1993 the South-Eastern Health Board carried out investigation after investigation because of the Kilkenny incest cases.  There was a spotlight on the South-Eastern Health Board for a long time during this period.  There was a concentration on the care for the intellectually disabled and those in care.  How this home escaped all of that, I do not know.  I am not convinced that what was going on was not widely known within the HSE at the time.</p><p> I will finish on this.  In his opening remarks Mr. O'Brien adverted to those who were referred to this service by the HSE or the health board, as it was then.  There were other referrals - from the Brothers of Charity I think - but they stopped those referrals because of suspicions they had in 1990.  However, the HSE or the health board continued.</p><p> A further aspect is that individuals were taken into that foster home independently of either the HSE or the Brothers of Charity.  I would have expected you to avail of the opportunity today to give an overall context to how this house existed at all, to its interaction with the HSE or the health board and the Brothers of Charity and to how they independently took in individuals.</p><p> Lastly, I thought you would have dealt with the complaint made by an authority in England.  We are told an authority in the United Kingdom made a complaint in respect of the service and concerns certain individuals had.  That is the context for today's meeting.  Let us not forget the horrific nature of the abuse in this case as you answer questions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien and his team for coming before the committee today.  The matters we are discussing are extremely serious.  I do not think we have had an issue of such a horrendous nature before this committee previously.  Important issues of accountability and responsibility arise before us today as well as the question of the entire operation and ethos of the HSE.  We are discussing a very serious matter.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien gave us a briefing and said that the HSE sent us a briefing paper on 10 December.  In the opening points in that document the HSE states that no individuals have been placed with the family by the South-Eastern Health Board, the HSE or voluntary service providers since 1995.  Is that the situation?</p></speech>

I went to see them specifically in order to prepare for this encounter today.  The individuals concerned confirmed that when asked if an apology had been given - they were asked that in the context of responding to this issue - they said "Yes".  They also confirmed that they were not saying they had given an official apology.  In the course of expressing their remorse, the word "sorry" was used.  When they were asked had they apologised, they confirmed yes.  The person asking the question did not ask them whether they had given personal expressions of remorse.  That person was asking them whether they had given an official apology.  There was a request for an apology to be included in the overall process, but that was not picked up.  In my view, having spoken to all concerned, this was an honest mistake.  That mistake influenced what happened at the meetings and in the telephone call.  It carried through to the information that was provided to the committee, which was incorrect, and to that extent it misled the committee.  The question is whether anyone set out to mislead the committee.  Having spoken to all of those involved, I do not believe they did.</p></speech>

It states that:</p><blockquote>The two HSE representatives to whom the HSE have attributed the apologies to our client and to her mother have both confirmed to us that they were never asked to apologise, that they did not apologise, and they told the HSE chief officer that no apologies were given, yet the HSE continued to issue repeated statements containing fabricated information about meetings that did not happen, apologies that were never covered, never offered, and conversations that never took place.</blockquote> <p>Is Mr. O'Brien saying that is an untruth?</p></speech>

In the discussions, teleconferences, preparations and communications it was always the intent to actually send a letter to all of the people and their families.  Over the course of that time, with the local people involved - a local HSE team - it was decided that the best way of communicating to Grace and her mother would involve more personalised communication.  In the translation between the letter right through to the actual meeting that vital apology got lost.</p></speech>

When one then brings that forward to January, and the people in question were asked if they had given the apology, their first response was that they did apologise.  On the back of that, the information was supplied from the local team through to the national office and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was subsequent to that that we actually discovered what happened, through my direct interactions with the two people concerned, and they clarified for me that when they had said they had given an apology it was actually a personal statement of sympathy and remorse.  On finding out - that was after the Committee of Public Accounts-----</p></speech>

They had a relationship with the organisation and one of the parties had at least met Grace before.  It was in the context of how we could do the best thing in terms of the person involved and taking due regard of trying to lessen any distress that some of these decisions were made</p></speech>

They were moving from a standardised letter with an apology in it, which I do not think was a sufficient apology but nonetheless included an apology and which would have satisfied the expectations that were reflected in the document that was sent to the committee on 10 December 2015.  The timetabling around this was influenced by the decision of the Freedom of Information Commissioner, the expiration of the appeal period and the timing of the meeting.  There was a strong desire on the part of the social care division to get that part of the report that was approved to be released into the public domain to the committee by that date.  A significant level of effort had been made to ensure the individuals involved and their families - there were 47 families, 44 of whom could be contacted - were made aware in advance of release that it could lead to some parts of this information coming into the public domain.  The social care division made a decision that an apology should be included in that letter.  It was in the case of 43.  The decision was made locally in the case of the person to whom we are referring to as Grace that this should be done in a different way.  That in essence is where it went wrong.</p></speech>

The HSE tried to persuade the family not to send Ann into the abusive care.  Why did it not close it down and put a stop to it?  It took the HSE another three years from the time of the legal advice to send a letter which was, as Mr. O'Brien stated in his remarks, "demanding the foster family cease all care activity".  Then and only then was Ann's family written to formally to request that they cease the placement.  Surely that is gross incompetence.</p></speech>

It goes back to my earlier conservation with the Deputy that we talk about the "foster home" and the "foster mother" although they had ceased to be that in the 1990s.  This is dealt with in the Devine report in a very clear and comprehensive way.</p><p>It had ceased to be a foster home and this person had ceased to be a foster mother.  That is clear, but we talk about the individual as the foster mother.</p><p> What happened was that when this situation arose in respect of Grace, the Devine report was carried out, which examined all of the issues around that.  It focused particularly on Grace - that is why it was constituted - but in the course of the work, the investigation team identified four other cases of significance.  Ann was not identified as part of that.  There were concerns of a serious nature in respect of that, and they were followed up.  The issue in-----</p></speech>

The area manager oversaw an investigation report by Devine, which came in 2012.  Subsequent to that, a look-back exercise was undertaken and that is the Resilience report.  What we have done is that we have taken the individual, specific situation that was identified in 2009, all the recommendations on that and an action plan was identified to implement those.  We also undertook a look-back to see, and that was the purpose of the Resilience report, and anyone who had any contact in relation to that home has had a look-back.  That was the purpose of the communication that Deputy Costello talked about; we were setting out the interviews that would happen.  There were 47 people, and 35 people were interviewed, including Ann's mother.  They were engaged with, initially, by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The agreement in relation to the look-back exercise was that there was full engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a protocol was put in place - it was called a contact protocol - and the Garda would meet people individually first and go through all of that.

It was in the context of those reports being undertaken that the question was asked at the national summit in relation to whether the reports were going to be published.

Mr. O'Brien said that various engagements were made with the family to persuade them to cease contact with Ann's foster family from 2011 to 2013, but that it took the HSE until 2013 to demand that the foster family cease all care activity, and that immediately after the letter was written to Ann's family to request that they cease contact with the foster family, they did so.  Once the HSE made the decision and closed the care facility, Ann's family immediately went along with that decision.  Given its awareness of the situation, why did the HSE not close that care facility, which it knew to be a site of abuse, instead of simply trying to dissuade the family from having any contact with the foster family?  Surely there is gross negligence on the HSE's part in this matter.</p></speech>

There were boarding-out arrangements in that period, prior to 1996, and the home would have been paid the foster allowance at that time.  Once the foster children were aged 18, the home ceased to receive the allowances.  The arrangement ceased in 1995, according to the best information that the investigation team could find.  When Grace reached the age of 18, no more foster payments or boarding-out payments were made from that time.  Grace, as an intellectually disabled individual, would have received what was, I think, DPMA at that time.  Subsequent to that-----</p></speech>

We need to figure this out and the delegates must be clear on it.  Once Ann reached the age of majority, what was the status of the then health board in terms of its duty of care and what was the status of her family?  I am raising this very particularly because the delegates are going to very great lengths to emphasise these were private arrangements.  It is actually very reminiscent of the Magdalen laundries, this private arrangement carry-on.  The initial statement looks to me kind of dishonourable in that it wishes to hang the culpability for all of this around the neck of Ann's family, that they were negligent in not intervening and not bringing this situation to an end.</p><p>That is the impression I have from the statement and from Mr. O'Brien's comments so far.</p></speech>

At the point at which Ann turned 18 she became an adult, albeit a very vulnerable one.  The health board was aware that there were issues with the foster home, which was then not a foster home.  Why is it that Mr. O'Brien insists it was for her family to intervene and ensure her safety?  Will he answer this for me?</p></speech>

Ann was attending a special school and living at home, and when she came to graduate she had an assessment, as might happen, and moved part-time into a voluntary service, living at home part-time.  This was not unusual at the time, not only in the south east but elsewhere.  She was moving into adult-type services.  The family had developed a good relationship with this mother - with this woman - and they maintained that relationship for 18 years.  They were wedded to it and they felt very strongly about it.  That comes across from those who undertook interviews and so on.  The issue here is that in 1992 - or in 1998, as she became an adult - that was the level of development of the service at the time.  In 2011, as the Garda was investigating matters, it contacted the local service, and there was engagement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and health service personnel over a period.  Ann had moved into a five-day service at this stage, and to remove the requirement with regard to weekends, or anything of that nature, a seven-day service was offered.</p></speech>

That is my understanding.  I refer the delegates to the letter of apology.  It is signed by Ms Colley.  One of the matters for which there is an apology is an absence of the necessary protocols and arrangements to support the placement in foster families of vulnerable children and adults with a disability.  The HSE concedes, correctly, that that is its job.  The attempts in respect of Ann, based on the controversy that has arisen over her ongoing placement and the discovery made, to make the family culpable are really unfair.  They are dishonourable and inaccurate.  I would like the delegation to correct the record.</p></speech>

Mr. Healy knew there was a risk to the girl and did not tell the family about the sex abuse allegations because somebody had initiated a report.  It is morally disgraceful.  That is the issue.  That is at the centre of all this.</p></speech>

What appears to be the case and what we could see is that there was consultation between the team locally and the Garda on what could be said - that is why I mentioned the Devine report - in the context of both a Garda investigation and the Devine report.  The team was advised that it should talk about serious concerns of care, which is what it did, and vouch for children in the home, or words to that effect.  I am not giving the exact wording but paraphrasing.  In the context of investigations at the time, associated with the Devine report and, more important, the Garda, those concerned consulted regarding what was to be done, and that is what they did.  The garda&iacute; advised them to get the family to speak to the Garda.</p><p>I know it is referenced in the report that they spoke to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Later, at the end of 2011 when a seven day placement was offered, the family made a choice.  Having advised the local health service team and having discussed the matter with the garda&iacute; the family was satisfied to continue with arrangements as they were.</p></speech>

Please, there is no need for any further expansive narrative because here we go again; the onus was left on the family to make the call.  That is a derogation of your duty.  Irrespective of what the family thought, there was a responsibility on the State and on the authorities to protect this woman.  She is a woman at this stage.  She entered the care arrangement at the age of 12 in the year when the concerns were first brought to the attention of the authorities but she was left there.  The explanation offered by the witness - let us not put any blas on it - is that she was left there because that was the decision of her family.  That simply does not stack up.</p> <p>  I am also alarmed at the fact - not least because the witnesses are before this committee - that they are not in a position to give us chapter and verse on precisely what amount of State money found its way into this particular institution.  This is information that should be made available to the committee.  It is information that ought to be in the public domain.  We have a scenario where State moneys are, at least in part, funding this place yet the HSE's oversight duties and so on - as were conceded in the letter of apology - were simply not fulfilled, not least in the case of Ann.</p></speech>

This was referred to and is referenced here.  However, there was a significant amount of preparatory work because the apology was part of the publication of this and all that went with it.  There was, therefore, a significant amount of work.  In fairness, some of that work was undertaken by the current chief officer's predecessor who was acting in the role and was actually doubling up in the role at the time.  There was a significant amount of work in preparing for that and getting all of that done.</p></speech>

There are ten interactions in respect of it and some activity towards the tail end of the process in December.  The apology is not made, yet a report is given to this committee that an apology was made.  The committee then receives the correspondence referred to earlier from the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association, which, I have to say, has proved to be a very honest broker in the midst of all of this.  It informs us that the two HSE representatives whom Mr. Healy has cited confirmed to the association that they were never asked to apologise, that they did not apologise and that they told the HSE chief officer that no apology was given.</p><p>That is in stark contradiction of what the witnesses have told us here.  There are two issues.  The first, which is perhaps testimony to the HSE's ineptitude, is that all of this work happens, from March, with all of these interactions, yet there is a miscommunication, according to the officials themselves.  My God - that is some shambles, is it not?  A high-level apology on an issue like this - these apologies are as rare as hen's teeth - that is some shambolic carry-on from the HSE.</p></speech>

First of all, I asked about the circumstances in which they were giving the apology and the nature of the request to them to give the apology.

Otherwise, I will lose my train of thought.  When arranging to have the meeting, they did not signal that an apology was to be given because they did not understand that they were being asked to give an apology.  That is one point in the letter.  I subsequently asked them how was it that the organisation we are referring to here was able to say that these conversations took place and so on, and each of the individuals received a telephone call in which they were asked, "Were you asked to give an apology?  Did you give an apology?  Have you told them you did not give an apology?".  They confirmed that those conversations had occurred, but that was consistent with the fact that they had not understood - or had not been effectively communicated with, whichever way we care to put it - that an apology was to form part of that meeting.  They arranged and went to the meeting without having in mind the giving of an apology.  They left the meeting with the individual concerned, and when I met them on Friday I asked how could it then be that when this issue was queried there was confirmation that an apology had been given.  In the case of one of the people involved, the exact way it was put to me was, "When I was asked had I apologised, I said I had."  I asked why the person had said this, and he said, "Because the person I was talking to became upset and I told her how sorry I was about everything."  When he was asked whether he had apologised, he answered it in the context of what he had said, which was not the same as the context in which he was being asked the question.  At the outset, there was a miscommunication about whether an apology was to be given in that meeting, and everything else followed from that.  It is not necessary to conclude that any of these parties are lying.  What the WIDA letter says is correct.  That information was given to them by the two individuals.  There is no question-----</p></speech>

I am at a loss to understand how the ambiguity arose.  Ms Colley has told me it was not in a letter and it was going to be done verbally.  That is hardly an earth shattering concept to take on board for somebody that the HSE has entrusted, by the way, to deal with a very traumatic and sensitive situation, a really bad situation.  For that to get miscommunicated or misunderstood is beyond the understanding of just about anybody else outside, perhaps, of the HSE.  To be frank, I am worried that we are getting the truth from the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association and we are getting a kind of massaging of things from the HSE.  That is what my instincts are telling me, from what we have heard from Ms Colley.</p></speech>

Based on my reading of the reports, where harm has occurred and if anyone wishes to litigate on the basis of that, there is no effective defence that can be offered.  As the Deputy knows, the HSE does not manage the process of litigation when persons take lawsuits against the HSE.  While that is managed by a separate agency, as I see it there is no conceivable defence.  Therefore, the issue of litigation is not one that needs to be taken significantly into account in deciding what we do or do not do.</p></speech>

I am suggesting that we take a break for half an hour.  Before we suspend, I want to put two things on record for this part of the meeting.  In 2009, the HSE was told about the risk to Ann and was asked to take the necessary and reasonable steps to protect her.  That is a fact.  She was still there in 2013.  In respect of Grace, if my calculation is right from information that I have received, the foster mother would have been paid up to &euro;70,000 in disability allowance.  The HSE knew that Grace was at risk of financial abuse in 2007 and did nothing.  In 2009, when she was taken into care, she had no belongings, no documents and no money.  If that did not ring bells in an organisation, I just do not know what would.  Those two statements are factual.  Maybe we will address them later on.</p></speech>

The only caveat I put on that is that the HSE itself does not manage its legal defences.  It is managed, by statute, by the State Claims Agency but we will be very clear that in our view there is not an adequate defence that can be put forward, so we will not be seeking to defend.</p></speech>

However, it is my very clear view that there is no potential defence available and, therefore, the HSE will not seek to defend them.  That is the reason I was quite happy today to write to all 47 - and the members have a copy of the letter - with an unambiguous apology because I do not see any basis for any other course of action.  As I say, I have not come here to defend, merely to explain.</p></speech>

A range of additional supports are in place for people affected by this.  If they wish to claim in a civil way on the basis that a liability arises owing to the negligence of either the South-eastern Health Board or the HSE since its establishment then clearly they need to formally make that claim but we will not be seeking to defend if it relates to this foster home.</p></speech>

During 1992-1993 there were a lot of allegations made about abuse, which led to an internal investigation by a Pat Donaghy.  Arising from that, some time later - perhaps about two years afterwards - placements in that foster home were stopped, with the exception of the woman called Grace.  Presumably the report by Pat Donaghy raised very serious concerns.  How was it that probably the most vulnerable person was left in the home when everybody else was removed?  I accept that is before Mr. O'Brien's time but does he have any sense of understanding of why that happened?</p></speech>

What I will attempt to do is give a general characterisation rather than get into the fine detail, which would take me into difficult territory from the point of view that we have already discussed.</p> <p>  There were decisions at two levels - in other words, two separate sets of decisions at two separate levels - around not allowing Grace to continue but then there was a decision made at a third level which effectively countermanded those other decisions.</p></speech>

As set out in our report, the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association is a voluntary group that emerged locally.  It provides residential and day care services.  It is a medium-sized organisation and, therefore, it is funded by the HSE.  We have set out in the note today the funding provided over the past number of years.  What we were seeking to do was, I suppose, to indicate that since 2009, since the downturn commenced, all services in health have been affected to some degree.  I think there has been a general attempt to minimise the impact on disability services but they have had an impact.  That is reflected here.  What we are trying to indicate is that while the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association has been impacted on average with the medium and larger sized organisations they have been treated fairly from a funding point of view.

Probably unlike anyone else in this room, I have actually taught non-verbal children, and the non-verbal children whom I taught did not have intellectual disabilities but they were still incredibly vulnerable because they could not speak.  I am absolutely hit in the stomach by the fact that a really vulnerable woman was left in that sort of situation for 12 or 13 years after everybody else had been removed.  I find it impossible to get my head around that.  Arising from that, can I ask about the whistleblowers?  I am closely related to a whistleblower who suffered quite a lot after whistleblowing in a totally different area of life.  I am looking at the end of the letter signed by Claire Looney and Fiona O'Neill from WIDA.</p><p>It states:</p><blockquote>However, we remain concerned that the HSE's treatment of us as whistleblowers is as despicable now as it was six years ago.  The HSE's actions over the last week are the latest in a series of attempts to silence us.  We are no longer willing to accept this treatment as we feel we need to send a signal to the HSE and to other people who might wish to speak up for vulnerable people being failed by our health services who cannot speak for themselves.</blockquote><p>I will tie in with that the interview on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; last night, in which Claire Byrne talked to a whistleblower.  The whistleblower's voice was disguised and her face was not shown on the TV.  Why would whistleblowers in and around the HSE be afraid to show their faces, such as in the case of the woman last night?  Why did Claire Looney and Fiona O'Neill write that last paragraph in their letter?</p></speech>

As I see it, WIDA has been, is and will continue to be a very important service provider.  As I said earlier, they gave significant service through the period before, during and since the time of the protected disclosure.  It is important that we rebuild that relationship.</p> <p>  I did not see the programme last night.  One of the reasons for the disguising may well have been to protect the identity of their client, I understand that may be the case.</p></speech>

The fact that they are writing that at this point is of significant concern.  That is the primary reason I intend to meet with them, in order to ensure that any damage to that relationship can be rebuilt.</p></speech>

It seems to me that for whatever reason, there was real fear in the case of these whistleblowers that there would be very negative consequences.  That leads me to consider that if that kind of atmosphere is widespread in the HSE, it is a discouragement to staff who do a good job and want to do a good job - and I am sure the vast majority of people who work in the HSE fit into that category - to spill the beans if something wrong is happening.  This has a corrupting effect on an organisation.  What is the HSE going to do to try to address that issue?  One of the things that we should have learned over the last number of years is that the best way to protect an organisation is to root out those who cause damage from within; whether that be the Catholic Church, the HSE, or dare I say it, a particular political party.  There is a real need to do that and to support the people who throw light on problems.  I accept that the witness cannot straight away accept upfront what a whistleblower says and that their allegations must be checked out.  It strikes me that is what happened in the early 1990s in this particular case, but it was not fully followed through on.  It was followed through where most people were concerned, but not in the most unfortunate case of Grace.  What plan has the HSE in place to encourage people to throw light on things that are happening which should not be happening?</p></speech>

One of the issues with the creation of the HSE is that it was set up without any description of what its culture ought to be.  In our 2015-2017 corporate plan, which was approved by the Minister, we have committed ourselves, over the course of that time, to enabling four words to be the hallmarks of that culture, recognising that culture does not change instantaneously but is a long-term play.  Those four words, which appear on the top of the letterhead I use to write out to people, are care, compassion, trust and learning.  They are not intended as a description of the "as is" but as a description as to where we need to get to.  As the person with responsibility for leading the HSE, that is a message I pursue vigorously every time I am engaged in any meeting with staff, town hall meetings and so on, as do other members of the management team and management of community health care organisations and hospital groups.  We have to create a different understanding of the nature of the relationship that is required between the public health service, whatever its legal name may be, and society and the people who use or are dependent on those services.</p> <p>  We recognise that, right now, some people may be deterred from making protected disclosures.  There is the formal protected disclosure route, which is effectively the route that was used in this case.  However, there is also the confidential recipient in the form of Leigh Gath, and a number of issues have been satisfactorily dealt with in the intervening period since December 2014 when she took up that role.  Many issues have been raised that had to be pursued and brought to appropriate conclusion where Ms Gath was able to act as a strong advocate in this regard.</p></speech>

In the early 1990s, whistleblowers seem to have made their mark, but it just was not fully carried through.  It would have saved this State huge amounts of money if people had listened to whistleblowers in these matters.  If we count the investigation in the early 1990s, the two most recent investigations and the examination that is now taking place of what has been done already, we are talking about four investigations.  How much has all of that cost the HSE and, by extension, the State?</p></speech>

It would be far better for the efforts of the HSE to be directed more towards what its function should be, which is looking after people's health in the broadest sense of that word.  It is a great pity.</p> <p>  Before concluding, I take this opportunity, particularly as I am not seeking re-election, to thank the Chairman for his chairmanship over these past years.  It has been an honour to serve on this committee.  To describe any issues that come up here as high points would be incorrect because we are usually looking at the dirty linen of how things are done in this country.  However, it was a particular honour for me, because of my close connections with the organisation in question, to be here when representatives of the Central Remedial Clinic came before the committee.</p><p>I was in the rather invidious situation of having to tell somebody who appointed me to a job that he should give back some of the money he got.

A lot of what I would like to have said has already been said, so I will not go over a lot of it.  Initially when this came up for the Committee on Public Accounts, I thought it was not the appropriate place for this type of situation but when one looks at it, the whistleblower was so desperate to get anything done this is the path the person had to come down.  To me, it is mind-blowing - absolutely mind-blowing - the amount of to-ing and fro-ing that has been done by the HSE about an apology.  The whole thing about this was a cover-up and a protection of the HSE rather than protecting the people the HSE is actually paid to protect.  I think the amount of time that has been wasted - HSE staff, time and money - about an apology, when all that time and money could have been invested in clients, is outrageous.</p> <p>  With this in mind, it is no wonder the health service struggles like it does if this is the type of carry-on that goes on in it.  I think it must be very difficult for parents and families of the service users, and I am going to call them victims in this case, that they have to go through this and that they were so helpless that they could not help and protect their loved ones.  They depended on the HSE to do that and it was not done.  I would like to ask about the people who worked in these services.  Where are they now?  Were they fired?  Were they ever held accountable for what happened?  They should have been held accountable.  In most jobs in this day and age, and for the past while, one goes through an appraisal on a regular basis.  Did these staff ever have an appraisal?  As politicians we have appraisals every five years, and if one does not do one's job properly one loses one's job.  These people should be held accountable.</p> <p>  There are a few things by which I am really bothered.  In the case of Ann, Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement that in October 2013 the HSE formally demanded that the service stop being used.  Why was that not done before this?  Why did the HSE wait until 2013 to formally demand that this would happen?  If it could do it why did it not do it before?  Why did it wait?  Mr. O'Brien spoke about the &euro;225,000 in combined reports, in the two reports, rather.  That money, I would suggest, would probably have provided a person-centred individual service for a client with an intellectual disability for a year at least, for at least two or three clients for one year, and this money was wasted on reports and other things.</p> <p>  I will ask all of my questions and the witnesses can come back in, because I am so annoyed that if I stop now I might forget.  In the HSE's report to the Committee on Public Accounts in December 2015, one of the things on page 6 was the 47 clients and the way the HSE broke them down.  It stated three could not be traced.  That is unbelievable, that there are three clients of the HSE who cannot be traced and nobody knows where they are.  Are they missing?  I ask the witnesses to tell me about that, please.  I would like to know how much money was spent.  Deputy McDonald might have asked this question, and the HSE cannot tell how much money was spent, which to me is ridiculous.  It loses clients and it does not know how much is being spent on the service.</p> <p>  Mr. Healy spoke about the downturn in the economy and said it had an effect on the disability services.  I have to say to him that no amount of money could provide or can pay for this.  This is not about money.  This is about a properly run health service.  It is about a properly run system.  Mr. O'Brien said the HSE does not have legal authority to end an arrangement like the one in this case.  It may not have a legal authority, but it certainly has a moral authority.  If it knew there was something going on  I think the HSE had a moral obligation to look after that person.  If I worked there and if I had a child, I would not want it to be in a situation like that.  I am so annoyed now that I am going to forget something.</p><p> Mr. Healy said Ann was assessed when she graduated at 18.  Presumably, the assessment was by a psychologist.  What kind of assessment was that and what was its purpose?  Was it educational?  At what stage was Ann at that time?  Did alarm bells not ring for the psychologist when Ann was assessed at 18?  If either of the delegates could answer those questions for me, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

As was normal around that time, she was assessed at 17.5 years.  The assessment was carried out by the local Brothers of Charity service.  It involved psychiatry and psychology.  It was an assessment as to what was the best placement and so on.  She graduated, attending a voluntary provider after that and so on.  In relation to-----</p></speech>

Among the 47 that we set out, Ann's family is one of the 18 families that identified that they had a good experience.  One of the challenges that arose regarding this matter was that, in their view, they actually had a good experience of working with the mother, and that had influenced them in how they dealt with the matter.  There were no issues of any kind.  I mentioned in the previous contribution that Ann was never in care and there were never child protection issues or anything of that nature.  She went for the assessment simply because she was at the age where she was graduating, having been in a special school.  I refer to day-to-day services.</p> <p>  I shall refer to the issue at the time in 2009 after Grace was moved out of the facility to a voluntary provider.  I was trying to articulate that, for a period, the Devine report did not identify any particular case, or did not identify Ann&rsquo;s case.  The investigation was going on.  Clearly, from the report, there was information locally to the effect that she was attending the location in question, and that is when engagement with the family took place and so on.  I think what happened then was that a senior manager in the area was reviewing the Devine report implementation and assessing it and, in that context, raised the issue of taking more decisive action in relation to Ann.  At that point, the Devine report had been concluded and the Garda investigation was still going on.  It was at that point that the foster mother was written to and instructed not to take placements any more, and the family was also written to.</p> <p>  Of course, in the consideration of this, one of the issues concerns how one deals with circumstances where the family of a vulnerable adult feels that individual is being looked after satisfactorily and that there is no concern, yet there may be other concerns and one must consider how to deal with that.  Certainly, from 2013 onwards, the lady was in five-day residential care and then seven-day residential care.  She still visits her mother.  She comes out of residential care every second weekend and visits her mother.  We have been advised, right up to the current time, that the mother indicates that she does not place Ann in that home anymore.  She does visit.</p></speech>

We mentioned in the director general&rsquo;s opening statement that, following on a broadcast earlier in the year, a question arose.  The voluntary provider she was with, reflecting on this set of circumstances being aired at the time, looked back on the situation in the past and felt particular matters might be looked at.  It submitted them to the HSE and to HIQA.</p><p>We have carried out an investigation of that to be sure there was not anything, and as of today that report has just concluded.  We have not fully assessed it yet but the indication to us, as outlined in the director general's statement, is that there was nothing untoward in that.  The extra mile was gone to carry out an investigation and so on, just to be complete in all of that.  That covers the position up to date regarding Ann, and she is progressing very well at the service she is in now.</p><p> With regard to the funding side of it, as I mentioned, when one goes back on the records, one can see it was a feature of the child care services.  There are two years of records.  We were not able to identify the others.  However, clearly the family were being provided with the equivalent of foster care allowance up to the time that it stopped in 1995.  From that time on the State was providing support to the individual through what was DPMA and is now the disability allowance, and that continued.  That is the situation regarding the finances.</p></speech>

It is not that there is anybody missing.  We wanted it to be totally complete, and the job given to Resilience Ireland was to identify any individual who had had any contact whatever with the foster home concerned.  There were a number of people whose records are on file, but they may have been very limited records, and those individuals were not traceable.  They may have had contact through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the HSE.  They are just references on the file; they were identified and put in as part of the investigation, but we have not been able to trace them.  For completeness, and to ensure everyone was recorded who had been involved in any way with this foster home, in fairness to the investigators, they identified all of that.  They provided all of that information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, between the Garda and themselves, it was not possible to trace them.

The reports are available to the Garda and to the commission of investigation or inquiry, whatever the correct term is, when it is established.  The reports have a value, but clearly, if different decisions had been made way back in the 1990s, then this direction of travel would not have been necessary.  There is no doubt the Deputy is right in that respect.</p></speech>

At the heart of this, there is a real lack of accountability.  At the end of the day, we are discussing the lives of two people whom I have not met and do not know.  I am sure this is a very distressing time for their families, as I am sure it has been for many years and not just now.  Some of my colleagues know much more about this case than I do.  Considering some of what we have heard, I do not know want to know any more of the finer details of it.  All we are hearing today is that Mr. O'Brien can go and work on certain parts but he cannot go and work on other parts.</p> <p>  I spent four years as a youth worker before I became a Deputy.  We were always told that the basic rule in cases where we believed a young person was in danger of self-harm or being hurt was to report the matter up the line straightaway, not tomorrow.  It is the job of the manager to take action and if he or she does not do it, he or she is then held accountable.  I have a feeling the Health Service Executive has a different understanding of the word "accountable" from other organisations because all I am hearing today is that nobody has been held responsible for this yet.</p></speech>

What I am not going to do is give them a get out of jail free card by putting something into the public domain that everybody wants to read, that I have read and which is horrendous.  If I put it out in public, one thing is sure - nobody will get convicted, nobody will get disciplined.  Nobody has yet been disciplined or convicted.  However, if I put the reports in the public domain now, I guarantee that nobody will ever be.  I must hold the line on that; as uncomfortable as that is, that is my job.

They will be published.  As I understand it, the Government discussed today - but I do not know the outcome of the discussion - the setting up of the commission of inquiry or investigation that the two Ministers announced yesterday they would be recommending.  As a result of exercising their rights under section 40 by end of play today, my office will have provided the Ministers with the copies of the reports we are talking about.  They will be as hamstrung about their publication as I am.  The report by Mr. Conor Dignam SC will be available, I suspect, by the time of the next meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That will inform the proposals that will have to go to the Oireachtas for the establishment of the commission of inquiry.  If I get clearance to publish the reports, they will be published.  Disciplinary action, hearings and all of the normal process will follow as a result of that, provided I am not prevented in doing so in respect of any individual case by a pending criminal prosecution.  There are currently situations to do with things not quite as horrendous as this, but almost as bad, where we are holding off on disciplinary action, having placed people off work on protective leave, while matters are before the courts.  That is exactly the course of action that will be pursued once we are in a position to publish these reports.  Unfortunately that position does not yet exist.  If at any point I have authority to publish the report and I do not do so, then of course I will be accountable for not having done so.  I do not yet have that authority.</p></speech>

Equally, within the Department, we have a huge amount of correspondence on this issue at this stage.  The idea with the Mr. Conor Dignam SC review was that he would effectively quality assure the two reports that had been prepared in the south east.  Part of the concern at that time was that we wanted to get information and try to establish the facts relatively quickly.  In fact, a detailed submission was given to the Ministers at that time outlining the different options that would be available, including a commission of investigation.</p></speech>

The Chairman replied that we did given that we looked at the value-for-money issues surrounding the commissioning of reports, but it was probably a fair question.  In reality, when it comes right down to it, the Committee of Public Accounts probably should not be dealing with this; the Department should be.  Ms Spillane should have dealt with this.  We should not be dealing with this today.  There is a theory that if it had been dealt with better in the Department of Health, a commission of investigation probably would not have been announced.  That is a reasonable point.  The reason Mr. Conor Dignam SC was commissioned to conduct a desktop review was because we raised this in this committee.</p> <p>  When it comes to constituents who came to me, I had to fight for the most basic care for some of those who were involved and who were subjected to the most horrendous rape.</p><p>We did that through what we do on a daily basis within this committee.  I have to ask Ms Spillane a question.  The Department of Health is absolutely pivotal in this with regard to its oversight of an organisation that has failed, and failed miserably.  What was the Department doing while we were dealing with this matter?  We have had Ms Spillane's boss, the Secretary General, in here.  We discussed this and dealt with everything but, frankly, it led to nowhere.  Ultimately, it has led to a commission of investigation because the Department of Health did not deal with this matter.</p></speech>

We have been doing our best to respond to the concerns.  We have kept the Ministers fully briefed.  They have met a number of whistleblowers on this issue.  It is correct that the PAC hearings have drawn attention to the issue but certainly the intention in getting the independent review was to try to establish the facts because it is a difficult area when people have not read the reports, Ministers have not seen the two reports.  As yet, I have not seen the two reports.</p></speech>

That was the background to setting up the senior counsel review, that he would look at the approach and at the two reports, and that he would advise Ministers on the whole area of whether the reports could be published and, also, what should the next steps be.</p><p>In terms of that report now, the area of contributing to the terms of reference for a commission of inquiry or commission of investigation is going to be very important.  The Deputy will be aware that it can be quite difficult to come up with correct terms of reference for a commission of investigation.  In fact, we approached Mr. Dignam last week to see if he could expedite his review.  It is going to be completed now by the end of April.  We hope that will be very helpful to us in preparing detailed terms of reference, which of course have to be signed off and approved by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We are not, obviously.  We think the information that has been dispatched to us has been selective.  Is Ms Spillane happy that she and her Department have received the full information at every juncture?</p></speech>

We rely completely on the HSE all the time for information on operational matters, so we are constantly in contact with it.  For example, we would have been in contact with it for a briefing for Leaders' Questions on this issue.  It is very difficult to say categorically that I am absolutely satisfied that we got all of the information.  To the extent that we have a very good working relationship with the people in the disability unit in the HSE, they do send us prompt replies to queries all the time.</p></speech>

We are told publicly now that a panel will be set up.  I asked the clerk about this, and I do not think we ever received confirmation with regard to the finalisation of those recommendations.  Can Ms Spillane tell us if that has happened?</p></speech>

Under our statute - the 2013 statute - there are two committees which are independently chaired, an audit committee and a risk committee.  We have agreed that the chair of the review panel will be accountable to the risk committee - in other words, not accountable to the executive of the HSE at all.  They are currently finalising a person specification for that so that an open competition can follow for the appointment of the individual who will be chair of the panel.</p></speech>

If Mr. O'Brien discovered, hypothetically, that one of his officials was dangerous - complicit in something terrible - and if he had a really serious personal concern with regard to the safety of the individuals that person was in charge of within his organisation, would he feel the same way he does today?  Would he say that there was nothing he could do and that he would have to wait until the reports were published and the Garda investigation had concluded?  Would he wait?  Would he sit on it and say there was nothing he could do statutorily?  If he found that somebody was at serious risk of doing something terrible, what would Mr. O'Brien do?</p></speech>

In the &Aacute;ras Attracta case that investigation is ongoing, but it cannot be brought to conclusion until the criminal proceedings are concluded.</p></speech>

It goes back to Ann and those various engagements.  We have now found out that, for the reasons the members of the HSE deputation have stated, even though those engagements were ongoing from 2011 to 2013, the HSE did not inform the family of the sex abuse allegations.  What changed?  Why did the HSE formally demand in October 2013 when it had not done so previously?</p></speech>

A similar question was asked.  The team had been engaging locally under the senior manager.  The Devine report had been completed and implementation of the report had commenced.  There was some legal delay at the beginning but it was progressing at that stage.  There was a review by a senior manager of the situation and how things were progressing.  At that point, she decided to escalate the position and engage with the family directly.  She wrote to the foster family first.  She then engaged with the mother and the family.  There were conversations and so on and then she wrote to her at the end of the month.  By the end of October of that year matters were brought to a conclusion.</p> <p>  It is the challenging predicament of an adult living at home on weekends, as it was at that stage.  Every second weekend she was going home to mother and staying seven days a week.  How do we ensure it?  Up to today, we have confirmation that the mother is clear that she receives her daughter at home and does not place her in this location.  She may visit, but she does not place her there.  That is the most up-to-date information we have, as of today.</p></speech>

Please be brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-02-02a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016020200002#DDD00600"><p>I will be brief.  What we have heard today has been extremely disturbing.  The members of the HSE deputation have already admitted to mishandling and to erroneous and inaccurate information - indeed, misinformation - being provided.  We saw from the case of Ann that there was a gross and grave dereliction of duty in terms of the HSE's responsibility of care.  There is <i>prima facie</i>evidence of that, quite clearly.</p><p>At this point I am worried that there is no disciplinary procedure in place.  The abuse has been known about for a long period and there have been a number of investigations.  Now, we have to wait further before we are in a position to take any action, on the basis that any action would prejudice the existing investigations.  We come then to the question of the commission of investigation that is about to be set up.  That could take another couple of years.  We end up in a situation, at this point at 4.30 p.m. before the general election is called, whereby no protections are in place that we are aware of in respect of people in care.  The HSE representatives have indicated that they did not know what was happening to some of the people named in the reports who are still working in a care capacity.  The HSE is unsure whether they were dealing with vulnerable children either.</p><p>This is my point.  How many children are still under HSE care?  What number are we talking about?  Does the HSE deputation have any ideas, between now and when we are going to have some outturn from the various investigations, for putting in place any protocols to protect these people?  This is a clear dereliction.  There seems to be no line management where anyone is directly responsible despite <i>prima facie</i>evidence.</p><p>How can we rest tonight and be sure that all the children in the care of the HSE are protected if it has no internal mechanism for dealing with them, as it appears, and it is going to kick everything to touch until such time as the investigations are complete?</p></speech>

Children in care are the responsibility of Tusla, the child care agency, but there are children for whom we have a responsibility.  There was a time when the HSE had statutory authority for children.  Obviously, we had to discharge that legislation fully.  We are no longer the statutory authority.  However, we have a duty of care to children and we must fully comply with children legislation, including the Child Care Act.

We need to know whether the HSE is putting its own house in order so that, when there is <i>prima facie</i>evidence of vulnerable children being in danger, albeit not necessarily evidence that is raised in court, but involving whistleblowers and so on, it will take action without waiting for an investigation and show clearly that it is protecting the children who have been the subjects of the abuse that has been brought to its attention.</p></speech>

It is the first time in Ireland that this has been implemented.  It means there is now a policy both for children and adults.  There is a statutorily based one for children; the national safeguarding policy is not statutorily based but it is there and all service providers have been confirmed.  That is what the national summits have been about, namely, implementing that.  One of the good things that has come out of this very damaging and bad situation is this national policy for safeguarding adults.  It was one of the key recommendations of the Devine report and for the first time, that has been implemented.  That is a very good thing.</p></speech>

I presume the arrangement that is entered into could be classed as a legal agreement, or as an almost legal agreement, setting out how that money would be looked after.  As I said earlier on, even though that agreement was in place, she entered care in 2009 with no belongings, no money and no documentation.  She had nothing.  If one adds it up, one will find that approximately &euro;70,000 was paid in benefit to the foster mother.  If that arrangement was there for Grace, how many more people was it there for?  Regardless of whether it is a health board document or a Department of Social Protection document, there is a document that should have been signed by the foster parents, the foster home or the respite home.  Can Mr. Healy find out whether the HSE has those signed documents for the others?  Are they held by the Department of Social Protection?  It is important to follow that up.  Mr. Healy was very quick to give us the figures for two organisations funded by the HSE, but he could not give us the figures for the clients' payments when he was pursued on it.  I ask him to pursue that aspect of this issue with the Departments concerned in order that we can get to the end of the payment piece.  We have not got to the end of the payment piece here.</p></speech>

Go back.  Do not wander off on me again.  What is happening in regard to the care of Grace is that the organisation or agency had to care for Grace out of its own funds.  You presented a column of funding in order to point out to us that they were not penalised in any way for raising issues around the care of intellectually disabled people.  I understand that Mr. O'Brien is going to have a discussion with them and I know he will be fair about it.  I think when you look at the funding figures that you quoted in your opening statement, and factor in the work that had to be done and the care that had to be given, you will find that their funding actually decreased over the period.  I will not argue with you about the figures, but I am going to ask you to examine that table at some stage and be prepared to inform the next Committee of Public Accounts of the position.</p> <p>  I am just finished now.  With regard to the three people who made the decision to leave Grace there - we have covered this, but let us clarify it - I understand that you cannot comment at all about that, but that you have all of the information that led them to the decision that they made.  Is this correct?  You were able to give us the table of the funding and everything else and other parts of the report.</p></speech>

The table that is currently on the screen is not part of the report; it is something we prepared for the committee today.  The information that we are currently allowed to release was contained in the submission of 10 December which had the unfortunate cover note that had the effect of misleading the committee.  The report of Conal Devine and Associates has considerable detail, including interviews with the people involved, that describe the processes that led to that decision, but I cannot share that information with the committee at this stage.</p></speech>

You outlined those.  In all of your discussions here, as I said to you earlier on, there was a failure to outline the rights of the intellectually disabled person. The emphasis on one set of rights as against another is not balanced.  That is my view of what you have been saying.</p></speech>

I think we can agree that is the normal fare.  It is not unnatural, therefore, that the committee might perceive that that is how I see my function here today.  I do not see it that way.  I am not in any way seeking to defend what happened to any of the individuals who suffered harm or may have suffered harm as a result of failings in regard to this foster care centre.  My opening remarks were intended to convey that I believe that this is an egregious situation and that terrible things have happened.  In response to questions about the issue of the release of documents and so on, in seeking to explain that I have obviously had to focus on those issues.  That should not be to the exclusion of the fact that my rationale is that, ultimately, I need to preserve the potential for justice to be done - justice in the same of all of the citizens who have been disadvantaged as a result of these failings.  Sometimes I am put in a position of answering questions about a specific thing which may result in my seeming to be arguing certain things, but that is not the case.  The whole purpose of my statement was to be clear.  I was very clear, I think, on the radio on Sunday.  This is a terrible situation.  I have no agenda of seeking to defend what went wrong, but I do have an obligation to create the conditions in which justice can be served.  That is it.</p></speech>

Whoever is in the House after the election will have to pursue it.  I respect the position Mr. O'Brien is taking and, as I said, I encourage him to continue with speed down that road.  That brings me to the point made by Deputy McFadden.  I was asked a question about our remit on the radio and Deputy Deasy quoted me.</p><p>It started with the whole question of costs.  It is a &euro;13.5 billion fund of taxpayers' money that is given to the Health Service Executive, HSE, and in purchasing the services such as we are describing here or in the procurement process for that service, it is the duty of this committee to hold the HSE to account in terms of the spending of that taxpayers' money so I hold that we are well within the remit.  We have strayed into the care of individuals but that is only because dealing with this and with procurement and governance has led us here.  That is why we are here.  I am saying that, Deputy McFadden, because there need to be clarity around this.  There are those exotic creatures outside the House who might like to describe our work differently, but I believe we are doing it well within our remit.</p></speech>

That is all I will say.  It is a reasonable undertaking to assume that the HSE would undertake that in terms of any doubts it had because not to correct it or flag it is allowing for the same errors to be possible for the future, and we must break that culture.</p> <p>  Finally, since this happened, and I spoke to Ms Colley earlier on, I have received numerous phone calls from people who are currently attempting to sort out similar issues with the HSE, or with Tusla now, and some of the stories I have heard, which I am checking out and will present to the HSE or to the confidential recipient as soon as I clarify them, would not make one proud as a political figure that we preside over this type of thing in our State.  I am just making that general comment because of what I have heard, but I will check it out.</p> <p>  As an example, in my own constituency, in terms of a particular organisation funded by the HSE, I am disappointed at the level of consultation with the parents of 11 intellectually disabled children who have now found themselves out of their homes, and we speak about the homeless here a lot, and now being cared for in a hotel where the Health Information and Quality Authority Standards, HIQA, standards do not apply.  Regardless of how long or how short they will be there, it is simply not right that this would happen.  I will speak to Ms Colley privately about this but I am shocked at the way parents are being treated with regard to that particular issue and the provision of respite for those parents who need it.  The resolution there is not being found in the way Mr. O'Brien has described it today in terms of finding the resolution, dealing with it, and the most vulnerable people being catered for.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming today.  I know it has been a long meeting but I appreciate their attendance and, at times, their frankness in terms of the replies they gave.</p></speech>

There were five files.  He did not proceed.  Obviously, she is also aware that many of the people involved in this are non-verbal and the likelihood of them testifying was always very slim, and that one of the alleged perpetrators is dead.  The issue, and it was raised by the whistleblower on television last night, is that the Department has professional sanctions for, say, care workers but when it comes to a certain level within the health services, there are very few sanctions.</p><p>One of the concerns is that the Acts cover the period 2006 onwards, such that if it was the case that reckless endangerment or professional negligence was involved, the Acts would not cover the period prior to that.  Is Ms Spillane concerned that in the area of foster care, when it comes to the management and administration of it, the regulation is not sufficient to provide the kinds of protection that vulnerable children need in this country?  Surely, one of the lessons we have got to learn from this is that people can make decisions, frankly, not care, go about their business and that there be no accountability.  Is it, after all of this, a concern within the Department that that has occurred in the way it has and are there plans to change that?</p></speech>

There have been foster care regulations since 1996, as far as I know, as part of the modernisation of our child protection services and the investment that has been made over the years, including the setting up of a separate child care agency.  I would have to check out the point the Deputy made about fitness to practise and whether the legislation applies to the period before the legislation was commenced.  I would also have to confer with colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in regard to revisions of the foster care regulations.  As I worked in that area at one time I do know that it includes a lot of safeguards like visits by social workers to the homes on a regular basis.</p></speech>

We have a very high proportion of our children in care in foster care which is regarded, in terms of the quality of care for children, as being preferable to having them in residential centres.</p></speech>

This part of the meeting is concluded.</p> <p>  In conclusion of the Committee of Public Accounts for this D&aacute;il term, I thank all those witnesses that appeared before us.  I also thank the secretariat, back-up services and all members of the committee, including those currently serving and those who have been members during the course of the past five years.  It has been an experience, one, where like today, we have often had to drag the facts and, in this case, the terrible abuse, out from behind closed doors that are well guarded and place them before the public in the hope that the various Departments that are responsible in this State take account of what has been done and take the appropriate action to ensure that the likes of what we have just heard and, indeed, what we have heard in the last five years does not happen again.</p> <p>  Regrettably, in terms of the Committee of Public Accounts' work, when one hears the description "inquiry into accounts of a State body" it immediately rings alarm bells.  In the particular case that we heard today the bells rang true.  We saw how it is often the insiders that carry out the reports and sometimes, in fact a lot of the time, that is not satisfactory.  </p> <p>  To the whistleblowers that have come before us or that have contacted the committee, I want to put on record that I believe they have been very brave individuals.  We were cautioned a lot about receiving evidence from Sergeant Maurice McCabe and look at the service that he did for the State.  I think that the whistleblowers in this case are to be commended.  Every effort should be made to protect the organisations that support the social workers and that ensure that the whistleblowers in turn are supported and protected.</p> <p>  One other issue that has crossed our desk is that often the last spin of the dice is when an agency of the State refers the issue in hand to the Garda and then the investigation is brushed into a cul-de-sac and does not go any further.  That is something that is, perhaps, done to buy time or, perhaps, to create an escape for those  involved.</p><p>This is something the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda should talk about to determine whether legislation is required to deal with the kind of instrument that might provide people with the get out of jail card they are seeking.  </p><p> Reading the whistleblower legislation, one could be sucked in by it but it has been proven it now needs to be strengthened.  More often than not, the whistleblower ends up as the person in the iron mask, silenced, in an office with no work.  We have examples of this across various areas.  The failed culture that allows this to happen needs to be rooted out.  If it is not, this will continue.  </p><p> I sat on this committee previously and have had the honour of chairing it for the past five years and I hope that, as we face into an election, those who are elected will have the bravery and courage to take on the job the electorate gives them and ensure, through legislation and their work on the committees of this House, they bring justice to those who deserve it, strike out to make a difference and bring about the reforms so necessary to ensure this State functions better.  The divide that is emerging between the State and its people must be closed and we must have better representation.  </p><p> This committee has done a fine job over the past five years and I commend committee members and staff on the work they have undertaken.  I should also thank the members of the media.  We will adjourn now and someone else will take up the baton after the election.  Thank you.</p></speech>
