    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112200002#A00500"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc Mac Sharry.</p> <p>  Today the committee will continue its examination of Special Report No. 94 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the National Asset Management Agency, or NAMA as it is better known, and its sale of Project Eagle, the code name given to the sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  To date, we have met the Comptroller and Auditor General; representatives of NAMA, including members of the board at the time; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials; Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, or the NIAC as it is known; the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and representatives of the Chief Operating Office of Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that purchased Project Eagle.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Patrick Long, managing director, Lazard and Company Limited.  I thank him for travelling to Dublin to assist the committee in its examination of NAMA's sale of Project Eagle.  Lazard is a financial advisory and asset management firm that engages in investment banking, asset management and other financial services.  It has offices in New York, Paris and London.  Its role in the Project Eagle sale was as loan sale adviser to NAMA.  We invited its representatives to appear before the committee to discuss the details of services it was contracted to provide for NAMA; its knowledge of and input into the sale process and its design and implementation; its understanding of the circumstances of PIMCO's withdrawal from the process and its letter of assurance to NAMA following completion of the sale.</p><p>We are also joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and, from his office, Mr. John Riordan, deputy director of audit.<br/><br/>I remind members, the witness and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off completely.  I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to the committee.  If he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or of the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>We do not have a formal opening statement from Mr. Patrick Long, but he will make some opening comments and observations.  Thereafter, our lead speaker will be Deputy Connolly, who will be followed by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I propose that the first speaker will have 20 minutes, the second questioner will have 15 minutes and each speaker after that will have ten minutes.  I will keep to that timetable.  If people want to contribute a second time, they will get the opportunity to do so.  I would like members to be focused on today's issue.  I ask Mr. Long to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

By way of background, my name is Patrick Long.  I am a managing director at Lazard.  I am based in London.

I will just ask a few questions.  I will try to make a few statements and ask questions because we really just want to elicit information.  I know Mr. Long will be co-operative.

It is 25 or 26 pages long.  It is the longest chapter in the report.  It raises concerns in respect of the sale process.  Those concerns are clearly outlined and Mr. Long has read them.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised all of these concerns.  If Mr. Long accepts them, that is okay; if he does not, I ask him to tell me which ones he does not accept.</p></speech>

As such, I would say that the transaction was successful.  Furthermore, in my view, the sale price achieved was the highest available in the market at the time.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General believes that a different sale process would have resulted in a higher price, he is obviously entitled to that opinion.  I believe that the sale process was appropriate in the circumstances.</p></speech>

One of the Comptroller and Auditor General's concerns is that the process was not as competitive as it might have been.  My response is to point out that competition is not simply a function of the number of parties involved in a process.  It is to do with the motivation of those parties.  Even though there were fewer participants in the Project Eagle sale process than in some other NAMA sale processes, there was real competitive tension throughout.  It was that competitive tension, in my view, that motivated the bidders and which resulted in Cerberus being willing to pay a price for the portfolio in excess of NAMA's reserve price.</p></speech>

However, our advice would be not to include them in the process on the grounds that we already have sufficient competition [nothing to do with criteria, money or ability to buy] and including them would undermine our assertion to the existing participants that the process is restricted to a &quot;handful&quot; of parties. </blockquote> <p>There is no mention of criteria.</p></speech>

There is no mention of criteria or ability to buy.  Lazard has given an assurance that it is going to be limited.  In fact, at some other stage, there is a reference to &quot;priority&quot;, which I have underlined.  If we look at firm F on the same page:</p><blockquote>Lazard separately emailed ... setting out its conversation with another firm that was refused entry ... [I told him] it was closed to new entrants [on 27 February].</blockquote> <p>Frustration is expressed by the potential bidder &quot;given their track record ... and their relationship with ... NAMA&quot;.  The email continues: </p><blockquote>I didn&rsquo;t say this to him but I recall discussing [Firm F] with you ... at the outset {This is Mr. Long's firm} but concluding that there were other firms who deserved priority.  He said he would call his contacts at NAMA to express his unhappiness.</blockquote> <p>Limited time has been set by NAMA and Lazard is following that.  There are limited restrictions and limited bidders.  Lazard has set it out clearly.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, "competition" is not about the number of participants.  It is about having the right participants in the process and ensuring that they are highly motivated.  Ultimately, the portfolio is only sold once and that to the highest bidder.  I really do not think that it would have helped NAMA if we had received a lot of other bids well below the reserve price.  That would have added nothing to the process.  As the Deputy pointed out, the table in section 4.4.2 highlights clearly that the parties that were included in the process, that is, that were invited to participate in the process, accounted for the vast majority, almost the totality, of loan portfolio sales-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112200002#D04800"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The witness sees how tight the time is, so I would appreciate if his answers could be quite short as well as to the point.  I think NAMA was described as the biggest property entity in the world at one point, so big firms would have been aware of it and NAMA would have been aware of the very big firms that are likely to buy the big portfolios.  That would be true.  Between 2013 and 2015, there were just four firms that acted for the bulk - nearly 90% - of sales, or purchases, with a par value of more than &euro;1 billion, yet none of those four firms featured in the first list for Lazard.  Why would that be the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Long" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112200002#D04900"><p>We made a judgment at the time to approach three other firms first, none of which was in that top four at the time, but we were trying to identify firms that we thought would be best qualified and most interested in acquiring this portfolio.  Once the firms that we approached initially declined to participate in the process, then we approached other firms.  Just to recap, apart from the approach from PIMCO, of those in the first batch, as Deputy Connolly mentioned earlier, Oaktree was one of those three.  Oaktree did engage in the process for several weeks and, for a large part of the process, appeared to be working on this transaction very intensively.  Blackstone and Starwood Capital may have withdrawn from that first batch, but Oaktree, at any rate, was seriously interested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112200002#D05000"><p>These were firms that were capable.  These four firms would have had the capacity because they have demonstrated capacity.  Why not contact as many as possible that had the capacity?  Why do one group and then go to the next group to see what was the interest?  There was a difficulty anyway with the process in that it was going to be a single process rather a two-stage process that would be open and in which there would be interest from all comers that would then be narrowed down, which would be normal and, perhaps, best practice.  Would that be the kind of practice that Lazard would advise in the normal course of events, that is, that it would be a two-stage process?  That is normally what happens, and it appears to be best practice.</p></speech>

We widened the field.  We wanted to make the parties we approached feel as motivated as possible to invest the time and resources necessary to acquire a portfolio of this complexity.</p><p> The Deputy's second question was on one round versus two rounds.  It is typical for processes relating to the sale of loan portfolios to have two rounds.  In this case, NAMA felt it was appropriate to have a single round process and to have a shorter timeframe than might have been usual.  My sense as to why that was NAMA's preference was that it did not want to lose the offer it had from PIMCO.  When PIMCO showed up and indicated a valuation range for the portfolio - I beg your pardon; I am talking too much-----</p></speech>

When PIMCO withdrew, did Mr. Long advise NAMA that the breakneck speed might not be a good idea and that it might be better to go back to the drawing board, given that it had lost the certainty?</p></speech>

We advised NAMA that we felt there was sufficient competitive tension left, that Fortress and Cerberus were sufficiently engaged in the process that we were confident NAMA could achieve its objective of selling the portfolio in its entirety in excess of the reserve price, which is what happened.  For some parties a compressed timetable was difficult while for others it was attractive.  I could quote from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

That was it, and that is what we told Fortress and Cerberus.  As it happens, it was wrong, although we were not aware of it at the time.  As I said earlier, it was consistent with the reasons for which other participants had left the process.</p></speech>

Particular groups were dropping out and others were being added.  It was rushed.  In its letter, Fortress, and others, told us:</p><blockquote>Considerations taken into account by Fortress included the quality and completeness of the diligence information made available to Fortress; that the portfolio constituted a large exposure in a very small, concentrated region: and that the bid process required an unconditional bid which could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid.</blockquote> <p>Fortress was telling us there were constraints.  Others complained about the fact that they were not allowed to use local information regarding valuing.  Looking at it from the outside, it seems almost every possible obstacle was put in the way in order to eliminate entities from the bid.  Was this dictated by NAMA?  Did Mr. Long discuss it with NAMA?  What approach did he take?</p></speech>

NAMA was concerned about confidentiality and the closeness of the relationship between values in Northern Ireland and the debtors associated with the portfolio.  NAMA also stipulated a requirement for bidders to have the resources internally to buy the portfolio without recourse to syndication.  The rationale was to reduce the execution risk associated with involving third-party finance providers.  While there were limitations, there was a rationale for them.</p></speech>

His expertise was to advise, in most cases, although he had much more limited criteria set out for him regarding the bid.  If he had been setting out the process and wanted to get the greatest competitive tension into the process, would he have put the same range of constraints in place?</p></speech>

The fact that PIMCO had made an approach for the portfolio, which NAMA viewed as attractive, was a very relevant factor.  NAMA wanted to run a marketing process.  It had to, and it wanted to, and that was what we were brought in to do.  At the same time, NAMA was not aware that the portfolio could be sold in its entirety until PIMCO came along and made the offer it made.  While NAMA wanted to run a marketing process, and we did, it did not want a consequence of the marketing process to be that it lost the PIMCO offer.</p></speech>

Cerberus and any other company bidding would have been conscious of the constraints.  They would have known it would have limited the competition for them.

Ultimately, the process was successful.  The fact that certain parties did not meet NAMA's criteria and, as such, were not included in the process, is not especially relevant in light of the outcome.  As I said earlier, we were trying to ensure the leading bidders were as motivated as possible.  The leading bidders accepted the way the process worked, hence the outcome.</p></speech>

It seems to have been closed only for some.  It was reopened for Fortress and Goldman Sachs after others had been told it was closed.  It is hardly good business practice to have different criteria for different groups of people.  Why was it the case?  Who decided it?  Did NAMA dictate it or did Mr. Long suggest it?</p></speech>

Fortress and Goldman Sachs met NAMA's criteria and others did not.  We were exercising our professional judgment as to which parties would have been additive to the process and which parties would not have been.  As I said earlier, having many extra participants who could not have got to the price or who did not have a real interest in acquiring the entire portfolio would not have been helpful.</p></speech>

In other words, I would need to check whether firm E was told the process was closed before we admitted Fortress and Goldman Sachs to the process or afterwards.</p> <p>  The thing about firm E, and I can remember exactly who it was but I shall not name them now, is that we did not believe - I did not believe then and I do not believe now - that they met NAMA's criteria in the sense that they did not have the resources or the expertise to acquire this portfolio.  It was more tactful to say to them at the time that the process was closed than to get into a lengthy argument with them about whether they had the capacity to buy this portfolio.</p></speech>

I did not want to - I did not feel as if firm E was qualified to acquire this entire portfolio.  I think that now, re-examining my assessment now, I am sure of my ground.  Rather than saying to them, "we don't think you are qualified to buy this portfolio" it was more tactful to say to them, "the process is closed" and to leave it at that.</p></speech>

I guess I would be in danger of straying into the realms of the hypothetical.  What I would say is that the process, as the Deputy pointed out earlier, evolved over time.  The timetable was lengthened.  We included slightly more participants in the process than NAMA originally intended.  Perhaps if I could go back in time we would have started with a slightly longer timeframe and slightly wider participation.  We would have started in effect where we ended up.  Beyond that I would not like to conjecture any further.</p></speech>

I do not believe that NAMA gave preferential treatment to PIMCO.  There was no bias in favour of PIMCO except in so far as PIMCO had made what NAMA viewed as an attractive offer for a portfolio that NAMA found difficult to manage and which they thought it would be difficult to sell.  So, in that sense, I think I understand their rationale for not wanting to lose PIMCO.  The fact that there were only two bids at the end of the process is partly at least a reflection of the fact that this was not a very attractive portfolio in a difficult jurisdiction.</p></speech>

There were actually several other examples of the same thing happening within this process.  For example, two of PIMCO's other advisers, namely Cushman and Wakefield and New River Retail, also found new clients following PIMCO's withdrawal.  So Cushman and Wakefield ended up working with Fortress and New River Retail ended up working with Cerberus.  That is actually relatively commonplace.</p></speech>

The paper presented to the Board for that meeting noted... &quot;...in line with our Board policy... will only be recommending the sale subject to an open marketing process&quot;.</blockquote> <p>That was in October 2013 and the board was very clear it had to be an open marketing process.

Instead, it sought guidance from the Board as to how to respond to PIMCO&rsquo;s continuing request that it be granted exclusivity.</blockquote> <p>An objective reading of that, from what I can see, is that in October it was very clear it had to be an open marketing process but there was continuing pressure coming from PIMCO for a closed or no formal open marketing campaign.  Paragraph 4.7 indicates it did not recommend an open market process.  Is it fair to say that maybe NAMA met PIMCO halfway?</p></speech>

In October 2013, it was clear it had to be an open marketing process but in December it did not recommend an open marketing process.  There is talk about continuing requests from PIMCO.

The reading of the report suggests there were certainly discussions - perhaps robust discussions - at board level as to what type of marketing process and loan sales strategy there should be because of the approach or maybe pressure from PIMCO.  It mentions continuing requests from PIMCO.  It was not just one request for a closed process and there were obviously repeated requests.</p></speech>

First, if they were not approached by Lazard and they approached it, the reason Lazard did not approach them is that it did not think that they had the same level of cash-----</p></speech>

Fortress is a highly reputable, internationally recognised investment firm and Cerberus was genuinely concerned in my view about the competitive threat which it posed.  The fact that Fortress at the end of the day found it difficult to cope with the requirement of the process that it should make a cash bid for the portfolio in my view does not undermine the competitive threat which it posed to Cerberus because until the bid deadline Cerberus did not know what Fortress would bid.  In fact, as far as I am aware, right until the transaction closed Cerberus did not know the level at which Fortress had in fact bid.  There could have been a competitive threat, if Fortress did pose a competitive threat to Cerberus, even though it ultimately ended up-----</p></speech>

I have limited time and I have a number of other questions.  Mr. Long was asked earlier by Teachta Catherine Murphy about the rationale for limitations in terms of the loan sale strategy, and he said that was a good question, the fact that PIMCO made an approach made that a very relevant factor in regard to the board's position on that, that the board wanted to have a marketing process.  It had a marketing process, but while it wanted to have one it did not want a consequence of that to be that it would ultimately lose PIMCO.  Does that not reaffirm what I was said earlier, that it was certainly influenced heavily by PIMCO's involvement and wanted to keep it in the game, that perhaps it did meet PIMCO half way and that there potentially was an inherent bias towards PIMCO?</p></speech>

It made an offer which NAMA viewed as attractive and, rightly in my view, NAMA decided to appoint a loan sale adviser to undertake a marketing process to see if that price could be bettered, and, indeed, it was bettered.  Cerberus paid a price in excess of the reserve price.  If the Deputy recalls, PIMCO did not actually bid &pound;1.3 billion for this portfolio, it indicated a range of &pound;1.1 billion to &pound;1.3 billion, so at the end of the day NAMA achieved a sale price in excess of the top end of the range-----</p></speech>

That suggests there was potentially a bias towards PIMCO.  That it would have been cheaper for it.  The whole language seems to suggest that there was a bias towards PIMCO.</p></speech>

Mr. Long will have seen from letters from PIMCO and from correspondence to this committee, and this is also contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, that there was an association with Mr. Cushnahan and debtors and that he was working with Brown Rudnick and Tughans who were also working with PIMCO.

We did for project Octopus but we did not for project Isobel.  On project Isobel, as for project Eagle, the seller wanted the process to be confidential for as long as possible and did not want investors, or anyone, frankly, to know about the process until we were ready to approach investors.

Mr. Long was verbally briefed.  According to the Comptroller an Auditor General&rsquo;s report, he does not have a valuation role in respect of the portfolio, he advises on marketing but only in a very circumscribed way because the board had taken a position on the transaction.

I believe we were aware that the meeting happened.

I am saying it was not particularly attractive and many of the investors who reviewed this opportunity or had the opportunity to bid for the portfolio concluded that there were other portfolios coming to the market that they wanted to focus on instead.</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald started to refer to aspects of the political sensitivities as well.  Will Mr. Long expand on that constant reference to the unique characteristics?  Again, it is not just Mr. Long who has mentioned it.  Senior NAMA officials who have appeared before the committee also mentioned it.  It appears to be a get out of jail card.  Everybody continues to refer to this as a unique project, as if it allows one somehow to cover over any other aspect to it.  Will Mr. Long expand on that, please?</p></speech>

I think it is really a response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in the sense that there is a presumption in that report that the sale process for Project Eagle should have been the same as the sale processes for projects Tower and Arrow, for example.  The point I have tried to make today is that this is not necessarily the case.  The circumstances and background to Project Eagle required a different approach.</p></speech>

My sense is that prior to that approach it probably did not expect to be able to sell this portfolio in its entirety.  It had an offer which it viewed as attractive but, at the same time, it wished to run a sale process to see whether that offer could be exceeded.  That is one of the-----</p></speech>

To explore those unique elements, the Northern Ireland Executive Minister, Mr. Sammy Wilson, appeared to like the prospect of an exclusive deal with PIMCO.  Obviously, that did not come to pass.  The deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, who appeared before the committee last week, spoke about his exclusion from conversations with the First Minister and the Minister of Finance in the North in respect of this and Cerberus.

We are all beginning to know a lot more about Lazard as a global estate agent.  In replies to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald and others Mr. Long said credibility, honesty, etc. were the benchmarks and DNA on which Lazard traded.  I do not want to misquote him and will check the minutes of the meeting, but he seemed to say one measured success by a successful outcome.  I find that to be one of the most extraordinary comments I have heard since we started this process.  That is because it is not the case.  The process has to be correct and have integrity.  That is what we are checking.  We are checking to see whether the taxpayer lost money because of the report and whether the process was correct.  Did it, at all times, adhere to the rules of engagement?  To say one measures success by the outcome is absolutely extraordinary.</p></speech>

I did not mean to say the ends justified the means.  I was trying to get across the fact that, notwithstanding that there were challenges along the way in respect of PIMCO's fee arrangements and the circumstances of its withdrawal and that the sale process had some unusual features, the process had been successful and the outcome had been successful.  We ran a very fair process.  One of the concerns of the investors we had approached and invited to participate was whether PIMCO had an unfair advantage by virtue of its prior involvement.  We did our best to ensure PIMCO would not have such an unfair advantage.  Another Deputy touched on the prior work-----</p></speech>

Mr. Long's reply is extremely worrying.  His use of the word "such" in talking about a competitive advantage is also extremely worrying.  I presume he is very surprised to be here.  There is a multi-jurisdictional investigation into these sales and he is in front of the Committee of Public Accounts in the Republic of Ireland.

I am anxious to know if this was one of the handiest gigs Lazard ever got as regards workload.  How sizeable was the workload relating to this matter?  It was a very quick process - let us be honest - compared to other examples.  This was a very, very quick process.  How large was the workload in terms of the volume of people and the number of man hours involved?  All consultancy of this sort, which I note was based on a success fee, has to be calculated in terms of all this internally.  How much work was involved, particularly as &euro;4.3 million is a hell of a payment for such a short period?  Lazard must have been working all the hours God gave.</p></speech>

That is all.  It is a fact that this happened.  It is a fact that Mr. Long's organisation, for whatever reason critical to this process, was not told about it.  In other words, in respect of his final conclusions as regards the sales and marketing strategy - an area in respect of which his organisation is a massive player worldwide - Lazard was not told about these payments, yet is standing over what it did.  Would it have changed anything at all?  Mr. Long has already cited to multiple Deputies that it was unusual.  Would it have changed anything in respect of the quality and the authenticity of the work Lazard carried out in any percentage at all?</p></speech>

I think there are two reasons.  The first is that these firms really dominate or dominated this type of investment at the time, as the other table in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report makes clear.  The second is that while these firms are American firms, headquartered in America, but, as I mentioned earlier, with a significant presence in London, the capital which they manage comes from around the world.  So the investors in the funds which these groups manage would be from all over the world and would not be confined to America.</p></speech>

NAMA will explain why it was so restrictive.</p> <p>  Page 83 of the report refers to the Lazard letter as stating, "the sell-side process for the transaction was appropriate for the sale of a loan portfolio of this nature".

In fairness, that must be said because Mr. Long is assisting.  Given those levels of restrictions that NAMA put on the process before Lazard arrived on the scene, was it fair to Lazard that it had to operate on a no foal, no fee basis, as we would describe it here.  I can understand if a person was going to sell a product, loans or assets he or she would take the risk if it did not sell, but Lazard was going into a process that had been so constrained before the start that it was difficult for it to enter that.  Did the Mr. Long have an issue with that?</p></speech>

It is the summary of the bids received from Fortress and Cerberus.  I refer again to the restrictions that NAMA placed on the bid before it got near Lazard.  Page 152 of the report shows the prices and the fact Fortress did not meet the reserve price.  On the same page, under the heading of financing, it shows that Fortress was not specific with regard to not having to obtain syndicate financing.  At the bottom of the page it refers to conditionality and it states: "Fortress have refused to allocate their bid on an asset-by-asset basis ...".  Therefore, Fortress did not meet the big conditions on the three key requirements of not reaching the reserve price, not satisfying the information required on the source of financing and in not giving a breakdown by assets.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is particularly significantly that Fortress did not allocate its bid on an asset by asset basis.  To me the most important difference between the Fortress and Cerberus bids was the price.  Clearly, there is a big difference.</p></speech>

That is what it chose to do; the logical thing to do.  Had it said to us that it could not get to the reserve price but was still interested in acquiring this portfolio then we would have asked it, inevitably, what price it could get to.</p></speech>

The process was competitive in that sense.  Ultimately, we only needed one compliant bid because we only needed a single counter party to buy the portfolio.</p></speech>

On many transactions there are, at various stages, meetings between the principals that the advisers do not attend.  I do not believe that any of the Cerberus advisers attended and it was natural that NAMA's advisers could not have attended either.</p></speech>

It is very strange that the person running the bidding process was not there.  Other sales are not quite the same as selling State assets.  These are State assets being sold by the Irish State and any loss will be carried by the Irish public.  Similarly, on the other side, there are procurement rules.  It would be extraordinary if a company was submitting a bid for procuring a State contract - for a private sector company to build a motorway, for example - and the night before the company submits its bid the most senior people in that company met with the Minister for Finance and the head of the procurement agency.  It would render the process fatally flawed if that meeting happened within 24 hours of a bid if the State was buying an asset.  It seems to have been okay for that to happen when the State was selling an asset.  I find that very strange.  Is Mr. Long in a position to comment on that?  We will also put this question to other people.  Does Mr. Long get the parallel I am drawing?</p></speech>

My response would be to a point the Chairman made a moment ago.  It is highly unlikely that Cerberus learnt anything at that meeting which influenced the level of its bid.  It is my understanding that the meeting was rather designed to impress on NAMA Cerberus's seriousness of intent and commitment to the transaction.  I do not believe it was about the price, it was about trying to present Cerberus as a reliable counter party for NAMA.</p></speech>

I watched some of the testimony from Cerberus before the committee last week and my understanding of the reason that the Cerberus representative gave for not having notified Lazard and NAMA of Brown Rudnick's appointment was that Cerberus did not in fact share confidential information with Brown Rudnick.</p></speech>

In fact, when I looked at the meetings of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, they spoke about performing loans and returns on loans.

The NAMA board held a normal scheduled meeting.  What was recorded was that Lazard was to be appointed and simultaneously PIMCO was to continue on with NAMA's permission to examine the portfolio in parallel with NAMA going out to Lazard.  The final sentence stated that this was as much to give protection to PIMCO about the integrity of the process.  Mr. Long should tell me if I am wrong.  From that and from what Mr. Long has said today, I am presuming that NAMA never wanted to lose PIMCO.  I am making a statement it was set up to give an illusion that there was competitive tension, that even before Lazard got into gear, NAMA was continuing with its investigation and that when Lazard came in, it was allowed to have two or three bidders to protect PIMCO.  Does Mr. Long agree with that statement?</p></speech>

Even when he wrote this report, he was not aware that PIMCO was in it.  It has come out that PIMCO was in it even further back, was in the data room and had a competitive advantage.

The closing price was a &pound;1.24 billion deal.  We have been made aware at this stage that first, the data room was managed by the client which was a major organ of the Irish State in one respect and backed by the taxpayer.  Second, a verbal briefing was given at an initial meeting between Lazard and NAMA of which we have no detailed record to revert to now to assess what conversations were held in terms of the objectives of the sale.  We also know there was no advice in terms of strategy, timing and value of the portfolio.  We also know that there was a very tight timeframe in which to execute the sale.  In terms of Mr. Long's professional approach as an adviser, would he consider that a prudent approach?</p></speech>

I said there was no advice in terms of strategy.  We were told very clearly that Lazard did not invite in terms of the strategy - in terms of when to sell and whether a group of assets should be sold piecemeal or together.  There was no advice on that.  Second, there was no advice in terms of timing - when to sell.  Lazard was given that instruction.  Third, there was no evaluation.  I am very clear on those three points.  I will ask the question again.  Does Mr. Long think that is a prudent approach?</p></speech>

It was not Lazard's place to challenge NAMA's decision to sell the portfolio in its entirety and launch a sales process immediately.</p></speech>

In terms of Lazard getting the best value for its client, as a professional adviser, should Lazard not have asked its client at that juncture whether it had carried out a risk assessment of curtailing the sale in all these different avenues?  Does Mr. Long not think this would have been prudent?</p></speech>

That is open to speculation and is what we must assess.  At a basic level, it concerns me that in respect of the process surrounding this and the limitations placed upon Lazard's engagement that Lazard was reluctant to say it should advise a client to assess what risk was there and that as advisers on competitive tension and trying to maximise the best value, ask the client about whether it had looked at everything in terms of having such a narrow focus on executing this sale.</p></speech>

There were not that many people out there who wanted to buy the entirety of NAMA's Northern Ireland debtor portfolio in a single transaction.  Fortunately, there were several parties who were sufficiently interested in the transaction to take part in the process and the process achieved a successful sale.</p></speech>

Paragraph 4.44 states:</p><blockquote>In response to a series of questions put to them by NAMA, Lazard stated to NAMA on 31 March 2016 that<br /><br />- Apart from the nine global investors who participated in the process, there is no evidence that any other investor existed at the time [...] who was as credible and as well qualified such that it appeared that they were in a position to pay a higher prices to NAMA than that secured from Cerberus.</blockquote><p>I have read the paragraph a few times as it is quite astonishing.  Earlier Deputy Kelly said that the end justified the means but to me the end is inherent in the means.  Mr. Long has equated here that "credible and qualified" with meaning the highest price.  In a competitive bidding process it is irrelevant what other criteria a bidder had as long as he or she had the highest price.</p><p> I touched on self-interest earlier.  It was my last question and I did not get to ask Mr. Long anything else.  There is a self-interest from Lazard's perspective and I am not saying that it was necessarily Mr. Long's fault.  Earlier he alluded to the fact that it is common practice to have success fees for these types of agencies.</p></speech>

There is a helpful table in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report which compares the number of participants in Projects Tower, Arrow and Eagle and it shows that even though Projects Arrow and Tower started with a figure of &pound;4.12 billion and a higher degree of participation they ended up with the same number of binding offers as Project Eagle and that is what matters.  That illustrates the point I tried to make earlier, that having many participants in and of itself does not necessarily maximise competitive attention.

He had represented many of those involved in the process.  Someone putting together a bid will include the costs, for example, if &euro;15 million is paid for advice that will be included in the cost of the bid.</p><p>In its statement to us last week Cerberus said:</p><blockquote>Ultimately, Cerberus agreed to the fee on the basis that the services offered were expected to be particularly useful in the circumstances and, when looked at as a percentage of the reserve price, it was approximately 1.1% which we viewed as within a customary advisory fee range. Brown Rudnick also told Cerberus that if Cerberus did not wish to enter into this arrangement, it would offer its services to another bidder.</blockquote> <p>Given that the real estate sector in Northern Ireland would be quite small and people would know each other, that is quite a threatening statement.  Cerberus had no choice but to take on Brown Rudnick and Tughans, and Cushnahan went with that.  Is that how Mr. Long would see it or would he accept that?</p></speech>

On that note, we were aware and took comfort from the fact that, without knowing the precise circumstances of PIMCO's withdrawal and the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan, in so far as Cerberus was concerned, when we heard via NAMA of the arrangements that Cerberus had entered into or was proposing to enter into with Brown Rudnick and Tughans, that NAMA had sought and received undertakings from Cerberus confirming its compliance with FCPA and the bribery Act and that no fee was - I forget exactly what the formulation was - payable to anyone connected with NAMA.

There is also a lot of angst in respect of reputational damage to NAMA.  I put it to Mr. Long as the representative of Lazard that reputational damage accrues to himself also.  With the greatest of respect to Mr. Long far from demonstrating insight and judgment, whatever we might think of performance because Lazard got the deal over the line, Lazard appears to have spectacularly lacked insight.  It was kept in the dark and therefore its judgments were compromised.  I think Mr. Long has as much as accepted that but astonishingly he sits at this Oireachtas committee, which is not a cosy chat in a coffee shop, and for whatever reason he is not placing on the record any concern with the behaviour of NAMA in this scenario.  NAMA kept Lazard in the dark.  I am not sure if Mr. Long has ever heard the word "eejit", which is an Irish term.  NAMA made an eejit of Mr. Long.  I am guessing that given his name Mr. Long has some Irish connections.</p></speech>

Lazard secured this gig with no tender, which was strange.  Lazard received a verbal briefing from Ronnie Hanna in which it was told about political sensitivities and so on.  It had no role in valuation.  It did not control the data room: that fell to NAMA.  The whole process then became very complicated and compromised to the extent that there was legal concerns around the key bidder, about which Lazard is not informed, and that bidder exits.  I put it to Mr. Long that all of this represents a very bad day out for the reputation of Lazard.  I think it was kept in the dark and that it was aware that it was kept in the dark yet that does not seem to be a matter of angst or concern to Mr. Long or maybe it is the case that he is not prepared to put anything critical on the record here, which I find astonishing.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Long to pull up paragraph 4.17 of the report on his screen.  In regard to the arrangement between Lazard and NAMA and the confidentiality which Mr. Long has referenced several times, it states that potential bidders were to be prohibited from contacting the debtors.  In other words, there was to be a Chinese wall in terms of debtor information.  We now know, and Mr. Long knows, that that condition was breached and compromised and was untenable from the get-go because Frank Cushnahan had an advisory relationship with those debtors accounting for 50% of the portfolio and because Frank Cushnahan, Brown Rudnick and Tughans had, it seems, contrived this approach around debtors and had themselves made the approach to PIMCO.  That debtor information that was put together - the witness from Cerberus was quite helpful in setting out that it was abstract in terms of each of the loans, business plans and so on - was in the form of a portfolio of information.  When PIMCO exits Brown Rudnick then bequeaths that to Cerberus, which was the successful bidder.  As the loan adviser and an organisation which we established earlier stakes its reputation on insight, judgment, transparency and other corporate virtues Lazard failed in that regard.  If I were sitting in Mr. Long's seat I would not be quite as gentle as him in respect of NAMA but maybe that is just a temperamental difference.  Whatever the misdemeanours of others Lazard failed in respect of those criterion.</p></speech>

In so far as contact with debtors is concerned - maybe this is only a subtle distinction - I am not aware that Cerberus actually had contact with debtors.  If the Deputy's point in that regard was about PIMCO then its contact with debtors predated our involvement so I do not think we can be held liable for it.</p></speech>

The Cerberus representative told us at committee last week and did not put a tooth in it.  There are two things.  The first is debtor information, and he was quite specific about that, and the second is access to what they called key stakeholders; movers and shakers, politicians North and South.  They paid &pound;15 million for that.  One of them was debtor information.</p></speech>

PIMCO had access to debtor information and so on and so forth.  I accept Lazard could not have known that at the time.  That is not my point at all.</p> <p>  Mr. Long remains resolute in a position that there was competitive tension and this was a competitive process.  That is entirely at variance with his acceptance that PIMCO enjoyed a competitive advantage.  He cannot have it both ways.  I do not understand how Mr. Long can at this time in this committee room remain so resolute in his position that the process was competitive while at the same time accepting that PIMCO enjoyed an advantage over other bidders.  That is a contradiction.</p></speech>

When PIMCO withdrew, part of the motivation for Cerberus to pay or offer the highest price it was willing to pay was the competitive threat posed by Fortress and vice versa.  It has nothing to do with PIMCO.</p></speech>

Perhaps I should have used the term "fair competition" or a "fair competitive process".  One cannot claim fair competition if one party enjoys an advantage, which Mr. Long has conceded.</p></speech>

It seems, in looking back, that PIMCO had an advantage over other bidders by virtue of the greater time it spent in the data room and access to debtors that it had before the process started.  It seems as if PIMCO had that advantage.  PIMCO withdrew from the process.  Without at the time being aware of the services that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were offering to Cerberus, it seemed to me as if there was genuinely a level playing field between Fortress and Cerberus.</p></speech>

In terms of paragraph 4.17 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the objective of prohibiting contact or association with debtors, the point is that NAMA became aware of an association with debtors and a success fee that involved Mr. Cushnahan.  Given the information was not shared with Lazard, the guardian of those objectives, Mr. Long does not seem to be angered, put out or upset by that, which really puzzles me.  NAMA was made aware of breaches but it was not conveyed to Lazard, the guardian of those objectives.</p></speech>

It is our clients' prerogative as to what they tell us or do not tell us.  That is always the case.  The Deputy may feel that NAMA should have told us this information.</p><p>I guess my response would be that it is up to NAMA.  I have acknowledged that our advice would have been different had we been aware of those precise circumstances.</p><p> The second point I would make in response - the other reason I am not angry - is that we gave the best advice that we could in the knowledge that we had at the time.  That has been our consistent approach throughout the process.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Long for his time; we are almost finished.  Issues arose during the process.  Did the letter Lazard gave to NAMA at the end of the day deal with the two competitive bids that were on the table and on which Lazard was adjudicating or did it refer to the whole process that had potentially nine bidders because Lazard only received two?  In Mr. Long's letter to NAMA, when he talked about competitive tension, was he talking about the end of the process, in terms of NAMA having to make a decision and bearing in mind there were seven other potential bidders, including PIMCO which did not make a final bid?  Had Mr. Long's letter to do with the process covering all nine or had it to do with the final bids that were received?</p></speech>

Why did Lazard never invite Fortress into the process?  Fortress had to force its way in, through the Taoiseach's office and through NAMA head office.  How did Lazard discount it, given that it was there at the very last minute?  I would have said, in terms of asking Lazard a question, there are lots of issues but there was a real bidder out there which had to force its way in at the last minute only because of a breach of media leak.  From what we have seen today, Lazard would not have brought it to the table had Lazard been left to its own devices.  Why did Lazard exclude Fortress?</p></speech>

We get the point.</p> <p>  I have two brief questions in relation to the bidders.

They said they had no contractual difficulties in providing the information to Cerberus and Cerberus was happy to deal with them on that basis.

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I understand that both witnesses will make an opening statement.

My colleague, Trevor Donnellan, and I are from the agriculture, economics and farm surveys department in Teagasc.  We thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the implications of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  Our contribution will be on the agrifood sector.  We will not address the fisheries sector as it is outside the remit of Teagasc.  The decision by the UK to leave the European Union will present challenges for the Irish agrifood industries, given the importance of the UK as an export market.  As members are aware, the precise implications of Brexit for the Irish agrifood sector will depend on a range of issues that will be the subject of negotiations, not only between the UK and the EU but also between Ireland and its EU partners.  In this opening statement we would like to briefly outline Teagasc's actions in advance of, and since, the UK referendum in June 2016.</p> <p>  At the start of this year we considered that the risk of Brexit was high and we therefore produced an analysis of possible implications for Ireland's agrifood trade.  Teagasc, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, organised a seminar on the possible implications of Brexit for the Irish agrifood industry, which took place in April 2016 in advance of the Brexit referendum.  This conference was attended by more than 100 stakeholders from across the agrifood industry and society.  There were speakers from Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the ESRI and respondents from the agrifood industry.</p> <p>  Teagasc's contribution to the seminar represented preliminary research on the possible impact of Brexit on the agrifood trade between Ireland and the UK.  Specifically, it examined the possible impact of Brexit on the value of Irish agrifood exports.  This paper, as the Chairman has noted, has been provided to members.  Since the referendum result we have also published a short paper on the choices to be made by the UK with regard to designing its future agricultural policy once it has left the European Union.  The design of UK agricultural policy will have implications for the future shape of the UK agrifood sector.  In turn this will influence the UK's future import food requirements and therefore has knock-on consequences for export opportunities for Irish agriculture and food industries.</p> <p>  Other actions taken by Teagasc include participation in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's consultative committee on Brexit.  Teagasc also has created an internal working group on the Brexit issue.  While it is not possible to specify the final impact of Brexit at this time, it is possible to set out the issues that would affect the agrifood sector that may need to be addressed.  It is also possible to specify desirable and less desirable outcomes that could arise with these issues.  By identifying these issues and the preferred outcomes, Teagasc seeks to provide the Government with an agenda for negotiation in Brussels.  We can identify five key policy areas of concern to the Irish agrifood sector, although it should be noted that there are many other concerns that will also need to be addressed.</p><p>The key issues are tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between Ireland and the UK; the future of the EU budget and the CAP given the funding deficit created by the UK's departure from the European Union, whenever that happens; the capacity of the agri-food sector on the island of Ireland to continue to function as a single entity, particularly in terms of trade in agri-food raw materials and food ingredients; future decisions on the design of the UK&rsquo;s agricultural policy; and future decisions on the UK&rsquo;s trade relations with countries outside the EU.</p><p> Since the referendum result in June 2016, there has been much speculation about how the UK exit from the EU will proceed.  At this stage we do not know exactly when the UK will trigger Article 50, how long the exit process will take, or what sort of trade relationship the UK will have with the EU.  High levels of uncertainty are associated with most of the issues that arise from the UK&rsquo;s stated intention to leave the European Union.  This uncertainty, along with expectations that UK economic growth will be slower over the medium term as a result of Brexit, has been reflected in a significant fall in the value of the pound sterling against the euro.  The immediate short-term impact of the Brexit decision has therefore already been felt by Irish agri-food exporters with business in the UK.  The fall in the value of sterling has made it more difficult for Irish exporters to profitably fulfil contracts with UK customers that are denominated in sterling.</p><p> It should be noted, however, that this exchange rate impact is just a part of the challenge that Brexit may present for the Irish agri-food sector.  Once Article 50 is triggered, the UK will remain an EU member for at least two years and possibly longer.  This means that no immediate change in access to the UK market will arise.  However, in the medium to longer term, once the UK has actually left the European Union, any change to the nature of the trading relationship between the UK and the EU will become more important. </p><p> Tariff and non-tariff trade barriers between the UK and the EU would present critical challenges but would not take effect until the UK has actually left the European Union.  Whether the UK and the EU forgo the option of a free trade agreement is therefore a key concern, since a free trade agreement, depending on its nature, could potentially limit the impact of Brexit on the Irish agri-food sector.</p><p> Teagasc is committed to undertaking objective economic analysis for Government, industry stakeholders and wider society, detailing the impact of potential policy developments, including Brexit, on the Irish agri-food sector.  As greater clarity emerges on the negotiation framework that will shape future UK-EU trade relationship, we will continue to provide Irish policy makers with timely and relevant analysis of the consequences of possible policy options.</p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to come along and we are happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

As a committee, we intend to do a body of work on this issue.  Teagasc is the first stakeholder group we will have before us between now and Christmas.  Thereafter we will have all the stakeholders involved in the agri-food sector to discuss this important issue.  Teagasc is first up, if I could put it that way.  We will have Senator Mac Lochlainn, Deputy Pringle and Deputy Penrose first.</p></speech>

Another area of concern is the language that has been coming from what will be the new Trump administration in the United States in terms of trade.  Has Teagasc done any analysis on the impact on prices if Britain was to engage with the United States, Canada and other international players directly?  I see it referred to but I am interested in detailed analysis.</p> <p>  The questions I will ask might need a crystal ball to answer so I apologise in advance.  The report is from April this year and the situation is changing all the time.  The other issue is sterling, which has recovered a little bit since it hit the one euro to 90 pence sterling rate.  It has fallen back.  There are people in Britain saying it will fall back further as time moves on.  Does Teagasc have any sense of that?  Again, it is a crystal ball question.</p> <p>  The all-island dimension is one of the five key points Dr. Hanrahan referred to.  Will he elaborate on the all-island implications?  As a Donegal man, I am very concerned about that.  Will Dr. Hanrahan speak on those points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#D00400"><p>I thank the witnesses from Teagasc for their presence here.  I apologise that I had to step out for a minute at the start.  We are crystal ball gazing for everything in terms of how things will develop.  It is very hard to get any definitive answers.  In the paper from April, Teagasc modelled four separate scenarios.  A worst case scenario was a cost of &euro;800 million a year for the agri-food industry and the best case scenario was &euro;150 million.  Has Teagasc revisited those models recently?  Has there been any significant change in the predictions based on the currency fluctuations and what is happening in the UK with Brexit and how it will develop?  Will Dr. Hanrahan elaborate on what the best case scenario of &euro;150 million actually means?</p> <p>  One of the key things if there are significant impacts on agri-food exports to the UK is to develop new markets.  That sounds as if it will not be simple.  It will not happen quickly or easily.  Does Teagasc advise agri-food businesses to start working now on developing alternative markets?  We had witnesses from the mushroom industry here a while back talking about how 90% of the industry's production goes to the UK market.  How feasible is it for them to develop other mainland EU markets, for example France, which is the next closest?  Is it feasible and is it something businesses should be looking at now?  It probably makes sense to have a more diverse market rather than being in the situation of some sole suppliers.  Some multiples ask people to be sole suppliers to them and then shut them down once they get them into that position.  Everything else is guess work at this stage.  Will Dr. Hanrahan expand on those two points?</p></speech>

I smile to myself when I hear everybody talk about how we should have this or that done.  How can one do anything in anticipation of what might transpire when Article 50 has not been triggered yet?  If one takes the Greenland scenario, one would think it will take far more than two years to unravel the multitude of trade agreements and stuff that is transposed from EU law and embedded in UK law.  Would the witnesses agree that two years is a very optimistic scenario and that it is more likely for it to go on for five years?   That is my strong view.  In that context, the UK will not have gone away from the EU.  There will still be some trade until it definitively pulls out.  The impact of that will be uncertainty.  Will the witnesses give some view of the level of uncertainty?  We will lose free trade with 65 million people.  Is it the position that we are dealing with guesstimates in respect of potential negative impacts on volume and value?  That is the important thing - volume and value.  One of them will be impacted by the level of sterling and how weak it becomes.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to address a simple issue.  I will be fair to them as economists, because I did some economic training and I know the "on the one hand, on the other hand" scenario drives everyone mad.  There is never a middle scenario.  Britain contributed &pound;12 billion to the EU budget.  Will that not be the most dramatic impact?  Is it not the most tangible and the one which economists can immediately evaluate?  What will be the impact of that on Ireland, particularly in the context of Ireland being heavily dependent on the more than &euro;1 billion it gets?</p><p>Could the witnesses address this as something tangible to which we can get a reasonable reply?</p></speech>

We have not done any more detailed modelling on the potential of what it might cause.  For most of our careers, we have been involved in modelling trade integration agreements, such as a World Trade Organisation, WTO, agreement or the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  Now, we are examining disintegrating potentials or the impact of FTAs between the UK and others.  We have not done any detailed analysis yet.  We are waiting for more clarity to emerge about what will happen in terms of the trade rules.</p> <p>  If the UK were to reach FTAs with the US and countries such as Canada quickly, and if there were no barriers between the UK and such suppliers, we could expect UK prices to decrease.  Given the continued importance of the UK market for Irish agriculture, we could expect Irish prices to fall as a result.  The magnitude of the fall would depend on many factors and we have no detailed analysis of how large it would be.  However, it would almost certainly be a negative for Irish agricultural prices and, as a result, agricultural incomes.  This just presents a downside for the Irish agrifood sector.</p></speech>

It has come back a little.  We do not have any greater expertise than anyone else in the room to predict whether it will improve or otherwise.  When we talk to people in the industry, there is a huge difference between sterling being at 90 pence to the euro and at 85 pence to the euro regarding entering a loss-making situation.  The fact that sterling has recovered a little is most certainly good news from the perspective of exporters who have a high level of exposure to the UK.  This part of it is good at least.  Could the Deputy clarify his question on the all-island dimension?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Donnellan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#E00500"><p>There are two dimensions to it.  We have a level of trade in terms of finished agricultural products with both Northern Ireland and the UK.  The market for Irish agrifood in Northern Ireland is important.  What is more critical is the integration of businesses north and south of the Border.  Fore example, there is a significant volume of trade in live animals between the North and the Republic and vice versa, predominantly for slaughter.  A large volume of milk comes from Northern Ireland into the Republic to be processed.  This creates problems on both sides of the Border regarding what happens if, suddenly, the movement of milk or live animals is impeded.</p> <p>  What will happen to the milk the Northern Irish farmers are producing?  Approximately one third of the milk produced in Northern Ireland comes South of the Border to be processed.  Northern Ireland farmers would potentially need more milk processing facilities in place to deal with it.  It seems problematic for the Republic to continue to take this milk, given that there is no way of segregating it and saying it is produced in Northern Ireland and is non-EU milk.  From talking to the industry, this seems to be a difficult issue.</p> <p>  There is a problem with live animals, given that there is only so much slaughter capacity and if animals cannot cross the Border, there may be an issue of whether additional slaughtering capacity will need to be put in place to address it.  In the poultry sector, all the hatchlings in the country are produced in Northern Ireland and come South of the Border to be grown.  There is a very high level of integration regarding agricultural raw materials and food ingredients.  Given that we have an all-island agrifood sector, the implications of Brexit are negative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Hanrahan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#E00600"><p>Those implications are forced a little bit on vets regarding product licensing on either side of the Border.  Vets on either side of the Border might be using similar products.  However, as licensing arrangements diverge between Ireland and the UK, some of those day to day decisions which vets and farmers make will be impacted in ways we cannot foresee.  Things they do currently without thinking about them will no longer be possible.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked whether we had revisited the analysis, and it is clear that we have not yet done so.  We are still in a fog regarding what the UK will be seeking and what the EU will be willing or unwilling to give.  Our opening statement commits us to being ready to do this analysis once we get a tiny bit more clarity on what the possible scenarios are.  It is an infinite set of possibilities and we could be employed forever trying to do them.  We want to start to do the ones that are most politically likely, given that this is where the interest will fall.</p> <p>  The numbers provided in the report, in terms of the magnitude of the trade destruction we are looking at if the UK exited, are based largely on similar work the ESRI did for the Department of Finance, which was based on work done by US economists Hufbauer and Schott.  It used a gravity model of trade and examined the extent to which being a member of the EU leads members to trade more with one another than with non-members.  Economists examined it in terms of trade in all merchandise, non-agricultural merchandise and agricultural merchandise.  They did the latter analysis given that tariff barriers to trade in agricultural products are still much higher than in non-agricultural manufacturing goods.  They found the impact of membership of the EU across all merchandise trade was approximately 21%.  All things being equal, trade was 21% higher if one was a member of the EU.  We and our colleagues in the ESRI use the estimate as a proxy for what would be destroyed if one left the EU.</p> <p>  The analysis also examined trade in agricultural merchandise and non-agricutural merchandise, given that they are different in terms of how tariffs work.  The proportional impact the American economists found for agricultural trade was very large, over 50%.  Would this level of destruction arise if the UK left the EU in terms of the trade relationships between Ireland and the UK?  These are the dimensions we examined in terms of what led us to the &euro;150 million versus the &euro;800 million in addition to trying to think about the fact that if we cannot ship our beef or cheese or whatever to the UK, it will not disappear but will find an alternative market.  We asked to what extent we need to change the price to get into those markets.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, getting a new market for Irish cheddar is not easy.  If it were easy, we would already be in there.  Often, it is sensible to assume that to get the market one would have to accept a lower price point, but how much lower?  We have no hard evidence on how much lower the price would have to be, given that this has never happened before.</p> <p>  We use two very blunt assumptions.  The product would not just disappear and we would still be creating the beef and cheese, and what we were not shipping to the UK would find another market, but at a lower price.  We have two price points, namely minus 15% and minus 30%.  Those four key assumptions are what creates the range of impacts in the paper between &euro;150 million and &euro;800 million.</p><p> By my guess, the finding that Irish agrifood trade with the UK would fall by 50% is too large because many other factors drive that trade.  For example, we are nearest neighbours, we have similar cultures and culinary preferences and there is a high degree of integration between the agrifood industries on both sides of the water and North and South.  There are many reasons to expect that, even after Brexit, Irish-UK agrifood trade will continue to be important.  It will not shrink by half, although it will probably shrink in value, if not also volume, over time.</p><p> Developing new markets is not Teagasc's remit, but Bord Bia's.  I have been present for statements by Bord Bia where it was actively helping the agrifood sector to develop new markets.</p><p> Does Mr. Donnellan wish to take Deputy Penrose's questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Donnellan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#F00200"><p>Regarding new markets, some products with a large proportion going into the UK are mushrooms, as the Deputy mentioned, cheese and timber.  Mushrooms and timber are low-value and bulky products that are not easily shipped long distances at a low cost.  The feasibility of developing new markets for some of these will be challenging.  Dr. Hanrahan mentioned cheddar cheese.  It is a specific product for which there is not really a market on continental Europe.  We would probably need to consider making different types of cheese.  We already do to some degree, but the cheddar market in the UK is an important one for the Irish dairy sector because it is a retail-type market selling cheese that is directly purchased and consumed by customers as opposed to being sold as a cheese ingredient, for example, to a company that makes pizzas, which is what one might have to do to continue being involved in the cheese market.</p> <p>  There has been a general trend in Ireland anyway towards trying to reduce dependency on the UK market.  Brexit might accelerate that.  Growth areas for food products internationally are mainly outside the EU.  The EU is a fairly mature market in which there is not much population growth and its consumers' preferences are shifting away from some of the products that Ireland produces.  Beef is an example.  Demand for it across Europe is not particularly strong, whereas demand outside of the EU is probably better.  Regardless of Brexit, the Government may have a role in this regard by funding marketing initiatives in order to develop Ireland's non-EU markets, but Brexit probably increases the importance of doing that.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked about the timeline.  We agree with him.  A companion set of slides goes with the report, although I do not know whether it has been made available to the committee.  We can provide it in due course.  Although it was speculation on our part in advance of the Brexit vote, we considered at the time that it could take up to a decade for the UK to untangle itself from the EU.  That view has been expressed in recent weeks by some others.  Two years is extremely ambitious.  That period has only been mentioned because it is mentioned in Article 50.  Many would say that that clause was written without the expectation that it would ever have to be used.  It is a complex issue.  Perhaps some of those involved in the negotiations have not yet realised quite how complex it is.  Five years might not be an unrealistic timescale to have in mind.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the UK's contribution to the EU budget.  That budget was probably under pressure even before Brexit arrived on the scene.  In the recessionary period of recent years, member states have been re-evaluating what they are getting out of the EU.  Their willingness to increase their contributions to the overall EU budget was probably already limited.</p> <p>  With the UK leaving, the immediate question for the EU is whether it will operate with a smaller overall EU budget or member states will be asked to increase their contributions.  That is a question to which we do not know the answer as this point.  If one were to guess, one might suspect that member states would not be willing to increase their contributions because there would immediately be a large squabble about who should provide more money.</p> <p>  The CAP accounts for 42% or 43% of the total EU budget, which is a large share.  There is pressure to reduce that share.  If the EU budget gets smaller, there is pressure to reduce the share of it that is represented by the CAP and there are further pressures within the EU to try to equalise to a greater degree the amount of money that is going to various member states on a per hectare basis or whatever measure one chooses, one must conclude that Ireland's share of the CAP may come under pressure.</p> <p>  Alternatively, what if member states can be convinced to increase their contributions so that the EU budget remains more or less the same and the missing &euro;10 billion is made up by them?  That would leave Ireland in a difficult situation.  On the one hand, it might find itself increasing its contribution to the EU budget and, on the other, wondering how much it will get back.  The main mechanism by which Ireland gets funding from the EU budget is the CAP.  As we move to being a net contributor, we could find ourselves trying to maintain the amount of money that is coming to Ireland through the CAP while contributing more to the EU budget than we are getting back.  It is a tricky issue that may need to be played out in future.</p></speech>

Countries like the Netherlands and Germany are seen as the paymasters of the EU.  They are getting rebates on the rebates that the UK gets in the budget because of the CAP.  They will not get those rebates if the UK is no longer a member state and getting its rebate.  This points to the difficulty in getting people to put their hands in their pockets to fill the gap created by the UK's exit, which looks likely to happen just as the new multi-annual financial framework is coming into being.  It will be an interesting few years in terms of the budgetary process, never mind the agricultural dimension specifically.</p></speech>

Companies and people who selling into the UK market will, when renewing contracts, allow for that fall.</p><p>Food inflation in the United Kingdom is increasing.  Those in the mushroom sector tell us they are getting price increases from retailers.  Has Teagasc done any analysis of whether food inflation is increasing in the UK and, if so, what effect it will have on consumer demand in future?</p><p> Free trade is a two-way street.  The UK will want to maintain free trade.  It exports a great deal of lambs to France.  Those involved will want to keep that trade going.  For over a generation we have stopped the UK doing trade deals with South American countries.  What impact would it have on the beef industry if any deal was done?  Can we spancel the UK in such a way that if those involved want free trade in Europe, they cannot do bilateral deals with South American countries?</p><p> I read a report this morning that set out how 20 countries within the EU had tried to bring in legislation to control retailers.  The report gave an indication of the power of large retailers.  Over a certain period the UK liquid milk market has been wrecked.  Proportionally, almost 50% of UK milk goes to the liquid market there.  As we sit here this evening, the price of on-the-spot milk in the UK is at 43 pence per litre.  It looks as if there will be a serious shortage of fresh milk and cream in the United Kingdom in the run-up to Christmas.  Over a long period, retailers in the UK have forced the primary producer into a position whereby it no longer makes economic sense to produce a year-round product.</p><p> We are focusing on alternative markets.  However, 50% of our beef goes into the UK and approximately 42% or 43% of our dairy produce goes there.  We need to be realistic.  Under the Food Wise 2025 plan, we are projected to increase our production of milk, beef and so on.  It will be difficult enough to get markets for that extra produce, never mind trying to find an alternative market for the product we sell to the UK.  We saw the results of the Russian ban and the unease it brought to the market.  It is difficult to imagine how we could reduce our dependency on the UK by more than 4%, 5% or 10% over a decade.  It would represent a major target to try to reduce our dependence over a decade.  There are 65 million or 70 million people in the UK.  That will always be our main market.  We have to factor that into our thinking.  The suggestion that we can get alternative markets for the produce we sell there amounts to living in fantasy land.  We will have to try to tailor any fall-out from the British decision to ensure that the economic effects are kept to a minimum.</p><p> CAP funding has been raised.  Again, we need to face reality in this regard.  If the budget is increased for CAP funding, or even if the budget is maintained, our proportion will drop.  Eastern Europe will have its claws into the funding.  Those involved will be able to make a stronger case for any extra funding that we could.  We must face reality.  In any economic projections we have to factor in that CAP funding to this country will be reduced as a percentage of the overall EU budget.  Unfortunately, that is the stark reality as we face into the next CAP reform, which is only two or three years away.  The year 2020 is only down the road.  Numerous challenges will arise.</p><p> As other speakers have suggested, we are looking into a crystal ball.  Food inflation will be present in the UK.  The effect of this on demand will be crucial.  The produce we sell will be on fragile ice with regard to the market equilibrium.  I am keen to see some analysis of this.  If food inflation is 4% or 5% in the UK, what effect will it have on demand for produce there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#G00200"><p>I am keen to follow the same train of thought as Deputy Cahill with regard to food inflation.  During the week the chief executive of Tesco said that food inflation in the UK would be a major issue for next year because of sterling.  The UK consumer will be significantly affected by Brexit.  They will be paying more for product.  That will be a key factor in where we go as a country.  The UK is one of our main markets and this will be a key factor in how we supply UK consumers.  I am keen to hear the thoughts of the Teagasc officials on how they intend to model the market in future.  In many ways, the consumer in the UK will be grossly affected by Brexit.  Food inflation will affect them more than us.  I am interested to learn how Teagasc will model the arguments in this regard and how the market can benefit.</p> <p>  We need to consider the entire picture.  Food prices and markets are important.  Another major issue is CAP.  For us, CAP is a major point.  We are starting the next iteration of CAP reform in the coming months.  The way we, as a nation, can deal with this will be crucial.  The thought of having a cut in CAP in this market or in this area at the moment is frightening.  That aspect has not really come to the forefront before today.  Not only could Irish farmers have an issue regarding markets, there could be knock-on effects because of the cut in the European budget.  That will be significant.  The coming years will be rocky.</p> <p>  I come from Cork, which is a long way from the Border.  However, cross-Border production is vital, especially when it comes to milk, pork and beef production.  It is difficult to envisage a scenario of regulating building or manufacturing on both sides of the Border within two years.  To me, it simply cannot be done.  I cannot imagine how Lakeland Dairies or other companies could manage to process milk on both sides of the Border to the necessary degree in a matter of a few months.  A five year plan is probably the only logical way.  Whether it is logical in the context of Brexit is another issue.  We are going to see exactly what will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#G00300"><p>I thank Dr. Hanrahan and Mr. Donnellan for their comprehensive presentations.  Many of the points have been covered well.  Teagasc produced a thorough report in advance of Brexit.  The report outlined the potential implications.  Apart from the decision to leave, we are no further forward in terms of the implications than we were in April.  The worst-case scenario in the report projected that agrifood exports could potentially drop by &euro;800 million per year or 8%.</p> <p>  Structural issues and tariff issues will arise in terms of how things pan out.  One thing we know thus far is that as a result of Brexit the issues of currency and the major currency switch or adjustment will be significant.  This is potentially concerning.  The impact could be structural rather than periodic, as has been the case in the past.</p> <p>  Has Teagasc undertaken any assessment in terms of the impact on agricultural trade between Ireland and the UK up to now?  I saw reports this week on beef exports for the back end of the year.  The report referred to a 13% reduction in volume of beef exported in one particular month - I am unsure whether that was September or October.  That is significant.  They may be issues with regard to supply in the UK which feeds in to those figures.  What is the Teagasc assessment?  How much evidence and information does Teagasc have thus far on the currency impact of Brexit?</p></speech>

It referred to the fact that food prices could increase by 8% by 2025 in Great Britain.  What are your views on those figures?  I realise we are crystal gazing to a large extent.  At this stage are there more positives than negatives or more negatives than positives for Irish agriculture in future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Hanrahan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#G00500"><p>I will address the questions on food inflation first.  In all the economic analyses undertaken here and in the UK on the impact of Brexit, the losers include the UK consumer.  Higher prices will reduce the purchasing power of the pound in their pockets.  Consequently, their real income will be reduced.</p><p>If we believe the chairman of Tesco, who probably has much more control over prices than we have, food inflation of 4% or 5% in the UK, even if it is passed back to Irish agrifood industries and on to farmers, will not compensate for the magnitude of the depreciation in sterling that we have seen this year compared to last year.  That is assuming the currencies do not more towards parity from their current differentials.  For Irish suppliers, some increase at the retail level and in the food industry in the UK in the sterling prices they offer would be beneficial because it would allow the euro equivalent to increase a little, but it will not, in any major way, offset the impact.  It might mitigate it but we will not see a return to the euro prices we had prior to Brexit and which we might have expected if Brexit has not happened.<br/><br/>Free trade is a two way street.  Regarding Deputy Cahill's question on whether we can spancel the UK's relationships with non-EU countries, the UK can choose to do that if it agrees to be part of the customs union with the European Union but all the signals, and they are only that from the UK, are that it is not willing to give up its desire to have control over immigration and other issues and the question of whether it would contribute to the European Union budget would be the <i>quid pro quo</i>for doing that.  One of the arguments of those in favour of Brexit was that they wanted to take control.  Agreeing to limit their freedom to negotiate trade agreements with non-EU member states was one of the powers they were seeking to get their hands on, so I do not believe it is likely that we will be able to do that.  <br/><br/>On the issue of retailer power, about which a number of members asked, while a number of member states of the EU were introducing legislation on this, any action at EU level that might happen once the UK is out of the EU would be irrelevant to the UK.  As long as we are very reliant on the UK as a market, particularly its retail industry, if there are predatory practices in that industry, and we have no evidence that there are but that does not mean that does not happen, we will carry some of the consequences of that type of behaviour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Donnellan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#H00200"><p>Deputy Lombard asked how we would view the food inflation issue in the UK and Deputy Cahill asked about the effect it might have on the demand for food.  We have colleagues in Northern Ireland, who do similar work to us, who have models for the United Kingdom.  Our intention would be to collaborate with them to examine issues such as that one.  That is one we will be capable of examining.  I agree with the member's remark about the timeline involved in constructing new processing facilities.  That could not be achieved in a short timeline of two years.  To plan, commission and construct a plant would involve a longer timeline.  The great uncertainty about that is whether it would be needed.  There is still the question of what the relationship between the UK and Ireland and the wider EU will be and whether that would be necessitated.  That is a challenging issue in itself.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we have yet seen the impact of the sterling reduction, that is difficult to say.  The committee probably needs to interrogate the food industry on that, as we are not in the food industry.  There are few issues involved.  One is the forward contract arrangements that might have been in place.  We do not know the detail, or what the duration, of those might be.  Another issue is the hedging arrangements these processors might have had in place.  In other words, they may have in the short term at least addressed the risk of the sterling depreciation.  Eventually they will have to do new hedging arrangements which will be at exchange rates which are much closer to where we are at present and then we will see the real impact on the processing industry of the sterling reduction.   </p> <p>  Another factor to bear in mind is the type of agrifood sector there is in the UK.   As well as producing its own primary products, it imports quite a lot of primary products and converts them into finished food products for consumption in the UK and in Ireland as well.  Another factor to bear in mind is changes in the value of primary products in percentage terms.  In other words, the higher prices they might have to pay in the UK for basic raw materials might not transfer into the same percentage change in the finished product.  There is also the range of other cost items in the production of a food product.  Therefore, the type of percentage changes we might see in raw materials might be much higher than the type of percentage changes we might see in the finished product at a retail level, which is an important distinction.</p> <p>  The type of inflation in the short term, as was mentioned, is in the range of 5%.  Some people have been talking about that in a relatively short-term period.  Over the longer term, I am not sure we can say anything about the level of food inflation we will see in the UK.  Traditionally, the UK has pursued a relatively low cost food policy.  Rampant inflation in food at retail level in the UK would be hugely politically unpopular.  We need to keep in mind that if UK policy was leading to very high food inflation, at some point governments would need to revisit the basis for that food inflation.  I do not imagine the UK population would tolerate high levels of food inflation over the long term.</p></speech>

On the point Senator Lombard raised about the coming together of this dynamic of the Brexit outcome and the negative impact of that for the agrifood sector, with the CAP and an EU budget dynamic, that is also negative.  I believe that is very real.  People are very well aware of that both in government and industry.  It is hard to see how it is anything but a big negative for the terms of trade Irish farming is facing in the medium to longer term.  It will accentuate some of the pressures on the agrifood sector that are already being felt.  In the continuum of exposure to both these types of dynamics, there are parts of the industry that are more profitable, there are parts of it that have lesser dependence on the UK market and then there are other parts that are less profitable currently and have a greater dependence on the UK market, and it is those parts of the sector, in particular, that will find themselves most affected by the UK decision and that will struggle the most.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Margaret Good" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#J00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  A number of questions were raised on the bovine TB eradication programme at the meeting of this committee on 25 October looking for clarity in some areas in respect of testing.  Unlike perhaps in engineering, there is no test in medicine whereby there can be 100% accuracy all of the time so it is good to try to aim for clarity.<br/><br/>Bovine TB is a disease caused by a living organism, Mycobacterium bovis,<i></i>which affects living animals and while there are two biological entities going on, there is not 100% certainty.  There are a variety of reasons for that such as the differences in the strain of the mycobacteria that are affecting the animal or even the number of bugs that got in and invaded the animal, the animal's own immune ability and the animal's genetics.<br/><br/>However, the Minister&rsquo;s veterinary inspectors working on this disease use their veterinary training and epidemiological skills as the basis for decision making.  Let us look at the tests we use for the bovine TB eradication programme.  Fundamentally, we have two basic tests.  We have a skin test and a blood test and I will cover both. The tuberculin skin test has been around for more than 100 years.  Farmers among the committee members will know it is bothersome.  It requires two visits, the cattle have to be assembled and put through the crush and handling facilities, they have to restrained twice, once for clipping, measuring and injection and then again 72 hours later for palpation of the lumps, measurement of them and assessment of them.<br/><br/>It is a somewhat subjective test with a degree of inter-operator variability in test performance and can be subject to human error.  Nevertheless, despite repeated attempts to find a better test - a laboratory test would be much desired - we have had many false hopes but we have not yet found a better test.  The skin test, in all of its forms, is still the most widely used field surveillance test for the detection of cattle with TB worldwide.  The same is true in humans where they use a variation of exactly the same tests as we use.<br/><br/>In Ireland we have many environmental mycobacteria and other diseases which can interfere with the test.  They cause cross reactions and can give rise to false positives and false negatives.  To minimise the impact of the environmental mycobacteria we use the most specific of the skin tests.  I will come back to what I mean by that.  We use the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test, SICTT, where two injections of tuberculins, purified protein derivatives, one from M.bovis, which is what causes TB, and the other one from M.avium, which is a close relation but does not cause TB in cattle.  That is to knock out the cross reaction.  The injections are into the mid-neck region in cattle and the response to both injections is compared 72 hours later.  Since the injections are just protein they cannot cause disease and because they are sterile they will not cause any other reactions unless the animal has met the TB organism and been sensitised, or alas, one of the cross-reacting ones also might sensitise.  From here on I will call that the skin test.<br/><br/>We also have a blood test so when we compare tests we use terms such as test sensitivity, which is the ability of a test to correctly identify infected animals.  The sensitivity of the skin test in this country has a sensitivity of approximately 85%.  When we are in an infected herd we can improve the sensitivity by applying a severe interpretation to the test.  Repeating the test multiple times also improves sensitivity.  We also talk about test specificity, which is the ability of a test to correctly identify non-infected animals.  I said that the test we use is the most specific.  Our test specificity is almost 100%.  It is perhaps 99.9%.  We only had 0.2% of animals positive to the skin test in 2015.  That tells us that the number of false positives we have has to be very low.  We carry out approximately 8 million tests every year and we do get some, which is still an area of concern.<br/><br/>The next thing we refer to when we talk about tests is the positive predictive value, PPV.  That is the odds that a positive test correctly identifies an infected animal.  It is directly related to disease prevalence in that if one is in a population with a high disease prevalence, one will have a very high probability, whereas, if one is in a population with a very low disease prevalence, conversely, one will have a lower probability.  As our disease prevalence falls, the risk of having false positives, the positive predictive value being low, will get higher the nearer we get to being truly TB free.  We are not there yet but we can look forward to that time.  In summary, on the tests, the skin test accurately performed under ideal conditions is an extremely accurate test.  The number of false positives to the test use in Ireland should be low.  The ability of the test to detect infected animals is good and it is improved by changing the interpretation when we are in an infected herd and repeating the tests.</p><p>Nevertheless, a proportion of infected animals can remain undetected even over multiple tests.  We know that the conditions under which cattle are tested are often less than ideal, to which I am sure a number of members can attest, and that any tests performed by humans can be the subject of human error.  To improve the detection of infected animals and remove them from a herd before they become reactor in a subsequent test, turn up with lesions at slaughter or spread TB to their herd mates, we also carry use a blood test known as interferon-gamma assay.  We use this within eight hours of sampling.  The skin and blood tests measure the same principle in the animal.  The cell mediated response measures it in the live animal beside the crush by injection and the other examines the same reagents and the response in the blood in the laboratory.  There should be a high degree of correlation between both tests.  We need live cells in the laboratory to perform the interferon-gamma assay test and so for maximum sensitivity, we start the assay within eight hours of collection of the sample.  This is challenging logistically.  All the samples are tested in one laboratory to ensure consistency of assay.  In other words, getting the samples taken on farm and to the laboratory so that the assay can start within eight hours can be challenging.  We have two laboratories in the country that carry out the initial stage of the assay, which has helped to alleviate some of the logistical challenges.<br/><br/>The specificity of the skin test is almost 100% but the specificity of the interferon gamma assay is only around 97%, which in the context of 8 million tests, is low specificity.  It is not suitable to replace the skin test as a screening test because that is much higher.  The sensitivity when the test is carried out at eight hours is much the same as in the skin test.  The benefit of doing this is that at any one time there is a small proportion of animals that will only be positive to one or other of the tests.  To maximise the detection of all infected animals, we do both tests together and we get the totality or almost the totality.  When we run the two tests together, the combined tests have a sensitivity of about 93%, which is a good improvement on 85%.  To ensure that we maximise the positive predictive value of the test, we only use it when we have already detected TB in a herd.  We use it in herds in which four or more reactors have been identified on the skin test, which animals were not bought in but acquired the disease in the herd such that there may be other animals that were in the herd that were exposed and infected.  The veterinary inspector in the local office will have evaluated the epidemiological evidence of active TB and identified the cohort animals to which they have been co-exposed with the reactors already detected and so they are the animals that we reckon are at higher risk of infection.  <br/><br/>In summary, using both tests together - the skin and eight hour gamma tests - concentrating on infected herds and on the high-risk cohorts of potentially infected animals, reduces the proportion of infected animals that might remain undetected turning up later at subsequent tests or become latent and lie dormant and either be detected later at slaughter, in which case they may restrict the herd again, which is very frustrating for a lot of farmers, or worse, cause a re-occurrence of infection and potentially spread TB again within the herd and cause another outbreak in animals or even humans.  They are the two basic tests that we use.  Since both tests measure the same response and should be well correlated, we have looked at using the blood tests as part of our quality assurance assay.  Over the years, we have had various quality control and quality assurance measures in the programme to try to improve the quality of it.  We maintain a monitor of every aspect and take steps where we can to improve the quality of the skin testing.  For example, we have measures to check that the testing facilities are adequate to allow the animals to be tested accurately and safely and to ensure there is consistent injection site accuracy.  We train people to do this and we also carry out quality control checks to ensure that on reading day the reactions are assessed and measured properly, with a view to more accurately identifying TB infected animals.<br/><br/>As a quality control, the quality assurance checks we have trialled using the blood test collected after the reactors have been disclosed.  We use a 24-hour test so we can post the samples.  These are animals that have been already tested and it is a quality assurance so we can afford to lose some of the sensitivity on it.  The first full year of operation of the quality assurance blood test was 2015.  We had 92% of the standard reactors and 72% of the standard inconclusive reactors that also failed the blood test, such that there was very good concurrence between it.  When the level of agreement between the tests falls significantly below 80% to 85%, the veterinary inspector will visit the herd, if he or she has not already done so, to assess the skin reactors, examine the nature of a lump and the regressions and whether the animals have been on any medications or had any vaccinations that might have interfered with the test.  The inspector will also then carry out a repeat blood test, which is usually done within eight hours, to see if there have been any mistakes.  The aim is to avoid the taking of uninfected productive animals from herds unnecessarily.  There is no bona fide farmer who wants to lose more animals than he or she needs to lose in order for a herd to be tested clear again.<br/><br/>For now, because of the greater familiarity with the skin test, the gamma assay as a quality assurance measure is still viewed with a degree of suspicion.  We have the same goal ultimately in mind, which is to rid a herd of infection and to restore it to officially free status as soon as possible.  To date, in exceptional cases where the quality assurance gamma has indicated that the animals are not TB infected and we have taken a decision to leave them <i>in situ</i>and retest them after six weeks none have subsequently failed the skin test or confirmed as infected with TB.  Undoubtedly, some day some will but to date none have.  We are cautious about that.  As I said, our goal is to get the herd TB free.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#K00300"><p>I welcome the delegation which has brought clarity to an issue that has faced Irish agriculture for 70 or 80 years.  At a meeting a couple of weeks ago representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine expressed the wish that we would be TB free by 2030, which will be a significant challenge for the veterinary and farming sectors in Ireland taking account of the wildlife aspect, such as deer and badgers, in many locations such as Wicklow.  We face many challenges in terms of trying to make Ireland TB-free.  This follows on from the attempts in recent years to make Ireland brucellosis free, which was done on the back of an exact blood test.</p><p>This project will be a little different given the wildlife aspect.  Will Dr. Good touch on how we will deal with the wildlife aspect when we deal with TB in future?  It is an issue the agricultural community is greatly concerned about in key locations, particularly with regard to forestry, deer and badgers.  To some degree, Dr. Good has brought clarity to the infamous blood test issue.  I thought there was a 24 hour and a 12 hour test.  How the blood tests intermingle with the skin test is an issue.  The issue of high sensitivity if there is a reactor in a locality needs to be addressed.  Does every district veterinary office have its own view on this or is there one view from the Department on how we as a nation deal with sensitivity tests?  Farmers, and neighbouring farmers in some locations, being under the scrutiny of high sensitivity tests is an issue that might have to be looked at.</p><p> Every year there are 8 million skin tests, which is an amazing figure.  When it comes to blood testing the reactor, do we go through a process of doing a 24 hour test first and then an eight hour test or do we go straight to the eight hour test?  There are two laboratories in Ireland.  Does Dr. Good believe this is sufficient?  Will we be able to work through the system?  Does she see the blood test being the key element in the 2020 strategy and having Ireland TB free?</p><p> An issue raised by farmers is the movement of animals from restricted herds.  Is Dr. Good happy with the time it takes to do the blood test and paperwork and get the reactor to a factory?  Is Dr. Good happy this time is tight enough when it comes to infected animals?  Does she believe more work can be done to reduce this time so it takes less than ten days?  In some locations it could drag out to more than three weeks.</p><p> I have never met Dr. Good but from what I have heard in Cork she is well able and efficient.</p></speech>

Unlike Senator Lombard I have come across her.  We must recognise we have significantly reduced the levels of TB.  We are now at a juncture to take the next step to reduce it even more, but this will be very difficult.  Take the example of Wicklow and the huge incidence of TB there.  Some farmers have stopped keeping bovines in west Wicklow because they could not get a clear status.  Suckler farmers had to try to sell off their young stock at the back end of the year and they found they were never clear of TB.</p> <p>  We have instances of TB in farm animals but there are also instances of it in wildlife.  There was a bad outbreak near me in the past six weeks.  Testing badgers is not automatic in a TB blackspot area.  When there is a outbreak we must analyse its cause.  In areas with a serious outbreak, where 80% or 85% of herds go down with TB, there must be automatic testing of badgers, and of deer if they are present.  Unfortunately, deer have the ability to travel extreme distances.  There must be analysis of how prevalent TB is in deer.  We have seen some results in Wicklow where TB seems to be fairly endemic in the deer population.  Obviously, they are infected by other wildlife.  How much analysis has there been of the damage done by deer?</p> <p>  We have heard about the skin test and the blood test.  Is it possible to do the two tests together or on the one day in a blackspot area, to take some pressure off the farmers?</p> <p>  We are at a point where TB has been reduced significantly.  It sat in the middle 30s for a long time and we have reduced it significantly.  To take the next step to get near to eradication, if that is possible, the focus on wildlife must increase.  We have had proof that controlling TB in badgers has had a very positive effect on the level of TB in areas, but not near enough emphasis is being put on deer.  In Wicklow tests on deer have shown they are infected.  With the increase in forestry throughout the country, deer will make it extremely problematic to reach eradication.</p></speech>

I thank her for a very comprehensive presentation.  Is she confident the 2030 target can be achieved, particularly in light of the wildlife issues mentioned by Deputy Cahill and Senator Lombard?  Recently I met a number of farmers from west Wicklow, along with Deputy Cahill, and the reactor rate in certain areas there was in high teens compared to a national average of 3%.  Given this particular challenge, how does Dr. Good see the State being able to achieve total eradication?  What additional steps does she feel are required to get to this stage?</p></speech>

If farmers who produce cattle for slaughter have a restricted herd they are not allowed to buy cattle.  Their livelihood could be totally wiped out.  Is there any possibility this issue could be examined?  If they buy cattle for slaughter only could this be continued so they could carry on with their business?  There is a possibility they could be out of business for a number of years, which seems a bit unfair.  I know there is compensation, but the compensation they would get would not match what they would earn if they were to continue to trade in cattle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Margaret Good" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016112200002#L00500"><p>None of these is a question we have not asked ourselves.  It will be challenging to meet the 2030 target of being officially TB free.  This does not mean biological extinction of the organism.  The TB control programme is governed by a number of directives, one of which is the trading directive.  This governs the trading in cattle throughout Europe.  It uses the term "officially free", which is not complete biological extinction but very low levels.  The first stage will be to get to these very low levels.  It will take us longer to get biological extinction whereby we do not have it in any wildlife or cattle.  We set ourselves challenging targets previously in conjunction with the farming community, and the 2030 target is achievable.</p> <p>  I will deal with the questions on contiguous herds before those on wildlife.  TB tends to be an area problem because it is contagious, so when we detect a herd that is infected and there has been a spread of TB locally in the herd we look at the neighbourhood.  We visit the farm to try to figure out where the infection might have been focused.</p><p>If somebody had an outfarm and a farm and it was focused on the outfarm we would concentrate on the neighbours around the outfarm who will be notified and put on a programme of testing.  Any neighbours in that situation who have not tested in the four months will be restricted until they have passed a test.  That is because there were too many instances of neighbours bringing out their cattle to sell once there was a breakdown in the neighbourhood.  The disease was then passed on and caused problems in other herds.  Not everybody would do that but it was a problem so the rule is that if they have not tested in the previous four months the herd will be restricted until it has tested clear.  Once it is clear it can trade again.  Until we have the problem in the area sorted we keep doing that.  That is a new control introduced in the past year.  It is an area of tightening to help us reach the 2030 target. </p><p> The skin test is the screening test because it is the most specific test.  When reactors are disclosed on that test we aim to do a 24 hour blood test, the blood arrives in the laboratory the following day.  We do not expect 100% agreement between the two tests but we do expect approximately 80% at least and in practice we get higher than that.  If we get no or very low agreement we go back to see why not.  Our first step is to do the eight hour blood test in case there was a mistake in the laboratory or the cells had died on the way to the laboratory and it was less efficient.  The cells have to be live.  They normally agree but there is always the possibility that they would not.  Then we would investigate further why the animals do not seem to be infected.  </p><p> I was asked were two laboratories sufficient.  We have three.  One completes the test and does the initial stages.  That is based in Dublin and takes the samples from that catchment area.  Another is in Sligo and takes the samples from that catchment area.  The one in Cork takes the samples from that catchment area.  They do the initial incubation stages and the final test and reading is done in Dublin.  That is enough.  This year we will test approximately 40,000 blood samples which is much fewer than the 8 million skin tests because we do it only in the infected herds and the infected groups of animals.</p><p> We would like to have reactors removed as fast as possible from the restricted herds but farmers want to have them valued by a valuer of their choice on the panel, which takes time.  That process has imposed some delays.  Animals cannot be valued instantaneously.  Meanwhile, we will do the blood tests.  Sometimes the two processes can overlap, especially if we are in an area where we know we have problems and it is not a herd out of the blue.  I do not know that there is much more we can do to speed up the removal and have the animals individually valued and allow the farmer the opportunity to have an appeal and perhaps a second valuation if he is not happy with the first one.  That takes time.  The valuers are independent while they are on a panel which is approved by the Department.  </p><p> In response to the question about wildlife, we detected our first infected badger in the 1970s and it took quite a long time before people accepted that they might be part of the problem.  Then there was the question of what to do about them.  We did various projects and in the early 2000s we agreed a plan with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is responsible for wildlife.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not responsible for wildlife and badgers are protected.  Under that agreement where an epidemiological investigation implicates badgers in a TB breakdown we can remove them.  We are limited to removing them from 30% of the country but we have reduced the density of badgers in those years.  In those years we have not examined every single badger but we examine approximately one third of the badgers we capture.  We did several projects which found that there is TB in badgers throughout Ireland.  Where there is TB in cattle the TB in badgers is worse, where there is no TB in cattle the badgers have much lower levels of TB.  We concentrate on hotspots and remove badgers from those.  We have reduced the level of infection in the badgers by more than 50%.  They are now coming more into line with the level in the areas where we did not have problems in cattle.  It would seem there is a threshold and when it spills over that poses a greater challenge to the cattle.  We will continue to do that. </p><p> We have also done quite a lot of work on developing a vaccine with the British and the French have recently joined that group.  We ran an oral vaccine project in Kilkenny.  It finished recently and the work has been analysed.  We expect a report any day on its outcome.</p><p> We have a project to catch and vaccinate badgers which is very labour intensive.  This is in areas where previously we culled badgers.  We are watching to see if we can keep the disease levels at bay and allow a vaccinated population to start to rebuild.  We will probably have to do some culling as well.  For the long term we are trying to develop a system to deliver vaccine to badgers orally.</p><p>In that way, we can get better coverage for the whole country and a better delivery of vaccine to individual badgers.  I do not think we could catch enough of them to vaccinate and doing this would be hugely resource-dependent.  In our project this year, we have been delivering bait containing biomarkers which leave a residue in the badger.  We are using it in the areas where we are capturing badgers to learn how many of them are eating the bait and how long we have to put out the bait before they eat it.   This is obviously a novel food for them.  A number of ecology studies are ongoing with a view to delivering the vaccine to the badger population.  There is no way we would want to wipe out badgers throughout the country.</p><p> I expect that the bait project will finish early next year.  We will then analyse the results and we will have a better idea of whether we can get wild badgers to eat the vaccine for us.  In an ideal world, 80% would eat it and would be vaccinated.  When we started this project, nobody knew anything about the immune system of badgers or whether they could mount an immune response to TB.  Thankfully, they can and vaccination in a laboratory setting works.  I hope we will hear about the vaccine in the field setting shortly.  Hopefully, that will work too and both the oral delivery and dummy bait projects will be ready for the next stage.  We will have some work to do to get it licensed because getting vaccines licensed under EU medicines regulations is quite complicated, especially when it is a product one is going to be putting into the environment.</p><p> The next question was on deer, specifically in Wicklow.  I used to work in west Wicklow so I know the area quite well.  We removed quite a lot of badgers from west Wicklow earlier this year and that will hopefully help the situation.  The area where deer were specifically looked at is a very discrete area of east Wicklow, in the northern part around Calary.  There had been very high TB levels in cattle.  Having previously looked at cattle, deer and badgers, we found that they shared the same strains of TB.  I understand that, with the collaboration of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, there will be a cull of deer in that area over the course of this season and into next year.  Hopefully that will reduce the number of deer in the area.  In the meantime, we will look at the rest of Wicklow to see if there are any other hot spots but that project has not yet commenced.  It will have to be done in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service because they are the people who are responsible for deer.</p><p> Wicklow is unique in that it gets deer samples from hunters.  I do not know a lot of the specifics on this because it is not my area, but there is an EU regulation for wild game and which deals with the examinations that have to be done when hunting is for human consumption.  The Food Safety Authority has been involved in training hunters to check carcasses and they are required to send us samples if they detect anything that looks similar to TB.  We also get farmers to send us samples following hunts and Wicklow is the only county in Ireland where, every year, we have had positive samples.  In the past 20 years, every county will have had at least one deer with TB but nowhere near the same number as in Wicklow.  I would be very surprised if there were lots of pockets of deer with TB which we had not identified or of which there were no records.  As forestry increases, the habitats where deer can hide out during the day have increased and they are very visible on fields grazing but they are not protected and can be killed, so we are more than willing to check out the samples we get.  Wildlife control and population management is not the job of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> I was also asked if it is possible to carry out two tests on the same day.  We screened herds with the skin test because it is the most specific test.  When reactors are found on that test, we go back in and do the blood test.  The first blood sampling cannot be done with that test but where disease persists in a herd we repeat the blood tests with the reactor retests and in these cases it is done on the same day.  I was also asked what additional steps were needed to get out by 2030.  That is a challenge.  If we knew the answer, we would already be doing it.  Vaccinating badgers is one step and we will probably have to control movement, even more so in infected herds because we have done a number of risk analysis studies and seen that herds which have had a history of TB outbreaks have a tendency towards recrudescence and repeat breakdown.  In some cases, stock has been sold before the repeat breakdown so we allow a short movement window after we derestrict the herd for stock.  The risk studies suggest they are safe enough for the first 60-90 days but, as time progresses, they get more and more risky.  This year, where there is a high risk of breakdown we allow a three-month movement window after we derestrict the herd and the herd must be tested again some time in the next five months.  Once the three months have elapsed, farmers can sell to slaughter and they can also sell calves under six weeks of age.  They cannot sell anything else until after another herd test has been carried out.</p><p>The farmers involved can choose the most suitable time for themselves within the following five months to do the test.  That limits the potential for spread from those.  We will need to do things like that to limit potential spread.  Probably in some of the areas where TB tends to focus, instead of one annual test we might bring in two, but we have not made any decisions on anything else yet.</p><p> We work a lot with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis in UCD.  It does much of the analysis of data, looking for the risks of various aspects.  When we have the risks identified, we try to figure out how we can mitigate those risks and prevent them causing problems.  If members have any ideas on what additional steps might help, they should feel free to present them and we will examine them.</p><p> The other question was on producing cattle for slaughter.  I mentioned a number of directives that govern TB eradication and trade.  One of those requires that when TB is detected, the herd must be restricted and no buy-in is allowed until the herd has had a clear test.  We had many more herds restricted because of detections at slaughter from fattening herds.  At one stage we had-----</p></speech>

We hope the blood testing we are doing in the infected herds will reduce that even further and that it will pick up animals.  While we still had the blood tests under trial, we had animals that had been positive but were not surrendered and we watched them progress.  They were up to ten times more likely to become reactor within 18 months or turn up with lesions when slaughtered compared with their herd mates that had been negative to the test.  By taking out those animals we hope we are also contributing to the reduction in the number of animals that we will kill out with TB when they are slaughtered.</p> <p>  For many years 20% of those herds would have a really bad TB outbreak when we detected them at slaughter.  It then reduced to only 16% and at the latest count it has dropped another couple of percentage points below 16%.  So that seems to be working.  I know it is no consolation to the beef-fattening farmers, but fewer of them are in trouble than was the case.  If they do a test that is clear, they can be given permission to buy in.  We have a small number of herds where very reluctantly the EU officials agreed to something we called "feedlots".  Initially they thought they would be like fedlots that were in America and the rest of Europe, that the cattle would be housed all the time.  They were appalled that the cattle would be out on grass.  We have assured them that these are not breeding herds, etc.  They are operating a very tight thing.  Every year they ask us questions about them.  They do not like that we allow this exception and it is against EU rules.</p></speech>

The committee particularly welcomes comments on the outlook for future budgets.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I will quickly go through the presentation I sent to the committee in advance of today's meeting.  It might be too long for the time allocated to me.</p> <p>  We welcome this opportunity to present our analysis of budget 2017 and to suggest ways of improving the poverty, gender and equality impact assessment of policy.  We have welcomed the creation of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the independent parliamentary budget office, which will come into action soon.  We believe it is significant and important that the programme for Government contains a commitment to develop the process of budget and policy proofing.  The programme for Government also commits to the development of a new integrated framework for social inclusion to tackle inequality and poverty.  It is hoped that consultation on this framework will begin shortly.</p> <p>  The European Anti Poverty Network Ireland has produced an outline of its proposals for an integrated anti-poverty strategy.  Copies of this document are available in case members have not already received it.  I am moving through the presentation quickly.  The current situation is not positive.  Our presentation includes a chart that shows how poverty has increased in recent years.  Inequality has also been increasing since 2009.  We believe these key issues need to be addressed.  This committee has an important role in ensuring policies are supporting the Government's commitment to reducing poverty and delivering an integrated strategy to address poverty and social exclusion.</p> <p>  Our assessment of budget 2017 is set out in section 2 of our presentation.  We welcome the &euro;5 increase in almost all social welfare payments, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus and the partial reinstatement of the income disregard for lone parents.  We also welcome the increased funding for the housing assistance payment and for emergency accommodation for homeless people.  Although the increased budget for social housing is extremely important, we suggest it could be increased further in light of the level of demand in this area.</p><p>What was also very important in this budget was the introduction of the first stages of a new single affordable child care scheme.  Finally, I highlight the increase in funding for higher and further education.<br/><br/>We regret, however, that some areas could have been better addressed and were not.  People under 26 years of age continue to be on lower social welfare payments and the budget effectively increases the gap between this group and their older counterparts.  There is no increase in support for asylum seekers in direct provision and the minimum wage is only increased by 10 cent per hour, which is very limited .  Budgetary measures also do not appear to be part of an overall plan to address poverty, but rather involve spreading resources very thinly.  We are also concerned about the cuts to taxation, particularly through the universal social charge, USC.  By international comparisons, Ireland already has a low tax base and a large infrastructure deficit.  The cuts to USC also benefited those on higher incomes most and could have been better spent on services such as child care, housing and reducing the cost of living for those on the lowest incomes.<br/><br/>I will comment briefly on the distributional impact.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, assessment of budget 2017 is that it is close to distributionally neutral overall but with some minor additional resources targeted towards those on the lowest incomes.  I have included the ESRI chart in my submission which shows some of that.<br/><br/>In section 3 of the submission we look at benchmarking social welfare rates, which we believe is important for an integrated social inclusion strategy to address issues such as income, services and access to decent work.  We propose that all adult social welfare rates be benchmarked to a level that lifts people above the 60% poverty line, while also being adequate to provide them with a minimum essential standard of living.  This could be achieved over a number of budgets.  The most recent survey on income and living conditions, SILC, for 2014 shows the 60% poverty line for an individual at &euro;209.39 per week.  Following the changes in budget 2017, the social welfare rate for most adults will be &euro;193 per week.  This leaves a gap of over &euro;16 per week to be covered in terms of people having an income at the poverty line.  The table in the submission shows the gap between the social welfare rates that will be in place in 2017 and the poverty line.  It is a particularly big gap for those under 26 years of age.<br/><br/>I will move on to the minimum essential standard of living.  This is based on a widely accepted methodology which calculates the income necessary for different family types to live with dignity.  The work has been done by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and its minimum essential budgeting standards research centre analysis of budget 2017 shows that of the 207 household types it has calculated with children on social welfare, the number of those families capable of meeting a minimum essential standard of living will marginally increase from 23 to 27 households as a result of changes in the budget.  In addition, a single adult over 25 years of age will still have an income inadequacy of almost &euro;60 per week.  The gap between what they will have after the impact of budget 2017 and what they require for a minimum essential standard of living will be &euro;60 per week.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the issue of poverty impact assessment.  This is an important matter.  Poverty proofing and, subsequently, poverty impact assessment have been part of Ireland's anti-poverty strategy since 1997.  The definition of poverty proofing adopted in 1999 is:</p><blockquote>[T]he process by which Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages in relation to the likely impact that they will have or have had on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction.</blockquote><p>It is important to highlight that the focus is not just on budgetary or spending policy but on all policy and programmes which could impact on poverty and inequalities.  It also looks at the impact on different groups and is not limited to purely statistical analysis but allows for much more flexible approaches to assess the possible impact.<br/><br/>In 2008, new guidelines were adopted for what was then called &quot;poverty impact assessment&quot;.  These guidelines emphasised the importance of consultation and transparency as key parts of the process.  The process involves seven steps.  These are outlined in the submission, so I will not detail them now due to the time available.  Overall, the assessments, since the period of their introduction, indicate that even from the start, while there might have been a reasonable level of formal compliance and reporting with poverty proofing and poverty impact assessment, it is much more difficult to identify what the actual impact was on policy and programmes, and therefore the impact on poverty.  Since 2008, the social inclusion division in the Department of Social Protection has continued to work on poverty impact assessment but with ever-decreasing resources and focus.  In effect, throughout this time poverty impact assessment was only carried out in very limited circumstances and with little transparency in the process.<br/><br/>I will outline our recommendations for a poverty and equality impact assessment.  It must be comprehensive and include all relevant policy areas.  It must be a planning tool and not just a reporting process.  It must be transparent and be published in a transparent manner, involving a clear assessment and justification for decisions in poverty terms and how they impacted on policy.  The assessment must involve meaningful consultation with those impacted by the policy measures.  It must be part of policy debate, including debate in the Oireachtas, and involve assessment using a range of indicators, not just the numbers at risk of poverty, and examine the impact on people's lives.  Also with regard to poverty impact assessment and poverty proofing, there must be a commitment to, and ownership of, impact assessment at the top level of Government as a tool for supporting it to deliver on its commitments to reducing poverty and inequality.  The Department of the Taoiseach should take a lead role in rolling it out across all Departments.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the effective impact assessment of the budget is essential in addressing poverty and inequality.  The committee has a key role in ensuring that this happens in a transparent manner.  This should not just involve looking at the specific tax and expenditure changes in any one budget but at overall taxation and expenditure.  It is also crucial that the Government seeks to strengthen the implementation of impact assessment across all policy and programme areas as envisaged in poverty impact assessment guidelines.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what was said and with many of the priorities identified.  However, we are all operating under the constraint of the so-called fiscal rules.  They have been revised downward in recent times by the Government following Brexit and external shocks.  The fiscal space sets out what additional spending is available.  Then there are discretionary measures that can be introduced through taxation increases, public spending savings and so forth.  Obviously, therefore, we must be conscious of the fiscal space and work within those parameters, regardless of whether we like them.  Is the network involved in any of the debate that is taking place at European level, or even national level, about flexibility in the rules?  Whatever about borrowing money for daily spending, and I have a view on that, there would certainly be an argument that we should be able to borrow to invest more in capital and public infrastructure and that the fiscal rules are too rigid in this regard.  Has the network given any consideration to that matter or carried out any work in respect of it?</p> <p>  The document the witness presented to the committee is probably the network's pre-budget submission.  It refers to greater taxation on wealth and to increasing employer PRSI closer to average EU levels.</p><p>What specifically is Mr. Ginnell referring to in the context of taxation on wealth?  On the issue of increasing employer PRSI, has he given any thought to the European Union average levels?  When the European Anti Poverty Network, EAPN, is making proposals, what exactly is it seeking?  The point about poverty impact assessments is something we discussed earlier.  Equality proofing and poverty proofing budgets is something the committee discussed when it was being established.  We had a number of experts before us and they made very compelling arguments for it to be mainstreamed within the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is obviously a scrutiny role for Oireachtas committees but they need to be conscious of it.  What type of work has the EAPN done on that and has it made any representations to the Departments in question on poverty impact assessments or poverty proofing?</p><p> The contentious issue of the USC was raised.  There are different views politically on that but most of the organisations that have been in before us have not been in favour of abolishing it.  What work has been done in that area?  What is the EAPN's position on that?  </p><p> My final point is on the living wage.  I was involved in authoring a report on the issue of low pay for the jobs committee just prior to the general election.  That report focused on wages but it also looked at the living wage as a concept.  It made the argument that welfare transfers, access to public services, such as health and investment in child care, are as important - if not more important - than increasing wages because wages can go up or down.  If there is a collapse in the public finances, wages can go down and people are reliant on them.  Welfare transfers, public services, taxation and working conditions and work-related considerations such as precarious work, part-time work, contract work and low-hour contracts are also important.  When looking at the living wage, has the EAPN considered other issues such as the cost of living being as important as the actual aim of a living wage?  They are my opening questions.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his questions.  On the fiscal space, we have not engaged as directly.  We were part of the Better Europe Alliance and in that context we meet the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and also engaged with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments.<br/><br/>Initially there was very little room for flexibility but it seems, as the Deputy said, that recently there has been an increase in recognition, which started with demands from larger countries, in particular France and Germany, that there be some more flexibility.  The annual growth survey released by the Commission last week, which is their main document of the year, seems to say that on an <i>ad hoc</i>or individual basis, at a European level, they would consider flexibility, particularly when it comes to investment and the recognition of the need for investment.  At a European level, we focused on the investment side and the importance of investment on flexibility but did not directly lobby on it.  It seems there has been increased recognition of the need for flexibility.  All stakeholders at a national level have been demanding that for a number of years.<br/><br/>In terms of taxation, wealth, employer PRSI and our pre-budget submission, there has been work done by TASC on a wealth tax.  In the past, the community platform has also made proposals on a wealth tax looking at all areas of wealth.  It is one element.  TASC estimates that a wealth tax would bring in around &euro;500 million per annum which is not vast.  It would make wealth more transparent and bring much more information into the system.  It would have some Revenue benefits but it would also provide more transparency in wealth.<br/><br/>In comparative terms, Ireland has one of the lower levels of employer PRSI in the EU so we are asking to move more towards the EU average.  As I said earlier, although it does not appear to be, Ireland is----- </p></speech>

There is resistance to that from certain quarters.  That is one of the main areas where there could be some catch-up compared to other European countries.</p> <p>  Poverty and equality proofing is something we have been highlighting consistently for a number of years with all Departments.  The EAPN has done it bilaterally but also, as part of the community and voluntary pillar, we meet regularly with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is consistently on the agenda.  It is consistently something they say they are working on but we have yet to see what exactly they are doing on it.  We keep hearing there is something in the offing and there is supposed to be an event next year.  Initially they were saying that they would hold an event early next year on this but we do not know the detail of what is being proposed.</p> <p>  On the USC, the issue is being raised in terms of the erosion of the tax base.  From our point of view, it is important to maintain a steady tax base because of the demand for services and investment.  While it can be argued that taking people on lower pay out of the tax net is important to their pay, we consider increasing pay by giving a living wage is another way of ensuring people have a decent income.  The Deputy mentioned his report, which I was at the launch of and have read.  It is a comprehensive report and it shows the holistic approach that needed to be taken to taxation, pay and access to services.  In terms of a minimum essential standard of living, which is the basis on which a living wage is calculated, one must look at the cost of services.  If the cost of a service is reduced, for example, by a child care subsidy, which, in turn, reduces the cost of living, it makes it easier for people and all of this balances out.  The cost of housing is another obvious matter in respect of which this would apply.  All of these things interplay with each other.  There is a need for a holistic approach to how these issues are addressed.  That is what we said on an integrated anti-poverty strategy.  It is not about one issue but how these work in the round, which is why we say the committee has a role in ensuring that the issues are worked in the round.</p></speech>

I am sorry I had to pop out for a second.  Regarding the USC, Mr. Ginnell mentioned the steady tax base.  Has the EAPN done any work on something that came up at this committee - which both of us have spoken about - to the effect that instead of being abolished, the USC would be channelled into PRSI?  Has the EAPN considered that as a way of keeping the base broad but of using the money specifically towards the PRSI pot?</p> <p>  Has the EAPN done any work on the impact of the living wage on employment figures?  I employ 30 people, give or take, in my other profession.  Many of them are shop assistants and low-wage earners.  I am only looking at it from my narrow point of view but if one was to increase the wage to &euro;11.50, has the EAPN done any work on whether it would lead to lay-offs from those sort of jobs, the impact of it or the inflationary impact of an increase of the minimum wage to the proposed living wage?</p></speech>

We have not done specific work on the living wage.  There is a living wage technical group, which the Deputy is probably aware of, that does a lot of work on that.  What was the first part of the question?</p></speech>

We would have recommended moving the universal social charge to a social insurance type payment because its structure in the way it operates is more like a social insurance payment and it started from that base.  That was part of a recommendation back then.  The universal social charge has a more progressive structure.  It can be organised in a progressive way as a form of taxation or a social insurance payment.  In the past we would have recommended that it would be moved over and become part of the social insurance element.  That element in that past was very much reduced during the crisis.  The Social Insurance Fund was almost emptied.  It is not a direct income tax but it could also form part of the social insurance base.</p></speech>

It is currently quite specific and narrow.  The issue of whether that should be broadened is one to be teased out.  It is one block of tax or contribution paid by the citizen where he or she can see where the money goes.  From that point of view, it can play that role.  However, it would need to be teased out further if that was a route we were to go down.  That would require further exploration and discussion.</p> <p>  We would regard the living wage as an important concept because many of us have concerns about the fact that the terms and conditions of work for many people are not as good as they once were.  There is the impact that has on people trying to move from welfare into work or people who are working who are trying to cope with the cost of living or even the cost of going to work and being able to participate in society.  Therefore, it is an important concept. </p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane raised the issue of the relationship between welfare and work and, ultimately, who needs to contribute to the take-home pay that the worker gets and how can that be done as fairly as possible.  For many of us the concept of decent work and people earning a decent wage is critical.  People need to feel that they will be protected in their work and that they will have security in terms of the hours they work.  People need to know what their income is likely to be from week to week.  There can be some flexibility around the second or the third wage coming into a family.  That might suit people and they might be able to manage on that basis.  However, if flexibility surrounds the primary wage, it is very difficult for people to manage because often they do not know, from week to week, where they stand.  Given that much of Ireland's social policy is very much based on individuals being able to provide for themselves and their families, we need to have better services.  Countries where there is greater equality generally have better services.  We need to explore those issues further and address them in a way that gives people a sense that this is very much their country and that they can manage well with what is on offer.  There are still a number of issues to be teased out.  Some of those are around the vision we want for this country and how we want to it develop and emerge, particularly coming out of the recession to ensure that the recovery is experienced by everybody.</p></speech>

I also have a number of students and part-time workers.  The issue is not that I cannot guarantee them hours, it is that they do not want them.  They want to be off three weeks before and three weeks after their examinations.  Essentially, they are on zero-hour contracts because they want them that way.  That works for me in my small world.  The witnesses might not know the answer to this question but they might direct me to whosoever might know it.  How can we protect those types of workers who need to work to fund their education and need a greater degree of flexibility around hours than the primary or secondary wage earner in the family?  How do we strike a balance whereby we can have zero-hour contracts for students but can ensure they are not taken advantage of and that we can also protect people who depend on their wages being paid every week into their accounts to pay their bills?  Have the witnesses suggestions as to how we would deal with that?  That is a practical concern I have.  It is not the case that I believe anyone should have a zero-hour contract but there are people who require such contracts for their education or for some other reason.</p></speech>

In that way people at least have a good sense of where they stand from week to week or month to month, depending on circumstances, and both parties have clarity and workers have certainty about their work and a sense of protection.  Flexible work arrangements suit some people and that is their choice.  It is important that people feel they have a choice but for other people, particularly those trying to make the welfare to work journey, because of the uncertainty of the work on offer, many of them have felt that they could not make that journey, particularly if they had any logistical issues to address, be it child care or transport.  In particular in the case of transport, it is very hard for people to secure their own private transport if they do not know where they stand income wise.  It is a question of ensuring there is good information, that people understand their rights and responsibilities, that there are clear contracts, and that people know what is in them, what is expected of them and what is expected by both parties.</p></speech>

It involved getting a grip on the belief that there is much precarious work with many people working on zero-hour contracts in Ireland.  The report was commissioned by the Department.  The University of Limerick examined whether the reality is that there are many zero-hour contracts here.  It concluded that there is not a massive issue with zero-hour contracts but with low-hour and "if and when" contracts.  In the report it analysed where this exists across a range of sectors.  It is more in play where there are different opportunities for people.  The report made a number of recommendations, one of the key ones being the need to give employees more certainty.  Many of the issues seem to be that employees did not know until a few days or very close to the working week what their hours would be.  There were a number of recommendations for legislation and tightening regulations around "if and when" contracts, which required people to be available if and when work was available.  The recommendations sought to regulate and tighten up this area.  That was the key issue for workers in Ireland, as opposed to necessarily zero-hour contracts where people had no guarantee of any hours.</p></speech>

There also were recommendations around the level of income.  People should be assured of a certain level of income.  Even if people were not be required to work the number of hours they were available, they would still have to be guaranteed a certain basic income or a number of hours.

In other countries, that would have been different.  We were quite struck by the contribution that self-employed people in France made.  Therefore, if things did not work out for them, they had access to greater social protections than people would have here.  One of the recommendations we would have made at that stage is that somebody who is self-employed should be facilitated in making a contribution on behalf of themselves, effectively as an employee and employer.</p></speech>

We are conscious that quite a number of people who ended up in difficulties during the recession because of their unfortunate circumstances were able to access jobseeker's allowance because they met the means-test criteria.  It is around how to build that safety net for people.  In that regard, some changes have been introduced that will allow greater access to some of the social insurance supports.  If everything goes belly-up for people, the only payment they can access now is jobseeker's allowance.  We were struck by how there seemed to be a greater contribution to the pot in other countries in order to cover the issue.</p></speech>

It suggests it would not been on lower levels of wealth but on assets of over &euro;1 million, excluding certain types of assets such as the family home and so on.  It would be kept at a low level, such as 0.5% of unearned wealth or income.  Considering international examples, it was felt that it would not create a flight of wealth if the tax was kept at a certain level.  It would be a self-declared tax.  Over time, it would built up a certain amount of knowledge about wealth in Ireland, enabling us to make better policy in terms of how to address this into the future.  Initially, it suggested a reasonably low level of tax on unearned wealth and a certain high threshold at which it would come into play.  It would, over time, produce a level of information that could be used for future progression.</p> <p>  Initially, it would not bring a massive amount of revenue - it would be approximately &euro;500 million - as it is very hard to estimate the amount of wealth that exists.  The Central Statistics Office did some work on this last year based on older data.  There is very little information on this type of wealth.  Over time, one would build up a level of knowledge by having this system in place and this would allow something more comprehensive to be introduced in future.  It is a way of building a level of knowledge and another area to look at with regard to wealth.  A few years ago, the Government introduced the application of PRSI to unearned income, and that has begun to bring a little bit of focus on taxation or PRSI on forms of wealth apart from income.</p></speech>

The PRSI they pay is one of many costs in running a business.  It is difficult to strike a comparison between this jurisdiction and other states because perhaps their VAT rates, rental or wage costs are lower.  There is an overall context regarding the cost of running a business.  The consistent feedback from businesses is they are barely able to cope with the level it is already at, and such a change would force them to let people go.  It certainly would not encourage them to take on people.  Our focus in recent years has been to create jobs and employment, as Mr. Ginnell is aware.  When he advocates increasing PRSI, has he considered that it is one of a number of costs and that it cannot be compared directly with what applies in other states?  One must consider whether the overall cost of running a business is very low.  That is one aspect but I would be very concerned about advocating to increase that tax on business because of the potential impact on employment.  There could be a loss of jobs as well as an obstacle to creating employment.</p></speech>

USC is a social insurance payment.  It is something to be investigated.  We have not looked at it in that holistic way but it is an issue to be examined.

If jobs and industry are affected, we will lose ground in those two areas.  If we increase employer PRSI, we could very well lose the same amount gained or even more, ending up worse off by making such moves.  We must be very considerate in any suggestion we make.  Any suggestion of an increased tax on business can have the effect of discouraging people in investing in our country.  We must be very careful about any suggestions that might damage our reputation internationally.  I accept Mr. Ginnell's point about exploring the possibilities and this is one of many options.  Revenue must be raised and services must be provided and we must consider how to do that without crippling people with taxes.</p> <p>  There is a table on the poverty line for 2014 outlining the different groups.  It is quite shocking to see the gap in respect of people between the ages of 18 and 24.  I am very much against the idea that those under 26 receive less social welfare than others because someone in that age bracket who is working full-time pays the same tax as everybody else.  People should, therefore, be entitled to the same social protection as everybody else and there should not be a distinction.  I understand the thinking behind this because it was designed to encourage people to get back to work.  People in that age group will argue that they cannot obtain work or that they find it extremely difficult to do so.  It is not for the lack of them wanting jobs.  Is the suggestion simply to increase the social welfare rate?  Is there anything else we can do to assist the people in the age bracket to which I refer who are in their early 20s.  It is very difficult for them now, particularly in the context of owning a car or a home while having a decent standard of living.  As a result of attending college, university, an institute of technology or even learning a trade, these individuals may have massive debts.</p><p>What are their prospects of being financially secure?  I am sure there are many people of that age group who are thinking they will never have that feeling of being financially secure.  Aside from the inequality we need to address in the social welfare system, is there anything else we could do for people in that age group?</p></speech>

I think it has sent a very negative message to young people.</p> <p>  What is interesting is that when one looks at the emigration figures, it will be seen that twice as many people who had a job emigrated.

I think that is an issue we need to address as a society.  We then have to tease out how we address the cost of living and the services gaps.  One issue in particular that is coming up quite a bit is the cost of housing.  Not only is the cost of housing a social issue, it is also an economic issue.  I would be conscious that some employers are finding it difficult to fill some jobs because people, such as Irish emigrants who might be contemplating coming home or other workers who have the skill sets we are looking for, are looking at the cost of housing and saying "crikey".</p></speech>

I would like to see further discussion on the social welfare inequality, as it were, for younger people.  Let us call a spade a spade, the measures were brought in because we were broke, we needed to save money and this segment of the population was the group that was least likely to vote and affect Government.  That is being very blunt.  As the country recovers and as there is more money in circulation, we should be looking to address this inequality.  It sends a very negative message to younger people that they are worth less and that Government can get away with it and there is nothing they can do about it.  It is also reflective of the fact we do not have many younger people in politics and perhaps their views are not being advocated strongly enough.  That is a job for us as well.

In regard to the social insurance contribution, certainly the employer's contribution is lower and, likewise, for some employees the rate is lower.</p></speech>

Again, is that something the witnesses would have found out from conducting investigations or would they have a different view on that point?</p></speech>

It shows that Ireland is among the most redistributive systems in the EU.  Unfortunately, because income from the market leaves us among the more unequal, even after transfers we still only hit around or below the average.  It does not move us.  It would be the best system at the end of the day.  It has to work harder in Ireland.  The transfers have to work harder in Ireland to bring us to the EU average.  In most social reports that Ireland sends to EU, the comments from the Commission is that we are one of the most redistributive, but from a very unequal base market-wise.</p></speech>

When the CSO figures look specifically at tax and welfare and the impact of welfare transfers on reducing the poverty rate, Ireland has gone from being one of the countries which has the least redistributive, where welfare does least to reduce poverty rates, to one of the countries where welfare does most.  When we talk about the impact of being a low tax country, we are also taking into account the other part of the triangle, which is the services which are available and which have most impact on the lives of our members, the people living on very low income.  While we have got to a situation where welfare transfers are helping us avoid the really extreme level of poverty, which would be very much an outlier in Europe, if this compensation was not in place, the low tax base has an enormous impact on the quality of our public services, which increases the real impact of poverty right across the board.</p></speech>

Mr. Ginnell states that we are not in a good place.  I suppose that is reflective of where we were in 2008.  When are we likely to see an updated version, in other words, figures for after 2014?  In one sense 2014 is not that long ago, but in another sense it is almost three years ago now.  Mr. Ginnell has marked three indicators on the graph, at risk of poverty, material deprivation and consistent poverty.  Does he know if the statistics are moving in a downward direction since 2014 or has he evidence of which way they are moving?</p></speech>

They are from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions, which I mentioned earlier in terms of redistribution of income.  The CSO produces these data and it has been trying to update them and have them in a timely manner.  That has been an issue in recent years.  We expected it this month, but the latest information from the CSO is that it will be sometime before the end of the year, it hopes.  There is some glitch in the statistics which it found in the USC.</p></speech>

It is slightly complex but in terms of looking at Ireland's income data, it is a business survey so it also surveys people.  It literally interviews people as part of the survey.  A lot of the information is based on the data from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in terms of looking at Ireland's income levels.  The CSO has to get all the data first and it then puts the survey interviews through the system as well.  It tries to get it as early in the year as it can.  October and November is the earliest time it can have it.  The 2015 data should be available soon, I hope.  They will be delayed.</p> <p>  In terms of my sense of direction, what we see in the graph will be continued.  The first item is material deprivation which comprises 11 basic items that people need to have.  If people are lacking two of the 11 basic items, such as a certain amount of food, clothing, footwear, certain social life and so on, they are suffering material deprivation.  That will fall as incomes have risen more generally.  I think many people who were experiencing material deprivation, and it was more than 30% of the population, are now in work.  As incomes begin to rise across the board, including from social transfers but also from work, I would expect that to continue to fall.</p> <p>  The second heading is "at risk of poverty", and that blue line is the poverty line.  As incomes rise, the threshold which is currently &euro;209 per week is likely to increase.</p><p>It is possible that the number of people falling below the line will increase as well.  That is unknown but it is possible that there will be an increase.</p><p> The consistent poverty line is next.  This is what the Government has targeted for reduction.  It is based on people who have experienced both types of poverty.  People who suffer from material deprivation and who are below the poverty line are deemed to be in consistent poverty.  That is an unknown factor.  It is a question of who experiences both types.  The figures are based on the survey.  It is difficult to know.  The numbers could fall further.  They are likely to fall somewhat because the at-risk-of-poverty line is likely to increase while material deprivation is falling.  The cross-over of the two variables is unknown but I expect that it would fall somewhat.</p></speech>

Figures published today suggest that the unemployment rate is down to 7.5% from a peak of 15.4%, although I stand open to correction on that.  It is an old chestnut.  The view is that the best way to reduce poverty is to get people back to work.  What has the impact of the past four years been since unemployment started to drop from its highest point?  What has the impact been in terms of getting people out of poverty?</p> <p>  I represent a large rural constituency, parts of which are sparsely populated.  However, it has a number of substantial towns as well.  The worst poverty I have come across is in isolated rural areas.  I am conscious that even in isolated rural areas there may be generations of families who have not worked.  How does Ireland compare with other European countries?  This is tied in to the American idea of the rust belt and the loss of manufacturing.</p> <p>  The biggest urban centre in my region is Waterford city.  Other urban centres nearby include Wexford and Carlow.  They have suffered significant losses in manufacturing employment in the past ten years or more.  Even at the height of the Celtic tiger, many of those manufacturing jobs were going.  Do we have significant concentrations of unemployment in geographic locations throughout the country?  Is there an intergenerational unemployment issue?  Is the issue as great as I and others fear?  I might think of some other questions before our guests conclude, but perhaps they could try to address some of those I have already raised.</p></speech>

However, that is of cold comfort to anyone living in the circumstances the Chairman described.  Likewise, let us consider a region like Dublin.  The employment and unemployment figures look healthy.  Again, that is of cold comfort to anyone living in some of the less-well-off suburbs in Dublin where there is often intergenerational unemployment and associated poverty.</p> <p>  Let us consider the EU statistics on income and living conditions, EU-SILC.  One of the groups that jump out is made up of those who are unemployed and experiencing poverty.  Certainly, getting a decent job can make a big difference to people.  This means that if a person needs to get a loan or car insurance, her opportunities are better if he or she has a job.  Some firms will not even give people who are unemployed insurance quotes.  Life circumstances can certainly be improved if a person gets a job, but it depends on the nature of the job.  The feedback we get from individual members and affiliates working and living in rural areas is that often trying to get access to such decent jobs can be problematic.  Transport can be a major issue too when it comes to trying to access whatever work is available in an area.  That has come to our attention as an issue.  We have raised it previously because we take the view that it is particularly difficult to resolve.</p> <p>  Unemployment in the south east is often higher than the national figure.</p></speech>

It is a part of the country where attempts to obtain - and then maintain and develop - sustainable employment has represented an ongoing challenge.  Developments such as Brexit and the election of Trump in the USA will throw up unforeseen issues in terms of what will happen to foreign direct investment here and in other countries.  All these factors add layers of complication.</p> <p>  It is important that the regional action plans for jobs and the targets in the programme for Government are delivered and that we examine ways to develop sustainable indigenous enterprises and self-employment options for people.  We get feedback from unemployed people, including those who are older, and from others within communities.  Sometimes they are in circumstances whereby they believe that unless they generate their own job, they will not get one.  It is a question of trying to ensure that people going down that route get the necessary supports to be able to deliver on it.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the further Revised Estimates for my Department for 2016 which deal with the formal transfer into the Department of funding for the climate action and environment divisions.  Having climate action and environment in the same Department as energy and natural resources is a sensible decision and there are many business synergies and advantages in ensuring greater policy harmonisation across those sectors.  Having formally ratified the Paris Agreement earlier this month and engaged in debate with other environment Ministers at a COP 22 meeting in Marrakech, I can see a real need to ensure a whole of government approach is taken to deliver on meaningful and real carbon reductions over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Reducing the overall amount of energy we use by increasing our energy efficiency measures has to be a key priority for my Department and I have argued hard to ensure that my Department secured a real increase in resources in 2017.  Increasing the use of our renewable energy resources and more sustainable management of our waste, including increased recycling, will all contribute to a more sustainable future.  We will have a further engagement after the 2017 Revised Estimates are published next month, which will go into my Department's 2017 plans in much greater detail.  </p>  <p>  I am accompanied by my officials - Martin Finucane, finance officer, Jim Whelan, assistant principal officer, Kevin O'Donoghue, principal officer and Ken Cleary, assistant principal officer.  In terms of the further revised 2016 expenditure, including expenditure in the new environment divisions, in capital my Department has spent &euro;71 million out of a profiled expenditure of &euro;96 million, representing 72% of profiled expenditure to the end of October.  On current expenditure, my Department has spent &euro;274 million out of an end of October profile of &euro;288 million representing 95% of profiled mid-year expenditure.  Appropriations-in-aid are running at &euro;187 million out of a profile of &euro;195 million, or 96% of end of October profile.</p>  <p>  As I signalled when I met members in June and September to discuss the 2016 Estimates, there has been a deferral of some expenditure on the broadband programmes this year and since then my Department has received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to divert some &euro;3.5 million of capital from this subhead to other areas as follows:  &euro;0.5 million to TG4 to complete the replacement of a roof at its headquarters in Baile na hAbhann in Galway; &euro;0.5 million to the Geological Survey of Ireland to fund an airborne survey as part of the groundwater 3D mapping programme; &euro;2.3 million for Inland Fisheries Ireland for investment in the recently undertaken national strategy on angling development to cover increased fisheries development activity, infrastructure improvements and new equipment including the replacement of rib boats for patrol duties; and &euro;0.2 million for additional work this year on the old Avoca mining site.  The Department does not require any supplementary Estimate for 2016.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses also that any submission or opening statement they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.

The committee decided to review the current funding model for public service broadcasting, the effect of advertising opt-out on broadcasters and to consider other related broadcasting matters.  The committee may also examine media ownership in Ireland.  The committee is aware of the difficulties with the current television licensing system, and of the rapid changes in technology with a reduction in funding through commercial revenues available to all broadcasters.  Although this is the second meeting at which the committee will consider public service broadcasting, we have engaged with the Minister during previous meetings on its funding.  The opening statements have been circulated and I propose that the three main witnesses will contribute for five minutes each, followed by a question and answer session where each member may ask questions for a period not exceeding three minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> We will have two sessions.  Session B will take place at 6 p.m. approximately when we will meet representatives of RTE, TG4 and the Irish Film Board.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I welcome Professor Kevin Rafter, School of Communications, Dublin City University, DCU; Mr. John Purcell, chairman, Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, and chief executive officer of KCLR 96 FM; Mr. Tim Collins, director, IBI, and chief executive officer of Newstalk FM; and Ms Lisa N&iacute; Choisdealbha, executive director, IBI; and Mr. Larry Bass, Screen Producers Ireland board member and Shinawil Productions and Ms Jennifer Kenneally, policy and communications manager.</p><p> I invite Professor Rafter to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I welcome the committee's decision to prioritise public service broadcasting as part of its work programme and also the positive engagement of the Minister with the topic.</p> <p>  By way of background, I am currently Professor of Political Communication at DCU.  I was previously head of the department of film and media at IADT, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have been associate dean for research and chairperson of the MA in Political Communication programme at DCU.  My statement draws on some of the research I have undertaken in DCU.  Several members of the committee will recall that prior to 2008, I worked in the media as a political journalist based in Leinster House with a number of newspapers and also with RTE.  I also produced a number of radio documentaries for Newstalk.  I am, therefore, alongside my academic work, drawing on this substantial professional media experience in my contribution to the committee's deliberations.  The statement is based on a longer submission made to the committee in the past few days.</p> <p>  All broadcasters, irrespective of ownership type, face funding challenges.  Recent changes in communication technologies and public consumption of media have had a dramatic impact on the media sector.  Global media has become local and the related impact on audience, advertising and content has been significant.  In October 2011, the then Director-General of RTE, Mr. Noel Curran, delivered a speech in DCU where he  recounted how it was possible to go through a normal day consuming a great deal of media beginning with "Ireland AM" on TV3 and continuing with independent radio, Sky News, using Google, tweeting,  posting on Facebook, watching the BBC and listening to Today FM.  As he said at the time, this type of media consumption was, "an Irish audience in a single day, any day, of any month, of any year [...] an average day of viewing, listening and web browsing &mdash; where you don&rsquo;t use any of RT&Eacute;S services".  It is now possible to go through an average day of viewing, listening and web browsing without using services of an Irish broadcaster, be they publicly or privately owned.  That is evidence of the scale of the global transformation in media in recent years and the challenges faced by Irish broadcasters.</p> <p>  RTE has a special place in the Irish broadcast landscape.  Given its Irish language remit, TG4 fills a unique space, but when we talk about public service broadcasting, we can no longer confine the discussion to RTE and TG4.  If the committee took that on board, it would be a major advance.  A considerable volume of research has focused on the difference in programming between public broadcasters and their privately-owned counterparts.  We have done research on that in DCU, which challenges the idea that RTE provides the only substantial news content in the country given that private broadcasters also produce public service content.  In a democracy, it is important to have multiple sources of news and current affairs and ensuring all sources are financially viable is hugely important.  We need to recognise the changed landscape in which broadcasters exist.  It is important to support RTE and TG4 and that is a viewpoint I hold strongly.  Private broadcasters, particularly those producing news and current affairs content, need public policy support.  We, in DCU, produced major research last July, which examined Irish journalism, and the findings were bleak.  The profile of journalists has become younger, mid-career journalists have exited the profession, the pressure to sensationalise news has increased and research times on stories has decreased.  If we believe that when journalism fails, democracy suffers, it is important that all journalism is respected.</p> <p>  Under the Sound and Vision Fund, 7% of the licence fee is available to produce programming on private and publicly-owned stations has been important, but news and current affairs programming is excluded.  This exclusion means that the 20% news and current affairs statutory requirement on privately-owned stations, which is public service content, receives no licence fee support.  That is deserving of consideration by the committee.  It is a shame that the broadcast charge has gone off the agenda.  Nevertheless, in the short term, the committee and the Minister can make huge advances by looking at evasion.  The evasion rate is approximately 15% whereas it is 5.5% in the UK.  Database access to digital television services is hugely important.  That legislation has been long promised and it should be acted on.  A commercial licence fee alongside a residential licence fee is worthy of consideration and I refer to that in the submission.</p> <p>  RTE also has to take responsibility for its own finances.  It is curious to say the least that it reported that it had its finances in order but that by the end of 2016 they have deteriorated to such an extent, notwithstanding well-flagged events this year.  While the new DG bears no responsibility, the mess that is now again RTE's finances is hers to clean up.  RTE needs to cut its cloth to the resources available.  The committee should pay attention to the singular asset available to RTE to make a dramatic impact on its finances.  Just as the arrival of television in the 1960s meant a departure from the GPO in Henry Street, serious consideration should be given to RTE exiting its current campus in Donnybrook.  This was referenced in the NewERA report in 2014.  Much of the site is not used for broadcasting purposes with 21% used for car parking and 20% underdeveloped.  There is a resource available to RTE to deal with its own capital investment needs alongside having the ability to put aside a significant sum for programme commissioning.</p> <p>  These issues are dealt with in greater depth in the submission and the background research we have produced in DCU is also available to members.  Private broadcasters are sometimes referenced as the "competing commercial sector".  This limits their value and fails to acknowledge that RTE is a ruthless commercial entity, especially in how it chases ratings and advertising.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 needs to be amended to recognise that public service broadcasting is no longer the preserve of RTE and TG4.  Dealing with evasion and introducing a commercial television licence fee would be positive advances.  RTE should be encouraged to look at its own campus as an asset in addressing its own funding needs.  If a percentage of licence fee revenue is made available to privately owned stations to support, in particular, their news and current affairs programming, it is vital that updated broadcasting legislation is more explicit in requiring increased public service obligations from them.</p><p>I would say the same about RTE.  The committee has many items on its agenda, but if it can broaden the discussion on what we refer to as public service broadcasting, it would be a significant advance.  I thank members of the committee for the invitation to speak here this afternoon.  I am available to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Purcell" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22016112200002#C00200"><p>Professor Rafter has considerably shortened many of my remarks because I was going to perhaps labour the fact that we are public service broadcasters as well.  That is a very important point and a shift in the debate in that regard is important.  Much of the debate tends to be RTE-centric and we need to move beyond that because our members who represent the 34 independent stations have 66% of prime-time listenership in the country.</p> <p>  We welcome this debate at a crucial stage in Irish broadcasting.  We are approaching, if not on the precipice of, a tipping point.  We are frustrated.  Politicians have for years recognised the value of what we do but action has been scarce.  In the midst of a communications revolution we are mystified that there has been no action on broadcasting legislation, which is urgently required.  I am sure my colleagues in RTE would share the view that this debate is timely and there is an urgency about it.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion about what public service broadcasting is.  It should not be defined in terms of ownership structures, rather in terms of content.  The value to a democracy of public service broadcasting has been further emphasised by events in recent weeks and months.  Professor Rafter referred to journalism.  The importance of public service-type journalism is that it reflects the communities to which it broadcasts; is reliable, balanced and fair; and sees the broadcaster as a responsible member of the community rooted in the long-term interests of the community to which it broadcasts rather than simply accumulating clicks on a website and generating revenue.  These are characteristics beyond the "inform and educate" mantra that we have heard for years.</p> <p>  Regarding our obligations as public service broadcasters, much has been made in the debate over the years of RTE's statutory obligations.  However, independent broadcasters have detailed legislative obligations under the 2009 Act and also laid down in our broadcasting contracts.  The reality around the country is reflected in last Friday's broadcast schedule for Clare FM.  The print on the slide I am showing may be a bit small.  There was an outside broadcast from Ballyea; traditional music; coverage of local sport; and local discussion.  This is not competing with RTE or other broadcasters, but it is providing unique broadcasting to the area, which, if Clare FM were no longer in a position to provide it, would not be provided by anybody else.</p> <p>  The success of Irish independent radio and RTE is reflected in the JNLR results showing that 82% of the Irish population listen to radio on a daily basis.  In almost every county, the market leader is the local independent radio station.  We have compared those figures with RTE Radio 1 on a county-by-county basis.  For example, the share of the market in Waterford enjoyed by the local radio station is 38.8% compared with 18.4% for RTE Radio 1.  On this day, as we address the committee, one of the true stars of Irish radio, Billy McCarthy, was laid to rest.  The reaction in Waterford to his passing reflected the importance in which the radio station was held.  Virtually the entire community came to a standstill to honour the voice of Waterford, as he was known.</p> <p>  Every three months when the broadcast listenership figures are released, we hear about the top ten most listened to radio programmes in the country being largely RTE programmes.  However, in Carlow and Kilkenny, for example, during peak listening time between 10 a.m. and noon, "KCLR Live", which is our talk programme, has an audience of approximately 15,000, while its competitor on RTE Radio 1 has in the region of 5,000.  We believe that is because we supply content that is relevant to people; reflects their lives; covers the issues that concern them; responds to the issues they want to talk about; involves them; and gives them the opportunity to express themselves.</p> <p>  On a national basis, my next slide compares the morning broadcasts of RTE Radio 1 and Newstalk.  It is untenable to argue that one is public service and one is not.  The debate needs to reflect the reality that public service broadcasting goes across the spectrum.</p> <p>  We face many threats to the market.  The fallout could be an erosion of Irish culture and identity.  Professor Rafter referred to Noel Curran's remarks on how it is possible to spend an entire day without any Irish media input of one so wished.  It is essential to have a diverse, sustainable and viable Irish-based broadcasting sector with a strong RTE, and a viable and strong independent sector as well.  At the core of this is the funding model.</p> <p>  The recent BAI strategy statement placed sectoral sustainability at the core of what it wants to do.  If this means changing the legislation to increase our advertising time allowance to 12 minutes per hour rather than ten minutes per hour as it currently is, it will not work.  The threats are very real.  The independent radio station, TXFM, recently closed.  We need fundamental shifts in understanding and action.  We have been critical of inaction.  Based on our interaction with the Department we feel that its orientation continually focuses on the survival of RTE.  We need survival of the cross-sectoral radio industry.</p> <p>  We need to recognise the challenges and recognise that the solutions must be on a win-win basis for independent broadcasters and RTE.  Equally, where resources are at stake and funding is to be provided, accountability, transparency, value for money and clear commitments are essential.  That model has already been shown in the "sound and vision" scheme.  As Professor Rafter pointed out, there are limitations to that scheme, but it clearly shows how public money can be entrusted to private operators to provide public service broadcasting.</p> <p>  We have designed a model to fund public service broadcasting on independent stations.  We can provide a copy to members of the committee if they wish.  Taking all the arguments on board, we have related the public money specifically to the 20% news, current affairs and talk content that broadcasters are required to provide under current legislation and our contracts.  Ultimately, this will come from the licence fee.  We believe the collection of the licence represents the potential for approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;50 million in additional revenue.  Given that our members represent approximately 66% of the Irish radio industry, we believe a fund such as the one we have outlined needs to be adopted and we urge the committee to examine it.</p> <p>  Failure to act presents an appalling vista where there will be an erosion of use, influence, depth and quality of locally based media across radio and television that will lead to the lowest common denominator and the constant search for clicks and quick revenue.</p><p>We have been frustrated.  There is a funding crisis.  We believe that this will generate an editorial crisis, which will have deep negative impacts for Irish society.  We do not want to see the degradation of our sector and we are willing to be very constructive.  We have presented this scheme.  We have presented research over the years.  We are willing to be a very constructive partner but I would like to stress the urgency of the situation.  We look forward to working with the committee members.  We will be happy to take some questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by Screen Producers Ireland board member, Larry Bass.  Larry is CEO and founder of ShinAwiL productions, one of the largest independent production companies in Ireland.  We are delighted to be here this evening on behalf of Screen Producers Ireland to discuss funding for public service broadcasters, PSBs, and the nature of the relationship between independent producers and PSBs.</p> <p>  Screen Producers Ireland is the national representative organisation of independent film, television and animation production companies.  We promote the growth and sustainability of a working environment conducive to a strong independent production sector for our 130 members and for the industry as a whole.  Screen Producers Ireland members produce programmes such as "Vikings", "Room to Improve", "Red Rock", "Ros Na R&uacute;n", "Ear to the Ground", "Dragons Den" and "What are you Eating".  They have produced Oscar nominated films such as "Brooklyn" and "Room" and are also responsible for GAA and rugby coverage on TG4.</p> <p>  It is imperative that policy makers understand the importance of public service broadcasters to the independent production sector.  PSBs nurture growth within the sector and give our creative talent a platform to present their work.  Security of funding allows RTE to commission independent productions.  That, combined with Irish Film Board and BAI funding, ensures an active independent production sector which allows Irish producers to gain experience and skills.  RTE and TG4 act as incubators for Irish production talent.  TG4's operation as a publisher and broadcaster is particularly beneficial to regional independent producers.</p> <p>  The audiovisual sector is currently experiencing many disruptive challenges in the form of new technologies and changes in consumption patterns.  Viewing patterns are increasingly favouring on-demand content via Internet streaming over traditional cable viewing.  Ireland&rsquo;s public service broadcasters need to be adequately resourced to adapt to this new environment.  We are aware that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has stated that he will not be pursuing the introduction of a household media charge.  We believe that this is a misguided and short-sighted choice and urge the committee to recommend that the Minister reverse the decision.  The current TV licence fee is no longer fìt-for-purpose.  Consumers are moving from traditional television viewing to streaming content from digital platforms.  In 2009, 2.5% of Irish households did not own a TV.  That figure increased to 8% by 2015.  Additionally, Ireland has one of the highest TV licence fee evasion rates in western Europe.  It is currently estimated to be 13.7%, amounting to &euro;40 million in lost revenue per annum.  The Minister is seeking to address evasion but we are concerned that, even if evasion rates decline, the growing number of households opting to not own a TV will off-set any gains made.  In the five years between 2009 and 2014, the number of TV-free households grew by 5.5%.  If the trend continues the number of households who legitimately do not require a TV licence will almost equal the current evasion level by 2019.</p> <p>  The introduction of a household media charge is the ideal solution to the problem.  However, an alternative would be to amend Statutory Instrument 319 of the Broadcasting Act to expand the definition of a television set to include new screen technologies.  Screen Producers Ireland also believes we should move towards the European norm where PSBs are funded principally from licence fee or media charge revenue with little or no reliance on advertising and commercial revenues.  The current dual funding model leaves Ireland&rsquo;s PSBs open to significant fluctuations in their annual budget, creating uncertainty in the sector.</p> <p>  If our recommendations are to be implemented, and a household media charge and elimination of reliance on commercial income are introduced, then efficiencies and value for money must be a condition of the changes.  For that reason, we believe RTE should move towards the emerging trend of the publisher-broadcaster model.  That would be a better use of funding and would result in a greater volume of quality, original Irish programming.</p> <p>  In conclusion, the continued success of the Irish independent production sector is very reliant on a strong public broadcasting service.  Protecting PSBs is critical for preserving democracy, social cohesion and for providing a trustworthy platform for public debates and national conversations.  Their funding base must be protected and increased and that increase would have a positive knock-on effect on the indigenous production sector.</p></speech>

I also thank all the witnesses for their opening statements.  Before I go to members I have a number of questions.  The first is for Professor Rafter.  I wish to concentrate on his reference to the ability to go through an entire day browsing the web or watching television without using any of the Irish broadcaster services.  That is globalisation at its most obvious.  Could he outline the challenges that poses and explain whether they are all financial in terms of advertising?  Could he also expand on the print media and the possibility of affording some State funding to newspapers, which also provide a public service, and they now broadcast through the web by means of podcasting and website videos.  Advertising revenue is now moving to digital media at a very fast pace, which is causing huge problems for newspapers.</p> <p>  I note that the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, defined public service broadcasting in its presentation.  What programming can the market not support in terms of public service broadcasting?  Is there an accepted list or are there particular types of programming that cannot be supported?  Given the fact that advertising revenue is decreasing and moving to digital, am I correct in understanding that the IBI is essentially asking for more State funding?</p></speech>

In response to the question on the availability of public moneys for print media, and privately owned print media, there is an important distinction between broadcast and print and the statutory obligations on RTE, TG4 and the private broadcasters in terms of fairness, balance and impartiality.  Newspapers, as private entities, can adopt an editorial line as they so wish.  In terms of that distinction the defining line for me is why public money, through the licence fee, would not be available to the broad newspaper and print sector.  The argument I would make and that I put forward in the submission to the committee on expanding the availability of public money into news and current affairs coverage of private broadcasters is because of the importance of having a viable sustainable alternative to RTE.  The legislative underpinning of their output and the requirements through the Broadcasting Act 2009 and the regulatory guidelines that the BAI publish puts the broadcasters in a different place.</p> <p>  On the challenges in the sector, I will go back to my opening comment that all broadcasters in Ireland, irrespective of their ownership type, face funding challenges.  The closure of a significant player such as Newstalk would have a huge impact on democratic discourse in this country.  Likewise, we heard reference to Clare FM, or indeed any of the stations in the local areas of members.  They know the value of the local stations and what would be the effect of their closure.  In this debate we must be conscious that when we talk about public service broadcasting, public service media and public service content, it is no longer about RTE and TG4.  There are other players in this market and they have a value in terms of their public remit.</p> <p>  The audience needs to have local choice as well as global media such as Sky and Google and tweeting and Facebooking, as I referred to in my submission, but it also important that there is a sustainable and viable financial model in place.  If the conversation about public service broadcasting focuses exclusively on RTE and TG4 we are neglecting a huge amount of content and there is a responsibility on those who are looking at the 2009 Act, which is really not fit-for-purpose any more and does need to be revised.  There needs to be a broader definition of public service broadcasting.  The BAI in its annual and five-year reviews of public service broadcasting must cast its own net wider than RTE and TG4 in looking at content and to put it up to private broadcasters in the independent commercial sector.  There need to be very defined criteria and obligations on them if they are to receive increased licence fee money for news and current affairs output.</p></speech>

That is the most expensive part of the schedule to maintain.  It is also the most public service part of the schedule.  If you look across the water to the UK, a commercial radio station serving what we would consider to be a large urban area like Sheffield or Southampton may not have more than three or four staff, which would consist of somebody on sales and somebody managing syndicated content.  If the failure of the market and the failure of us to sustain news, current affairs and sports coverage happens because we can no longer afford it, it would mean that we would be looking towards syndicated models of programming.  What is at risk is the unique local flavour offered by stations like Clare FM, KCLR, Highland Radio or Midlands 103, which have fully developed and staffed broadcasting outlets in their local areas that reflect those areas.  I could run a music radio station with half the staff I have.  The half I would lose would consist of news, current affairs and sports, which is the rich content that provides the local identity and the public service content.</p></speech>

One of the contrasts between print and us is that most print media are paid for.  In contrast, radio as a medium is quite robust so audience levels have been largely unchanged for the past ten years.  Almost 90% of people tune into radio every day so it is a very strong and intensely local and personal medium.  The fundamental change that has taken place in the radio market is not an audience problem but a funding problem.  The funding problem is down to structural changes that have taken place in the market.  They are not temporary changes because advertising is a bit rocky this year.  They are structural changes that have seen a drift in revenue to digital media.  Digital has now overtaken television as a proportion of the revenue that is spent in the market.  The largest media in the market by revenue, let alone audience, are Google and Facebook.  Radio in 2016 will probably decline in revenue terms, whereas digital media like Google and Facebook will grow by double digit figures.  They will represent well over 30% of the market by the end of the year.  They are the challenges we face in funding news and current affairs programmes.</p></speech>

If we want to recognise that we have a culture and a nation, we need to fund our language and culture, which is represented in all types of programming like entertainment and arts programming, documentaries, drama and film.  All of it combines to give us a nation.  We were exporting literature before we ever had a nation.  If we are not going to invest in our future cultural exploits, we will not have a national culture to talk about.  There is a crisis of funding but it stretches right across radio, television and film.  Ireland has been well served by our cultural heritage but it will disappear if we cannot compete with the Googles, Facebooks and everything else that is encroaching and taking up space.  The debate is about funding and somebody needs to take it seriously.  It has not been taken seriously in these Houses for the best part of 20 or 30 years and we would like it to be taken seriously in the future.</p></speech>

Obviously, what they have provided us with will be helpful for us in reaching a determination.  We have a difficult job in that from the very start of his time in office, the Minister has indicated that he does not want to go down the broadcasting charge route.  He ruled it out from the start notwithstanding the fact that our party offered it to the Irish people as part of our manifesto.  It is something we believe in.  It is a way of addressing the funding shortage and the very significant level of non-payment of the licence fee.  While I welcome the initiative the Department is putting forward to try to get a better return, I remain to be convinced of the success of that.</p> <p>  In respect of public service broadcasting at this time, particularly in the context of what is now being referred to as the "post-truth" era, the provenance of content is hugely important with the advent of fake news, which is readily available on the various digital platforms.  Professor Rafter rightly identified the issue concerning the ability to go through a day, a week or perhaps a month without ever having access to any Irish content and feeling one has been informed as to what is happening domestically and throughout the world.  In that environment, the person could be largely dependent on Twitter or Facebook without having any access to knowledge about where it comes from, its probity or the extent of editorial management or control.  That is scary in a democracy where we are moving away from those norms that are protected on a legislative basis and where people know the provenance of content.  Much of the debate during previous committees and up to now has been a "them and us" debate - the independent or private commercial sectors versus RTE.  We all have a responsibility now to get our act together and see the threat to democracy that is afforded to certain vested interests if they wish to use digital media and platforms to convey values that do not concur with what most right-thinking people believe.  </p> <p>  The preservation and protection of public service broadcasting is really important - certainly to me and, I would imagine, to most people in this House.  It is about how we can get together and ensure that, collectively, we have a balanced approach to it.  For a long time, I have believed that includes the commercial private sector.  I often think the word "independent" is somewhat misleading.  I assume it only comes from the fact that these outlets are independent of RTE.  We need to get over this "us and them" mentality and call it what it is.  Of course, there are issues and concerns to be addressed about the commercial sector when you hear of large sums of money being paid for a television station and somebody buying two television stations.  It should not be beyond us to address that on a legislative basis without ending up in a situation where we have another Fox News-style channel.  An appropriate legislative base under the guidance of BAI could manage that scenario.  </p> <p>  It then comes down to money, which is where the questions will come from.  I have listened to what Mr. Purcell has said and I certainly think there is a basis for a very solid proposal there that can be worked on.  It is about where the money comes from.  It cannot be at the expense of RTE.  I had a chance to peruse what RTE will say later.  It does not have a lot of spare cash and certainly cannot afford to see a reduction in what it gets from the licence fee.  Could the witnesses guide us on where that additional-----</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming in.  They are a very talented group of people who have made a great contribution to Irish life and broadcasting.  At the end of the day, money is one of the biggest difficulties here.  What Ms Kenneally said about the drop in the actual number of people paying the licence fee is correct.  It is not only a question of non-collection, which is also a problem.  An Post administers collection for RTE.  The point is that people will not accept a new tax such as a charge on computers.</p><p>There is an in-between situation, whereby one can extend the Title and amend the legislation to provide for an alternative.  </p><p> If one is watching television on a computer, then one should pay the licence fee.  I do not know whether that requires a complete change.  Politically, at this point in time, given that the Government is in such a dicey position, it is not inclined to introduce any new charges.  It requires a strong Government to introduce charges and redistribute them to local broadcasters.  Shannonside is my local radio station.  We almost expect it to provide coverage of proceedings in Leinster House.  It provides more coverage than "Oireachtas Report".  I would suggest that "Oireachtas Report" does not understand what the Oireachtas means; that is, two Houses, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, which are entitled to equal coverage.  Committees should also be covered</p><p> Provision for a contribution has been discussed for a very long time, but that will not work unless we can control and work out a system of collecting funding for people who are availing of content.  I understand 5% fewer people now have televisions than in previous years, but they are receiving content on their computers.  It is clear to me that they should make an equal contribution to broadcasting, whether public or otherwise.</p><p> We have discussed this issue for years, but I ask that a contribution be provided to local radio for the purposes of coverage of news, current affairs and sport.  That is very important.  It is obvious that some property in Montrose will have to be sold.  Even selling that will only be a once off operation; it will not provide an annual return.</p></speech>

The ability of the Government to introduce a broadcasting fee has been covered.  Another factor must be considered, namely, that many low and middle-income households already face a significant burden in terms of increased charges, including insurance costs and so on.  The working poor would find it difficult to carry an increase in the licence fee, never mind whether it would be justified.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the views of the panel on what means and method of collecting the just under &euro;40 million that is lost through evasion of the licence fee should be used.  The money collected from the licence fee should go to commercial broadcasters.</p> <p>  I want the panel to address the question of content and the level and quality of coverage.  There may be an accepted view that public sector broadcasters such as RTE have better and more balanced coverage than commercial operators.  That is not my experience.  A study of the 2016 election coverage was carried out by Mr. Padraig O'Mara.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the panel on his findings. </p> <p>  There has been a deafening silence about the report.  I have not heard it being challenged, supported or anything else.  I am not in a position to question how accurate the study is; I have not had time to carry out an in-depth analysis of media coverage, but the report is available and I have not heard anybody shouting him down or saying that what he has found is rubbish.  In the case of RTE, the study found the overall coverage that the party I represent, Sinn F&eacute;in, received was about two-thirds of what the Labour at a party received and less than half of what Fine Gael received.  The Labour Party received more coverage than Fianna F&aacute;il in terms of overall coverage.  On a further analysis-----</p></speech>

The figures relating to Sinn Fein are about the thickness of the blade of a knife.  One can see that the amount of level of negative coverage is significant.  I am not picking on the Labour Party in particular, but the report covers the four major parties and until the election the Labour Party was still one of them.  That has changed.  The report shows that the level of positive coverage the Labour Party received was almost 80%, whereas almost 80% of the coverage Sinn F&eacute;in received was negative.  I would like to hear the views of the panel on that.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supporters pay the licence fee.  We would argue that we are entitled to the same coverage.  Of course, people, no matter what party they support, are entitled to hear the same level of coverage for the various parties.  What is also important is the level of positive and negative coverage, which should be balanced.  My experience has been that independent or commercial broadcasting is more balanced.</p></speech>

It is simple.  If there is no funding for public service broadcasting, there will not be a debate and the body politic and Ireland will not be well served.  If there is any particular issue, the Deputy can make a submission to the BAI, on whose board I sat, about fairness because that is part of the Act to which all broadcasters have to adhere.  There has been a very fair debate.</p> <p>  Ireland is one of very few countries in the world where prime-time current affairs television coverage of politics is still broadcast during prime-time hours five, six and seven days a week.  That is what serves the House and the future of Irish democracy very well.  We will not have that and it will be of little value if nobody is watching and we do not have other quality programming around that coverage.</p> <p>  Another issue I would like to put into the mix is that some homes in Ireland struggle to pay for television licences, but many pay for cable or satellite television packages, some of which cost in excess of &euro;100 per month.  The House could consider raising taxes through the application of VAT to a fund.  All of the money paid for cable and satellite television leaves Ireland and does not go into Irish content or stories for children in Ireland.  It certainly does not go into Irish radio, news and current affairs coverage. </p> <p>  It is in the gift of the House to examine how taxes are charged on fees paid in all homes.  People pay such broadcasting charges voluntarily.  They are not taxes, rather people volunteer to subscribe to television services, all of which involve money going out of the country.</p></speech>

Changing the name of the charge is not a substantive issue.<br/><br/>On Deputy Dooley's point about a them-and-us approach with regard to RTE, we entirely agree.  We believe that more unites rather than separates us.  In our discussions over the years with RTE we have found a lot of common ground in terms of its accepting our bona fides and <i>vice versa</i>- we recognise it has faced many legitimate issues and needs support.<br/><br/>On the question of whether money for the independent sector would come at the expense of RTE, I will hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>

Between eliminating evasion and avoidance and reducing collection costs, which are very high compared to other countries, perhaps about &euro;30 million or &euro;50 million is at play in terms of increased revenue.</p><p>As John Purcell said, that would provide for improving RTE's funding position as well as a fund.  The fund we have looked for is somewhere between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million which would go towards funding the 20%% news and current affairs portion of independent broadcasters.  That can be done without any increase in the licence fee to households.  It can be done just by eliminating evasion and avoidance and increasing collection costs.  That fund is very feasible.  There is also an alternative which is to revisit the sound and vision scheme.  Currently, only 5% of the sound and vision scheme goes to independent radio broadcasters.  The scheme was originally set up to benefit our sector but 95% of it goes to either television or to RTE or TG4.  That fund could also be changed.  However, the most viable approach is to set up a new separate fund.</p></speech>

RTE is a commercial broadcaster although it gets half of its funding from the licence fee.  Both the private and public sectors are independent.  Talking about them as private and public is more clear cut.  There is no doubt that the concept of a television licence fee has been undermined by changing consumption patterns driven by new viewing platforms and devices and it will have to be looked at.  It does not have a long-term future, but it still has a short-term one.  There is still in the region of &euro;180 million coming in.  The question is how one increases that pot for a win-win for both the public and private broadcasters.  In the short term, there are actions that can be taken at departmental and governmental level to increase the total amount of revenue.  An evasion level approaching 15% is unacceptable.  There has been talk of dealing with this for many years and the simplest short-term method is to have access to the names and addresses of the subscribers to digital television services to increase the pot of money.</p> <p>  There is value in a commercial licence fee.  Currently, we only have one type of licence fee which is payable and it covers all televisions in the same property.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the introduction of regulations on different classes of licences for residential and commercial premises.  The introduction of a commercial licence fee at a nominally increased sum above the current &euro;160 level would be a positive move.  Again, it would increase the pot of money.  The idea is to increase the pot of money to ensure that RTE, TG4 and the private broadcasters have greater resources available to make public service content.</p> <p>  On the question of RTE's finances, it cannot continue on a path defined exclusively by continuously cutting costs and pleading for increased licence fee support.  Something has to give in that space.  It is sitting on a huge asset.  The campus in Donnybrook needs to be looked at.  RTE has serious capital investment needs and has within its own remit the ability to deal with some of its current funding issues.</p> <p>  On the question of balance in coverage, I can provide the committee with a number of studies we have done in DCU on political coverage.  One in particular looks at the 2011 general election exclusively in terms of RTE and its allocation of broadcast time across the different political parties.  This is a long-standing issue of tension between broadcasters and politicians.  The study shows the positive endeavours the broadcaster made to ensure that there was balance across the different political parties proportionate to their support and sets out the matrix it used to allocate broadcast time during the general election.  That was also replicated in the 2016 election.  Those obligations for balance in coverage apply also to the private broadcasters.</p></speech>

It is an area in which I have a particular interest having worked in media for a number of years myself.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts around regional film funds and their scope to create employment in the regions rather than to have everything so Dublincentric?  Obviously, we have a burgeoning film industry in the west which has been helped by the development of TG4 and other initiatives.  Certainly, the regions need employment to be created in the regions as much as possible.  A number of other countries in Europe have been very successful at developing film and broadcasting funds.  Are there any thoughts around the regional film industry?</p></speech>

I was attending the Chamber for another debate.  Everyone in the Oireachtas agrees that we need to support content creation in RTE and the commercial, independent broadcasters.  We value, as Mr. Larry Bass said, the fact that five nights a week we have proper debate from our broadcasters and we want to protect and advance that.  I agree that it is not a question of RTE versus the other broadcasters or even print media as well.  In our earlier meeting with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the Department, some interesting figures were set out.  I understand that approximately &euro;330 million in advertising revenue is now going to the likes of Google and Facebook.  Is Facebook a broadcaster in some way?  What is its role in this whole story of how we support content creators?  Similarly, as Professor Rafter said, there is a significant volume of money going to the cable companies or satellite broadcasters who can insert advertising without any regulation here.  They are in this picture rather than it just being a fight internally among content producers in the Irish broadcasting industry.</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear reflections on a view set out at our previous meeting.  While there are marginal changes we need to make on the level of evasion and in perhaps imposing a charge on some of the cable providers or other telecommunications companies to cover the cost, it may be time to look at a change in the system itself rather than to continue to tie up loose ends.  I do not know exactly what mechanism would be involved and whether one would tie it to a property charge so that it was easier to collect or if it would be part of some other collection system.  Do any of the witnesses have a perspective on a forum early in the new year to look at those options in an informal way?  It would not just be here in the committee where it is hard to do it but would rather be a way to informally bring together different industry participants to look at options in that slightly more radical assessment of how we fund content providers rather than just seeing it as a marginal change to the current system.  That is one of the processes the committee can initiate in conjunction with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the Department.  It is to think slightly outside the box.</p></speech>

On the general broadcasting charge issue to which Deputy Eamon Ryan was just referring, the figures Professor Rafter brought here today suggest the lost revenue is approximately &euro;30 million on a 13% to 15% evasion rate.  If that is brought down by two thirds to British levels, there is &euro;20 million to be gained.  That is a fairly limited amount of money, all things considered.  Evasion does not seem to be the big issue unless someone has other concepts in mind.  It strikes me that the cost of recovery is an issue.  If one looks at that &euro;180 million and divides it by the number of households or domestic units in Ireland, of which there are perhaps 2 million to 2.5 million, one is talking about &euro;90 to &euro;110 each.</p><p>In that context it might be more sensible to collect it as part of the local service or property charge and simply take it away rather than doing that.</p><p> When Mr. Purcell refers to a differential commercial rate, is he talking about anything different from pubs, restaurants and hotels?  Will there be a charge per hotel room or per screen in a pub?  I am fully conscious of the fact that publicans pay a lot of money to provide Sky or BT Sport.  I do not feel too sorry for them but I would like some flesh put on those bones.</p></speech>

As regards the type of licence fee, we are talking about the collection method and it is up to the committee to examine a variety of options.  If we move away from the self-collection method and it was rolled up as part of a new broadcast or household charge, it would be possible to have a 100% collection because it is automatically deducted like property tax or other charges.  None of these measures in themselves solve all of the problems the broadcasting sector faces.  In the short term, however, they increase the pot of money.  That at least allows programming on public and private sector stations to be enhanced.  The licence fee concept is going to be overtaken eventually, but it is still there and is generating a lot of money at the moment.  However, the pot of money can be increased by a number of measures that are within the remit of these Houses to deal with.  I encourage the committee to examine them.</p> <p>  Goggle and Facebook have been referred to.  I was in the company of the head of Google News at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication in Arizona 18 months ago.  There was a fascinating presentation about what it does but it does not employ a single journalist; it is all algorithms and computer scientists.  We do not want to get to a situation whereby we do not have journalists going to the local courthouse, council meeting or this Parliament.  Our democracy needs viable journalism, news and current affairs coverage both on private and public stations.  That is why this conversation, as well as the committee's deliberations and recommendations are so important.</p></speech>

We are all open to that as we are a creative industry.  It concerns the ability to bring about new ways of funding. We are all open to doing that in another form.  The VAT rate in tourism was reduced to allow the sector to recover.  One could take the VAT rate on those particular services and then redistribute the funds.</p> <p>  As regards regional film funds, who will put the money in?  Irish film needs more money and Irish broadcasters need to support Irish film more strongly.  If it is locally available it will be guaranteed to be spent locally, which is how it operates around the world.  We all support that.  In terms of other ways of making the RTE money go further, TG4 is a shining light as a public broadcaster.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that it should not have any commercials at all.  That aspect is so small in terms of TG4's income that it should have an increased Exchequer fee and be commercially free like the BBC.  TG4 would generate more viewers that way.  Equally, if RTE could move towards being more of a publisher-broadcaster, the independent sector could fulfil the role of more programming.</p> <p>  When the cuts came, as they did through the crash, the spend in the independent sector fell from &euro;80 million to &euro;40 million.  We therefore took a 50% cut, have not recovered and it is getting tougher.  The independent sector has taken its fair share of cuts but it can certainly build up and supply the content at a very high level.  Film producers are putting Ireland on the map not just locally but also globally with their ability to gain Oscar nominations and Oscars.  With Creative Ireland, of which we are part, we can address these funding issues collectively.  </p></speech>

The invitation is timely, as the issue is pressing and important for us all.</p> <p>  Media organisations in Ireland are under very serious financial strain.  RTE, with its broad remit and reliance on commercial revenue to cover 50% of the cost of fulfilling its remit, is no different.  In Ireland's case, the reasons for the financial challenges facing media organisations are multifaceted, with some specific to us and some consistent with trends across the developed world.  Most of the challenges facing the media industry are for us to meet.  The digital age is dramatically changing audience behaviour and expectations.  Audiences now expect and can access the media they want free of charge when they want them on multiple devices.  The Internet is powering all of this change and as broadband speeds increase and the price decreases, the pace of change will increase.</p> <p>  Digital advertising is the fastest growing category of advertising globally.  The move towards digital advertising was an obvious strategy for traditional media companies as they built their online services.  This has been greatly complicated by the emergence and dominance of social media services.  Facebook and Google together take approximately 80% of global digital advertising revenues, while investing almost nothing in original journalism, programming or content.  Their entire business models are built on selling targeted advertising around the work of others, with little or no compensation for the original producer.</p> <p>  Like the rest of the developed world, audiences in Ireland have embraced new video-on-demand entrants like Netflix and Amazon and new on-demand services from Sky, Virgin Media and others.  So far, broadcast television and radio services have been more resilient than other media types against this digital disruption.  Notwithstanding the advent of all this new technology, the consumption of linear broadcast television and radio services remains high among the population as a whole, even if it is shrinking somewhat among younger audiences.  Despite much of the hype coming from the digital media industry, around 90% of all television viewing in Ireland is of live television, with an average viewing period of three hours and seven minutes per day.  The figures show that over 80% of people in Ireland listen to the radio for an average of almost four hours per day.  That amounts to over seven hours on average per person every day spent in consuming the so-called dying media.</p> <p>  The competition for audiences and revenue among broadcasters in Ireland is fierce.  Among television broadcasters, it has increased massively.  RTE has always had to compete with the best funded commercial and public service broadcasters in the world.  Sky, the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV channels have been accessible to the majority of homes in Ireland for many years.  The purchase of Virgin Media by Liberty Global and the subsequent takeover by Virgin Media of both TV3 and UTV Ireland mean that all national commercial television channels in Ireland are owned by one highly resourced international media organisation.  This will bring new commercial competition for RTE, although it is not yet clear if this new dispensation will lead to significant increased investment in Irish programming or commissions from the independent production sector in Ireland. </p> <p>  The commercial radio market has seen similar consolidation.  Ownership of that market is now dominated by Denis O'Brien's Communicorp and, most recently, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.  Between them, they own both national commercial talk radio stations, one regional licence and eight local commercial stations.  Combined, they retain an audience share of over 30% of all adults and a considerably higher share of younger listeners.  Both organisations also retain significant interests in other media properties in Ireland.</p> <p>  While increased choice benefits audiences in Ireland, the growth of the phenomenon of TV opt-out advertising has been much less beneficial.  Enabled by the European Single Market, 50 channels sell advertising in Ireland.  As many as 39 are wholly international, largely UK, channels that invest little or nothing in Irish content.  Combined, they take &euro;50 million from the advertising market in this country, nearly one quarter of all Irish television advertising revenue.  While RTE operates with half of the advertising minutage of its commercial rivals, it has always met these competitive threats head on.  By European standards, it retains a healthy share of the audience for both radio and television services.  As somebody who has worked in the international television sector for 20 years, the quality of much of RTE's programming stands up to the best in the world.  Frankly, offering choice means that it must do so.  In 2016, in particular, this quality was showcased with a range of unique cultural and creative content to mark the centenary commemorations, as well as the general election, Euro 2016, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the six nations rugby championship and the GAA championships.  However, the creative and journalistic challenges never stop.  RTE must continue to challenge itself, take risks and innovate if it is to maintain its relevance and sustain its connection with the public.   That is the challenge for it. </p> <p>  The appetite for quality has not diminished with the arrival of much greater choice.  With investing in new digital channels and services, as RTE has done in the past few years, making creative and distinctive programming ultimately offers the best opportunity to meet the increasing competition.  The key focus of RTE will always be investment in high quality Irish programming, Irish storytelling and Irish journalism.  That is what makes it distinctive for audiences in Ireland.  In any given year RTE produces or commissions approximately 80% of Irish television programming.  Simply put, without its investment in programming, Ireland would be just another television market dominated by UK and US programming, much like what happens in Canada.  There is a cost ratio of over 20:1 between home produced and acquired programming.  Therefore, the fewer resources RTE has the less distinctively Irish its schedules become, the less programming it can commission from the independent production sector and the less commercially viable its becomes as a dual funded public service media organisation.</p><p>Along with the creative and journalistic challenges, the commercial challenge is ever present.  While digital expansion and increasing competition amplify the commercial challenges, they have been made much more difficult by Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic difficulties and the current uncertainty thrown up by unpredicted political events.  Advertising has improved over the past couple of years, but Brexit is now having a direct impact.  Television advertising has been severely hit both here and in the UK.  Just last week, the<i>Financial Times</i>reported that ITV is blaming uncertainty over a hard or soft Brexit for a sharp drop in advertising revenues, which it warned could fall by as much as 7% in the final quarter of this year.  As yet, the impact of a Trump presidency is unknown but at the very least it is creating further uncertainty.<br/><br/>As RTE's financial retrenchment since 2008 has been well documented, I do not plan to go into it now.  I have added as an appendix to my written submission a couple of charts which tell a clear story of RTE&rsquo;s cost reductions over the past few years.  We can discuss this in more detail if the committee wishes.  However, the committee needs to be aware that we are currently significantly underinvesting in key areas of output due to our very tight financial position.  Drama, arts and culture output, foreign news and children&rsquo;s programming are all areas that we want to strengthen.  Of course, RTE must continue, like any business, to reduce costs, and we will, but we now do not have enough resources to remain competitive or, in the longer term, relevant, let alone be the engine that drives the broader Irish creative economy.  <br/><br/>It is important for the committee to understand that it is not just RTE saying this.  All the independent reviews that have been conducted over the past few years confirm this reality.  These reviews have been comprehensive.  They analysed, internationally benchmarked and reviewed in detail almost every aspect of what RTE does and how it does it.  As the committee will be aware, a number of very clear conclusions and recommendations have emerged from this review period.  RTE has been judged to be efficiently run against best international benchmarks and the scope for further cost reductions is limited.  Given the complex dynamics in the Irish media market, Indecon has concluded that RTE is likely to continue to lose market share over the next four to six years, limiting its capacity to significantly grow commercial revenue in the medium term.  The BAI has recommended that public funding to RTE should be increased in both its five-year review and more recent annual reviews.  NewERA also recommended that consideration be given to increasing public funding to RTE.  As concluded by Crowe Horwath, RTE must invest more in digital services to sustain and enhance its public service contribution in the medium to longer term and NewERA echoes this view.  NewERA suggested that options regarding the use in part or whole of the RTE site in Donnybrook should be explored as a source of funds for capital investment.<br/><br/>RTE would agree with each of these observations and recommendations but where does all this leave us?  My predecessor, on the anniversary of 50 years of Irish television a couple of years ago, stated that this sector was at a crossroads and that policy makers had to act or much was at risk of being lost.  His call was not listened to.  There has been little or no action and there has, until today at least, been little serious public discussion with policy makers about what should and could be done or, indeed, what is even at risk.  While I therefore very much welcome today&rsquo;s discussion and hope it can lead to some real decisions and action, the question is, what decisions?  There are market interventions that are worth considering.<br/><br/>The Department, as reported recently, appears to be looking at ways of addressing the impact of opt-out advertising and this is welcome.  Any intervention that could increase investment of commercial revenues into Irish programming and the independent production sector in Ireland would be very welcome.  Similarly in other markets, such as France in particular, there have been moves to introduce levies on distributors and telecommunications companies to support public funding of public service media.  Changes to the must-offer-must-carry and copyright legislation, which we understand the Government is currently considering, will potentially level the playing field in negotiations between broadcasters and platforms, which should lead to much fairer compensation arrangements between them.<br/><br/>There is also great scope for reform of public funding.  The current television licence fee system is no longer fit for purpose.  Evasion currently stands at around 15% and the number of homes classified as &quot;no TV homes&quot; for the purposes of the television licence fee stands at around 8%.  In aggregate this results in more than &euro;50 million per year lost to public service media and, therefore, to the creative industries in this country.  This is a huge loss to Irish programming and to potential jobs in the independent production sector.  While RTE continues to hold the view that a household-based licence decoupled from any device, as has been introduced recently in Germany, is the most sensible solution, there are other reforms to the current system which could dramatically improve performance.  These include tendering the collection agent contract, rebuilding the television licence database and removing the outdated television set exemptions.  The UK, which had a very similar system to Ireland, has shown that a series of integrated reforms can lead to dramatic improvements in collection performance.  Budget 2017 saw a welcome partial unwinding of direct cuts to RTE&rsquo;s public funding that happened during the recessionary period.  In budgets 2011 and 2014, cuts totalling &euro;20 million were made to RTE&rsquo;s funding and while &euro;6 million was reinstated in budget 2017, which was very welcome, more is needed here.  <br/><br/>Any of these interventions are predicated on the assumption that policy makers believe that public service media is something worth sustaining and enhancing.  I am conscious of the human difficulty for politicians in reconciling the need to increase investment in RTE, no matter how compelling the argument, and the role that RTE has in questioning, challenging and investigating all those in public life.  I am conscious too that there are arguments for allocating public funding to organisations other than RTE.  Notwithstanding their private ownership and commercial purposes, clearly other media organisations perform elements of public service, whether that be commercial radio stations or local and national newspapers.  RTE would welcome a discussion on these issues and will argue the case for independent public media.  All I ask is that we move these discussions forward.  The time for endless reviews has passed.What we need now is action.  <br/><br/>Inaction will have far-reaching consequences for journalism, for national cultural expression and, most alarmingly, for public debate and politics.  David Remnick, the editor of the <i>New Yorker </i>magazine, noted last week that we now live in a collapsed media structure that has caused us to live in our own silos of reality.  Social media, highly commercial and market focused multi-platform news channels and the financial strain on traditional media organisations, including public service media, are eroding the very notion of a trusted public space that is impartial and balanced.  At its best, public service media provide a compelling response to the challenges and opportunities of the digital era, to the changes and challenges of fragmenting societies and to the growing public disconnection from institutions.  In a world increasingly dominated by international media and content, strong indigenous public service media are essential if we are to support and preserve vibrant local cultures and distinctive identities.  We need the resources to do all of these things well and to protect all that is important.  </p></speech>

To those of us who have experienced public service broadcasting in more than one European country, it is clear that Ireland has been very well served, both culturally and democratically by its public service broadcasting services.</p> <p>  Economically, as displayed in the recent UK public and political debate on the future of the BBC, public service broadcasters have a key role in stoking the engine of audio-visual creativity.</p><p>In a globalised world of content, skills and successful programming are increasingly tradeable and traded and the new BBC Royal Charter puts all of the British television sector in very strong position to exploit this global market.  The television producers association, PACT, estimates that the UK television production sector has revenues of &pound;3 billion and that international TV revenues grew at a rate of 13.4% in 2015.  However the biggest source of revenue for the UK&rsquo;s production companies remains their primary UK commissions, underlining the importance of public service broadcasting, PSB, as the major driver for the creation of international revenues.</p><p> As recognised in the 2009 Broadcasting Act, TG4 occupies a central space in the PSB landscape in Ireland.  TG4 operates as a publisher-broadcaster, a model which allows us to combine creativity, audience-focus, and nimbleness.  The great majority of TG4's Irish-made programmes are commissioned from independent production companies throughout Ireland and TG4 spends 90% of its annual programme budget on independent production, that was &euro;21.2 million in 2015 and the figure increased in 2016.  In 2017 we intend to increase our out-of-house production spend and to take measures to encourage stability and development in the independent sector.</p><p> There are 200,000 people, of all ages, who live in the Republic of Ireland and speak Irish on a daily or weekly basis outside of the school environment.  This audience displays a full expectation that TG4 will serve them a range of programmes that is as deep, broad and rich as English-speakers in Ireland would expect from RTE One or that British viewers would expect from BBC One.  News, drama and light entertainment are the genres most valued by our core audience.</p><p> However from its first day of broadcasting in 1996, TG4 has made clear that, in the same way as the Irish language belongs to all of the people of Ireland, TG4 will seek to appeal to all audiences in Ireland at certain points of the day and of the week.  Audiences with less fluent Irish, or no Irish at all value TG4&rsquo;s programming very highly.  The largest numbers of this national audience come to us for the genres of music, factual and sport.</p><p> It is easy in any debate around the funding of public service broadcasting, to push matters of minority language to the edge of the focused agenda - a single bullet point, a hermetically sealed topic that does not impinge on the major questions regarding broadcasting.  This marginalisation has not happened in Wales and the result has been that Cardiff now finds itself, along with London and Manchester, at the centre of a global creative industry.  The drama skillset honed during the decades of production of Welsh language drama for S4C was key to the decision by the BBC to produce worldwide drama such as "Doctor Who" in Cardiff.  Only countries and regions with a strong domestic television market will bring their skills to the level that allows them break into global markets.</p><p> Reports commissioned by the BAI over the last years give clear evidence that TG4 cannot sustain further cuts to its funding.  We need to create sustainability in our baseline content funding which is at present very far below that of S4C, the Welsh-language channel, and risks, under the new BBC Royal Charter, falling below that of BBC ALBA, the Scots Gaelic channel.</p><p> We are very ambitious for TG4 because we believe that being ambitious for TG4 is being ambitious for Ireland&rsquo;s culture and for Ireland&rsquo;s democracy.  The funding of public service broadcasting lies at the heart of how that ambition can be enabled.  We are most grateful to receive this opportunity to contribute to this public conversation on the funding of public service broadcasting, PSB and see TG4 as a unique asset which lies at the centre of that debate.</p><p> Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I am sure everybody is aware of the feature film "Song of the Sea", which was nominated for an Academy Award in the best animation feature film category last year.  Both "Room" and "Brooklyn" were nominated for best feature films this year.  This shows the strength and depth of Irish creative talent in the feature film sector.  It is vitally important that the Irish Film Board emphasises that this is a result of the years of investment in creativity and the development of Irish creative talent.  The primary concern of the Irish Film Board is that it continues to invest in that talent.  </p> <p>  The Irish Film Board is very pleased to see that 2016 was a great success in the way in which the importance of culture was placed at the centre of Irish thinking and society.  The strength of culture and media content was brought to the fore by public service broadcasters and in particular by the work that RTE undertook during the commemorations.  We in the Irish Film Board believe strongly that this legacy is something than can be built on and can bring a greater sense of Irish culture and creativity to the country.  We would be very excited to see the country take advantage of this opportunity to advance this legacy.  </p> <p>  The funding of the Irish Film Board was increased this year, which was welcome, however there is a long way to go before the funding is restored to the levels we were at previously.  Equally, we believe it is very important that a resolution be arrived at in respect of the funding of public service broadcasting.  This applies to both RTE and TG4, because of their relationship with film makers, the creators of screen content.  The the Irish Film Board supports feature film makers, the development of TV drama, the development and production of TV animation and would like to see all these sectors supported to a much greater extent by public service broadcasters.  However public service broadcasters can only do that if they are provided with the additional funding which they need in order to achieve that really great contribution to creativity and to the strength of talent that is undoubtedly there and which has been proven to be there.  The Irish Film Board needs to create a situation where investment is made.  It is our experience that only with investment in creative talent, which the Irish Film Board has done for many years that the success can continue to be achieved.  That is very important.</p> <p>  We were consulted on the importance of section 481 as the tax investment for feature film, TV drama and TV animation production.  In Ireland the Irish Film Board estimates that as much as &euro;200 million of eligible expenditure occurred on feature films, TV drama and TV animation alone in 2015 primarily as a result of section 481.  As a result significant levels of international investment was brought to Ireland, for example, very major TV series, such as "Penny Dreadful" and now a major AMC TV series "Into the Badlands" are being made in Ireland as a result of these incentives.</p><p>We have the rich creation of jobs for cast and crew members and creative talent across the board as a result of this investment.  We emphasise the major importance of section 481.  We believe that in 2016 expenditure will increase to something in the order of &euro;240 million plus.  It will mostly be driven by projects funded from the international market.</p></speech>

The important thing to say is that the independent production sector is a strong and well-resourced sector, which is well able to benefit from international income and local investment in terms of supporting Irish creative talent.  It is really important that continues.</p> <p>  I said earlier that it was important that the relationship also exists with public service broadcasters and that they are able to invest in creative talent, in particular in the areas of feature film and TV drama animation and, in particular, to spend the money that is needed, above all else, for projects involving development funding.  It is the lifeblood of the creative sector - it is the equivalent of research and development funding in other areas, and we all know the importance of that in areas like software, pharmaceuticals and everything else.  One must spend money and invest in talent to enable talent to succeed locally and generate income internationally.  It is really important to emphasise the importance of development funding.</p> <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs recently commissioned a report on the audiovisual sector.  The consultants who have been appointed in respect of that report started work this week and will examine the audiovisual sector as a whole.  It is hoped they will publish a report in the second quarter of next year.  This is something that will help to contribute to how best to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for media production on the world stage.</p> <p>  We already show our skills and strengths in this area.  Some of the largest TV drama series in the world are made in the Republic of Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland.  For example, "Penny Dreadful" was made in the Republic of Ireland and we all know about "Game of Thrones" in Northern Ireland.  Ireland as an island is very successful in terms of its capacity to undertake major TV drama production.  In terms of job creation, it is a major success for us. </p> <p>  We emphasise the need to continue to invest in Irish creative talent and tax incentives that support international production.  We are competing in a world where most other countries have those kinds of incentives.  With the audiovisual sector report, there is a real opportunity to examine how best to move forward on capitalising on the strength of the creative talent we have in screen content production in Ireland.</p> <p>  Given that we are discussing public service broadcasting, I again emphasise that public service broadcasting should be supported sufficiently.  Not only is it important in terms of news and current affairs, but it is very important as the basis of Irish creativity, culture, storytelling and creativity, whether live action, animation or TV drama.  All those things are as important as news and current affairs in terms of public service broadcasting.  We want to make sure that the emphasis on those areas is maintained because they are the areas supported by the Irish Film Board - we want Irish creative talent in screen content.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions before I call on members.  I will start with the Irish Film Board.  I ask Mr. Hickey to flesh out the proposal with regard to contributions or levies on broadcasters and other content users in terms of funding the Irish Film Board.  How does that work internationally?  Are there any comparisons?</p> <p>  I note the reference in the submission to Film4 and BBC Films.  Is there a suggestion that there be a comparable station in Ireland?</p> <p>  I refer to TG4 and Irish broadcasters.  Reference was made to how they could co-operate better.  I ask Mr. Hickey to elaborate on that, with particular reference to serving young audiences in, as he put it, a non-linear world.</p><p> With regard to RTE and Ms Forbes's reference to the recommendation made in NewERA's report that consideration be given to use of part of the Donnybrook site to raise funds for capital investment, have plans for sale of the site been advanced and, if not, what is the current position?  </p><p> Is Ms Forbes committed to the continuation of "Oireachtas Report" and not reducing the length of the programme?</p><p> On the financial position in 2016 and RTE's coverage of the Olympics Games and the 1916 Rising commemorations, for which there was advance planning, perhaps Ms Forbes might expand on what happened in 2016 that caused the deterioration in the financial position?  </p><p> Reference was made to the television licence no longer being fit for purpose.  I would welcome Ms Forbes' views, or those of any of the other delegates, on the commercial television licence fee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22016112200002#P00200"><p>I am happy with the responses thus far from TG4 and the Irish Film Board, but I would like to put a couple of questions to the RTE representatives.  </p> <p>  Recognising the growth of social media across the digital platform and the real threat this poses to the principles of public sector broadcasting, namely, fairness, balance and impartiality, it is incumbent on all broadcasters, public and private, together with legislators, to move quickly to address the challenge.  Ms Forbes posed that question to us in the context of her reference to what had been said by her predecessor.  She appeared to be indicating that there had been a lack of action by all of us collectively in that regard, but perhaps I am wrong and she was suggesting there had been a lack of action on the part of legislators.  My response is that there is a need for a greater level of engagement between all concerned, including on the ambition and vision in a business plan for how RTE would propose to spend the funding that obviously needs to be made available.  I recall the report of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which referenced the need for greater ambition on the part of RTE in identifying ways to grow and take on challenges.  The report was considered by the committee, but it is for legislators to assist in considering the funding model to be used.  From my point of view and that of the party I represent, we will not be found wanting in that regard.  </p> <p>  I refer Ms Forbes to her statement that she is conscious of the human difficulty for politicians in reconciling the need to increase investment in RTE, regardless of how compelling the argument is, with its role in questioning, challenging and investigating all those involved in public life.  I can assure her that whatever the role of RTE in investigating anybody involved in public life, that will not guide us in supporting public sector broadcasting.  Politicians of all colours are well able to differentiate between the role of RTE in providing an investigative journalistic platform and its role as a public service broadcaster.  I am not sure how Ms Forbes might be informed by that comment.  I have not heard anything in the committee's discourse with RTE that would lead me to believe that has been an issue or in any way an encumbrance in our support of RTE and ensuring it receives appropriate funding.  There has been the lack of an appropriate vision and ambitious planning on the part of RTE, taking into account the challenges faced by it, but it is a matter for it to develop such a plan.  As I acknowledge Ms Forbes has only recently taken on her role, at this stage she might not have a plan in place, but I suspect that on the next occasion she appears before the committee it will be and that it will set out her vision for RTE, taking account all of the challenges it faces.</p> <p>  On funding, Ms Forbes has identified some welcome ideas.  Has consideration been given to the introduction of levies to be imposed on distributors in telecommunications companies similar to those which are applicable in other markets?  For example, has consideration been given to the imposition of levies on Facebook and Twitter or does Ms Forbes see them as being within the mix of distributors, although I accept that they are not telecommunications companies?  In other words, does she see potential in levying social media platforms?  Also, when does she expect to be in a position to bring a plan before the committee which would assist it in its deliberations on a proper funding model for RTE?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22016112200002#P00300"><p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for coming.  I congratulate Ms Forbes on her appointment as director general.  She has a tough task ahead of her.  I also welcome Mr. Alan Esslemont, chief executive of TG4, and his team which is doing a fantastic job.</p> <p>  What is the future of RTE 2, given the current funding position?  The committee is also concerned about the position on local radio broadcasting.  Local radio stations provide a tremendous service throughout Ireland.  They are very accessible.  </p> <p>  An issue of concern to most politicians is the content of "Oireachtas Report".  While it provides coverage of proceedings in the D&aacute;il, it often excludes coverage of proceedings in the Seanad.  I have been a Member of both Houses.  </p> <p>  On the sale of part of the Donnybrook site, I presume the RTE studios would remain on the site.  </p> <p>  On the licence fee, I am always amazed by the fact that small pubs are required to pay the same annual fee of &euro;160 as larger pubs such as Wetherspoon, despite the fact that in the case of the latter, the properties involved are often 20 times greater in size, and that a hotelier pays the same fee as a householder.  While the rate of VAT was reduced for the hospitality sector from 13% to 9%, there has been no return in that regard as far as RTE or anybody else is concerned, but I do not propose to engage in a "Today Tonight"-type investigation with the delegation.  </p> <p>  The committee is very pleased with what is being done by RTE and TG4.  TG4 provides tremendous content in terms of documentaries and so on.  RTE is the flagship company and all Irish people are proud of it.  Programmes such as "The Meaning of Life" hosted by Mr. Gay Byrne, whom I wish a speedy recovery to good health, in which he recently engaged with the Papal Nuncio to Ireland, Archbishop Charles Brown, indicate the quality of Irish broadcasting and justify the level of expenditure in respect of the licence fee.  The more money that is raised the better for RTE and other local broadcasters.  In that regard, there is a need for a better collection system and a recognition that people are opting not to have a television set and instead watching programmes on computer screens and so on.  I agree that people are paying massive amounts per month to Sky and other providers.</p></speech>

I worked in Britain for the past ten years.  To an extent, broadcasters in the United Kingdom are beginning to acknowledge that while they need to compete on content, they should co-operate in the use of infrastructure.  There has been talk of the BBC iPlayer being turned into an open iPlayer in order that there would be one deep well of digital content in which people would be able to access British content.  In other words, one would be able to access programmes on the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 in the same place.</p><p>It would add to the passing traffic.  They have done it because they realise the competition is Facebook and Netflix.  It is not the BBC against ITV any more.  In the same way radio has done a great job creating a single player, if we can hold onto our brands but create a shared digital space, it would be good, especially for younger people.  Young Irish speakers want to do the normal thing.  If the normal thing is to go to a place that is mainly English, we will lose a hold on this audience.  Co-operation can help with all audiences, especially young audiences.</p></speech>

Funding is going on at EU level.  The audiovisual media services directive is on its way through the legislative process.  As I mentioned in my submission, it provides for levels and prominence of European works in digital media services and for levies and contributions from those services for indigenous screen content.  It is the French model.  In France, screen content is funded through various means.  It goes back to the days of levies on cinema seats and DVDs.  It is now up to levies on Internet service providers.  Screen content is funded through those levies.  While it is a French system, it also exists in Germany and other EU countries.</p> <p>  Our Irish Film Board Strategic Plan 2016-2021 specifically suggests we continue "working with European Film Agency Directors on the development of EU policies on film and screen content, including initiatives on the Digital Single Market (DSM), the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and directives in relation to copyright and e-commerce".  This is the area we are in.  One of the major issues is country of origin.  Under current country of origin rules, only the country where the service provider is located can regulate the party.  However, a proposed change under the audiovisual media services directive would allow a country which is targeted by a service from a country into another country to consider putting levies or contributions on the service.</p> <p>  In an Irish context, it is a very important discussion which needs to be had.  It needs to be investigated further and I urge the committee to investigate what is being done at European level and how it would impact on issues such as opt-out advertising regarding the services that come from the UK.  They are not digital services, strictly speaking, but there could be a way of examining it.  These are areas the committee could explore.</p> <p>  BBC Films and Film4 are operations within the BBC and Channel 4.  They fund feature films instead of television programmes.  Most European countries have film funding arrangements with public services broadcasters which are regulated in a particular way.  Ireland should follow suit.  In my world, if there were an RTE film organisation within RTE, I would welcome it.  This depends on RTE's funding, and it brings us back to the discussion on funding and the licence fee.</p> <p>  The concept of an Irish film channel was in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  We must consider the fact that technology has significantly overtaken where we were in 2009 and we must re-evaluate how best to re-examine the proposal in light of the development in technology.</p></speech>

Saorview has been a growing platform and is a great success story.  We would love to continue to do that, however we need to speak more with the committee and decide how best to cover the broadcast, particularly in light of the digital generation, and how we can best serve the information to another generation.  We are committed to it and how we do it needs to be examined.  We must engage a wider public.</p></speech>

Ms Deirdre McCarthy has already been in discussions with some people here around it.  It is about sitting down and discussing the best way of doing it.

It is well known, and mentioned in the NewERA report, that during the period when we had to constrain our finances, we have had to curtail capital investment.  The one area we have not curtailed is our digital terrestrial television, DTT, investment.  We invested more than &euro;60 million in DTT, and it was very important in releasing an important digital dividend for Ireland.  Notwithstanding that, we have curtailed our capital investment and it is in that context that any potential disposal proceeds would be used.</p> <p>  As any member will know, it is important to reinvest.  We have reinvested in capital at approximately half the level of our depreciation over the past five or six years, which is unsustainable.  NewERA in particular commented on this and reaffirmed in the review that there was a key concern, given the importance of maintaining relevance in a competitive environment, particularly in the digital environment, that we would continue to invest in our assets.  It is primarily to address this shortfall in capital funding that any potential disposal of underutilised lands in Donnybrook be used.  There has been media coverage around it and we have secured planning permission around a cr&egrave;che and an N11 entrance.  While we are developing options, no final decisions have been made as we review the options.</p></speech>

The BBC does not have prime time current affairs programmes on at 9.30 p.m. three times per week.  The amount of live, prime time political coverage is very significant.</p> <p>  Regarding the challenge to us to innovate, particularly embracing social media, in the last election we formed partnerships with colleges, universities and different media faculties whereby young graduates were able to partner with us to provide coverage from every constituency.  There was great acknowledgement of the extent of the coverage and how we did it to fully embrace social media.  My colleague, Mr. Jim Jennings could elaborate further on it.  We are an organisation that wants to embrace digital technology and we can show that when we have national events, we do so.  The issue is the funding on an ongoing basis to enable us to do it and bring in the skills and talents, particularly of young people, to ensure we stay relevant to that generation.</p></speech>

For example, it is our main television station for sport.  All our sport and children's programmes appear on RTE 2, and on TG4.  These are important public service offerings for us in terms of our sport and children's programmes.  We have younger entertainment programmes later in the evening.  It is a very important station to us in terms of complementing what we do on RTE 1 television.  It is crucial to our delivery of children's programmes, young people's programmes and sport.<br/><br/>Senator Terry Leyden mentioned local radio, and it is important.  Representatives of local radio were here earlier.  The committee might hear, from some of the discussions with TG4, the Irish Film Board, local radio and the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, we are <i>ad idem</i>on many issues regarding our industry and the desire to get some action around funding.</p><p>We may argue about how the funding will be divided and who will get what, but it is very important for local and national radio and national media that we have indigenous newsrooms that bring Irish content to listeners and readers.  This is a valuable debate.  Sometimes we have varying views, but RTE and the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland worked together on the radio player and we work together on the PPI awards.  We have also worked together with the Irish Film Board and TG4.  We have much in common.</p></speech>

It will be published towards the end of next year.  Leading into this will be the longer-term vision for RTE and we are very much across it now.  There is much work to be done on it.  What we want to come up with is a plan that is a living breathing document which we will be able to deliver over a period of time.  As the committee is aware, the industry is evolving and the last thing we need is to produce a document which will be out of touch as soon as we write it.  We need to engage in a process, as we are at present, to create a strategy that is deliverable and will have ambition and innovation at its very heart, because this is what RTE is about and what we want to be about in the future.</p></speech>

This is a matter for policy makers.   As we have already stated, fundamentally, the big question for the wider industry in Ireland is the loss of approximately &euro;40 million to the sector based on evasion.  This would mean approximately 500 jobs.  Whether it is a more efficient collection system for the commercial or domestic home, we are speaking about 500 jobs which could be created and more digital content which could be supported, and graduates being trained in the area could be employed.  This is the bigger question.</p></speech>

Regarding the vision for RTE, the future financial model is questionable when we take into consideration capital issues regarding Brexit and how it will affect the commercial side.  Has RTE been affected by a lack of advertising because of Brexit?  To what degree will it affect RTE in future?</p> <p>  Ms O'Keeffe stated if the Donnybrook site is sold the proceeds would be for capital use.  How will the day to day issues be run if this capital injection is not used to keep the business going?  What review will take place?  Brexit is a moving entity and we are unsure where we are going long term.  The knock-on effects it could have for the industry and advertising are immense.  Listening to people in the industry and the uncertainty about where we are going, perhaps the money from a capital disposal of the Donnybrook site could be used to keep the industry going.  I am concerned the proceeds from disposing of the site in Donnybrook would go towards capital investment rather than plugging a gap that might come into existence due to a lack of commercial activity because of the unfortunate dilemma we have at present with Brexit.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go han-mhaith leo.  I place huge importance on the public service broadcast remit.  I should say I had an interest previously, as in a previous existence I was employed indirectly by TG4 and RTE as a producer director.  I am interested in the issue of fairness and balance in public service broadcasting and it being independent in what it produces.  Because it is so dependent on Government funding how does it get this balance right with regard to being able to be critical of the State as well as having its hand out to looking for more money?</p> <p>  There is a perception that RTE is very Dublin 4 centric and does not have regional vision, and that it is very middle-class, white and middle-aged.  This is the perception that is out there.  Public service broadcasting is about looking at drama, arts and culture.  The question of diversity being seen on screen and in production I see as a huge part of the public service broadcasting remit.  How does RTE intend to live up to this?</p> <p>  RTE has undersold itself on its Irish language content.  It has devised a very good Irish language strategy and there has been improvement in the Irish language area.  Do not undersell the Irish language.  I do not think that because TG4 is doing such a good job it lets RTE off the hook on the Irish language remit.  It has something to be very proud of, in particular Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Parts of the public service broadcasting that might not have been mentioned are stations such as Lyric FM and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, which would not happen if there was not a public service broadcasting subsidy.  It is very important.</p> <p>  What is the future of digital content which both broadcasters envisage?  It is changing so quickly.  What are the changes in the digital industry they see coming forward?  How will they adapt to deliver what is needed not next year but two or three years down the line?  This leads to a point raised on capital investment.  Ms O'Keeffe mentioned there is a need for capital investment to keep ahead of the technology.  What is envisaged in this regard?  If money is being given from the State coffers we need to have a sense of where the organisation sees the money being spent in a capital sense so it is not overspent.</p> <p>  What is the regional policy of RTE?  This is also part of the public service remit.  TG4 proved fantastic broadcasting can be done from a bog in Connemara, where I live.  Why has RTE not had more of a regional footprint?</p> <p>  The funding issue strikes me as quite simple.  There used to be less competition in the market and more money from advertising was spent on the two main broadcasters, but the money now goes to companies such as Facebook, Google and Netflix.  How do we follow the money and how do we get back some of the money from these multinationals?  I do not think it is a good idea to go after more taxes from households.  There is no appetite for it or an ability to pay in many cases.  I would much prefer us to follow the profits and the money rather than trying to take more money from struggling households.</p> <p>  Another issue which is raised from time to time is the fees to top presenters.  We are always told massive fees must be given to the top presenters in RTE because otherwise they would go away.  We saw that when Pat Kenny went to Newstalk the audience did not follow him.  Is this argument still justified?  Much of the best talent in TG4 in the beginning was poached by RTE, and fair play to the people involved who have gone on to great careers.</p></speech>

It is an issue, and people ask why we spend millions on presenters when we have people of wonderful calibre who can do the job for much less money to a very high standard, sometimes bilingually.  People want to see the money spent well and they question these expenses.</p> <p>  I asked previously about a regional film fund.  Do the witness see benefits in a regional film fund and money being made available to enhance broadcasting and the content being provided across the board?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22016112200002#R01300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I agree with Deputy Dooley.  We can work on at least two assumptions.  We know the difficulty with regard to the various roles involved, in that broadcasters must be tough on politicians sometimes and the witnesses can rest assured most politicians here do not bear a grudge.</p><p>Ms Forbes can also accept the assumption set out in her opening statement that there is real conviction here that public service media is worth sustaining and enhancing although it is not without criticism.  We must also focus on the issue of public value for money.  We are not so much judging editorial content because were to start doing that we would get into trouble but we do have to ensure there are systems in place to enable quality, impartial and honest broadcasting.  As luck would have it, when it comes to the issue of funding the Government has passed the ball to this committee, which I accept is not necessarily a bad pass but I hope it is not a hospital pass.  There is a crisis in public service funding of broadcasting across all media because of the disruptive effects of the digital revolution that is taking place.  This committee is the vehicle tasked with consideration and resolution of this matter and coming up with proposals for Government in that regard.  The Minister has been very clear on that point.  I believe we should take up that responsibility and that we should do so in a creative way, which I am sure all here are committed to doing.  </p><p> I have a couple of specific questions for the witnesses.  My first question is to Ms Forbes, although I accept she may not be able to respond to it.  Ms Forbes intimated that the digital revolution is taking place in a way we did not expect in that we thought broadcasters would get a large slice of the digital media advertising pie, 80% of which has been scooped by Facebook and Google.  Am I correct that Mr. Hickey's response to that was to the effect that we could scoop back somewhat in that regard by way of the imposition of a charge on Internet service providers or is there some other strategic development happening in the wider digital world through which content creators may be able to recover some more of that pie?  I accept that is not an easy question to answer.  I raise the issue because the solution is not one that is specifically proposed.  Perhaps there is no strategy in that regard and this is an issue we might need to tease out further.</p><p>On the opt-out of advertising clause, a favourite subject of mine for many years has been the lack of regulatory control over advertising such that money accruing in that regard is being taken out of the country with no investment in content creation here.  It was stated that this is enabled by the European Single Market.  Aside from the changes that will come about by way of the audiovisual media services directive, is it being suggested, in terms of the wording used in the presentation, that Brexit is likely to have implications for those outside of the Single Market.  God help us if Rupert Murdoch ends up being one of the losers from Brexit.</p><p> My next question is for the delegation from TG4.  How much did TG4 raise in advertising revenue in 2015?  My final question is to Mr. Hickey.  I was very interested in the prospect of a film channel and I remain so.  I take his point, however, that technology, platforms and delivery mechanisms may change but there is still an underlying issue in terms of value for public money and so on for the hundreds of millions of euro spent over many years building up an archive of Irish films, many of which I have only ever seen a minute clip of, none of which has been shown since.  If a film channel is not to be introduced how might we get that content out to the Irish public bearing in mind the money spent on it down through the years?</p></speech>

I welcome everybody and thank them for participating in this formal meeting.  As hinted earlier it might be necessary at some point for us to have a more informal discussion about some of the issues that are being raised.</p> <p>  It may come as a bit of a shock to Mr. Esslemont to hear this but before he came into the room a previous speaker had suggested that TG4 might give up advertising and that it might benefit from that in terms of audience satisfaction.  My question feeds into an issue raised earlier by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Is it crucial for TG4 to be in a position to advertise and what percentage of its budget does advertising income represent?  As I said, it was suggested that TG4 might be better off giving up advertising.  Mr. Esslemont mentioned in his presentation that TG4 is a at a serious disadvantage compared with TV3 in terms of its permitted number of minutes per hour of advertising.  Some of us might confess to having watched "Tonight with Vincent Browne" in our darkest hours.  It is true that one can put out the bins and make a good cup of tea during the advertising breaks for that programme.  Is there an advantage in TG4 becoming an advertisement-free zone, as suggested earlier in Mr. Esslemont's absence?</p></speech>

The questions for TG4 are how much advertising revenue it raised in 2015 and how critical advertising revenue is to TG4.  The question for the Irish Film Board is how we get content out to the public.</p></speech>

First, RTE is proud of its regional coverage down through the years.  We have 14 regional offices throughout the country which employ approximately 250 staff.  Two of our major services, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and Lyric FM, come from Galway and Limerick.  On top of this, a huge amount of content is produced from our Cork studio, including "The Daily Show" which is transmitted live in the afternoons and in respect of which there are between 40 and 60 staff are hired on an ongoing basis.  We are committed to the regions.  Shows such as "Nationwide" are an indication of our commitment to developing and showcasing stories from the regions.  Other examples of our commitment across the regions include our coverage of The National Ploughing Championships and other activities.

TG4 has a seen a real impact on its commercial revenue, particularly in the second half of this year.  In terms of how it is impacting us, practically over 55% of our commercial income comes from television advertising.  Almost 50% of our top 20 advertisers are UK based, including Unilever, Proctor and Gamble, P&amp;G etc..  When it comes to their bottom lines and financial constraints, which have been impacted by Brexit, they are pulling back on marketing.  The other impact is a practical one in that sterling buys fewer euros.</p><p>The UK companies will continue to invest the same amount in sterling in marketing.  To answer the question directly, we are seeing a marked difference in commercial revenue in the second half of the year than in the first.  That will feed into the financials for the year.</p><p> I endorse what Senator Tim Lombard said.  He hopes the proceeds from any disposal of land in Donnybrook would not be used to plug RTE's finances but would be used for capital investment purposes.  I agree and would go so far as to say it would be reckless if that was actually to happen.  That makes the case for an increase in public funding or looking again at the licence fee model to generate additional public funding for us and  other broadcasters.</p></speech>

We made a public commitment a number of years ago to reduce the fees paid to our top talent.  We recognised that they were too high.  In the first instance, there is great coverage of this issue, but top talent fees represent less than 1% of our operating costs.  We have many other issues about which to be worried.  Earlier this year we released figures that showed that top talent fees were more than 40% lower than in 2008.  That exceeds the public commitment we made.  We operate in a commercial environment and generate commercial revenue and the talents of our presenters help us to deliver commercial revenue which is very important to us.  If one were to look at a top ten talents across Ireland, we reckon five of them would not be at RTE but with other commercial broadcasters.  We are operating in a competitive environment.</p></speech>

In my opening remarks, I would like to provide the committee with an update on Permanent TSB's current performances and the specific areas of new lending activity to retail mortgage customers and SMEs, retail mortgage lending rates, macro-prudential mortgage lending guidelines, how we are managing customers in arrears and the strength of our capital position.</p> <p> The job I took on in 2012, namely, that of turning Permanent TSB into a best-in-class retail and SME bank with an exclusive focus on the Irish market, remains a work in progress and will do so for a few years to come.  However, we have achieved much over the past four years and we are well placed to finish the job, to return capital to taxpayers and other shareholders and to create a well governed, competitive and profitable retail bank that works for the community, our customers and our shareholders. </p> <p>  When we announced our half-year results in July, we reached a major milestone in our turnaround story by returning to bottom line, pre-tax profitability for the first time since 2007.  That progress may be temporarily interrupted for the full year as we will have to take account of the losses arising from the recent sale of our remaining CHL loan book and the completion of the group's deleveraging programme.  The trajectory is clear and positive.   </p> <p>  We have shown that, at an operating level, we are capable of generating capital organically after a lengthy period in which significant amounts of capital were depleted.  As we agreed with the troika in 2012, the group's turnaround involves three phases, that is, rescuing, rebuilding and growing the group.  By now we have completed the first two of these phases and, in doing so, have earned the right to embark on the third with confidence. </p> <p>  With our return to profitability, we have settled the argument about whether we can survive.  Now we have to prove that we can thrive and build a compelling commercial and competitive business.  Recent news that we have completed the sale of the final piece of the deleveraging target means we have delivered on all of the commitments we made to the authorities to support the recapitalisation by the State at the time of the financial collapse. </p> <p>  There are a couple of areas about which I would like to say a few words, starting with lending.  I am happy to confirm that we are growing our new lending volumes.  We recently announced that new mortgage lending drawdowns were 12% higher at the end of quarter 3 on a year-on-year basis.  We plan to keep growing our new lending profitably on a responsible and sustainable basis, by developing competitive, consumer friendly propositions for new and existing customers.  </p> <p>  Earlier this year, we launched a highly competitive variable rate mortgage product and a range of very competitive fixed rate mortgages which we believe are appropriate and offer good value to new customers given the current economic outlook.  We are also making good progress with our consumer finance offerings, such as personal loans, car loans and credit cards.  We are competing actively in this segment of the market. </p> <p>  In terms of our new SME offering, I have told the committee in the past that the owner managed enterprise sector is an area in which we are keen to grow our presence.  It is a logical move for us, given our retail banking strengths.</p><p>Our initial entry into this market earlier this year has been well received.  Although it is still early days, we are encouraged by our performance so far.</p><p> Turning to variable rate mortgage pricing, I am conscious that this remains an area of significant interest to the committee, particularly in light of recent initiatives to legislate for giving the Central Bank powers to regulate mortgage pricing.  The challenge my team and I face every day is striking the right balance between being as competitive as we can be in what is already a highly competitive market and ensuring we lend in a responsible, sustainable manner.  The price of any retail banking mortgage asset must reflect five key inputs: the cost of funds, the cost of operations, the cost of risk, the cost of capital and the portfolio mix.  If we price our loans too aggressively, we will fail to manage these inputs and we could ultimately cost the State and our other shareholders money.</p><p> I will quickly go through each of those inputs in turn.  It is correct to say that the group's cost of funds remains low in the present interest rate environment at approximately 0.73 basis points, but that is not the only input.  The group's cost of operations has risen markedly since the advent of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the design of a new pan-European deposit guarantee scheme and the extension of the bank levy.  In simple terms, the group's cost base through these line items alone has risen by &euro;60 million in 2016, and it is the customer who eventually pays.</p><p> The group's cost of risk on its most recent lending activity has stabilised since the nadir of the financial crisis.  However, the scale of the crisis means we are not yet at a stage where we can claim the back book has been cleansed of all its problems.  This, together with the ongoing difficulties faced by all lenders in realising collateral when customers fail to repay their loans, will continue to be felt in the level of ongoing provisions.</p><p> In terms of the cost of capital, the group, as well as other Irish banks, has to allocate far more capital relative to its mortgage book than its European peers due to the scale of the non-performing loan, NPL, challenge for Irish banks.  In addition, the cost of that capital has risen as investors price the underlying risk of the Irish banking sector to reflect the scale of the NPL, stock, the length of time to realise capital and the possibility of political intervention in asset pricing.</p><p> The final input is the portfolio mix and particularly the impact of our relatively large exposure to tracker mortgages based on historic decisions. The level of tracker mortgages in our overall mortgage book means that the level of relative interest received from trackers generally is low.  Therefore, the sum of all these inputs, together with the lack of an arrangement fee culture in Ireland of the type we see in other markets, means that relative variable rate mortgage prices are necessarily higher here than some of the rates we see elsewhere in Europe.  That major European banks have not demonstrated an appetite to enter the Irish market with cheaper offerings tends to confirm that our pricing in this market is about right for our particular conditions.</p><p> In terms of what are the best counterbalancing forces, first, it is my job to minimise the input costs within my control and, second, the market exercises a controlling function.  If we charge excessive prices on an ongoing basis, our lending volumes will suffer.  Those are the most effective ways of protecting consumers from any bank seeking to apply excessive lending rates and protecting Ireland from a dangerously under-profitable banking system.</p><p> We have a track record of responding to those competitive dynamics.  We have demonstrated our credentials as a strong competitor by effectively abolishing our standard variable rate, SVR, for any customer who wants to move to a lower rate from our managed variable rate, MVR, range.  This move offered cuts of between 20 basis points and 80 basis points for every SVR customer, and approximately one in four of all our SVR home loan customers has taken it up so far.  We use this as an example of a key principle whereby we and our competitors must do all we can to provide fair pricing in respect of both the front and the back book to customers in negative equity as well as those with positive equity.  We have also demonstrated that we can compete strongly with our fixed rate offerings, aimed at customers who want certainty over their monthly repayments, and with innovative new products such as our Home Mover offering.  Our rates are among the most competitive in the market and it is important to remember that when our cashback incentives are factored in, our overall offering is better value for customers than other banks with lower headline rates but no cashback.</p><p> Turning to our lending criteria, the amount that we can lend to any individual customer is limited by the Central Bank&rsquo;s guidelines that place a ceiling on the maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios that we can offer.  These guidelines are intended to prevent excessive borrowing by individual borrowers.  As my management team and I are committed to responsible lending, that is an aim that we share.  If the guidelines change as a result of the consultation process that the Central Bank is currently engaging in, then we will change our lending policy to reflect any such change.  We are well placed to increase our lending volumes in the event of any change in the current guidelines, but without ever losing sight of our overarching requirement to ensure we continue to lend on a responsible, sustainable basis, and the customer&rsquo;s ability to afford his or her repayments is always paramount.</p><p> Turning to the critical issue of customers who are in arrears with their repayments, we have witnessed encouraging trends over recent years. We have seen the benefits of engaging with customers.  The bottom line is that engagement works for the bank and for the customer.  We invested heavily in putting the right people and the right systems in place in our group to manage this engagement.  This investment has allowed many thousands of people to stay in their homes.  We have provided more than 24,000 sustainable long-term treatments to our customers since 2013.  A very high percentage of these customers are meeting the terms of their restructuring agreements and we will continue to look for the best treatment for these customers.  Our goal is to minimise the capital at risk for the bank and the taxpayer and to reduce the likelihood of, for example, a forced trade down for the customer at maturity of the treatment.</p></speech>

The facts bear this out.  Since the start of 2015, we have taken possession of 54 properties while customers have decided to voluntary surrender properties in a further 204 cases in that period.  That said, there is no easy solution.  There is no way around the problem that does not involve intense engagement with customers and agreeing new arrangements such as split mortgages that reduce each customer&rsquo;s monthly repayment to a level that he or she can afford.  The number of customers in arrears on their primary dwelling home has fallen by around 50% from its peak in September 2013.  It is an area that continues to require careful attention but one in which the group is making good progress.</p> <p>  I will conclude with some comments on our capital position and the Europe-wide stress tests.   We showed with our first-half results that we are capable of generating capital organically.  That is a key indicator of the group&rsquo;s long-term viability.  The members may recall that we successfully raised more than &euro;500 million in private capital last year when we completed our initial public offering, IPO, on the Irish and London stock exchanges and enabled the State to get some of its money back and reduce its shareholding from 99% to 75%.  Our capital position is strong and our business case is that it will improve further over time.  The bottom line, and the most important test for me and my management team, is that we were not required to raise any further capital following the recent stress tests unlike in 2014, but our capital levels, like those of every other bank, are subject to intense scrutiny by our regulator and the wider investment community.  We welcome the scrutiny of these tests as it offers us the opportunity to demonstrate that we are a solid, viable, competitive bank.  In our recovery journey, we have met every challenge that has come before us and we are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to build on the enormous progress we have made.  </p> <p>  Before I conclude, I should introduce my colleagues.  I am joined by Mr. Shane O'Sullivan, the managing director of our asset management unit, Mr. Ger Mitchell, the director of our group product review group, and Mr. Stephen Groarke, the group's chief risk officer.

Indeed, we pay for that valuation and it is something we would encourage people to do.</p></speech>

We retired the one-size-fits-all SVR produced and went to the MVR option.  In September 2015, part of our policy was to offer new and existing customers the same price, or fair pricing to answer the exam question about bringing fairness to variable rate mortgage pricing.  We launched that product in September 2015 and within the pack that went to customers was a simple application form, a voucher to get their valuation paid and an immediate conversion to the MVR option inside 14 days of receipt.  To date, approximately 24,000 customers have moved on to that.  A customer in negative equity will get a reduction of 20 basis points and a customer in positive equity under 50% LTV can benefit with a reduction of 80 basis points from the SVR.</p></speech>

In our organisation, as with any business, we have to prioritise the allocation of resources and we prioritised our resources in respect of the variable rate challenge we had.  First, there was the MVR product and the opening of the back book.  We then prioritised fixed rate products for our new customers and they are now of the shelf in terms of a competitive rate.  The last time I was here I was asked why we did not have fixed rates and the reason was to do a fixed rate mortgage, one has to find some equal and opposite funding at the right price and at that time, our franchise was perceived as weak by the market.  We could have put fixed rates on the product but they would have been very expensive.  The good news for Ireland is that since then, as the business has improved and we have continued to compete and show we are an important contributor to the financial services landscape in Ireland, depositors and funders have been prepared to give us resources at the right price.  The next stage for us is to move that offer to our existing customers.  It is just a question of priorities and choices.  We will offer fixed rate products at competitive prices to our back book customers as soon as we can in 2017.</p></speech>

For example, somebody with an LTV of less than 80% can move to an MVR of 4% but cannot avail of a fixed rate of 3.2%, which is available to a new customer.  The bank is making a different offering and is discriminating between existing and new customers in respect of their treatment on fixed rates.</p></speech>

I absolutely accept the challenge that we should have fair fixed rates for our existing customers.  I absolutely take that on the chin.  In any organisation, choices have to be made about where resources are allocated.  We are moving on to it and the Deputy has my commitment that we will do competitive fixed rates in 2017 for our back book customers.</p></speech>

I do not have the exact data points in front of me but approximately 60% of our customers had a price promise and they got that price promise which was between 1% and 2% on average and those on the non-price promise got between 2% and 3%..</p></speech>

In September 2015, we also announced that unilaterally we would undertake a full review of our mortgage book and Mr. Mitchell was appointed to do that.  Subsequently that was rolled into the CBI tracker review which was launched in December 2015.  We continued to work with the Central Bank, as with the rest of the industry because let us not forget it is an industry review, not a Permanent TSB review.  It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the outcome of the review at this stage because it is still quite early.  There are several principles we apply, one of the most important being that as soon as we find a cohort of customers to which we have caused detriment, we move as quickly as we can to redress and compensation.  My guess is that, like the other banks, we will find detriment in some issues.  The important principle for me is transparency, redress and compensation.</p> <p>  I think we have put aside the right level of capital to pay for the harm that we caused.  Mr. Mitchell runs the programme so he will give an update on that.</p></speech>

I do not think we have gathered everything as part of the mortgage redress programme because it was a very specific task to identify customers who had broken early from a fixed rate contract and lost their right to a tracker.  We were guilty of an information deficit.  We did not communicate sufficiently with customers about the potential loss of a right down the line.</p> <p>  The CBI review, however, is very broad.  It attempts to check for the contractual entitlement, to view it through a regulatory lens in terms of adherence to regulatory policy.  The third element pertains to the reasonableness or conduct of the organisation during that period.  We have taken every tracker mortgage customer going back 12 years.  This is business live in our systems today - business we have sold, business that has been redeemed - and we have recommissioned legacy systems to make sure we get all the data.  We are working hand in glove with the Central Bank to make sure everybody potentially affected is assessed, reviewed, and where we find a failing, that they are remediated properly.</p> <p>  There are six steps in the remediation policy: put the customers on the right rate to stop the harm; refund any overcharge of interest; allow a time value of money; a separate payment of &euro;400 to allow them get independent advice; pay 10% or &euro;1,000 minimum in compensation; and two appeal panels depending on what cohort the customers fall into, those who have not lost their homes and those who have.  Beyond that, everything is open to the customer including the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, thereafter.  There are four stages in the Central Bank review.  We have just completed phase two and are moving into the full assessment of our book and expect to go through phases three and four in the first half of next year. </p></speech>

First, however, I want to deal with question No. 2, which asked the number of BTL mortgages reported as in arrears greater than 90 days as of 30 June.  Since 2013, when the bank cited a figure of 5,000, it now has 2,112 BTL mortgages more than 90 days in arrears.  What was the mechanism by which the bank arrived at that number?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112200002#D00500"><p>We were very keen at the outset of tackling the arrears problem to understand things from the BTL perspective.  We felt that working through the problems and restructuring accounts would be the most effective solution.  As we did with the home loan book, we set about meeting each of our BTL customers and assessed the situation on the basis of affordability and sustainability.  Once we could find a path that gave us confidence that capital could be repaid at the end of the term or an extended term and there was affordability between here and there, we were happy to restructure the account.  Our large scale restructuring approach is different from that of most banks.  It has worked to date.  Our performance on the buy-to-let is arguably better than on home loan although the numbers are smaller.  That is substantiated by the reduction from 5,000 to 2,000.  Most of those restructures are working.  Approximately 92% of them have remained performing.  Time has been good to landlords and owners of buy-to-let property in terms of price appreciation and rental income.  That causes other difficulties in society but through the narrow lens of buy-to-let landlords, it puts them in a position to repay their mortgages now in a way that they were not previously.</p></speech>

In fairness to the bank, it has provided all the numbers comprehensively for us, which is to be welcomed.  The figure of 1,351 is quoted.  If there are 1,351 mortgage holders paying a reduced payment that is greater than the interest rate, wherein lies the risk?  This committee is mindful of the tenants of those properties because of the problem of homelessness and if there is 92% performance on the loans, I wonder how those 1,351 will play out.  Is there security of tenure?  While the bank's first duty is to the mortgage holder, does it feel a social obligation to ensure there are tenants and that they have some security of tenure where those mortgages fail to perform?</p></speech>

We have a responsibility as bankers to ensure that the capital that is effectively at risk, the amount that needs to be repaid at the end of a restructure, is payable.  Across the system there is a legitimate treatment, interest only, in buy-to-let.  It is our second most popular restructure at 30%.  We offer it when we are satisfied that the capital at the end of the re-term can be repaid through the sale of that property.  We are also mindful of risk.  Our preference is that if landlords can repay the interest plus a portion of the capital, that is a better position for the landlord and the bank.  There is less capital at risk and a stronger plan for the repayment of capital at the end of the term.  That opens up options for the borrower who may not need to sell the property at the end of the term.</p><p>This is the thinking behind the restructures we put in place for buy-to-lets.  We fully respect the issue raised with regard to tenants.  For us, it is important there are tenants in the property at all times.  We do not have a fixed asset agreement, term or condition in our contracts.  We do not have the authority if we wanted it, which we do not as it turns out, to repossess properties swiftly, exit the tenants and sell the property.  Our buy-to-lets are treated very much like our home loan contracts.  It is in our interests that there are tenants in place.  The only time we will appoint a rent receiver is where there are tenants in place and they are paying rent but the rent is not being paid to the bank to pay for the mortgage.  In a situation like this we will appoint a rent receiver to look after the interests of the borrower and the tenants.</p></speech>

They are almost exclusively on buy-to-let properties.  The reason we put in a rent receiver is as I said.  They are appointed by the bank.  They are an agent of the borrower.  They are there to gather the rent and pay it to the bank.

A total of 1,372 customers of the bank were in line for substantial refunds.

It is a chapter of the bank's history we must never repeat.  Therefore, I can categorically assure the committee there have been many learnings.  We have the Central Bank's tracker review with regard to ensuring the provision of information, because this was what it was about.  There was no willful misrepresentation as it was about the provision of information.  We need to ensure the buyer of a banking product absolutely has the right information.</p></speech>

At this point, 91% of these customers have been fully redressed, which includes putting the account back in the position it would have been in, rebuilding the account, providing advice fee, providing compensation and, as I mentioned earlier, opening up the appeals panel.  Approximately 14% of the total have appealed and approximately one in four people have got slightly additional terms on foot of going through those appeals.</p> <p>  On the point on lessons learned, to build on what Mr. Masding has said, our objective is to rebuild trust and faith in Permanent TSB, which is why in September 2015 we established the mortgage product review group.  Our core objective is to ensure our behaviour and the contractual obligations to customers are adhered to and delivered upon.  As part of this programme, we have sought to find any failings, be they system or operational, fix them and future proof such that it does not happen again.</p></speech>

We have been told that Permanent TSB is over the worst.  I welcome this confidence and hope it is well placed.  However, we must bear in mind that the bank failed the ECB stress test not 1 million years ago.  Only six months ago in a trading statement, Permanent TSB stated it may not generate the return on equity of approximately 10% by 2018.  It had flagged investors just a year ago, citing increased external risks.  The share price fell 10% on the back of this statement.  A note of caution is very much required.  At any point in recent years, did the bank, as a serious option, look at the possibility of a merger with another bank or being subsumed into another bank?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Masding" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112200002#E01800"><p>I should go right back in history.  In early 2012, I was asked to review Permanent TSB.  As I mentioned when before the committee previously, with the troika and the Government we looked at all the alternatives for Permanent TSB.  These alternatives included resolution of the organisation, or wind-up as committee members might know it.  We looked very seriously at a merger with another Irish financial services business.  We also looked at trying to create a focused Irish domestic retail bank.</p><p>Each of those alternatives was examined through a quantitative and qualitative lens to a level of detail which I think would pass any due diligence.  It was decided that the most value creating alternative was to allow Permanent TSB to compete in the Irish market.  Since then, we have done all we can.  The team has done a great job and created an organisation that is now alive and vibrant.  We were profitable for the first time in ten years.  We have now deleveraged all of our non-core business and we are competing hard in the market.  At this point there are no conversations taking place around merger-acquisition.  To be frank, they would be a diversion.  What we need to do now for the benefit of the Irish consumer and the Irish taxpayer is grow this bank profitably, and we are confident that we can do so.</p><p> In regard to some of the hiccups that arose along the way, the return on equity, ROE, was a benchmark target against other peer banks in 2014.  Since then, the industry has suffered from a combination of factors, including low interest rates, a high regulatory cost burden and some geopolitical risk, all of which come through into our business.  In regard to the 10% ROE, I imagine that the ROE that we are targeting now is well within the peer group range.  I am confident that investors are comfortable with where we are going.  In regard to the share price, it is true that it deteriorated but that happened because of many factors which were outside of our control.  In recent times, following reporting of profitability, deleveraging of CHL and showing the market that we are confident about the future of this organisation the share price has rebounded strongly.  </p><p> It should not be forgotten that Permanent TSB is the only nationalised bank to undertake an IPO.  We did that in nine months.  We crossed the globe and presented our value story to investors and we were massively over-subscribed such that confidence in Ireland and Permanent TSB was strong then and remains strong now.  Last week, I was in US for a meeting with our American investors.  The feeling is one of optimism, particularly now that we have deleveraged CHL.  The investors now believe that this management team is ready to deliver on the promise it made to them about a profitable Irish domestic retail and SME bank.  Therefore, I remain confident to today.  Any discussions about an inorganic transaction would be an absolute distraction that I do not think is required at this point in time.</p></speech>

In regard to his statement that the bank is now ready to move on to phase three - growing the group - what does that mean for competition in the Irish banking sector and physically in terms of the bank infrastructure?  Can we look forward to the opening of more branches, a better geographical spread of same and more jobs?  Will Mr. Masding confirm that at least there will be no more closures or mergers of the banks?  I note Permanent TSB currently has nine fewer branches than it had in 2012.  In regard to staff, perhaps Mr. Masding would explain how it is that there are 273 more staff in the organisation but fewer branches.</p></speech>

To compete, one has to invest.  I will give an example.  In regard to the channels mentioned, we participate in five channels, including via branches, online, mobile, telephony and brokers.  We continue to invest in all of those channels.  In regard to branches, we believe that these remain an important part of the Irish banking landscape.  We have 77 branches, none of which at this point we have any intention of closing.  Obviously, demographics and behaviour change over time and, therefore, we have to keep the facts base alive and monitor the situation, but as of today I have no intention of closing any branches.  Our branches fit into two categories.  Some of them are old and, in many cases, decrepit and in need of investment.  At this point, 30 branches have been fully refurbished.  I would encourage the Senator or any of her colleagues to visit one of the refurbished branches.  I can guarantee they will walk out confident that Permanent TSB is an organisation that is investing in its people and its technology.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that we need to invest further but we can only spend what we earn and so we need to make some money first.  Broadly speaking, we know the channels we are in and we know where we need to invest.  The branches in Dundrum and Malahide are just two of the branches recently refurbished.  We are big fans of the branch network.</p></speech>

First, the cost of regulation of all banks across Europe, including Permanent TSB, has increased materially.  It is important that the standards of banking continue to rise and for that reason we have had to invest in our risk governance and control infrastructure.  That involves people processing technology.  In the area in respect of which Mr. O'Sullivan has responsibility, which is asset management, we have to continue to invest in arrears management because we need to do the right thing for Ireland.  As stated earlier by Mr. O'Sullivan, we are trying to avoid repossessions and to provide customers with long-term solutions.  The main reasons for the increase in headcount are risk governance and control and continued investment in the arrears management unit, all of which, I suspect, are a good thing.</p></speech>

As such, we have a 25% private shareholder base.  In regard to the 75%, what happens in that regard is a matter for the relevant Minister.  The Minister is on record that over time he wishes to reduce the stakes of the Government in the banks and that is something which I would welcome.  At the end of the day, that is a matter for decision by the Minister.</p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, in a short-term perspective Brexit somewhat bizarrely helped Permanent TSB in that it increased the probability of deleveraging the CHL business.  A very short-term upside for us of Brexit was that it accelerated the full deleveraging of our non-core portfolio.  For us, there was a short-term tick in the box from Brexit.  In the longer term we are the only Irish bank that does not have a mainland British operating business and, therefore, we are less exposed than others.  Like everybody in this room, we remain cautious of the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

Question No. 3 on page 15 relates to the &euro;4 billion bailout for PTSB.</p><p>The question is about how much has been repaid and how much will be repaid.  When one adds everything together, which includes the deposit guarantee scheme, effectively the witness is saying the bank has repaid &euro;2.6 billion of the &euro;4 billion bailout.  However, question No. 17 on page 18 deals with the amount of the money that has gone from the State to Permanent TSB in that period of time via the redemption of National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, bonds and interest.  The total is &euro;2.548 billion, plus &euro;200 million interest.  When one balances them out over that period of time there has been a further net payment from the State of &euro;148 million, via NAMA, to the bank, rather than money coming back the other way.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that there is a &euro;4 billion investment in the Permanent TSB group and we have repaid &euro;2.6 billion.  That is made up of &euro;1.3 billion from the sale of Irish Life, &euro;0.5 billion from redemption of contingency capital and a further &euro;0.8 billion from fees and interest.  The answer to question No. 17 is not like for like.  We acquired those NAMA bonds in association with a deposit book which we took on.  In taking on those assets, the NAMA bonds, we also took on liabilities.  That is not a net investment from the State, and  it is not appropriate to add that to the other investment.  Effectively, the State gave us an amount of NAMA bonds and almost exactly bonds to date with deposits from another institution that was being wound up at the time.  I would not add the numbers in question No. 17 to the earlier numbers.</p> <p>  In terms of repayment to the State, the additional piece is that the State also owns 75% of the group.  At this morning's share price of &euro;2.66, that is worth &euro;900 million to &euro;1 billion.  That is a further potential contribution to the repayment of the State's investment.  As Mr. Masding said, it is at the Minister's discretion as to when he wishes to do that.</p></speech>

I am open to correction but there are no situations where I can recall that we obliged the eviction of tenants.  It goes against the repayment of the capital that is due, so there would not be a good reason for the bank to wish to evict the tenants and sell the property.  Our intention is to work with the borrower to keep the tenants in the property.</p></speech>

The number of owner-occupier mortgages in arrears is down 50% since September 2013.  Part of that is the selling of approximately 5,500 mortgages to vulture funds.  Do the witnesses have any idea what happened there?  Is the question of whether they will evict tenants something the witnesses take into account when they are choosing to whom they will sell the mortgage books?</p></speech>

In each of the cases the Deputy referenced, the disposal of those portfolios was linked to our restructuring plan.  The property numbers one sees, therefore, probably would be called connected mortgages as against being the principal mortgage.  Essentially, we were obliged to sell some non-core portfolios.  Many of those non-core portfolios were in a commercial real estate space or in the professional buy-to-let space, and many of the principal dwelling houses, PDHs, that came with them were connected to that main mortgage.  I would not want the Deputy to think there was a proactive vulture fund strategy, as he calls it, vis-&agrave;-vis those portfolios.  We were obliged to sell those portfolios as part of our restructuring plan, because the primary obligation was linked to a non-core label.  That is where we are at in terms of those disposals.</p></speech>

The 50% reduction in questions Nos. 1 and 2 relates to Permanent TSB loans that we have worked through with our borrowers.  It is not reduced by the 5,000.  As Jeremy Masding says, that is a separate portfolio or portfolios that were in our non-core division that were sold.</p></speech>

They are implying that a bunch of them would be commercial property and so forth, but some of them could be connected residential.</p></speech>

The bias was very much in the commercial real estate, CRE, space.  There were some residential loans, both home loans and buy-to-let loans, sold as well.  Once that sale takes place and once the economic and legal ownership is with another entity, from a data protection point of view and business point of view we would not see transactions on those accounts from that point.</p></speech>

A common complaint many of us encounter is that when people see boarded-up houses they presume they are owned by the council, but often they are not owned by the council but by banks.  Non-governmental organisations, NGOs, have said there is a process of repossessed houses lying empty for a period of time.  Threshold told the Committee on Housing and Homelessness that there is clear evidence available that when vacant possession is obtained for sales purposes properties are left unoccupied for a considerable time.  What type of turnaround would Permanent TSB have on properties of which it takes vacant possession?</p></speech>

We recently appointed a new asset manager and the idea behind that relates to the Deputy's point, to appoint and work with a partner who can sell these properties once they come into our possession on a scale basis and more quickly than heretofore.  In recent times that turnaround has quickened.  Over the last number of years it has been an elongated process, because in the early days of the crisis access to mortgages was not available.  However, time has passed and we are all aware that there are issues with supply.  Demand far exceeds supply.  The turnaround time, therefore, is getting quicker.  I admit that we were slow this year because while we were appointing and tendering for the new asset manager we held our properties until that appointment was made.</p><p>I estimate that at this stage it takes about six months to sell a property.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that it is a risk, but when we do the underwriting associated with the restructure we do leave a small amount of money aside in terms of our assessments for issues like that to arise.  It might not necessarily be an increase in ECB rates, it could be an increase in medical costs or other expenditure but we do not take the total net disposable income and assume that all of it is available to repay the mortgage, so that leaves some leeway for exceptional circumstances.</p></speech>

The alternative of course is not to provide a restructure and the consequence of that is repossession and that is not a route people want to take so, as bankers we have to assess the risk and we have to make decisions.  We believe that our policy in terms of buy-to-let restructures is appropriate.  It recognises that risk.  It does not take all of the net disposable income into account as a consequence but, nonetheless, the risk exists.</p></speech>

When I listened to the comments earlier about tracker mortgages and the rage inside me was growing stronger and stronger because it was being passed off as a case of the bank not communicating or performing and giving the information that was required and that this is an industry-wide issue.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the redress scheme, trying to right the wrongs and that the bank apologised again to its customers, but this was not just an information flaw.  It is not connected but in response to our questions the salaries of the senior staff in Permanent TSB were provided.  Some of them are earning up to &euro;500,000.  They watched these individuals lose their homes.  The bank took the homes from some of those individuals.  In my view that was daylight robbery by a financial institution which took money from its own customers.  When that was pointed out by those very same customers, the bank denied it.  When the Financial Services Ombudsman said that the bank was wrong and the customers were right, the bank fought the ombudsman.  When the High Court told the bank that it was wrong and the customers were right, it fought the High Court and went all the way to the Supreme Court.  Some of the customers who were robbed also had their houses taken off them as well.  The bank then tried to pass it off as an information issue and said that it was an industry-wide issue.  This was not just a small little error within the bank.</p> <p>  I met with one of those customers who had a letter saying that she should voluntarily surrender her family home, with arrears of just over &euro;400.  It was the first time ever she was in arrears.  I looked at the contract and it was as plain as day that the individual was entitled to go back onto a tracker rate.  That was one of the appeals that went to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  If I did that - if I took &euro;20,000 from an individual I would be locked up in Mountjoy, but unfortunately the history in this State is that bankers can rob their customers.  I do not target this at individuals but I am talking about institutions, and then dress it up as a redress scheme.  The bank will give back the money and no heads will roll within the bank.  That is how a lot of people feel and while I welcome the apology given by the witnesses, have they apologised for taking the Financial Services Ombudsman to the High Court?  It was only when the Central Bank said it was not about the 80 cases before the FSO but in 1,300 cases the bank had taken money from customers and some of them were left so high and dry that their family home was taken from them.  I want the witnesses to respond to that because that is how many people feel about what the bank has done.</p> <p>  The words that have echoed in this chamber about it being a question of information and an industry-wide issue are trying to deflect from the responsibility.  Mr. Masding is the CEO who oversaw the appeal to the Supreme Court and who allowed those people to be overcharged by the bank.  He oversaw a process whereby they were being fought tooth and nail through the courts.  What the bank has done is appalling.  I did not intend to take this line but the witnesses have enraged me in terms of the way they have presented the situation, which is inappropriate given the scale and the suffering involved.  No redress scheme will ever be able to make right the difficulties some of those individuals, some of whom I know personally, went through.  They had to make sacrifices and suffered stress and anguish and there were health implications of all of that because of what the bank did.  To categorise it as not providing people with the proper information and to say it was an industry-wide problem is disrespectful.  I am appalled that is the type of approach the witnesses took today.</p></speech>

I think I was answering a different question, so if we go back to the point of principle, in June 2015 I announced the enforcement action and the redress and compensation scheme.  I did that in a public way.  I did not hide behind a press release.  I did it in the boardroom of Permanent TSB in front of the Irish media.  I then came to this House and answered questions, so in terms of the attitude and the remorse that the bank showed I hope that if Deputy Doherty looks back on the record for June 2015 he will see that I did not hide behind anything.  I stood up there in front of the Irish media and apologised for the absolute distress that we caused to customers.  I also was very clear that it would be irresponsible and completely without empathy if I tried to imply that the redress and compensation scheme would in all cases complete any remediation of any harm because obviously I do not know all the individual circumstances &ndash; Deputy Doherty might know better &ndash; but what we tried to do at the time was to design a scheme to the best of our ability to make sure that we did the right thing for customers, including those who suffered loss of ownership.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s first point, I apologise if I gave the impression today that I was trying to deflect from what I did in 2015.  I repeat my position to him that it was a sad episode in the history of the bank.  We caused enormous detriment to a large number of customers.  I apologised in person and we felt the scheme that we tried to design and build was the best scheme that we could do within the circumstances.</p> <p>  In terms of the second point about personal accountability, I repeat what I said at the time, namely, I have found no evidence to suggest that anyone within the group took a conscious decision to deprive customers of the trackers.  If any such evidence emerges I will take the action that is appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112200002#H01000"><p>I will give Mr. Masding some evidence.  When the Financial Services Ombudsman said the bank was wrong, that was the evidence but obviously something happened at board level whereby the bank decided to appeal the case to the High Court.  Whether there was a conscious or deliberate effort when the customers were not put back on the tracker rates, when the Financial Services Ombudsman found that the bank was in error the bank should have rectified the situation.</p><p>Afterwards when the High Court found that Permanent TSB was in error, the bank should have rectified the situation.  In layman's terms, if this happened anywhere outside a financial institution people would be locked up in Mountjoy because individuals' money was stolen . It was stolen by a financial institution.  The redress scheme, which was forced upon Permanent TSB, meant the bank had to rectify the situation.  The Central Bank has made that clear.  Permanent TSB did the right thing, but it had no option but to stand up and say it would make things right.  What the bank is doing is returning the original money it took from them back to the customers with a little bit of top-up for the pain and suffering caused, which amounts to about 10%.  That is the problem here.  There was a conscious effort and a decision was taken.  Maybe Mr. Masding can enlighten this committee as to whether he was part of the decision-making process that either appealed to the High Court - I am not sure if he was there at the time - or to the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

We put this scheme in place.  I apologise to the Deputy again this afternoon if he felt that the use of the term "industry-wide tracker review or information" was something to deflect from that.

At least, therefore, Mr. Masding knew at that stage that there were 80 similar cases before the FSO about which the High Court had made a determination that the bank had erred in law.  Mr. Masding decided to fight them.  He decided to fight the FSO, which was acting on behalf of his customers.</p></speech>

The decision the board took at that time was a decision around a variety of different factors.  In terms of the consequences for the tracker review, those facts are now in front of the committee.

What we have to do now is to move forward on this case in terms of the tracker review, and to ensure that mistakes like this are not made again.</p></speech>

This is a State-owned bank which robbed citizens of this country.  When they were caught out by the High Court and the FSO, the people there decided to appeal that to the Supreme Court, which was within their rights.  They made the wrong decision by taking that appeal to the Supreme Court but Mr. Masding has never apologised for it.  Those decisions placed more hardship on these individuals.  These individuals were sitting at home monitoring websites such as <i>askaboutmoney.com</i>and they saw what happened in the High Court.  When the High Court made its decision, they thought that finally they would get their tracker rates back, keep their houses and put food on the table for their children.  However, highly-paid executives within Permanent TSB, sitting around a board table, decided they were going to fight this.  They took it to the Supreme Court, which took months before the decision was eventually taken to withdraw the appeal because the Central Bank review said Permanent TSB had to make right the wrongs it had done.  That is the problem here.  There is no accountability within the financial institution.  Nobody will be held accountable for this.  How can no one be held accountable for it?  The bank robbed 1,372 of its customers.  That is what happened here.  The bank took their money.  It is giving it back to them under the redress scheme but how come nobody will be held accountable for this within the financial institution or was held accountable when it became known that this was happening?</p></speech>

The fact is that it was a systems design failure on our part and a legacy issue before I started.  The failure was a systems gap.  It was an operational weakness and I have apologised to the Deputy and his colleagues in the past for this and the impact it had on the customers involved.  I continue to apologise today.  As I said when the issue arose last year we moved as quickly as we could to do the right thing.  Sitting here this afternoon, I can only tell the committee that we are trying to rebuild trust.  We are trying to rebuild Permanent TSB and we are trying to do the right thing.  That is where I would leave it.</p></speech>

He will continue to dress it up and present it in the way he has as a systems failure.  It was not a systems failure.  A systems failure is when a computer throws out an interest rate that is wrong.  This was people at the end of a phone saying "You have put me on to the wrong rate.  I want my tracker rate back".  Decisions were taken by individuals within the bank to say "No, you're not entitled to that tracker rate back."  That is not a systems failure.  Decisions were taken within the bank at a high level that were being filtered down to staff who were answering phones.</p></speech>

In terms of that particular dimension, since I became the leader of this organisation I have sought to ensure that the operational practices we have under my watch are to the highest standards so those issues do not happen again.

He was part of the group of people who decided to appeal this to the Supreme Court.  He oversaw this institution while this was happening.  This did not come to light just last year.  People have been bringing this to the attention of the Financial Services Ombudsman but, first and foremost, to the bank because one cannot go to the FSO before one has exhausted the appeal mechanisms within Permanent TSB.  They have been doing that for years.</p> <p>  I have a connected question.  I believe that &euro;140 million was set aside for the redress scheme.  How much of that has been paid out so far and how much is expected to be paid out when the scheme ends?</p></speech>

I presume that many of these properties are located around Dublin.  Permanent TSB is not unique.  Bank of Ireland and AIB have properties as well.  Indeed, the banks in which the State has substantial shareholdings have vacant properties and they are doing nothing with them.  We have a homeless crisis and people are being accommodated in hotels by local authorities and so on.  Has Permanent TSB engaged with the State to inform those responsible that the State owns the bank and the bank has 441 houses that are lying empty?  Perhaps that could represent something of a solution to help to alleviate the homelessness and housing crisis in the capital.  What has the response from the Department been if the bank has had such an engagement with it?</p></speech>

From 2006, there was an obligation under the consumer protection code to provide customers with adequate information in respect of any decisions they made.  There was an issue for Permanent TSB in this regard.  Where our customers broke early from a fixed rate, they lost the contractual right to a tracker.  However, the information pointing out to them that they were losing that contractual right was not provided.

We have tried to put in place a framework whereby customers have as much optionality as possible.  We put in place a customer appeals panel and an independent review panel.  They can be used depending on the circumstances.  The panels are independent of the bank.  Customers have an option to use those panels to have their compensation and circumstances reviewed.  If they are still not satisfied, they have the option to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  At that point, if they wish, they can also bring through legal action.</p></speech>

There is no desire on our part to close these cases quickly <i>per se</i>.  Our mindset is to close these cases correctly such that the customer has a voice and that we try to get to the right solution.  That is the most important thing for us.</p></speech>

We have previously had a debate in the Chamber on the difference between the two.  If we have found a solution, which, sadly, might involve an assisted voluntary sale, I would absolutely use the capital for the customers for whom it is right that we use the capital for the shortfall.  We can control some aspects.  We can do our best to engage with customers.  We can have as professional a conversation as possible with customers through the standard financial statement, SFS, lens to try to find a solution.  Our track record since 2012 and 2013, under Mr. O'Sullivan's leadership, has been that we have found many creative solutions for customers.  We set off with a mind set that success for us was to find a long-term treatment.  We cannot control those who, unfortunately, we are unable to help.

That is 54 in almost two years.  This is a bank that has had 26,000 customers not repaying their mortgages.  This figure of 54 in nearly two years from over 26,000 customers, or over our entire customer base of 155,000, says the bank is trying to do everything to find solutions.  Compare the figure of 54 repossessions to the 24,000 restructures we have put in place.  I hope it gives a sense that we come to work every day to find restructures.  It is our priority, our mind set and out intention, although it is not always possible to do it, and this is what leads, inevitably, to the 54 repossessions we have, unfortunately, had to ensure happened during the past two years.</p></speech>

We provide both variable and fixed rate products to our new customers.  We have explained what we do on variable mortgages in terms of the back book.  As I have already explained to the committee, our next challenge is to provide fixed rate mortgages to our existing customers.  I would guess that by the third quarter of next year both our new and existing customers will have access to a variable and fixed rate suite of mortgages at a competitive rate.  That is an example of why Permanent TSB needs to be here.  We need to be in business to give customers choice and to give the pillar banks some competition.</p></speech>

However, its mortgage rates are around twice the average rate in the eurozone.  Will the bank come under pressure through competition to reduce its rates or does it believe there will not be additional competition in the market and it can continue to charge those rates?  Permanent TSB is charging a lot more for its products than other banks across Europe.  If competition were to increase, does the bank fear-----</p></speech>

The first thing I ask my team to do is to demonstrate to me and assure me that we price our mortgages in a way that covers the five dimensions that I referred to in my speech, namely, the cost of funds, operating expenses, cost of risk, cost of capital and portfolio risk.  If we cover those, then that is the right way to put mortgages into the Irish market.  That no foreign banks have come into the Irish mortgage space at scale indicates that the pricing is probably right, considering that most other European banks would price mortgages in the same way.</p> <p>  Irish competition has increased in recent times.  There are essentially five vibrant institutions in Ireland, namely, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, KBC, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.  Additionally, in certain niche areas, other competitors are coming in.  Competition is alive and we price mortgage assets correctly.  As the inputs change, prices will change.</p></speech>

Obviously, as I said already, that might change as demographics change.  In terms of the branches themselves, I am very proud of the people working in our branches.  The service they provide is first class.  We provide service to all generations, as well as to both personal and business customers.  The statistics I have seen show that the service provided to our customers is first class.  Obviously we must keep investing in technology.  I am sure there are services that can be taken out of the branches and put into machines, but that does not mean we are going to remove the human interaction which makes Permanent TSB special in the communities it serves.</p></speech>

What we continually do within the bank is we try to estimate how much we think we will recover ultimately.  Clearly, one of the inputs to that is the price of the property.  As Mr. O'Sullivan has outlined, our preference is not to realise the collateral, if we can at all, it is to give a forbearance treatment to the extent that the mix of treatments changes over time.  For instance, if people, over time, are on a split mortgage but we manage to see their circumstances improve and they might move on to part capital and interest then we will re-estimate the provision that is required.  As customers get into a better position over time that improves the potential cashflow for the bank and we can recognise that in provisions.  It is not just about the price of property.</p></speech>

Clearly the bank's figures suggest that it is not out, as property values increase, to get people out of properties and to sell the properties either with vacant possession or with tenants in the case of buy-to-lets.  It is fair to say that the bank is not doing this but there is a suggestion out there that that happens.  With the bank's figures I do not think that such scenarios happen.</p></speech>

Let us say today's price is &euro;2.70.  I have not looked at the figure since I have been in this meeting but a price of &euro;2.70 would be quite a deterioration.  Most of the decrease is due to factors that are outside our control.  All bank stocks have fallen due to a combination of factors that I mentioned to the Senator's colleague earlier.  There are sustainable long-term interest rates, regulatory intervention and geo-political volatility.  Within what we can control one can note that the price has risen significantly in recent weeks.  As we delivered a profit we have deleveraged CHL.  I am confident that within what we can control, investors will continue to support us.</p></speech>

The restrictions have been talked about a lot in terms of whether they should be relaxed.  What does the delegation think about the restrictions, particularly in terms of the Dublin area because that is where they hit the hardest?  An argument can be made that the restrictions have depressed or maintained property values as opposed to letting them run away with themselves as happened in the past.  Has the delegation any thoughts on where they should go?  Should they remain as they are?  Should they be relaxed or strengthened?</p></speech>

We think the measures promote a degree of resilience to financial shock as experienced during the crisis.  Therefore, at a principle level, we support the objectives of the rules such as increasing the resilience of the banking system, increasing the resilience of household sectors to financial shock and dampening the dynamics between property lending and house prices.  At a principle level, we are advocates of the rules.  At the outer margin, as we all learn, there can be changes to the rules to make them more effective.  If those changes come in then we will respond accordingly in terms of our lending policy.  In terms of the Senator's question on the principle of the macro prudential rules, then we are advocates of those rules.</p></speech>

The amendments are technical.  Deputies will remember that the Companies Act 2014 was a major project to reform Irish company law.  One of the aims of that project was to have an Act that could be updated easily without changing its name each time.  Experience shows that company law needs to be updated regularly.  By keeping the name of the 2014 Act, references to the Companies Act 2014 in forms and contracts do not have to be changed each time there is a new companies Act.  This is the approach that has been taken in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p><p>Section 4 of the Bill is the only section that does not amend an existing section or insert a new section into the Companies Act 2014 and, as a result, section 1 provides that the name of the Companies Act will change.  Amendment No. 1 deletes the references to the Companies Acts 2014 and 2016 and as it is proposed to delete section 4 the Bill, amendment No. 2 deletes references to section 4 from section 1.  However, the content of section 4 is important.  It provides for some early application of the Bill so that companies can benefit from the savings in time and effort as soon as possible.  Accordingly, amendment No. 12 moves the content of section 4 from its current place and inserts it into a new section 15.</p><p>In this way we can keep the advantages of the provision in section 4 and maintain the benefits of not changing the name of the Companies Act 2014.</p></speech>

Section 12 amends the definition of a &quot;profit and loss account&quot; that is currently in the Companies Act 2014.  The change in section 12 is needed to take account of the fact that some companies such as charities do not make profits.  Therefore, they do not prepare a profit and loss account.  Section 12 reflects that fact and refers to an &quot;income and expenditure account&quot; instead.  </p><p>Amendment No. 5 also addresses a further issue with the definition.  The phrase &quot;income statement&quot; is used in both the Companies Act and in section 12 of this Bill.  However, the relevant international accounting standard, IAS, does not use this term.  Instead it uses a statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income or equivalent term.  Amendment No. 5 replaces the current text with the language from the relevant IAS, for clarity and consistency.</p></speech>

The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the policy decision that underlines certain prohibitions and-or requirements that are associated with companies that undertake regulated activities.

This section is concerned with companies registered within the EEA while section 23 is concerned with companies registered outside the EEA.  Both sections make a distinction between the two scenarios.  The first is where the holding company owns more than 90% of the shares in the lower company.  The second is where the holding company owns more than 50% of the shares of the lower company.  However, when these provisions are inserted into the Companies Act 2014, there is an overlap because a company that owns more than 90% of the shares also owns more than 50% of the shares.  The amendments clarify that the second scenario refers to a holding company owning more than 50% but not more than 90% of the shares.</p></speech>

Section 306 relates to the provisions on disclosure of directors' pay.  The Bill replaces that section in its entirely rather than just amending it for two reasons.  First, it allows us to update the title of the section in order that it refers to the new section 305A.  This is a useful clarification for people using the Companies Acts.  Second, it inserts references to the new section throughout the section.  The new section will be inserted by section 27.  The intention was not to change the substance of the existing section 306 in any way.  However, the words &quot;for any reason&quot; were added to the text.  This could introduce a lack of clarity regarding what companies have to disclose.  It would also be too sweeping.  For example, a son or daughter of a director of a large chain of shops might have a summer job in one of the branches.  If these words were not deleted, companies would be required to disclose the salaries paid to the son or daughter.  This would be a burden on companies and is not justified in such circumstances.</p></speech>

Section 321 relates to the disclosure by companies of the accounting policies they have adopted.  The section inserts a new obligation on companies that change their accounting policy to disclose the reason for that change.  They are also required to disclose the impact of that change on the financial statements for the current year and, to the extent practicable, for preceding years.  The purpose of the amendment is to align the extent of the obligations relating to the current year with those relating to preceding years.  In other words, companies will be obliged to disclose the impact on the financial statements to the extent practicable for the current year, as well as for previous years.  This is fair.  It would be costly for companies such as large financial institutions to go beyond what is practicable.</p></speech>

That directive provides that the financial statements of micro entities shall be regarded as giving a true and fair view.  As a result, the obligations on directors with respect to the true and fair view do not apply to directors of micro entities.  That is a useful saving for very small businesses in time and effort.  The directive does not permit member states to go beyond that and the other rules that apply to micro entities.  However, section 40 provides that the financial statements of a micro company are deemed a true and fair view until the contrary is proved.</p><p> Section 45 makes a similar provision with respect to the report of the statutory auditor.  This condition appears to introduce a burden on directors that is beyond the requirement of the directive.  It also introduces uncertainty and that would undermine the benefit of this provision for micro companies.  Therefore, I propose to delete the words "until the contrary is proved".</p></speech>

They replace the current Schedules in the Companies Act and separate the principles, form and content of financial statements for companies, small companies, micro-companies, groups and small groups.  This approach is intended to make it easier for a business to identify the relevant provisions for its financial statements based on the size of that business.</p><p>These new Schedules refer to value adjustments as well as to provisions.  However, section 117 of the Companies Act, which provides for profits available for distribution, only mentions provisions.  Amendment No. 33, therefore, inserts references to value adjustments for clarity.  Section 88 already makes an amendment to section 117 updating the cross-references to take account of the new Schedule.  Amendment No. 32 deletes that new cross-reference and amendment No. 33 reinserts it, together with the new reference to value adjustment.</p></speech>

Section 621 provides for preferential payments in the winding up of a company.  It sets the order of priority in which debts owed by that company are to be paid.  Subsection (2)(e) of section 621 provides for the priority of damages and costs owed to the employees for an accident.  It was intended to carry over the wording from the previous provision that was in the Companies Act 1963, as amended.  However, the word &quot;save&quot; made its way into the text.  Amendment No. 34 deletes that word for consistency with the previous law and for clarity.</p><p>Amendment No. 34 also deals with an issue of more substance.  It addresses an issue that has arisen from a recent judgment of the Supreme Court.  In that judgment, the court confirmed a decision of the High Court to the effect that crystallising a floating charge before a liquidator is appointed can improve the priority of the charge holder.  The result is that the holder of the floating charge can effectively leapfrog preferential creditors such as the Revenue Commissioners and employees.  That is clearly contrary to the intention of the Legislature in giving priority to particular types of creditors ahead of others, including holders of floating charges.  Amendment No. 34 is intended to restore the standing of the various creditors and to ensure that the operation of a floating charge returns to its previous standing behind employees and Revenue.</p></speech>

Section 633 introduced requirements for qualification to act as a liquidator.  As a result, members of certain professional bodies such as accountants and solicitors who meet other criteria can be appointed as liquidators.  It is also possible for people with practical experience of wind-ups and knowledge of the relevant law to apply to the Irish Auditing and Accountancy Survey Authority, IAASA, for authorisation to act as liquidators.</p><p>Section 633 also provides that anyone in this category who wants to apply to the IAASA must do so on a prescribed form and pay a prescribed fee.  However, the word &quot;prescribed&quot; has a specific definition for Part 2 of the Act and section 633 is in the Part.  As a result, the forms and fees in section 633 should be prescribed by the rules of court.  That is not appropriate for an administrative scheme of this nature and was not intended.  Amendment No. 35, therefore, clarifies that the forms will be presented by the IAASA and the accompanying fees that will be set with the consent of the Minister.</p></speech>

The amendments are technical in nature.  Section 842 of that Act gives the courts a discretion to disqualify a person from acting as a director of a company in certain circumstances.  Before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, those circumstances included where a person had committed civil or criminal breaches of competition law.  Section 842 sets out the people who may apply to the court for such a disqualification order.  Again, the law used to provide that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and, in some cases, the Commission for Energy Regulation, ComReg, could apply to the court for a disqualification order.  Due to an oversight, these provisions were not carried over into the Companies Act 2014.  These amendments rectify that error.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 38 reinstates a provision that was inadvertently left out during the consolidation of the Companies Act 2014.  Section 192A of the Companies Act 1990 provided the statutory backing for the disciplinary procedures of the nine prescribed accountancy bodies in Ireland.  This section provides for the establishment, procedures and powers of disciplinary committees that look into alleged breaches of standards.  Through an oversight, section 192A was not carried over into the Companies Act 2014.  Amendment No. 38 rectifies that omission and reinstates the section in its entirety into Part 15 of the Companies Act.</p></speech>

Under company law, before 2014 it was not necessary to prescribe a body as the setter of accounting standards.  However, Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014 now requires that financial statements be prepared in accordance with accounting standards that are issued by a body that is prescribed by the Minister.  It is my intention to prescribe the Financial Reporting Council, FRC, in the UK as the standard setter for accounting standards in Ireland.  There is a long history of co-operation with the FRC and of using its standards.  The FRC consults Irish stakeholders whenever it develops new standards and it has formally established connections with some of the professional accountancy bodies here.  Their accountancy advisory council includes an Irish member nominated by the Minister here.  The Irish auditing and accounting supervisory authority is an observer.  The current standards issued by the FRC have been developed in line with the EU accounting directive and they provide for the new category of micro-entity.  The requirement of the Companies Act to prescribe a body will have the effect of placing this long-standing informal situation on a statutory footing.  As a result, the FRC will have a role that is recognised in our law.  Therefore, I consider that it is appropriate to provide an exemption from certain liability.  This exemption is modelled on the existing exemption for the Irish auditing and accounting supervisory authority.  In section 942 of the Companies Act it is limited to their activities of setting standards and issuing guidance on those standards and to cases where it has acted in good faith.</p></speech>

Paragraphs (a), (f) and (k) are technical and correct cross-references in the Companies Act 2014.  Similarly paragraph (d) corrects a typographical error.</p><p>Paragraph (b) addresses a gap in Part 7 of the Companies Act.  That part includes provision for the registration of charges with the Companies Registration Office.  Section 408 defines &ldquo;charge&rdquo; for the purposes of Part 7 and provides that these types of charge do not include charges on shares.  That is because shares are registered in another way.  However, due to the combination of the definitions of a company and of a share in section 2 of the Act, shares in section 408 do not include shares in companies that are formed and registered outside Ireland.  Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 40 is intended to clarify that shares in foreign companies are also excluded from the definition of charge for the purposes of Part 7.</p><p>Paragraph (c) is related to amendment No. 34.  That amendment addressed the priority of a floating charge in the winding up.  Here the intention is to do the same for receivership.  This will restore the priority of preferential creditors, such as employees, and the revenue ahead of the holders of a floating charge.</p><p>Paragraphs (e) and (g) are related to amendment No. 35.  As things stand, section 580 of the Companies Act provides that a report by a statutory auditor in a voluntary winding up by members of the company should be in a form that is prescribed by the rules of the court.  It is the same in section 682 with respect to a liquidator to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  That is not what was intended.  This amendment will clarify that the forms of the two reports should be prescribed by the director.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p><p>This committee is involved in a very in-depth item of research.  We propose to talk to the representatives of approximately 49 different organisations, ranging from businesses to enterprise developments to community groups and so forth, to get a good understanding from the experts in the field of what is necessary to achieve a sustainable rural society and economy.  What we are seeking to get, in the main, are in-depth recommendations from the witnesses' experience that we can add to our report that we hope to publish in the new year.</p><p>Before we proceed, I wish to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents submitted may be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by their official name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>In today's meeting we are continuing with the programme regarding viable rural communities.

We have also looked at different elements of it.  We hope to have the report completed by the new year.</p><p>I call the representative of Fingal Leader Partnership to address the committee first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1902" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil Moore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016112200002#D00200"><p>To give members some idea of the company profile, Fingal Leader Partnership, FLP, is a not-for-profit organisation with charitable status.  The company was established in 2009 following the Government cohesion process which saw Rural Dublin LEADER Company Limited merge with Co-operation Fingal, which was a community partnership at the time.  FLP has extensive experience and expertise in the delivery of the Leader programme across the Dublin rural sub-region, which encompasses the three local authority areas of South Dublin county, D&uacute;n Laoghaoire-Rathdown and Fingal.  The company also delivers other programmes such as the T&uacute;s programme, the Jobs Club programme and the Care and Repair programme.  Previously it would have delivered a substantial number of social inclusion-type programmes but currently that is the level of its involvement.</p> <p>  I have been working in community development since I entered employment.  I completed a BSc honours degree in rural development and have worked on the rural Dublin Leader programme since 1997.  I first started as a development officer and therefore I have extensive experience of working with the communities, small businesses and various other individuals in the crafts sector, niche food sector and so on.  I am currently working as acting chief executive officer with the company as the recruitment process continues.  I had a key role in the research and development of both the 2007-2013 programme strategy and the 2014-2020 strategy.  As a development officer, I have cemented strong links with the communities and businesses of the rural areas and have achieved many excellent projects in both sectors.  I also have a strong working relationship with the many key agencies and the local authorities which assist the rural areas in their efforts to achieve sustainability and address the many challenges these communities face.</p> <p>  In terms of the operational area, the rural area of Dublin comprises 410 sq. km, which is 42,000 ha, which is approximately 51% of the total area of the three relevant local authorities. However, the population in this area is 66,603, accounting for only 13% of the total population of the three local authority areas. Compared with the urban areas of these local authorities, this reflects a relatively less densely populated area.</p> <p>  The Dublin rural area is a peri-urban region, heavily influenced by the urban area within County Dublin, where the urban environment transitions into the rural environment.  The physical landscapes are varied, with the Dublin Mountains to the south, arable pasture to the north and west, rivers and streams throughout, nearly 34 km of coastline to the north east, and interspersed with vibrant towns and villages. However, while this landscape remains predominantly rural, the relationships with the urban core are numerous and complex, influencing employment, demographics and household characteristics.  Furthermore, population growth is resulting in urbanisation and the loss of rural and agriculture lands as parts of the county are ceded to residential requirements.  For the residents of urban Dublin, its rural hinterland is an enviable location for recreation and amenity and an escape into nature.  The peri-urban region is under expansionary residential and commercial pressures, resulting in rural towns and villages experiencing many challenges, not least the changing demographic in terms of population, with many diverse communities now residing in the Dublin rural area.</p> <p>  The effect of these pressures is a factor in the reduction in farm numbers and size between 1991 and 2010.  The number of farms in County Dublin fell by 47.2% during this 19-year period, resulting in a 22.9% reduction in the area of land farmed.  These changes and challenges are not unique to the Dublin rural area, but its proximity to Dublin city brings additional pressures which heighten the issues in the Dublin rural towns and villages.</p><p> In summary, the issues faced in the Dublin peri-urban area differ slightly from those experienced in the more traditional rural areas.  They include the loss of rural identity; the loss of cultural heritage; the loss of open space; the threat to the rural landscape; the threat to the rural environment and biodiversity; large growth in population with poor or no matching service provision; a growing youth population requiring early intervention to prevent problems; and issues arising from increased in-migration of residents of diverse cultures without social interaction opportunities for old and new residents.</p></speech>

County Kildare Leader Partnership is a company limited by guarantee.  It was incorporated on 30 November 2007.  It has charitable status and is based in Naas, County Kildare.  The structure of CKLP has evolved over the past two decades.  It conforms with the requirements of all the funding bodies and agencies with which we work.  CKLP currently operates under a voluntary board of directors.  It was originally established in 2007 in accordance with the governance guidelines of October 2007 issued by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The board is responsible for deciding the strategic approach of the company, the formulation of policy and the implementation of a range of publicly funded programmes.<br/><br/>CKLP successfully delivered the rural development programme from 2007 to 2013 and currently has responsibility and the authority to deliver the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, for the period 2014 to 2017.  Under the rural development programme for the period 2007 to 2013, some 232 projects were supported with &euro;8.2 million in Leader grant aid.  Under SICAP 2015-2017, operated by CKLP on behalf of the Kildare LCDC, we have exceeded key targets in 2015 and thus far in 2016.  For the calendar year 2015, some 1,081 individuals were engaged with on a one-to-one basis.  The target was 1,035 and 60 community groups were assisted.  The target was 54.  The number of individuals of 15 years and upwards in receipt of employment support was 808.  The target was 599.<br/><br/>In addition to these two key programmes, the company is also responsible for the administration of a number of other programmes linked to the main funding programmes.  These include the rural social scheme.  We currently have 22 participants and one supervisor providing supports to 28 community groups throughout the county.  We have applied for ten additional positions as part of the recently announced expansion of the scheme by 500 places nationally.  We deliver five local training initiatives, based in Naas, Rathangan and Athy, whereby we assist 70 unemployed people to develop new skills, enabling them to seek full-time employment.<br/><br/>We deliver two CE schemes, with 44 participants.  The first is called the business development programme and it is based in Allenwood.  It assists local unemployed people to develop business ideas with a view to self-employment.  The second scheme, the addiction services scheme, works with individuals in recovery from drug and alcohol abuse and delivers services and work experience opportunities to community projects around the county.<br/><br/>We deliver the T&uacute;s programme as the implementation body for County Kildare.  It is responsible for the employment of up to 300 unemployed people on placement with a range of community and voluntary groups, groups working with disadvantaged communities and local organisations that would not normally have access to employment schemes.  We operate one of the largest T&uacute;s schemes in the country.  It has supported significant improvement in the local environment and the upkeep of community facilities throughout the county.<br/><br/>CKLP, as a host organisation or host agency, supports the work of the South Western Regional Drugs &amp;amp; Alcohol Taskforce, serving Kildare and west Wicklow, in addition to Older Voices Kildare, supporting the employment of five staff members.  That is a brief overview of CKLP.<br/><br/>I have been involved in rural development and Leader programmes since 1997.  When I joined, the programme was called KELT.  It was delivering the Leader 2 programme.  It subsequently evolved into Leader+.  The most recent programme is the rural development programme for the period 2007 to 2013.<br/><br/>I have provided a more detailed pack of information on County Kildare and some of relevant issues.  I do not propose to go through all that right now.  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the issues we regard as relevant.  We have prepared a document in consultation with Meath and Monaghan Leader partnerships.  I will refer to three elements therein, namely, broadband, rural transport and renewable energy.  I have provided to members a document entitled Submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on its Examination of the Issue of &quot;What it Takes to Sustain a Viable Rural Community&quot;.  We prepared it collectively based on the CEDRA report and its recommendations.  We have identified a number of recommendations in the report that we believe are key, relevant and valid and which should be implemented.  I will speak about those on broadband, transport and energy.<br/><br/>On broadband, there are two recommendations made in the CEDRA report.  Recommendation 15 states:</p><blockquote>In the context of the strategic role of broadband, particularly from an enterprise perspective public funding for the provision of next generation services to rural areas (minimum 30mbps) needs to be ring-fenced and should be delivered as soon as possible.  Considering the widespread availability of speeds of 50mbps and higher in many rural areas, the priority must be the delivery of 30mbps minimum to all rural areas by the end of 2015.</blockquote> <p>Local development companies regard the lack of access to high-speed, low-cost broadband as a significant inhibiting factor in the development of viable rural communities.  We note the CEDRA report recommends efforts should be made to provide the minimum speed by 2015.  Currently, we are waiting for the roll-out of the national broadband plan, which is very much welcomed.  We understand that programme is on target to start delivering in 2017.  We hope to see next-generation broadband delivered in three to five years from then.  Any delays in that process would further widen the divide between rural and urban areas.  Broadband in rural areas is a real equaliser.  The sooner it can be achieved, the better.<br/><br/>Recommendation 16 refers to the need for population centres of more than 1,500 to have the right investment and speeds of up to 100 mbps as soon as possible, not lower than 40 mbps.  We welcome the roll-out of the MANS network to 94 of the larger urban centres and towns.  They are receiving high-speed, low-cost broadband through the initiative.  On the downside, the trend supports larger urban areas to the detriment of rural areas. <br/><br/>We welcome the mobile phone and broadband task force recently established by the Minister and we look forward to the identification of more immediate solutions to the provision of telecoms and broadband infrastructure in advance of the rolling out of the national broadband plan.  Local development companies believe the new Leader programme should be given a more imaginative and expanded role in the matrix of State interventions to provide next-generation broadband access, particularly in supporting community-owned and community-led initiatives, such as the B4RN project in England.  Currently under Leader, we are very much restricted to training and small-scale initiatives in regard to community development.  We believe there is a more active role for Leader in the rural development programme in this area.<br/><br/>On rural transport, a CEDRA recommendation states:</p><blockquote>The Commission supports the Government's initiative to improve and integrate the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) into the overall public transport system.  The Commission recommends ongoing and comprehensive monitoring of the programme in order to ensure that it is meeting the transport needs of rural Ireland going forward.</blockquote> <p>The restructuring of the rural transport programme has taken place and there are now 18 transport co-ordination units delivering rural transport around the country.  That has integrated rural transport into the wider public transport service.  When preparing the new strategies for the new programme, rural transport arose as a key issue.  No matter what community we went into, rural transport was a key issue, along with the need to provide more services.</p><p>Rural transport is key to trying to underpin the survival and maintenance of vibrant rural communities, particularly in accessing services that are increasingly being withdrawn from rural locations such as post offices, banking, medical services and Garda stations.</p><p> We welcome the additional allocation of &euro;850,000 in the 2016 funding and an increase of &euro;2.19 million for the rural transport programme in 2017.  This represents a practical and strong statement of Government policy to support transport in rural areas.</p><p> Recommendations Nos. 33 and 34 in the CEDRA report relate to renewable energy.  The commission identified that the most significant potential for renewable energy to contribute to rural economic development was through wind energy, marine energy and bioenergy.  As LDCs, we welcome the Government's commitment to energy-related goals in the programme for Government.  We particularly support the commitment to use the White Paper on Energy 2015 as a framework guide for policy between now and 2030.  We welcome the introduction of the strategy to combat energy poverty 2016-2019.  We look forward to the commitment to accelerate the updating of the regional planning guidelines for wind farms given wind energy is one of the three areas identified by CEDRA as being potentially vital for rural economies.  All local development agencies have identified renewable energy and the green economy as key areas that they will invest in under the new Leader programme.  LDCs are well positioned to facilitate the implementation of Government policy and to facilitate rural communities to participate more fully in the development of renewable energy projects that will derive community benefit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-22a.1909" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Ludlow" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016112200002#F00200"><p>Meath Partnership was first incorporated in 2006.  We are similar to other LDCs.  We run the Leader programme, SICAP, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS, in County Meath.  We employ 28 people on a permanent basis to which we can add 16 supervisors attached to T&uacute;s and the RSS.  Participants on those schemes are also employees of the partnership and, therefore, we currently employ 265 people under T&uacute;s and 16 under the RSS.  As with other LDCs, we are a registered charity and we operate under a voluntary board and so on.</p> <p>  We also specialise in European funding outside of normal funds such as the European Social Fund and Leader, which comes from the Government.  It is an area I would like to comment on briefly in the context of the creative sector.  We are currently involved in 21 projects across Europe, which are funded directly by the European Commission.  Recently we were awarded a &euro;500,000 contract to assist with the integration of migrants and the contribution of migrants to the rural economy.  We have five partners in five other European countries in this and, therefore, we will share in the work on this research.  However, it is more than research; it is also about putting the learning into practice on the ground.  That is a speciality area for us.</p> <p>  The various programmes in County Meath have had significant success over the past five years.  Through Leader and another programme we are involved in, we funded 66 construction projects, the total value of which was &euro;13.8 million.  Very often, it is important not just to consider the grant aid provided to beneficiaries but also the total sum invested by them.  That is where people will recognise the impact on the local economy.  While Meath is not County Clare or County Kerry, tourism is of significant importance.  Festivals and major events are important to us.  We have invested together with festival committees a total of &euro;4.358 million.  An independent analysis of that investment shows that the return to the rural economy was a little over &euro;13 million.  The impact of these programmes is significant.</p> <p>  We work through networks to a considerable extent.  We have the innovation business network, in which there are 87 member companies.  We engage with them collectively in addressing the needs of microenterprise.  We are also responsible for running the artisan foods of Meath network, in which there are also 87 members.  Our investment in the network over the past five years was &euro;1.285 million.  We run networks in tourism with grant aid under Leader totalling &euro;2.8 million.  We also run the later life network which looks after the needs of older people in society.  It is the representative voice attaching to the Meath age friendly imitative, which is a nationwide initiative.  The bottom up approach at local level is driven by our understanding of the Leader programme and it is very much put into practice through that type of engagement arrangement at a local level.</p> <p>  I will address three aspects of the question we were asked to present on.  Most of our effort has gone into looking at this to give as much assistance as we can to the committee.  CEDRA recommends that the food and beverage sector should be supported to facilitate product development and access to export markets.  The commission says the value of speciality food was &euro;615 million in 2012 with approximately 350 producers employing more than 3,000 people.  CEDRA also cites UK studies showing at &pound;1 spent on local food generates &pound;2.50 for the local economy.  Those figures are conservative in the context of the artisan and speciality food industry.  There are 87 such companies in our county, 30 of which received grant aid under the previous Leader programme.  We welcome the increasing support of the food sector with LEOs having become involved.  The local authority has also shown greater interest in this space.  Producers that have expanded over the past five to seven years from a standing start with Leader support are moving into other programmes to take further steps down the road.  In that context, I refer to the Enterprise Ireland-LEO engagement with SuperValu and so on.  The vast majority of support in that sector is for training, not for capital investment.</p> <p>  The central message in comparing information across LDCs is that the Leader programme alone invests as much and has a budget as large as individual LEOs.  More attention should be paid to the capacity of the programme to work within the food sector when all the agencies come together around the table to work on the future.</p><p>To avoid duplication, we see our role as working with nascent entrepreneurs who are establishing or trying to establish in the food sector.  At this point in time, there are 57 such entrepreneurs in County Meath.  I expect the position is similar around the country.  They must be supported to a level where they can engage to good effect with Enterprise Ireland and the SuperValus of this world and provided with additional supports to enable them move into the export arena should they wish to do so.  The softening of the position of Enterprise Ireland in terms of its heretofore only assisting export-only companies is welcome.  This will enable further growth of indigenous companies who do not necessarily meet the export criteria.  We also welcome the change made by the Commission and adopted by the Irish Government to allow for assistance via the Leader programme to SMEs in the food sector.  We were able to meet the requirements of the last programme in terms of helping companies to grow past the &euro;2 million point, in terms of turnover, and the ten employee target, but once they reached that point we had to opt, leaving a gap in terms of assistance between that and a company employing 50 employees, which was then the recognised standard for SMEs.  In other words, unless a company was a 50-employee, &euro;10 million turnover company, it did not have access to Enterprise Ireland supports.  We need to ensure these gaps are closed-off.  </p><p> In regard to the alignment process in bringing together the best of what is available to drive rural development, which I am sure the committee is familiar with, a massive amount of work has yet to arrive on the agenda of the local community development committees.  The focus of local community development committees at this point is on the social inclusion programme and the Leader programme.  The hoped for integrated approach has not yet arrived.  We did expect that there would be an interdepartmental committee established as part of the alignment process and that the agencies funded by Departments, in terms of the programmes for which they would be responsible, would sit around the table of the local community development committees so that funding decisions would be based on a much broader knowledge of what is available, but that has yet to happen.  It is hoped that it will happen.</p><p> The creative industries area was also examined by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, in considerable detail.  We had input into that process.  We gathered further information which suggests that across the EU, 2.6% of EU GDP is represented by the creative sector.  A lot of work has been done, commencing with the Amsterdam declaration in 2010, which has fed into European policy in terms of CCIs.  Significant funding is available in this area.  A pathway for the development of the creative sector has been developed, commencing with the Amsterdam declaration.  The successful pathway to generating more income and greater output from the creative sector at a rural level has been sufficiently researched and it now needs to be funded properly.  The Commission provides funding in this area but Ireland is not drawing down the funds.  For example, under the culture programme, in respect of which &euro;400 million is provided by the EU, the drawdown by Ireland was only &euro;200,000.  Under the FP7 - research and development programme - in respect of which &euro;57 billion is available, there were only two successful Irish applications for relatively small amounts.  This is very much the case across many of the EU funding programmes.</p><p> Local development companies are familiar with networking and sourcing the most appropriate funds.  They also have the capacity to apply for funds.  Currently, staff in local development companies are tied to individual programmes and so there is a lack of opportunity to seek other funding to complement mainstream programme funding.  For example, in terms of SICAP, in the past additional funding could be applied for by local development companies to support that programme and that would be counted as a success whether it was European funding or otherwise but this is no longer the case.  Likewise with Leader, because every moment of our time must be accounted for, if we spend any time making applications for other programmes, there is nobody to pay for that work.  It is important that part as of the structure going forward, whether attached to the local community development committees or, as we would wish, attached to the local development company, space and funds would be provided to enable expertise around the making of applications and draw down from the European programmes.  We specialise in this area.  In one year there were only two successful applications to one programme, one by Waterford Institute of Technology and the other by Meath Leader Partnership.  The next lowest application was in respect of Italy, which made 29 applications.  Ireland has been a member of the EU since 1971 but it has not yet learned how to access these funds.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The local development companies have the expertise to chase down this funding.  Given that role and funding for the specialist human resource required in that regard, we would be successful in it.  </p><p> The tourism sector is critical to County Meath.

We deliver broadly similar programmes to other groups but the two main programmes we deliver are Leader and SICAP.  Unusually for a rural group, we also deliver the local employment service on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, which we find integrates well with our local development company model.  We also deliver jobs clubs, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and a volunteer centre and, being in a Border county, we also assist with the delivery of the PEACE programme.  We deal with anything that fits within the local development and social inclusion remit.</p> <p>  The importance of integration in terms of service delivery, particularly in a rural county like Monaghan, which is 70% rural, cannot be over-stated.  In 2014, we worked with 3,655 clients.  We assisted over 1,500 people into further education and training.</p><p>We assisted 505 people into mainstream jobs and 488 into community employment schemes.  On small enterprise, I refer mainly to people who are unemployed and who want to start their own businesses or "necessity entrepreneurs", as we call them.  We assisted 89 new enterprise start-ups and worked with 162 existing enterprises to help them become sustainable.  That is a total of 251 that we worked with.  We also do quite a bit of animation work with community groups with 159 groups being supported during the year.  That gives the committee an idea.  It is about that kind of networking on the ground - pulling groups together, helping small groups look at the possibility of applying for funding and tapping into other funding schemes.</p><p> In terms of individuals, linking them to training programmes and jobs is a critical part of what we do.  In that context - and before I go into the main part of the presentation - the figure at the very end, figure 1, is something we have put together by way of trying to provide a conceptual view of what we think our local development company does.  It is the graphic at the very end of the presentation.  Successful rural development must be a mix of these things.  We stimulate rural enterprise through our Leader programme and through the back-to-work enterprise allowance scheme run under SICAP.  We work with community and voluntary groups and run a volunteer centre to stimulate active citizenship and involvement in community development.  We link people into further education training and lifelong learning.  County Monaghan has a history of significant levels of early school leaving and getting those people back to lifelong learning is an important part of development.  There is then job placement and the work we do on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  Well over 50% of our budget is from programmes delivered on behalf of that Department, a significant part of which is our local employment service which fits in very well with the local development company model.  On the graphic, members will see some of the deliverables.</p><p> I was asked to discuss the CEDRA recommendations Nos. 1 to 6 and 11 to 13.  Recommendations Nos. 1 to 6 are referred to as "foundation recommendations" and these are the ones it is felt must be got right in rural development if the approach is going to work and if the rest of the recommendations are to succeed.  Recommendation No. 1 is about preparing a clear and committed rural economic development policy statement.  Naturally enough, one starts with a statement.  CEDRA's rationale around that cites the complexity of rural policy.  It has been written about quite a bit and, since the foundation of the State, the issue of rural areas and equalising development across the country has been a talking point.  Local development companies broadly welcome this recommendation, particularly the need for a clear policy statement on an integrated approach to rural economic development.  We stress the importance of an integrated approach.  We very much agree that there needs to be a policy statement on this and will mention later the new Department and the integrated working group at national level and the importance of that.</p><p> Development companies such as ours deliver a broad range of economic and social initiatives.  The mix of both is important.  Working on the ground with unemployed people and others, we see the importance of doing the mix of social and economic.  One does not work without the other and both are necessary in a rural context.  However, we find that the funding Departments with which we deal tend to take a single programme view so that when one reports one's outcomes and figures at the end of the year, one reports them on SICAP, Leader and the local employment service, respectively.  The Departments do not see the totality of the figures.  In fact, some of the figures I have mentioned would probably surprise some of the individual Departments that fund specific measures.  As such, the much-discussed interdepartmental working group is really important to get a grip on things so that integration is seen at national level and local level.  The core competences of local development companies doing this mix of initiatives that get people into jobs, include them, tackle social exclusion and address unemployment are really important and must be recognised more as a strong policy instrument.  A one-stop-shop approach is one way to look at that along with, more formally, looking at local development companies as policy instruments on the ground in terms of delivering more of these programmes.</p><p> Recommendation No. 2 relates and refers to the establishment of the policy delivery and co-ordination mechanism, the creation of the ministerial function and the high-level implementation committee, to which I have referred.  We very much welcome the new ministerial function.  I am delighted to say that the relevant Minister is from our constituency.  However, the rural ministerial portfolio may not be ideally configured.  We would like to see the function cover SICAP as well as the Leader programme, particularly in light of the fact that they are the two core programmes delivered by rural development companies.  Again, the portfolio brief needs to be at a manageable scale.  We have some concerns regarding the co-ordination structures, the LCDCs, that have been set up at local level.  There was an expectation that a lot of the public money going into community projects would go through the LCDCs but we have not seen that to date.  The only moneys going through the LCDCs to date have been from the Leader programme and SICAP.  If that forum is to achieve its overall aim and objectives, a lot of the other funding streams must go through there as well so that they can fully consider the co-ordination of all public funds going into rural areas.</p><p> Recommendation No. 4 states that the Government and relevant stakeholders should be required to maximise the potential available funding mechanisms to support economic development in rural areas.  This is critical.  CEDRA's rationale on this relates to the integrated approach and it refers to the importance of maximising the funding into Leader.  In fact, it made a recommendation on retaining Leader funding at 10% of the RDP.  That has not happened and, in fact, it has ended up at 7% of the RDP.  The Exchequer co-funding was set at 38% unlike the rest of the RDP, which is 46%.  We think there will be scope to address that imbalance going forward because many Leader companies have suffered significant funding losses.  That would be very welcome in rural areas in terms of job creation, etc.  A huge opportunity has been missed in the context of the European Social Fund and the partnership application to the EU in that there was no application for the community-led local development, CLLD, method to utilise all the funds - including ERDF, ESF and EAFRD - in an integrated way.  Each member state had the opportunity when making its partnership application to Europe to use the CLLD method for community funding.  In the Irish case, it was excluded and left purely to the Leader method.  There is definitely scope for more integration.  The door is still open and it could still be considered.  Indeed, our national representative body, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, made strong representations for the CLLD method to be applied by member states and a good number of member states have it applied successfully.</p><p> I have a general comment to make on the other funding streams going into rural development currently, namely, the rural economic development zones, REDZ, and the towns and villages scheme.  We spent a lot of time in rural areas developing a Leader strategy and we put significant effort into public consultation to ask communities what they wanted.  That is the Leader method.  Shortly after that, we saw significant other funds coming in through REDZ, the towns and villages scheme, etc.</p><p>They do not go through the same type of scrutiny, they do not get the same amount of time to consult with local communities, if there is any consultation at all, and they are being delivered in isolation from the Leader programme.  At a previous meeting, one of our colleagues referred to possible duplication.  Under Leader we have a team for funding towns and villages but a separate new town and village team is coming, with no interlink or collaboration.  There is scope for greater use of the delivery mechanism.  None of the funding streams is going through the local community development committees as far as we know.  If the local community development committee is to be the real co-ordinator of these programmes at local level, all of these funding streams must go through it.  There needs to be greater use of implementing bodies such as the local development companies which have the expertise to deliver it.</p></speech>

From this, the function of the organisations and the development of the many groups and individuals with which they operate happen in a positive fashion.  I understand the total budget for this Leader programme is approximately &euro;250 million, which is a sizeable chunk of money in anybody's understanding.  From the committee's perspective, oversight is very important and we need to be confident the money is being spent in a useful fashion.  As Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; we have a responsibility to the citizens and our constituents to ask pertinent questions to ensure oversight is clear and transparent.

I have mentioned various activities the company is involved in, including our success in drawing down significant funds for the benefit of the county from the European Commission.  In our conversation with benefactors to the company and the corporate sector, they have an understanding as to what they support.  If we make an application for very substantial European programmes, such as the one I mentioned, the minimum cost of making the application will be approximately &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000.  Therefore, we seek corporate support to fund these applications because we are not for profit charitable organisations and funding must arise somewhere.</p> <p>  In general, the Chairman would find rural industries, in particular in the agricultural sector, are tremendously supportive of anything that would be for the good of the county or the rural economy.  This is essentially how we have utilised funding of this nature.  Equally, the committee should remember when Leader was first introduced in 1995, despite the fact a company might have been awarded a Leader programme grant unless it could prove it could raise a given sum of money to assist the operation of the company in investing it could not access the Leader moneys.</p><p>So in County Meath, that sum in 1995 was &pound;100,000.  There is an historic aspect to the ongoing support that is there from the rural and agri-economy in County Meath towards assisting the delivery of Leader programmes or other programmes of support to the community.  </p></speech>

Are there differentials with regard to the type of services that are being delivered?  Are some Leader programmes far richer in terms of the amount of services they provide?  If that is the case, is there a space for greater national co-ordination of different Leader programmes?  In other words, if one Leader programme was not availing of or drawing down services or funds, help could be provided to it.</p> <p>  The statement that LEOs are roughly getting the same amount or less funding was very interesting.  In my experience, there can be confusion and overlap between LEOs and partnerships.  Is this the case currently or is it very clearly defined?  Do citizens know that they should go to a partnership for some and LEO for the others?  </p></speech>

We are involved with three LEOs and three local authorities so we work with a diverse number of people.  When somebody comes in to see us for a grant application or support in any way, we talk to them about the sectoral agreement between the LEOs and us.  If we feel that the first port of call for that project is the LEO office, we refer them there immediately with a letter saying that we are referring them.  Very often, the support the LEO can offer is not what the client needs at that particular time.  They need capital investment.  We can give them capital investment while the LEO can give them other types of support.  Sometimes, it is not in the best interests of the client but the rule states that we must refer them across to the LEO office with whom we work closely to provide the client with the best deal and support available.</p></speech>

The first is economic, enterprise and development.  The second is social inclusion while the third is the rural environment.  There are a number of sub-themes within those themes.  The Leader model is a standard one with regard to what is delivered.  Budgets vary across areas but the model will be quite standard.  With the local community development strategies approved in each county, the LEOs and everybody else know what the potential funding is.  It is up to everybody to work together to maximise the money coming into each county.  That works quite well.  What the Department has encouraged is local agreements with LEOs through the local community development committees, LCDCs, to make sure this happens.</p></speech>

The idea behind Leader was always about looking at a local area and responding to its needs.  While Kildare shares similarities with Meath and Monaghan, there are aspects of and issues in the county that are unique to us.  There will be similarities with regard to the programme in general but there can often be differences because local issues differ.  The benefit of Leader has always been the flexibility to do that and allow a local development company to respond to local need.  We would have particular concerns in County Kildare about how the funding for the new programme was distributed.  Typically, in terms of Leader+ and the last rural development programme, you presented your case through your area.  Needs were identified for the area and how they were to be addressed.  Based on the quality of that information and approach, an allocation was awarded.  County Kildare was among the top five allocations in respect of Leader+.  Under the last rural development programme, we were in the top ten.</p> <p>  However, it was decided to use a different approach in respect of the current programme and allocations were predetermined.  County Kildare ended up getting 50% less funding for the new Leader programme but we still have the same issues that need to be addressed.  Unfortunately, the mechanism used to allocate funding did not benefit the county.  It is important to say that the county is often perceived as a rich county that has no issues but the reality is that 10% of the population of the county live in either disadvantaged or very disadvantaged small areas.  That is spread across the county.  It is not just locations in rural areas like Athy or the south and north west of the county.  It also applies to Naas, Maynooth, Celbridge and Leixlip.  In preparing our strategy as a local development company, we have tried to devise unique responses to those unique issues.</p></speech>

We would always have an excess of applications for funding.  In respect of accountability regarding funding, as local development companies, we must operate on the basis of a very robust and stringent monitoring system.  The Department's inspectors can come into our companies at any stage and look at any file, regardless of whether it relates to administration, funding or projects.  In respect of the Department's internal audit, its inspectors can call on our companies and review the files.  The programme monitors appointed by the EU also come into our companies and look at the information and files.  The European Court of Auditors also calls to our companies and looks at files to ensure that we are spending the money we are supposed to spend.  The monitoring of our companies and how we spend public funds is quite robust and multi-layered so no Deputy should have any concerns in that regard.</p></speech>

Could he outline the funds he is talking about?  Is no other arm or agency of the State applying for these funds?  Mr. Ludlow says we are missing out these nationally.  Do Departments not have a responsibility to apply for these funds as well?  He mentioned the relaxation of the export criteria for Enterprise Ireland.  How does he see this manifesting itself in practice?</p> <p>  I welcome all those presenting today and thank them for their presentations.  As a Deputy for Kildare South, I have a particular interest in the Kildare Leader Partnership presentation.  I concur with what Mr. Larkin said about the impact of the reduced funding under this programme, how disappointing it is and how it restricts what we able to do in Kildare.  Mr. Larkin has touched on the perception of affluence in our county.  Sometimes, we are referred to as "K4" instead of "D4".  This is a huge challenge in our county.  We have a few big headline employers like Intel, Pfizer and Kerry Group, and we are delighted to have them, but we have pockets of serious deprivation, many of which are in my constituency.  If the deprivation scale was the reason for doling out this State funding, I do not see how there can be any justification for a county with 220,000 people getting a lower allocation than County Leitrim, which has about 35,000 people.  This is what we are talking about in terms of funding.</p><p>It is stark and it will have to be addressed in the mid-term review.  That is not to take anything away from Leitrim.</p><p> The divide between population based in urban and rural areas is quite stark.  The committee is trying to remain focused on practical recommendations on what it takes to sustain a viable rural community.  From the briefings, there is a good focus on CEDRA, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas.  Do the delegations agree that it is the blueprint and it is just a matter of implementing it or are we missing something else which needs to be part of the plan?</p><p> Up to 40% of Kildare's population travelling outside of the county for work is not sustainable unless we accept we are happy to be a commuter county.  I do not believe anybody would be.  What do we need to do to maintain jobs in rural areas, whether it is Kildare, Monaghan, Meath or Fingal?  I know issues such as broadband, renewable energy and rural transport are factors.</p><p> We cannot presume that keeping people in rural areas will automatically save all the services.  An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union attended the committee last week.  We have to educate people on the need to use local services to maintain them.  Have the delegations views on the role Leader could play in that regard?</p><p> The formation of the local community development committees, LCDCs, came in under the reform of local government.  The roles of the local authorities and Leader groups are intertwined, probably more so than ever.  There is a network of local authority services across the country.  We have taken water services and some planning functions from them.  Local authorities have an important role to play.  They need to be reformed and are doing more with less.  How do the Leader companies see the integration with the local authorities?  How can Leader companies and local authorities operate better together?</p></speech>

I have been self-employed for all of those 20 years.  What I have done has come out of my and my family's pocket.  I am based in a rural community.  We have three businesses operating from a 30-acre plot of land and are ten miles from the nearest town.  Accordingly, I am well acquainted with the challenges of rural development.  One might think I am from Kerry, west Cork or somewhere else when in fact I am an hour from Dublin.</p> <p>  Before the recession, our company had 64 employees.  We now have eight.  The devastation of that in our locality, our parish and community is huge.  What does an employer in a rural area suffer as a consequence of being isolated?  In any of the rural development programmes put forward, there has never been an initiative that has focused on rural microenterprise or the entrepreneur setting up in a rural area.  The value of family businesses in a rural community is being understated completely.  The loss of that value is going to fall out.  I have ten grandchildren, ranging in ages from one to 13.  I doubt whether any of them will be employed in any rural capacity in any rural town in 30 years from now.  This is because we have failed to address the longer-term connectivity of policies.  Everything is based on one programme and the rules around it.  There is no joined-up thinking between different programmes.  I have been chairman of a rural development company for 12 years, so I have a good understanding of the rules and how they operate.  The fact that there is not any joined-up thinking between the different programmes is a significant failure.</p> <p>  There has never been any tax concession to rural employers.  Concessions are given to inner city or financial centre employers.  If I have to go to get a bag of nails at my local hardware store, it will cost &euro;4.  The time and the travel is a 12-mile round trip.  My competitors based in a peri-urban area can walk into a village and get a bag of nails.  Do I move my business to there or do I find some mechanism for operating in a rural community?</p> <p>  There is no easy way to access finance for small businesses, particularly in rural areas.  I know initiatives were put in place before.  However, if we are looking at how we are going to sustain a rural economy, we have to address those issues.  The banking sector has failed miserably to address this.  Rural development is in decline because a way of life in the countryside is in decline.  Our structures are geared towards urban centres and centralising control and power.</p> <p>  At the risk of using locker-room conversation-----</p></speech>

It is as blunt as that.  We have one of the largest growing populations in the country, yet 40% of every working adult has to leave our county for work.</p> <p>  I do not believe the issues are unique to Kildare.  However, having spent all my adult working life in Kildare, providing local employment in a rural way, there needs to be joined-up thinking between the programmes and a realisation that rural development is about people in the community, not about local authorities usurping - a phrase I used in my report for which I make no apology - the influence of local development companies.  It appears to me that there is a grab for funding and programmes, taking it away from the bottom-up approach in which local development companies are involved.  I have no axe to grind with anybody and I have no political party.  I have voted for every one of them in my time.  I am no longer involved in rural development.  I had 20 years and, under the ministerial order we have to rotate, so I am gone.  The way it is going is about process, funding, control and power, not about rural development.</p></speech>

I am a community representative and chairperson of Monaghan Integrated Development.  I come from a small rural community in Monaghan.</p> <p>  The reform of local government highlighted the importance of the local co-ordination of rural development initiatives.  It acknowledged the importance of maintaining the expertise, skills and local knowledge of local development boards.  However, we have had a host of other funding pots, such as CL&Aacute;R, town and village renewal schemes and rural economic development zones, REDZ, but our rural development companies have not been asked to implement these programmes.  It would make more sense to have an integrated approach to the delivery of these.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, we have seen the removal of many county councillors and State sector representatives from our boards.  Many chief officers of the councils have interpreted correspondence they received from the Department as an opportunity to stop appointing public representatives and local authority members to positions on local development company boards.</p><p>The failure to fill these positions is probably leaving our public representatives more distant than ever from rural development.  Many members are questioning their future on these voluntary boards.  They are expected to manage the governance of programmes, the plans for which they no longer have a role in developing.  They have a responsibility under employment law for employing the programme staff.</p><p> We now have penalties for failing to reach targets under the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  Local development companies were never meant to be commercial entities.  Where are we expected to find money to pay financial penalties if they are imposed?  We are not commercial entities and never have been.  The most important thing in helping to sustain viable rural communities is to give the people living in these rural communities an input into planning the future of their own communities.  No one is more qualified than they are to say what is good for their communities.  While they need the help of other agencies, they must be given the power to make decisions about their own community.</p><p> I will cite an example from my local community.  We are situated on the Border with Tyrone and Fermanagh.  In troubled times, we were completely cut off.  We had one way into the community and one way out of it.  We saw our community totally decimated.  We got support from IFI, INTERREG and other programmes.  We have built a community-owned hotel.  Between part-time and full-time workers we have a staff of about 30.  With the aid of Leader funding we have developed all-weather playing pitches.  We are providing facilities for the people of our rural community, which is as rural as one could get in a rural county.  That is because the people were given the help to do what needed to be done.  It was a completely bottom-up approach and not top-down, which is what is happening in many programmes now.</p></speech>

I believe they have the touch of politics because they are on the ground.  Certainly in the Seanad, we tend to live in a bit of a bubble.  What the witnesses have to say is disturbing and alarming, but also tremendous.  At least they are being part of a massive change and I hope the Government is open to taking their advice.</p> <p>  Who is running the best Leader programme in Ireland?  I do not mean the best county by county.  What Leader programme is being run brilliantly?  While it does not necessarily have to be from their own county, what Leader programme are the witnesses very proud of?  What Leader programme is extraordinary, different, creative, imaginative, working financially or whatever?  Which one would the witnesses most like to emulate?</p> <p>  This committee also deals with the arts, which Mr. Ludlow mentioned earlier.  Have the arts and creativity played any part in Leader programmes and, if so, what was that?  I rightly heard mention of rural transport, rural regeneration, energy and mobile phones.  However, mobile phones will not save us.  Ms Moore's document makes much mention about people being the message.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon asked about funding already.  Mr. Ludlow referred to creative funding that we are not drawing down.  Does he mean creativity within the sciences and technology or does it also incorporate the arts?  Why are we not doing that?  I ask him to go over that again.  I also ask him to expand on the need to pay &euro;5,000 to make an application and having to look for that &euro;5,000 from some corporate organisation.  How big an application would warrant &euro;5,000?  I believe someone who ran for the Presidency of this country once had a job doing applications for the lottery.  Am I right on that?  Why should it cost &euro;5,000?</p> <p>  With his experience, will Mr. Byrne tell me where the power lies?  If he could shift it, what would he shift and where would he put it?  Why does he feel Kildare County Council was shafted?</p> <p>  We talk about educating citizens to use local services, as the Deputy said, but we contradict that when we locate a Tesco at the top of the town and an Aldi at the bottom of the town and charge people to park.  We need to re-educate ourselves in a thousand different ways.</p> <p>  I ask all the witnesses to tell me about their older communities in Monaghan, Kildare and Meath.  In what way does Leader make their lives more sustainable?  There is not enough concentration on the elders and far too much concentration on the young.  I know that is on the record, but it is just me being a bit dramatic.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p></speech>

I am talking about programmes such as the FP7 programme, the 7th Framework Research and Technological Development Programme, funded by the EU.  There was a total of &euro;50 billion in that.  I mentioned that there were only two successful Irish applications up to the end of 2013, which is when we conducted the research on this.</p> <p>  Many other programmes, including Leonardo, fall under the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, EACEA.  In answer to Deputy Heydon's question, it is not the responsibility of any Department to apply for this funding.  It is not even that a Department would be eligible to apply.  The European Commission broadly supports the bottom-up process.  It could be a collective grouping of local authorities that make a successful application, as happened in the north west, or it could be a grouping of local bodies in Meath.</p> <p>  Most of the projects in which we have been involved have run through the EACEA at European level.  As many of them involve high-level European research, the European Commission will pose a question.  As it is addressing policy in 2020 or 2025, it will want the best possible European team brought around that table to discuss that issue and they will be given two years to address that question.  In addressing that question applicants have to invest in their own locality and bring the people together in that locality, decide how to address the question and get the input from, for example, the agencies and bodies in County Meath that are relevant, but alongside that they have to do some practical work in using that knowledge to drive the economy, social development or some other aspect of European policy forward at a local level.  They are driving it forward at a local level in five different countries.  They are not only researching the polity but are trialling a way forward that they will ultimately put forward to the Commission as a solution.</p> <p>  The Senator asked why it costs so much.  It requires a European research officer researching all of this.  It requires all these experts around the table at the outset putting this together.  A high-level submission to a body of that nature would need to run to 200 pages.  Unless an applicant is researched and spot on in addressing the Commission's question in a way that gives it the confidence that the applicant will produce something worthwhile, it will not get funded.  That initial investment is critical.  Those programmes ran up to the period ending in 2013, but 2013 is 2016 in Ireland.  We are three years behind in the context of moving programmes forward.</p><p>There is a whole new range of programmes at this point of a similar nature available at European level with very significant funding.

We have proposed a development plan for the sector in the Leader local development strategy.  This strategy could help to bring these people together in the way the Amsterdam declaration and the Commission decided was best, that is, to consider a cluster development.  It was found that when these different groupings or sectors are brought together, even more creative energy is generated.  We have the specialist knowledge and know-how to generate enterprise and economic activity by working with a collective group of people of this nature.  However, there is a missing element to this.  We can bring all these people together, and we have the Leader funding and staff to do so, but there are major funds at European level which could be applied to in order to further this industry.  However, we do not currently have the personnel to do so, unless, as I explained to the Chairman, we privately fund-raise and employ, perhaps on a part-time basis, the expertise.  We can then make only a limited approach to the fund.  Right across the spectrum, not just on these programmes, there are communities, enterprises and sectors which could benefit enormously from more collective support and from an individual being immersed in the community with the capacity to chase down these funds and drive the applications to the level required.</p></speech>

We were set up as not-for-profit organisations to operate on a non-commercial basis.

They must think how to generate reserves, for want of a better word, that will enable the company to do things that provide a commercial basis for itself.  The programmes we deliver are subject to penalties, and unless we have other resources identified to support and pay those penalties, this could be a significant problem for local companies.</p></speech>

Kildare was not given the opportunity to submit a business plan as to what its needs were and what the local community consultation process indicated was required.  The allocation of money was given before plans were asked for.  The reason we were shafted was that somebody carved up the pie and decided that Kildare would not get any of it.  If we were allowed to rely on our business plan, I am confident we would have got one of the highest allocations in the country because Kildare deserved it.</p></speech>

In Monaghan we have provided a lot of funding for festivals through the Leader programme to try to bring the festivals together.  We have many small festivals trying to buy IT and communication equipment and barriers.  We effectively got them to pool together and start buying this material collectively, and they now move it around as they need it.  These are practical measures.</p> <p>  The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, has spoken about the social economy.  Forf&aacute;s did a major report a number of years ago on the potential of social enterprise in Ireland and concluded that there was a potential to create 25,000 jobs in rural areas by 2020 which would have a particular impact on unskilled or semi-skilled workers and occupations that may have been displaced in the farming sector, etc., and a significant impact on social inclusion, health care, etc.  While some funding is available through Leader and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, for these areas, and we welcome that, there is need for a stronger framework from Government to support social enterprise.  Social enterprise can be very useful in the creative arts.</p> <p>  To come back to Deputy Heydon's point on practical policy approaches, one of the big issues we find in a rural county such as Monaghan is graduate retention rates.  We have the second lowest graduate retention rate in the country.  We send very well-educated people to Dublin, Armagh and Dundalk for further education.  We have a very good education facility in Cavan-Monaghan delivered by DCU.  However, we find that when young people leave the county, we do not get them back, and in the context of sustainable rural communities, the more depopulated a county gets, the harder it is to maintain service levels.  Regarding graduate retention, getting back to Mr. Byrne's point, we are asking if some stimulus could be provided to smaller SMEs that would incentivise them to hire young graduates.  There is a method in America called intrapreneurship which places a young qualified graduate with a particular skill set into a small business that maybe needs to grow but is stuck.  It gives that person the scope to use his or her expertise and skills, whether marketing or IT or whatever, and helps the small business grow and the young person create a job for himself or herself and maybe for other people.  This would not cost an awful lot.  Something along these lines was done by InterTradeIreland a number of years ago.  Graduate retention is a significant issue because the loss of our best and brightest young people from rural Ireland leaves an imbalance.</p></speech>

In fairness, it is difficult to be questioned on numerous issues, but at least they showed up.  We have asked the Minister for rural affairs to come before the committee for the past five weeks.  She has failed to show up and has refused to turn up to answer questions on the Leader programme.  This in itself tells me that the programme is in a bit of a shambles and that she is afraid to face the rural affairs committee, her very own committee.</p> <p>  I listened to what Mr. Byrne had to say.  It was refreshing to hear such honesty.  I have heard words today such as "control", "power", "politics", "fool" and "shafted".  I come from west Cork, which was solidly shafted.  West Cork Development Partnership appeared before us about three weeks ago.</p><p>Since that, it has been shafted, with seven members of staff involved.  It is a scandalous situation.  The people in that partnership have delivered honestly to the people in west Cork for 25 years, and they have been booted out.  We have invited the Minister to appear before the committee and explain herself but she failed to do that, so that tells me there is an issue.</p><p> I have a few questions, but I realise the witnesses cannot answer all of them.  Over the years, west Cork and other places have seen that many of the funds appear to go to less populated and more wealthy areas than areas where there is serious rural deprivation.  How is that and who comes up with it?  Have the witnesses experience of that?  Also, were any funds withdrawn from them in the last programme?  In west Cork, &euro;2.4 million was taken from the budget, even though it needed &euro;5 million extra, and that funding was never spent.  It is extraordinary that the powers-that-be withdrew &euro;2.4 million and the money was never spent afterwards.  West Cork desperately needed that funding at the time.  Do the witnesses have funds at present for projects in their areas?  When will the new programme be rolled out?  Perhaps my questions should be directed to the Minister, but the witnesses might have an update on the position.  In west Cork we certainly do not know what is happening or who is going to roll out the programme.  It is a complete shambles.  We are told that everything is on schedule, but how can that be when nobody knows what is happening.</p><p> The rural social scheme and T&uacute;s are hugely important in rural communities, as the witnesses well know.  However, the JobPath scheme has come into play and has disrupted the T&uacute;s scheme in particular.  Somebody might be identified for T&uacute;s but once they have been identified for JobPath, even though they do not have a job, they will not be allowed on the T&uacute;s scheme.  That has caused a good deal of annoyance.  I am aware of people in rural communities around Castletownbere and on the Mizen Peninsula who are on the roads thumbing lifts to places such as Bantry, 20 or 30 miles away, to try to keep in line with JobPath.  They have no job and do not know why they are hitching lifts up and down.  They might be offered a T&uacute;s scheme or an opportunity to go on a community employment or other scheme, but they cannot take it because JobPath appears to have overall governance.  Is it causing the same problem for the witnesses?</p><p> On broadband and mobile telephone coverage, in fairness every community is in desperate need of better broadband.  I was in Castletownbere yesterday where Eir was talking about rolling it out.  I strongly believe there should be funding for communities to provide the roll out of broadband in their areas.  If Eir or any other company has the main fibre optic cable along a main line but there are six or seven houses up a hill or elsewhere who cannot get it, they should be allowed to apply for funding under the Leader programme to bring the broadband to their community.  There has been a failure in this country with broadband and mobile telephone coverage.  It is an absolute failure at the highest level and there is no intention of turning it around.  I raise this issue continuously because politicians got it in the neck on the doorsteps during the election campaign, and rightly so.  If there was an election in the morning, I would get it in the neck even further because it has not improved.  Mobile telephone coverage has collapsed in many communities.  A merger was allowed between 02 and Three Ireland mobile telephone service providers.  Where in the name of God did ComReg come into that?  Masts are being lost in rural communities throughout the country and mobile telephone reception is being lost, but nobody is willing to take it on.  Only the community can take it on.  The witnesses know as well as me, as do people who speak honestly from the heart, that if we want proper broadband and a proper mobile telephone service it must be given back to the community, because the community will deliver it through the Leader programmes.</p></speech>

I believe the development of the food sector in my neck of the woods is based on west Cork companies' success with the fuchsia brand.  We made plenty of visits to see how the industry was advanced in west Cork.  It is a model we imported.  That was a massive success.</p> <p>  The question about funding relates back to the management of the last programme.  When making an application for funding at the start of the programme, all of us would have indicated the graph of investment or expenditure for the programme over a five year period.  As I understand it, the Department of Finance provided the responsible Department with annualised funding which did not match that graph by any manner or means.  That led to some excitement and almost panic that the Leader programme was not being successful, therefore, mid-stream the idea arose that those companies that appeared to be investing more rapidly than others should have open access to the funds of all the others.  That is what happened.  It was a very serious mistake.  It led to the Leader programme being guillotined on 30 August 2013, after which no grant was made available to anybody.  The money was not there at that point.  Equally, no grant was available from the Leader programme in the past three years to anybody in the country.</p> <p>  It was a failure of communication and a failure to take account of the knowledge that was passed on from the local development companies, in terms of the investment as it happens.  I will explain that briefly.  Normally, one will start off very quickly with a carryover from the previous programme.  Then there will be something of a dip.  As one goes through the first year one will see a rise, in the second year there will be a less gradual rise and in the third year the programme will zoom because of all the animation work and activity being generated.  There was a failure at programme management level to recognise what happens in year three of the five year programme, panic set in and west Cork lost &euro;2.4 million as a result.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of concerns about where funds are going, particularly in the new programme.  We have identified communities who, for whatever reason, might not have been making applications for Leader funding.  In those cases, there is often no solid or strong foundation of community people prepared, or in a position, to work and go through the process for take up.  In Kildare, we are actively identifying communities to provide the supports they need to make an application not just for our funding but also for other funding programmes.  One will always find groups that become used to, and very capable in, making applications-----</p></speech>

Some of our projects took five years to come to fruition because we were working with communities on large scale capital investment.  We had to tell some projects that we no longer had the funding for them because it had gone somewhere else.</p> <p>  With regard to how things will roll out in the current programme, we are in new territory as local development companies.  We are now classified as implementing bodies or partners.  We are no longer the local action group, LAG, in most cases.  New processes had to be created to facilitate applications and there is now almost a two-tier system.  One must have an expression of interest submitted before one can go to the application.  We have to put that information through the local community development committee, LCDC, and then it goes to Pobal and then to the Department.  Quite frankly, the time taken to get Leader funding will increase because of the processes we must go through now.</p> <p>  JobPath is having an impact on T&uacute;s, certainly in Kildare.  We have been given a four week window now, which is welcome, but we could do with double that.  If people are referred by the Department for T&uacute;s, we are doing our utmost within the four weeks to ensure we interview them, identify a placement for them and place them.  However, that might happen in a third of the cases, so there is an impact.  We must acknowledge that JobPath is Government policy.  It is what the Government decided to do and we cannot be seen to be negative about it.</p><p>I agree absolutely with Deputy Michael Collins's comments on broadband and community involvement.  There was a missed opportunity in the new programme on support for community involvement and investment in broadband infrastructure.  It is my sense that some of the more rural communities, even under the national broadband plan, will have to wait until the very last moment to access speeds of 30 Mbps, while our European counterparts are already accessing speeds of 100 Mbps and 1 GB.</p></speech>

There is a pilot scheme in the United Kingdom called B4RN under which the lines are owned by rural communities.  The lines are provided and managed by rural communities and are an income stream which is a very important point if a community is trying to raise funds to leverage other funds.  I agree 100% with Deputy Michael Collins on his point about local communities in isolated areas receiving Leader funding to help to establish broadband lines and then take ownership of them, instead of giving ownership to larger scale multinationals which will only feed the areas in which services are commercially viable for them, rightly because they are businesses.</p></speech>

We had a pipeline of projects worth &euro;2 million ready to go.  One can imagine the impact it had on our local action group and community.  It is no surprise that we are up and running under the Leader programme at this stage.  Expressions of interest are starting to come in and we will not find ourselves in that situation again.  The danger is, however, that it can be a case of being first across the line.  It is a five year programme which has to be delivered prudently.  We would not want to be in situation, anywhere, where local development companies or local action groups were rushing to spend money to make sure they spent their quota.  I do not believe that would be in anybody's interests.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the impact of JobPath.  We definitely find that there is an impact on T&uacute;s.  As a local development company that runs a local employment service, we also find that there is an impact on it.  Not every local development company runs a local employment service.  I believe there are 28 in total.  The staff are paid by the State and it is a standard contract every year.  We see no rationale for JobPath as a commercial supplier in a county in which labour market programmes are pretty well catered for.  Our local enterprise office is struggling to find enough clients to whom to deliver its services, as are T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  There is a real need for another look at the matter.  I do not know how far the relevant Department is tied into contracts with JobPath, but stock needs to be taken to assess the real need in bringing external commercial suppliers into that space. </p> <p>  The current Leader programme was referred to.  The process is complicated.  Potentially, there are about six to eight points in the process at which a project could be held up or stopped.  We made a number of applications and administration claims.  I believe we are into the third month and none of the applications has yet cleared the Department.  The process will have to gear up and improve by the time we reach project claims.  We cannot have communities and entrepreneurs waiting six, eight or nine months.  At a previous committee meeting one of our colleagues who had carried out an exercise showed that the wait could be eight months.  We can certainly see how it could definitely be eight months and that will grind down the process.  We note that before the programme started the European Commission commented that it wanted to shorten the supply chain for the delivery of projects.  In fact, Ireland has managed to at least double the length of the supply chain.</p></speech>

As it did not appear we were working efficiently enough, this amount of money was stopped.  In 2014 there was an embargo which had a huge impact on the manner in which projects were progressing and slowed everything down.  At the time we lost the &euro;1.3 million we had approximately &euro;850,000 worth of projects that we were not able to advance.  One, in particular, was a very high profile tourism project in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown region.  We were very sad to lose it.</p> <p>  I will talk about the supports offered under the programme.  We have substantially high numbers of seniors in the catchment areas across the three counties, with whom we work under the Age Action care and repair programme.  We have also established a rural challenge programme, a four module training programme.  We insert a facilitator with a body of individuals who are interested in supporting seniors at local level for recreational, educational and social interaction.  We have established a number of very successful groups across the full catchment area in the three local regions.  It is the same in the case of arts and heritage projects.  We have delivered a number of high profile arts projects, one of which is the Fingal Food Festival.  Initiated in pilot scheme form four years ago, it has gone from strength to strength.  Arising from it, we have listed as an action in our strategy statement establishing rural Dublin food hub as part of the programme.  The programme will be rolled out strategically to allow for a circumspective spend which will be targeted and aimed at achieving what is required and needed in communities.  All of the actions reflect what we have learned in the consultation process.</p> <p>  We must roll out our programmes in the three local authority regions.  We do this through public consultation and public information provision.  We have organised 17 animation events across the D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Fingal and south Dublin region, the last of which was held on 17 November.  From these we have gathered expressions of interest which we have submitted for review.  There is in excess of &euro;1 million allocated.  We have also identified substantial projects to be advanced.</p></speech>

The meeting has been very informative.  I will not promise a structured narrative from the notes I have taken, but I have a few questions, the first of which Mr. Ludlow might address.  </p> <p>  Recommendation No. 25 in the CEDRA report concerns the creative industries.  To take up where Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell left off, the first paragraph calls for an industry in which creative artists can live, work and excel to earn a living wage in this society and the rural economy.  An integrated approach is mentioned in terms of the need for a coherent voice, particularly on collaboration, not only within the arts and creative industries but also on policy.  The Departments of Health, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaelteacht Affairs and Education and Skills are all tied with the creative industries.  I would be hugely supportive of an integrated approach for the creative industries and to policy.  Is there greater scope for the local enterprise offices to support the creative SME sector?  </p> <p>  With regard to the Amsterdam Declaration and the notion of cluster concepts, there was reference to 40 visual artists, 85 crafts people, 91 people involved in film enterprised and 105 in creative enterprises in County Meath.  It strikes me that, as a starting point, the national cultural institutions which are mostly near here could be moved and regionalised as has happened in the United Kingdom in the case of the Tate Britain, the Tate St. Ives, the Tate Liverpool and the Tate Modern.  Our national cultural institutions could be made structurally and digitally accessible - it is a great scandal that they are not - and regionalised as part of a cluster concept and tied with heritage sites, for example, the site at Newgrange.  They could also be tied with work spaces for artists because there is a huge squeeze in urban areas to support artists to live in rural communities alongside national cultural and heritage institutions.  The national cultural institutions are among the top ten most visited attractions by tourists.</p><p>These groups spend far more than other tourists.  I would be interested in hearing the delegates' take on it.  What is the effect on the indigenous creative industry when young people - recession or no - are attracted to London because the creative industry here cannot support them?</p></speech>

From a Leader programme perspective, we consider our territory, for example, the development of County Meath.  We have been supporting the sectors I have mentioned for some time and some are more amenable than others to collective activity.  Artisan food producers, for example, would find common cause with each other more than artists might.  Artists work in their own space and it is more difficult to collectivise their activities.  There is one thing that can be done which we almost managed to do in the last programme and which I think we will do in this programme.  Young artists coming out of college face a major challenge in equipping themselves to follow their careers.  We could develop a collective facility with the heavy hardware needed, similar to the hubs created for the food sector.  However, the Leader programme does not have the financial capacity to establish it because it would be a major investment.  The local authority and the local enterprise office, LEO, are considering the establishment of a food hub between Navan and Kells which would be the shell of the facility, but the equipping of each work space within that structure would be to be undertaken.  That is where the Leader programme would step in.  We align with somebody who wants to occupy a production space and aid the specialised fit-out, while our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland or the LEOs invest in a different way.  If we were to bring all of the creative people together in a collective, there would be the possibility of developing a plan they would be interested in following.  We cannot impose anything.  We start the conversation and the work towards the development of what they would like to see in place.  The Leader programme will not put everything they wish for on the ground.  I would like, as part of the Leader programme, to be able to allocate some Leader programme staff time to sourcing funding for a Leader programme-led project.  That funding might come from another source or it might require time for consultation with Enterprise Ireland or other agencies in Ireland.  That is not provided for, but there is tremendous potential.  We know how to bring people together and operate the collective for the benefit of the individual.  That is the route we see, but additional funding is necessary to address the need, but from where will it come?  That is not a question lying out in the fog; it is one we will address.</p></speech>

We do talk to the LEOs and identify local arrangements about who has the first call in particular types of project.  That happens to varying degrees around the country.  Under the new programme, it is proposed to have a national protocol to provide an overarching structure within which local agreements can be developed, but we are not sure where it is.  Steps are taken to ensure there is as little duplication as possible at local level and that people know where to go in the case of certain types of project.  The Leader programme is often referred to as a funder of last resort, but we cannot replicate other national funding streams.  Because of this we are very often kept to one side.  Unless we can identify some bespoke intervention that is not being funded under another major national programme, we are constrained.  The interventions of Leader and local development companies must be integrated with other State interventions.</p></speech>

The only word of advice I can give is to make more use of the local development company delivery structures on the ground because in the restructuring there is a sense that some capacity is not being used or is being under-used.  New <i>ad hoc</i>funding streams can cause problems for the Leader programme.  As I said, the Leader programme is a funder of last resort.  We have to check to see if there is EU or State funding available.  If we have submitted a funding application for the provision of a playground, a Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rd Riachtanais, CL&Aacute;R, programme has been introduced and we have been told it can fund playground projects, we cannot fund the applicant.  The <i>ad hoc</i>funders that have come on stream in recent months can damage integration.</p></speech>
