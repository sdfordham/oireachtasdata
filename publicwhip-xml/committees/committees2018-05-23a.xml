No apologies have been received and we will deal with the business to be transacted by the committee tomorrow in the normal manner.</p><p>The topic on the agenda for this meeting is matters related to the submission to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of financial statements for 2017.  This is an issue we have been watching closely since the last general election.  It came to light on a couple of occasions when people were before to discuss accounts that, in some cases, were three years out of date.  We found that to be an unacceptable practice, but it does not apply to any of the organisations represented today.  We took a detailed look at the time organisations were taking to submit their accounts for audit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a couple of reports in the past couple of years on the timeliness of organisations in submitting their financial statements for audit and there has been an improvement.  Last year's report highlighted the education sector as being the worst in the public sector in the submission of accounts and some time ago we decided to meet the organisations concerned.  It was noted that of the 16 or 17 education and training boards, only one had submitted its financial statements for audit by the end of March of the following year.  That was unsatisfactory and we invited four boards to come before us, including the one which had met the deadline to show that it could be done.  We asked for the position to improve across the public service and were pleased to note at the last meeting that every single education and training board had its financial statements for 2017 in before the end of March this year.  That is a fantastic improvement.</p><p>As the year progressed, I sent a letter to all of the organisations the accounts of which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to remind them of the importance of getting accounts in on time, saying we would follow up in the new year.  We waited until the end of April, when the Comptroller and Auditor General informed the committee that there were 37 organisations which had not submitted their accounts for audit before the end of March.  The committee decided to invite four organisations to explain why.  We picked the four that are represented today based on the fact that they were substantial organisations with a major turnover.  They are the Local Government Fund, the National Training Fund, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Abbey Theatre.  We are grateful to their representatives for coming.  We wrote separately to the other 33 organisations to ask for a written explanation as to why their accounts had not been submitted on time.</p><p>We believe the submission of annual financial statements is an essential element of good corporate governance which in any organisation starts from the top.  When an organisation does not submit its accounts in a timely manner, it raises a number of questions about it, which is why we are here.  We are joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the National Training Fund, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the Local Government Fund and the directors of the ESRI and the Abbey Theatre.  I do not expect this to be a long meeting, but I am grateful to the witnesses for coming.  Part of the purpose is to demonstrate that the Committee of Public Accounts is taking a proactive role in improving corporate governance in the submission of accounts and financial information because we cannot do our work if we do not have accounts to examine.  We are joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is accompanied by Mr. Maurice Coughlan, principal officer; Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, who is accompanied by Mr. Keith Moynes, principal officer; Professor Alan Barrett, director of the ESRI, who is accompanied by Mr. Charles O&rsquo;Regan, company secretary and head of finance; and Mr. Neil Murray, director and chief executive officer, the Abbey Theatre, who is accompanied by Mr. Denis Reeves, interim director of finance and administration.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 indicating that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol that has been circulated.  </p><p> I thank the witnesses for submitting their opening statements and the progress in respect of the matter at hand.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills has submitted the accounts for the National Training Fund for audit on 15 May 2018.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government submitted the accounts of the Local Government Fund for audit on 17 May 2018.  The ESRI has submitted the accounts for audit on 10 May 2018.  The Abbey Theatre submitted its accounts on 4 May 2018.  From the public accounts point of view, mission accomplished.  </p><p> We, as the Committee of Public Accounts want to send a signal to all public bodies that we expect accounts to be prepared not for the sake of producing financial statements but as an indication of the level of corporate governance, because as the Secretaries General all know, it is a function of the Secretary General or Accounting Officer or the board of directors to submit their accounts for audit.  Failure to do so in a timely manner does not reflect well on corporate governance.  That is what we are clear about.</p><p> We will take the four opening statements in the following sequence.  We will start with Mr. McCarthy from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to be followed by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; from the Department of Education and Skills; Professor Barrett from the ESRI and Mr. Murray from the Abbey Theatre. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052300002#C00150"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee.  The committee is considering the timeliness of submission of annual accounts for audit.  I know this is an issue that is of keen interest to the committee and to the Chairman.  At the outset let me place on record that compliance with our obligations in this regard is also a key priority for my Department and for me as Accounting Officer for the reasons of good governance, as pointed out by the Chairman.<br/><br/>The issue which I wish to address specifically relates to the Local Government Fund, LGF.  The LGF, as the fund is known, was established in 1999 under legislative provisions introduced through the Local Government Act 1998.  In terms of the preparation of the annual accounts of the fund, the relevant provision of the Act is section 3(5), which provides as follows: </p><blockquote>As soon as may be after the end of each financial year, the Minister shall submit the accounts of the Fund to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and the Minister shall cause a copy of an abstract of the accounts as so audited together with a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</blockquote> <p>There is therefore no statutory deadline for the preparation and presentation of the draft annual accounts of the LGF to the Comptroller and Auditor General, a position which also applies in relation to a number of other funds, as recognised in last year's special report on financial reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, there is a very clear statutory requirement to produce the accounts as soon as may be after the end of the year.  That is a duty that we take very seriously along with all of our other statutory requirements in relation to the preparation of accounts.  <br/><br/>In that context, it is important to note that there is a statutory financial reporting requirement to submit the Appropriation Account for the Department's Vote by 31 March each year.  The production of the Appropriation Account and the engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Vote audit have to take priority for the Accounting Officer in the early part of the year.  This has been a longstanding practice and to my knowledge has never been identified as an issue of concern by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition to the Appropriation Account having to take priority, given the statutory deadline that attaches to it, it should also be noted that the LGF is a very detailed and complex account to prepare as the Department has to receive and reconcile annual returns from 26 local authority motor tax offices as part of the process and the turnover involved for 2017 for the fund is in excess of &euro;1.8 billion.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding all of that, the Department is committed to an expeditious and timely submission of the annual accounts.  This is demonstrated by the fact that a preliminary draft excluding the related notes of the 2017 LGF account was submitted to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 April 2018, barely two weeks after the Appropriation Accounts have been completed.  While this did not include all of the notes associated with the account, I understand it did allow significant progress on the audit to be made by the Comptroller's audit team.  As the Chairman mentioned, the final draft of the 2017 account with the associated notes has also now been completed and was submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 May.<br/><br/>Taking account of the range of financial reporting requirements to be met, I am satisfied that we have discharged our responsibility to submit the accounts of the LGF as soon as may be after the end of the year in question with the period of time involved decreasing significantly in the past ten years.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific statutory deadline, we continue to strive to shorten the period for the preparation of the annual accounts of the fund.  In that context with the fund undergoing significant restructuring this year, with motor tax now being remitted directly to the Exchequer rather than to the fund and a number of payments that were previously made from the LGF now being made from voted moneys, we will be looking to again shorten the time period for the preparation of the 2018 accounts for the fund.  Specifically, we will be aiming to have the draft 2018 accounts completed by the end of March 2019, subject, of course, to prioritising the work on the 2018 Appropriation Account and also just to mention it, it needs to take account of any potential implications that may arise from the fact that the Department will be likely to be moving to a new financial management shared service centre in 2019<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address an issue which I know is of keen interest to the Chairman and members and one which is also taken very seriously by me and by the Department.</p></speech>

We will now take the opening statement from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; in respect of the National Training Fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052300002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  I am attending today at the request of the committee to discuss timing in respect to the presentation of the National Training Fund, NTF, accounts.</p> <p>  The NTF was established by the National Training Fund Act 2000 as a dedicated fund to support the training of those in employment and those seeking employment and to provide for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy.  It has been the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills since May 2010.</p> <p>  I want to highlight at the outset that the Department is acutely conscious of the importance of meeting statutory and other deadlines for presentation of accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised concerns in this regard in his special reports on financial reporting in the public sector, and I know, as the Chairman has indicated, that this is an issue on which the committee has put considerable emphasis.</p> <p>  Informed by the views of the committee and Comptroller and Auditor General during the past year the Department has prioritised this issue, and has worked with bodies across the education sector to strengthen compliance, particularly where statutory deadlines are in place.  Considerable progress has been made across the Department&rsquo;s aegis bodies and in the ETB and higher education sectors.  I appreciate that this progress has been acknowledged by the committee.</p> <p>  In this context, it is important to say that the Department did not regard the NTF accounts as being comprehended by the committee&rsquo;s correspondence of 20 December 2017 which concerned &ldquo;the failure of public bodies to meet obligations, statutory or otherwise, in relation to the timely presentation of annual financial statements&rdquo;.  We did not take the view that we were failing to meet any defined obligations in respect of the NTF.</p> <p>  As acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report number 95 on Financial Reporting in the Public Sector, no specific deadlines are in place in respect of certain departmental funds.  This includes the National Training Fund, NTF.</p> <p>  The NTF accounts are prepared in line with the terms of the National Training Fund Act 2000, and specifically section 2(14) which states, among other things, that &ldquo;Accounts of the Fund shall be prepared on an annual basis, in such form and in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct&rdquo;.  Neither the National Training Fund Act, nor any other legislation, provides for a statutory deadline for production, signature or certification of the NTF accounts.  As regards non-statutory obligations, there are no circulars, codes of practice or other guidance which set out a specific deadline for production of the NTF accounts.</p> <p>  In practice, given the imperative of meeting the statutory deadline for production of the Appropriation Accounts by 31 March, it has been the longstanding position that production of the Department&rsquo;s Appropriation Accounts and engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General audit of the Vote are given priority in the first part of the year.</p><p>Since the establishment of the National Training Fund in 2000, finalisation of its accounts has, without exception, always taken place subsequent to the submission of the Appropriation Accounts.  Most recently, I signed the 2017 accounts on 15 May and they were conveyed to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the same day.  This long-standing position has not been flagged as an issue of concern by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in NTF management letters of recent years, nor has it been listed as a discussion item in recent post-audit engagements between the Department and the auditors.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the Department has met its obligations to date in respect of the fund.  However, I can also appreciate that, from the committee&rsquo;s perspective in looking across the entire public sector, it is desirable to have a greater level of consistency in meeting deadlines for the submission of accounts.  To that end, I have set a specific deadline for the submission of the NTF accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of 31 March following the year of account.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052300002#D00300"><p>I am the director of the Economic and Social Research Institute and joined by Mr. Charles O&rsquo;Regan, head of finance and company secretary.  We have been asked to appear before the committee to explain why our draft 2017 accounts had not been presented to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General by 31 March.  We are happy to have the opportunity to provide the explanation.  </p> <p>  By way of context, I will provide a brief outline of how the ESRI is funded.  It is a company established in the private sector.  However, almost all of its funding comes from public sources.  It receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In 2018 the grant is &euro;2.8 million.  The institute receives additional funding from a range of other Departments and State agencies, for which it agrees to conduct research projects of particular interest to them.  In total, it has an annual income of approximately &euro;10 million.  Given the public funds provided for it, the institute is committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and financial management.  We have worked closely during the years with our parent Department, originally the Department of Finance and now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure frameworks and processes whereby the funds provided for the institute are managed to the highest standards.  One element of the overall framework has been the presence of a senior official from the Department of Finance and then the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the board of the institute.  We operate under an oversight agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which was provided for us in March 2017.  We also liaise closely with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To my knowledge, we have always provided information for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in a timely manner when requested by it.</p> <p>  I turn to the specific issue of the timing of the submission of our 2017 accounts.  As the committee knows, in January we received the letter from the Chairman sent to all bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the general requirement to produce annual accounts for audit within three months of the end of the financial year.  Based on our interpretation of our ongoing interactions with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, at the start of the year we expected the timing of the accounts process to run as in previous years.  We planned to submit our accounts to our audit committee for review at its May meeting and subsequently send them to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  At the time we received the Chairman's letter, our accounts department was under some pressure owing to staff absences related to sick leave.  This meant that bringing forward the accounts would be challenging.  Arising from this, we emailed the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 2 February to seek clarity on the three-month requirement.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its response to our email did not specify that the ESRI was required to meet the three-month deadline.  As the email went on to discuss the arrangements for the audit of the 2017 accounts without reference to the three-month deadline, we took this to mean that the deadline did not apply.  On that basis, we continued with the previous schedule.  The draft accounts were reviewed by the audit committee at its meeting on 8 May and sent to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 10 May.</p> <p>  On reflection, I regret that I did not seek further clarification from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General around the time of our correspondence related to the Chairman&rsquo;s letter.  I took the absence of a positive statement on our question as implying that the institute was not being asked to comply with the three-month deadline, but that was a mistake on my part.  Looking ahead, the ESRI will, of course, meet the three-month deadline in the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Murray" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052300002#D00500"><p>I have been invited to appear before the committee to explain why the draft 2017 financial statements of the Abbey Theatre were not presented to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as required by 31 March 2018.  The Abbey Theatre acknowledges receipt of the correspondence, dated 12 January 2018, from the Chairman on the requirement for the prompt reporting of annual financial results.  I regret that this letter was not acknowledged, as requested, and that the issues raised in the letter were not the subject of follow-up discussions with representatives of the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was, unfortunately, the case that Chairman&rsquo;s letter arrived in the week when the theatre&rsquo;s long-standing director of finance and administration left on 19 January.  Our interim director of finance and administration, Mr. Reeves, took up his post on 28 January.  I express my sincere apologies.</p> <p>  It has been the long-standing custom and practice of the Abbey Theatre to present the draft accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s team on its arrival at the theatre to carry out the annual audit.  In previous years the team arrived in February or March.  For example, the audit of the 2016 financial statements began on 27 February 2017.  Subsequently, the audited financial statements were approved by the board of the theatre on 5 May and later published on its website.  In 2018 the starting date of the audit was significantly later.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s team arrived at the theatre on 4 May to carry out the audit of the 2017 financial statements.  At the time, the team received the draft accounts, on which it is working with the theatre.  In line with the later starting date of the audit this year, it has been planned to submit the financial statements to the board at its meeting scheduled on 30 July, having been reviewed by the audit and risk committee of the theatre at its meeting scheduled to take place on 16 July.  The board was provided with estimates of the provisional outturn for 2017 at its meeting on 31 January.  The plan corresponds approximately to the length of time required for the accounts finalisation process in 2017, albeit, regrettably on our part, with a starting time that is nine weeks later.</p> <p>  During the course of 2017 the Abbey Theatre was engaged in discussions with the Arts Council, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  While the theatre is not required by law to follow the code, I am pleased to advise the committee that the board has decided, in line with best practice, to implement it.  Its current plans are to implement all relevant aspects of the code in the period 2017 to 2019.  This process is well under way.  Implementation of the code, as approved by the board, will see the theatre achieving compliance by 31 December 2019.  This decision was communicated formally to the Comptroller and Auditor General by way of a response contained in the management letter, dated 16 February 2018.</p> <p>  I assure the Chairman that the board and the executive of the Abbey Theatre will put in place the appropriate actions to ensure that in future years the requirements set by the committee to have the annual financial statements ready for audit by 31 March of the following year will be met in full.</p></speech>

As I know that they are busy, we will keep it short.  </p> <p>  I address the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He put a spotlight on this issue some time ago when he reported on the timely presentation of accounts.  From his experience, since he and the committee looked at and examined the issue, what progress has been made?</p></speech>

The Deputy will appreciate, having heard the opening statements of the Accounting Officers, that it is a complex process.  There are a lot of ducks that have to be in a row to receive a signed set of financial statements and ready for presentation to the Oireachtas.  We have to work collaboratively.  The Deputy has heard about the level of engagement, to which there are many aspects.  I am happy that significant progress has been made.  There will be another special report which I expect to finish quite soon on the 2016 financial statements.  As the Chairman said, I have reported even further progress on the 2017 financial statements, particularly in the education sector where I had reported a systemic problem.  Good progress has been made, even in the case of funds, where priority is given to the Vote, as the two Accounting Officers said.  We have progressively been able to get to the funds earlier such that the financial statements are ready for submission earlier.</p></speech>

The timeframe for submission is relatively tight anyway.  Going back to 2015, for instance, the introduction of financial reporting standard 102 required a significant additional effort around the time of carrying out the audits.  That applied, certainly, to the Abbey and to the ESRI.  For the 2017 sets of financial statements, the implementation of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies is having a significant effect as well.  There are different challenges in different years and there can be surprises for organisations when they come to deal with new requirements, etc.</p></speech>

Every opening statement states the same.  If we are to include this in one of our periodic reports, that may be something that should be looked at.  I do not see how we can arbitrarily invent a timeframe that is not set out specifically in the code.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states the code is not voluntary, but at the same time it is vague.  I thank the Accounting Officers for their opening statements.</p></speech>

If there was never a statutory date, just because there is no statutory obligation to do something is not a reason for not doing it.  Good corporate governance should dictate that the accounts would be submitted in a timely manner.  That is all we are trying to achieve here.  There might not be a statutory backup to the good corporate governance that we are trying to achieve but it is good that we should try to do that.

I would imagine this has come up before our time as members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Is there a good reason there was not a specific requirement in terms of a timeframe included in the code, which states, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has it, "as soon as may be", after the end of the financial year.</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane has stolen my thunder because the two questions I was going to hone in on have been asked and answered.  The opening statements are appreciated.  The common theme throughout, as rightly highlighted by Deputy Cullinane, highlights what we could call a deficiency in terms of the specific data upon which accounting reports should be presented in a timely way.</p> <p>  To touch upon what Mr. Murray stated on the implementation of the code of practice for State bodies, in terms of the length of time it is taking, as a general point as opposed to anything adversarial, I would be of the view that two years is quite a long time.  I am not an accountant but I have dabbled in accounting departments over the years in my former career.  Two years seems to be quite a long time.  Does Mr. Murray believe the Abbey is adequately staffed to cater for the code of practice?  Is that a normal implementation period?</p></speech>

What we need to do is go through it, literally, line by line, to see.  We occupy a slightly strange position in that we are funded by the Arts Council rather than directly by the State.  We occupy a slightly anomalous position in that way.  We need to go through the whole document, literally, line by line, to work out which bits actually are relevant to our operation.  Certainly, if we can accelerate that process, we will, but that is the timeline that has been agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

For example, KBC Bank, Bank of Ireland and AIB, through us, undertake what are known as sentiment indicators.  The Deputy may have heard of the KBC/ESRI consumer sentiment index.  We do a data collection exercise for them and then we report on the trends in consumer sentiment or whatever the other indices are.  There is this small bit of funding that comes from those agencies.  There may be one or two others - I do not think so.  Essentially, one is talking about 96% or 97%.</p> <p>  The reasoning behind the establishment in the private sector goes back to some sort of a notion that the ESRI should be independent of the State in some shape or form.

He was before the committee a short time ago in respect of the special report and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the Local Government Fund and the many strands of funding that come into the Department.  In his final points, he made reference to the fact that the fund is undergoing significant restructuring this year with the motor tax receipts now being remitted directly to the Exchequer rather than to the fund and that will shorten the time period for the preparation of the 2018 accounts for the fund.  Can he elaborate, for my benefit and the benefit of other members, and particularly many interested others?  The overall fund was &euro;1.8 billion, which is a significant amount of money.</p><p>The motor tax element accounts for &euro;1.1 billion of that, so this is a very significant amount of money.  It generates a lot of public discourse and debate.  I am interested in the impact of that change and how its extraction is going to be accounted for now.  If it is not in the Local Government Fund how will it be reflected in terms of the return next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018052300002#F00200"><p>Back in the mists of time, when the fund was first established under the 1998 legislation, a policy decision was taken that motor tax would go into this fund on the basis that a significant proportion of the funding coming out on the other side would fund local authorities for a whole range of functions, including for roads related functions, which were then a part of our Department.  That was 20 years ago, and we have gone through four, if not five, reconfigurations in the meantime.  I was before this committee in March and made the point - and I believe Deputy Connolly made the same point the year before - that the fund, through those four or five reconfigurations, had outlived its usefulness in terms of the form it took because it had become very complex in terms of money going in and out for a range of functions which are now much more widely distributed across a range of Government Departments.  We put a position to Government last year on this matter and it agreed that we should simplify things.  In 2018 that means that motor tax no longer goes into the Local Government Fund but goes straight to the Exchequer and so will be accounted for in the general finance accounts in the same way as other taxation streams that go straight to the Exchequer are accounted for, and that the Local Government Fund, with effect from this year, will primarily become a fund from which local property tax is taken in and paid out to local authorities.  In quantum terms, the revenue position and the expenditure position of the fund in 2017 would have been about &euro;1.8 billion, as I mentioned in my opening statement.  The effect of the streamlining and the changes that are introduced this year bring that back to about &euro;600 million.  In effect the quantum of turnover is approximately one third.</p></speech>

One of the complications that has arisen over the course of the years when departmental functions were being changed around was that motor tax came into the Local Government Fund.  One of the payments out of the fund was to the Department of Transport, which then paid the local authorities for roads, for example.  One of the streamlining and transparency-boosting features of the arrangements for 2018 is that motor tax will go into the Exchequer.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be funded through the Vote in the ordinary way for its roads programme, and it will pay the money straight on to local authorities.</p></speech>

It is no longer a problem for us, but getting returns in from the 28 different motor tax offices and checking them was a big job.

There was some discussion on that issue in March.  That distribution of local property tax funding to local authorities is on the basis of what we call an 80:20 model, where 80% is retained locally and 20% goes into a central fund to assist local authorities with lower property tax bases.  That has been built on historical baselines, and I indicated in March that we were establishing a process to review those historical baselines of funding for local authorities.  That process has just got under way and is scheduled to be completed, I believe, in August.  </p></speech>

IPRT views gaps in mental health provision as one symptom of wider social exclusion and is intrinsically linked to criminal justice and penal policy.  The committee can refer to the briefing provided for the detailed sources supporting our key points but during this oral hearing, we will highlight those which we consider most pertinent.</p> <p>  The level of mental ill-health difficulty in the Irish penal system is overwhelming in both its scale and complexity, and the challenges are growing daily.  Walking through our prisons, that current reality is evident on every landing and every wing and ranges from the severely psychiatrically unwell to those experiencing anxiety and depression.  This should come as no surprise.  The experiences which precede incarceration are often marked by multiple vulnerabilities, including adversity, trauma, abuse, violence, addiction, and experiences of care, poverty and homelessness.  The experience of prison itself such as overcrowding, enforced solitude, lack of privacy, lack of meaningful activity, violence, isolation, insecurity about future prospects and broken family relationships compounds those problems.  It can actively exacerbate existing mental health issues, heighten vulnerability and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide.  Why then does the State continue to warehouse those with the most complex needs in prisons that of themselves both cause and exacerbate existing mental illness?</p> <p>  A decade ago, 3% of the prison population had a severe, enduring and disabling mental illness such as schizophrenia.  Since 2015, this has more than doubled to 7% to 8% of the prison population.  A 2005 study on the prevalence of mental illness among prisoners in Ireland showed that for sentenced prisoners taking into account all mental illnesses, the rate for men was 27% and for women almost twice that level, at 60%.  More recently, those working on the ground report to the IPRT that even higher overall levels of need are present and, within that, there are increasing complexities and multiple vulnerabilities.  In addition, our prison population is rising.  After a period of relative stability, more and more of those convicted have been sentenced to prison and our female prisons are consistently overcrowded.  At the same time, both the Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service face difficulty recruiting sufficient staff to meet the overwhelming need.</p> <p>  In 2015 the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, said: "Irish prisons continue to detain persons with psychiatric disorders too severe to be properly cared for in a prison setting."  The committee recommended that Irish authorities enhance the availability of beds in psychiatric care facilities for acute mentally unwell prisoners.  It particularly queried the level of psychiatric care provided at Castlerea Prison and the long waiting list for the CMH.  Similar concerns were voiced in 2011, yet seven years later there is still a lengthy waiting list for the CMH, there is no psychiatrist at Castlerea Prison and we still have the lowest ratio of psychiatric beds in Europe.  The CPT will return to Ireland next year to inspect our prisons.  After this hearing has concluded and after the Oireachtas committee report is published, will the committee witness the same indefensible state of affairs they saw three years ago?  I ask this committee to consider in the coming years what will have changed.</p><p>While the focus of this hearing is on psychiatric care, the terms of reference of this committee is to look at the future of mental health broadly in Ireland.  A properly resourced mental healthcare profession in the community at the earliest point and especially for children will reduce the number of those coming into contact with adult criminal justice system.  Researchers and clinicians agree that early mental health assessment is required in order to prevent escalation of need.<br/><br/>On 14 May,<b></b>the<b><i></i></b><i>Irish Examiner </i>reported that almost 2,700 children are currently on the list for mental health appointments with 368 having waited over 12 months.  This has been described as a service reaching crisis point.  Failing to resource the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, increases the number who end up in our penal system.  In Oberstown in April of this year, there were concerns for 23 out of 50 young people in respect of their mental health, 13 had a history of self-harm and 32 had been misusing alcohol and-or drugs prior to detention.<br/><br/>Mental health care provision in the community is also especially relevant to continuity of care on release.<b></b>While prison-based medical personnel make great efforts to create these links, they report there is effectively no adult psychology service available to which to refer in the community.<br/><br/>We note that the committee has been specifically tasked with examining the &quot;significant challenges in the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel&quot;.  The current ratio of senior psychologists to prisoners is in the region of 1:260 but should be in the region of approximately 1:150.  A Vision for Change recommended that &quot;[w]here mental health services are delivered in the context of prison, they should be person-centred, recovery-oriented and based on evolved and integrated plans.&rdquo;  It is simply not possible to deliver that level of service to all who need it in a situation where prisons cannot recruit a sufficient number of psychologists.<br/><br/>High support units provide expert support to prisoners who are in an acutely disturbed phase of mental illness as a short-term intervention within the prison.  There are currently only two in operation but it has been recommended that one is required in all prisons.<br/><br/>The number of secure forensic beds for the mentally ill is currently the lowest in Europe at two per 100,000.  As of April 2018, 26 prisoners were awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, from prison.  There is no published data of how long each individual prisoner waits to be transferred but it appears that many lower on the waiting list for a transfer are unlikely to be transferred due to the lack of available spaces.<br/><br/>Twelve years ago, A Vision for Change recommended that the CMH &ldquo;be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up to date humane setting&quot; and to maximise capacity.  With the opening of the new facility at Portrane, the psychologist-prisoner ratio of 2:100,000 is likely to only reduce to 3.5:100,000, which is still well below European average.  The alarming growth in the prison population during the past six months makes this situation even more concerning.<br/><br/>The Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douch was published in May 2014 and found at that time there was &quot;reckless disregard for the health and safety&quot; of prisoners and staff alike in a decision taken to transfer a prisoner who had been assessed as &quot;acutely psychotic&quot; to Mountjoy Prison.  At that, I commented that &quot;if there can be any positive legacy at all from this tragedy then it should be that concrete and effective changes will be swiftly introduced&quot;.  That report contained 35 recommendations specifically in the area of mental healthcare and treatment in Irish prisons.  Four years later, while an interdepartmental group was set up in 2012 it is unclear to what extent, if any, those responsible for implementation have taken action. <br/><br/>In April 2018, more than 500 prisoners in our prisons were on a restricted regime with the majority of those prisoners held on 21-hour lock up.  This practice is detrimental to any prisoner's mental health.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, has recommended that the maximum period an individual spends in solitary confinement is 15 days and beyond that point the psychological damage may become irreversible.  Similarly, suicides are over-represented among the prison population. <br/><br/><b></b>In brief, the human reality of the combination of failures to provide sufficient mental health services at an early point, coupled with the failure to provide sufficient spaces in our acute and psychiatric facilities along with tough-on-crime rhetoric, results in: mentally unwell women in the D&oacute;chas Centre sharing cells; prison staff trying to cope with high numbers in unsuitable facilities; and Ireland contemplating a bleak future in which nothing has changed and nothing changes.<br/><br/>In our view there are many things that can be done to start to improve the situation, which we have set out in our briefing document.  In short, before prison, we propose: more investment and use of prevention and early intervention supports; urgently addressing the current waiting list for children and young people could be urgently addressed; the development of  diversion schemes in courts and police stations; and in respect of Central Mental Hospital to ensure sufficient spaces and provide sufficient deal to deal with those with severe mental illness.  In prison, we propose: solitary confinement should be prohibited and access to justice for those in solitary confinement; implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douch; the provision of  enough prison psychologists to reach an appropriate ratio; ensuring all prisons have a high support unit; ensuring single cell accommodation for every prisoner; and to make mental health training available for every prison staff member.  After prison, we propose the making of links to the community, linking with psychology supports or to make them available if they do not exist. <br/><br/>We urge the committee to do everything that is within its power to make an impact on the ground for those who are currently suffering in our prisons and detention schools and those staff and professionals who are trying to cope with an untenable situation.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Enda Kelly, a national operational nurse manager.  I hope the information we and the other representatives provide will assist in viewing solutions to help prisoners who are suffering from a mental illness.</p> <p>  The management of persons committed to prison presenting with severe and enduring mental illness is one of the major challenges to effective healthcare in prisons.  There is evidence from the national forensic mental health service team, which is supported by our healthcare staff, of an increasing number of prisoners requiring treatment for mental health issues within our prisoners.</p> <p>  On 18 May, we had just under 4,000 prisoners in custody.  Of that number, 323 were on the caseload of the national forensic team and they were deemed to be suffering from severe mental illness.  Behind that group, there are another several hundred prisoners.  </p> <p>  The national forensic mental health team at the CMH provides an in-service to us.  It also provides a court diversion service to the Irish Prison Service.  This includes consultant forensic psychiatrists, non-consultant hospital doctors, community forensic psychiatric nurses, social workers and other staff.  The standards of care for the provision of services to prisoners with mental health difficulties include assessment, prison in-reach and ongoing treatment within the prison setting or escalation to the forensic team at the CMH.  The prison in-reach arrangements provided by the national forensic mental health team are an excellent example of partnership working and provide an invaluable service to a significant body of prisoners who suffer from a severe mental disorder.  The in-reach team to prisons has expanded in recent years with additional consultants, nursing and social work resources.  Approval was granted by the HSE in 2016 to provide consultant-led mental health services to Limerick, Cork and Castlerea prisons, which was a most welcome development.  However, it has not been possible for the HSE to recruit consultant forensic psychiatrists for those three prisons. </p> <p>  Significant problems have been experienced in Castlerea Prison specifically as the national forensic mental health service in-reach to that prison was discontinued in April.  Regrettably, that has resulted in the necessity to transfer very ill prisoners from Castlerea to a Dublin prison for assessment, which is not only problematic from a logistical perspective but it is less than ideal for those suffering from a major mental illness.</p> <p>  The Irish prison psychology service also plays a key role in helping to deal with mental wellness and prisoners to cope with imprisonment.  The psychology service consists of the head of psychology, eight senior psychologists, 11 staff grades and nine assistant psychologists.  They undertake a range of mental health supports, including interventions matched to the severity of the presentation.  Interventions include self-help, psychoeducational workshops and individual and group-based therapies. </p> <p>  There is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality when mentally ill prisoners come to the end of their sentence.  To help manage that increased risk, a pre-release planning programme with HSE social workers was established in Mountjoy Prison.  This pre-release planning intervention has shown that collaboration between the national forensic team, the Prison Service and community based supports greatly improves sentence-planning for mentally ill people and 91% were accepted by community mental health teams on return from Mountjoy Prison.</p><p>Some 91% were accepted by the community mental health teams on return from Mountjoy Prison.  It shows something can work.  However, notwithstanding the in-reach and psychology services available, and the positive examples of collaborative working, the fact remains that imprisonment is inappropriate for people with severe and enduring mental illness as prisons are not therapeutic environments.</p><p> With regard to admission to the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, a waiting list is operated by the national forensic mental health team and is reviewed weekly.  Over the last ten years, the waiting list has fluctuated from between five and 30 prisoners at any one time.  It should be noted that all prisoners placed on the waiting list have been clinically assessed as warranting admission to the CMH, which is a tertiary care facility.  Today in Cloverhill Prison there are in excess of 15 prisoners deemed to require admission to the Central Mental Hospital.  Overall, there are 30 people on the waiting list for the Central Mental Hospital facility.  The continued detention of these individuals without proper access to the services and inputs of an appropriate clinical team exacerbates and increases the morbidity of the prisoners concerned.  Leaving people untreated increases risk.  The absence of appropriate access to admission beds for all prisoners who have been deemed to require such admission also exacerbates the risk to our staff in managing prisoners with serious mental health issues in a prison setting.</p><p> The Irish Prison Service has invested heavily in training and education for staff in dealing with individuals with mental health issues.  Notwithstanding the clinical expertise of Irish Prison Service staff, supported by the in-reach staff, considerable clinical, individual and corporate risks remain.  The disproportionate draw on resources to facilitate, protect and afford the best quality of life for prisoners with severe mental illness in custody means that others' services  are disadvantaged and restricted.  It has to be remarked that the input of prison officers is the mainstay of providing the best quality of life possible for such prisoners in custody, and I wish to specifically acknowledge the work done by our healthcare and discipline staff who are managing this level of difficulty in as humane and compassionate a way as possible.  However, with the best will in the world a prison is not, and should never be, a suitable or appropriate clinical environment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Harry Kennedy" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018052300002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to this meeting.  I have brought two colleagues with me: Mr. Peter Byrne, who is peer educator from the service reform fund and attached to the national forensic mental health service, and Mrs. Pauline Gill, who is general manager of the national forensic mental health service.  I will talk about problems, causes and solutions taking the headings of the committee's terms of reference.</p> <p>  With regard to waiting lists for transfer from prison to the Central Mental Hospital, currently there are 28 on the waiting list and there are 323 on the caseload of the in-reach teams we provide to the Irish Prison Service.  All of the people on the waiting list are urgent.  All of them are severely mentally ill and should not be in prison.  They have been on the waiting list for months and this is entirely unacceptable by any clinical standards.  When we surveyed the numbers with severe mental illnesses in the prison population over ten years ago, we found there was a need then for approximately 350 secure forensic beds for Ireland.  Matters have probably worsened since, although we have taken every alternative strategy as far as possible.  I will list those as we proceed.  We have tried to manage with minimal resources compared to other countries, and I can tell the committee what the averages in other countries are.  Matters are managed only because the Irish Prison Service does not complete certificates for those who should be admitted until we have a bed available.  One of the problems for all of us is that we manage to cope in increasingly difficult situations.  Ultimately, that is not a great thing.</p> <p>  As clinical director I have statutory obligations under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  I am increasingly unable to meet my statutory obligation to admit those found not guilty by reason of insanity in the courts.  Again, we cope by asking the courts to put off sentencing, for example.  We have published the results of participatory action research showing how a systematic screening of people on reception in prison identifies those in need of psychiatric care.  We have shown that we can identify those who need treatment and individual care and treatment plans.  Most can be diverted back to community mental health services.  We have now set up a model service, which is copied in other countries.  We originally modelled it on the Australian system and now other people come to visit us.  However, there is an irreducible number, those who are on our waiting list and those on our caseload, who cannot be managed in community mental health services or approved centres around the country.  Those who are too dangerous to others because of their severe mental illness require treatment in conditions of therapeutic security.</p> <p>  The national forensic mental health service currently has 93 beds for adults in need of treatment in conditions of therapeutic security.  That is two per 100,000 of the population of Ireland.  This has not changed for many years.  Comparable countries have between five and 14 secure forensic beds per 100,000.  The Netherlands is at the upper end of that range.  We will move to 130 adult medium and high secure forensic beds in Portrane in 2020, with an additional 30 intensive care rehabilitation unit, ICRU, beds which will now have to serve the entire country.  That will give us 3.4 adult secure forensic beds per 100,000.  Comparing like with like, most developed countries have between five and 14.  We will also open ten forensic secure child and adolescent mental health beds on the Portrane campus, but obviously not within the adult campus.  The new hospital will not bring Ireland up to international average resource levels.</p> <p>  On the need to meet long-term needs, because of the lack of a national plan to meet the needs of those requiring longer-term, slow-stream care, treatment, rehabilitation and quality of life in secure forensic hospital settings, and because of the continuous growth of this group, we think it will be necessary to plan for the introduction of designated centres, as a matter of desperation, in prisons.  I entirely agree with what Mr. Donnellan has said.  Looking at the global situation, this has already happened in the Netherlands, Finland and other progressive European countries even when much better resourced than we are.  The Netherlands has the most forensic beds in the community and it is now opening designated centres in the prisons.  We might discuss the root cause of this if there is time.  There will also be a need for longer-term secure psychiatric beds within five years of the opening of the new Central Mental Hospital in Portrane.  We can already foresee that the new hospital will not be enough and we would like to start planning the next step now.</p> <p>  According to the committee's terms of reference there was a consensus that the 2006 policy, A Vision for Change, charts the best way forward for mental health services.  A consensus can be specific to its time or it can fail to address some important areas.  Sometimes it can be wrong.  A Vision for Change is now out of date because it could not take account of modern knowledge regarding, for example, at-risk states in the young and, because of its era, it could not take account of modern evidence for enduring neurocognitive impairment occurring during the prodromal onset stage of schizophrenia and other severe, enduring and disabling mental illnesses.  For a proportion of patients these illnesses are now better conceptualised as developmental disorders and enduring disabilities. </p> <p>  A Vision for Change did not address the need for general adult psychiatric admission beds in an epidemiologically appropriate way.  From EUROSTAT we know that, typically, other countries have between 40 and 60 general adult beds per 100,000 while A Vision for Change recommended 17.  We managed to get it down to 20 before a halt was called.  It also did not seek to examine international best practice regarding the use of such resources.  A Vision for Change did not address the need for local psychiatric intensive care units, for example, as part of general adult psychiatry.  Typically, other countries would have three such beds per 100,000.  We have hardly any.  The plan for four intensive care rehabilitation units in A Vision for Change was a compromise between the need for approximately 350 secure forensic beds, including secure slow-stream rehabilitation beds, and the acute general adult psychiatric local intensive care beds, PICUs.</p><p>In the event, neither has been prioritised.  A Vision for Change recommended that general adult psychiatry should reduce to 17 beds per 100,000 based on an ideological and frankly faith-based belief that acute, sub-acute and rehabilitation treatment for severe mental illness could be done in the community.  This missed evidence that even countries with well-developed community services still have 40 to 60 beds per 100,000 for general adult psychiatry.  EUROSTAT shows us these data.  Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and the Scandinavian states, which provide the most progressive community services, provide choice.  They also have inpatient services.  No research has shown that community services work as an exclusive option.  In practice, in many countries, including Ireland, the only way to obtain treatment for more than a week or two and longer-term intensive care packages in the community is to access these through the criminal courts.</p><p> Eleven years after its publication, A Vision for Change is not yet fully implemented.  All those aspects of A Vision for Change that removed or diverted resources for mental health services for severe mental health were implemented.  Those that transferred resources into the planned community services were not fully implemented when they cost money - revenue - or manpower.  Resources - revenue and manpower - have been lost to services for people with severe and enduring mental illness.  I suggest that now is the time for an entirely new document, not a revision of an old document.</p><p> The joint committee might want to try to achieve agreement on the best rational, scientific and clinical evidence for effective services that achieve human rights, including rights to dignity, rights to health and rights for disabled people, including quality of life, for people with severe mental illnesses, particularly those with enduring impairments of functional mental capacities due to mental illnesses or intellectual and developmental disorders, for people in need of long-term care and treatment in conditions of therapeutic safety and security due to the danger they present to others, and for people who do not present a danger to others.  There should be some effort to engage and develop the health and justice interdepartmental and inter-agency consensus about the relationship between individual freedoms and the protection of others.  My colleagues - psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who work closely within the criminal justice system - and I are continually concerned about the exercise of bail for those who are a danger to themselves.  There is a lot of evidence that suicide rates are high among those bailed - higher, curiously enough, than among those remanded in custody.  There is also a concern about the exercise of bail for those who are a danger to others.</p><p> Regarding the current integration of delivery of mental health services in Ireland, there are problems with integration of services due to the emphasis on local delegation of responsibilities without delegation of competencies.  The failure to develop PICU units locally is the most obvious of many examples along with the rejection of those who become homeless, which is a continuing problem for us at the transition between criminal justice and mental health, between custody and the community.  The rejection of those who become homeless is an obvious failure of the catchment area system and the substantial lack of beds and community mental health teams that could be corrected at least in part by empowering central direction and, if necessary, by legislating for central directors of services.</p><p> Many other states the size of Ireland have so-called clinical chiefs or heads of psychiatry who are the ultimate line managers of all psychiatrists and can direct colleagues to accept patients who are otherwise unable to obtain services.  Ireland urgently needs an office of chief psychiatrist, comparable to those in states in Australia, with the power to direct that no one is deprived of rights of access to mental health services and, where necessary, to drive resource allocation.  This would include an oversight of evidence-based and effective services of equal quality, accessible equally to all, around the life cycle.  The office of chief psychiatrist would integrate heads of all disciplines and ensure co-ordinated manpower planning and multi-annual planning of service delivery, all things that are missing at the moment.</p><p> The office of chief psychiatrist should be independent of the Mental Health Commission and should have the ability to exercise executive power.  It should not be merely an advisory position.  There are such advisory positions, which have a role in their own right.  This would solve the problem of preventing rejection and ensuring provision of mental health and substance misuse services for those leaving prison, an important group among the homeless.  Co-operation with primary care, disability and welfare services would be an added task since this does not work as well as it ought to.</p><p> The commissioning of regional and national tier 3 and tier 4 services should also be under the central direction of an office of a chief psychiatrist which should include chiefs of other clinical disciplines and should be supported by managers.  This office of chief psychiatrist should also be responsible for the commissioning of service related research, development, teaching and training, which is a virtuous cycle that is essential for excellent services.  This office should not be vulnerable to being starved of necessary resources.  It could be said that the executive clinical director experiment was starved in that way.</p><p> I would suggest that a central office is needed.  To achieve the availability, accessibility and alignment of services and supports to ensure the integration and seamless provision of services to children, adolescents and young adults during life cycle transitions and the transition from working age adults to older adults, the appropriate solution is a national office of chief psychiatrist with the power to direct local service providers, including consultant-led community mental health teams.</p><p> Regarding the need to develop prevention and early intervention services further, I must sound a note of caution with regard to prevention.  The evidence is tenuous that severe mental illnesses and mental disabilities such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, autism and intellectual disabilities can be prevented.  There is little evidence that any programme can prevent schizophrenia, autism or other disabling severe mental illnesses, although these affect about 1% of the population.  There is better evidence that early intervention can reduce long-term disability, although even this requires further research and development specific to an Irish context.  To be effective, this requires a shift to screening models from help-seeking models where a person is expected to present themselves to their GP or where their family might do that and it is hoped the person will escalate through the system to find what they need.  In effect, this is what we do in our in-reach systems in the criminal justice system.  We screen on reception.  We are introducing the same in the youth justice service.  There is also a requirement to set quality standards for "treatment as usual" and a rolling programme of randomised controlled trials of how to improve treatment as usual at national level.  There is no consistency in what a person would get as treatment depending on where he or she happens to be.</p><p> Regarding at-risk mental states, in St. Patrick's Institution, which is now closed and which provided for those aged 16 to 21, we found through screening that 23% of young people on reception met clinical criteria for an at-risk mental state, which carries about a 15% chance of going on to develop a severe mental illness.  These were strongly associated with poly-substance misuse, which occurred in the great majority of young people detained.  We are now finding much the same in Oberstown Children Detention Campus, allowing for the younger age group.  It is not quite so common in people who are younger.  We have not been able to recommence screening there, however, partly due to difficulties recruiting a full team.  I will talk about the system of recruiting panels compared with bespoke recruitment.</p><p> Regarding suicide and unnatural deaths in adult prisons, the suicide rate in prisoners is now lower than it was 20 years ago when it was the main impetus.  We believe this is the direct result of the introduction of screening on committal and psychiatric in-reach and court liaison services, PICLS.  PICLS is, again, picked as a model for other countries.  In our most recent survey of coroners' verdicts, we found that unnatural deaths, including suicides, were strongly associated with the deceased having illicit intoxicants in the blood at the time of death.</p><p> We have introduced a pre-release planning programme, about which Mr. Donnellan spoke.  We have now piloted a service for arranging aftercare packages for mentally ill prisoners on release from custody.  The pilot at Mountjoy Prison has shown the value of this scheme.</p><p>We have taken what we can do in the prisons and in the community as far as we can.  We have high-support units in Cloverhill and Mountjoy.  We have screening systems on reception in almost all of the prisons.  We have systems to divert through the courts those who can be safely cared for in the community or through local services.  We have 323 people on our prisons case load today.  This includes those who are sentenced and those who are on remand.  We cannot accommodate those who are too ill for prison and we cannot admit them either.</p><p> A vital way to improve recruitment is to have a culture of excellence.  The HSE must urgently shift towards a culture of clinical excellence.  Excellence is inseparable from the virtuous circle of research, development, teaching and training.  Only centres of excellence should be empowered to train postgraduate mental healthcare professionals.  Ireland should be self-sufficient in all mental health professions.  Manpower planning to date is difficult to understand.  We struggle to attract the best trainees - or sufficient numbers of trainees - because the mental health services do not enjoy a reputation for excellence, unfortunately.  I say that as someone who is within those services.  The mental health services do not have a positive image as valuing health and welfare outcomes for patients.  A part of the problem is that many trainees go abroad to broaden experience, which is a good thing, and are unwilling to return to work in services that do not provide resources or cultivate excellence.  They are unwilling to return to work in services that do not provide resources to keep up with modern practice and are subject to periodic serious impairments in quality and staffing during economic recessions.  Specialist niche services such as the National Forensic Mental Health Service should be able to conduct bespoke specialist recruitment.  When we were able to do so, we were always oversubscribed.  The HSE's generic panel system has been a disadvantage to us.</p><p> I suggest that the joint committee should make explicit recommendations based on current international standards and should support those who are working continuously to keep these standards up to date.  These standards should be grounded in the evidence of clinical science and not merely on good ideas.  Good ideas are never a guarantee of success.  Expertise has a technical definition.  Experts may be contributory, interactive or experts by experience.  All of these are valuable, but they are different.  A Vision for Change put itself forward as the report of an expert panel.  I think it is important to know properly what expertise is.  Only contributory experts can be held responsible for a standard of competence in their evidence.  Interactive experts are people like managers, lawyers and journalists who learn expertise by talking to the contributory experts who are responsible.  There is a complete divorce between responsibility and the exercise of any sort of influence.  There is every chance that the mistakes that have been made in the past will be made again.  The committee should have access to expert advisers who have contributory expertise.  Currently, there are few if any expert advisers in the Department of Health concerning psychiatry or any of the clinical disciplines.  The HSE has advisers on clinical programmes, but no directors.  The committee should have regard to the meaning of expertise.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Pat Bergin, who is the director of the Oberstown Children Detention Campus, to make his statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Bergin" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018052300002#F00300"><p>I am pleased to report on the progress we are making at Oberstown in delivering mental health services to young people who are sent to us by the courts.  My role as director is to manage the campus and ensure we provide the highest standard of care to young people in a safe environment, thereby fulfilling the requirements of the Children Act 2001.  Oberstown, which is the national detention facility for the care of young people referred to us by the courts on remand or detention orders, is a safe and secure environment for young people.  We place a key focus on addressing offending behaviour and preparing the young people in question for their return to their families and communities.  All of that is part of the process.  The Oberstown campus is a modern facility with new buildings and services.  Our programmes are based on best practice for young people who offend.</p> <p>  Young people who come to Oberstown have generally experienced significant adversity and disadvantage across their lives.  They are usually between the ages of 15 and 17, male and have had significant association with the care system.  We undertook a review of the characteristics of young people detained on the campus in early 2017.  We are in the process of completing a similar exercise for 2018, with a particular focus on the challenges.  The outcome of the 2017 exercise affirmed that many of the young people who are placed with us struggle with poor experiences in education, suffer from mental health problems and addiction, and have often experienced trauma or loss.  Our young people have been through many of the State services and supports, often unsuccessfully.  They present to us with challenging behaviours and complex unmet needs.</p> <p>  The facility at Oberstown can accommodate 54 young people at any one time.  Oberstown currently has a daily population of 50, which is slightly under capacity.  One third of the young people in Oberstown are on remand orders.  Since April 2017, young people under the age of 18 are no longer sent to adult prisons and instead come to us.  Over the past couple of years, the board of management has approved a strategic plan for Oberstown, the first objective of which is to provide the best possible care for young people.  We have identified a number of key actions, including the development of multi-agency and specialist support to deliver effective assessment, clinical and therapeutic services.  We have developed and are implementing a strategy of participation with young people through ongoing consultation with them about their care and ongoing needs.  This involves hearing the voice of young people.  A range of developments and policies have been approved by the board.  They focus on areas like care, health and well-being, dignity and respect, anti-bullying, complaints, safeguarding, single separation and medication management.  These policies and related ones provide support in the area of behaviour management and inform the procedures to be undertaken by staff in the care of young people.  There are a range of services on site at Oberstown to meet the needs of young people.  The campus has an approved framework based on the Children Act 2001, which sets out the areas we need to address, including care, education, health and well-being, offending behaviour and preparation for release.</p> <p>  The assessment consultation and therapy service, which operates as part of the Tusla family agency service, has a team based in Oberstown.  The members of the team, who are professionals in areas like psychology, speech and language, substance misuse and social work, work in conjunction with our residential social care workers and nursing staff to provide an integrated programme for young people.  This service was established in 2013 on foot of the recommendations on the 2009 report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  Two specific actions set out in the report pertained to young people in special care and detention.  The report called on the HSE, in consultation with the Irish youth justice service, to develop a national multidisciplinary team for children in special care and detention.  It also called on the HSE to review the need for and establish resourced multidisciplinary assessment services for children and young people at risk.  The assessment consultation and therapy service at Oberstown receives referrals and assesses the needs of young people following a multidisciplinary team meeting.  A formal assessment tool is used by our staff in Oberstown as part of a screening process to determine the mental health needs of young people.  Direct assessments are also undertaken by the assessment consultation and therapy service team.  Following consultation with parents, care staff and the other services involved with the young person, it is determined what, if any, interventions are required.  Areas of focus include responding to needs of a young person due to developmental trauma and disruptive care histories, emotional regulation and general mental health and well-being.  The team engages directly with the campus placement planning process, which looks at each young person's individual need in the areas of care, education, health and offending behaviour.</p> <p>  The HSE provides psychiatric services through the Central Mental Hospital, which operates the national forensic mental health service.  We share with that service a goal of providing a high standard of care and treatment to young people with a mental disorder.  This team, which is on site each week, works as part of a multidisciplinary team to assess and respond to specific mental health concerns as necessary.  A referral process is in place.  Consideration is given to these referrals weekly or in some circumstances immediately as necessary.  The multidisciplinary team addresses the needs of young people.  The staff in Oberstown provide support to young people on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Within the campus, we have 110 trained and experienced residential social care workers and 50 night supervising officers who work directly with our young people.  We have a medical team on site, which consists of three nurses and a social care worker.  We have a visiting GP who attends the campus three days a week and engages with the medical team, the HSE and other clinicians in meeting specific identified needs.  Thirty-one members of our staff have been trained in or are in the process of completing STORM training, a recognised self-harm mitigation model developed at the University of Manchester.  It provides skills-based training in risk assessment and safety planning to our staff.  It also supports staff to determine what to do after a serious incident has occurred.  We operate and provide substance misuse programmes and we access support from ACTS and community programmes.  In June and July of this year, we have organised sixteen substance misuse relapse prevention programmes on the campus, which are based on the adolescent community reinforcement approach.  A community-based service is providing these programmes as part of our summer activities and education schedule.  In September 2017, we appointed a young persons programme manager to support the identification of suitable programmes and the implementation of a programme of training and engagement.  We have been successful in the delivery of many of these in the past year and a half.  </p><p> The challenges facing young people detained in Oberstown are complex.  For many young people there are known risks and the approach of Oberstown is to keep young people safe especially during times when young people do not know how to keep themselves safe.  Our engagement and approach with young people is individual based and is informed by professionals on the needs of each young person.  We continue to review and improve our approach to the health and well-being of young people placed in Oberstown.  </p></speech>

I welcome their submissions.  They made a number of testimonies.  We will touch on different issues.  My first question is to Ms Malone.  She mentioned links back to the community after prison.  Will she flesh out her ideas on that?  What does she feel could work?</p> <p>  Professor Kennedy mentioned A Vision for Change and how he felt it was out of date.  He said he felt a new A Vision for Change was required as opposed to a revision of the old one.  Has he been in consultation with the revision group or groups?  Has any consultation taken place?  Has there been an initiation of communication or anything like that?  He spoke about contributory experts as opposed to expert advisers.  Could he provide more clarification on that?  He said the HSE was working with more expert advisers as opposed to direct contributory experts.  What would be the best formula for how that would be implemented or changed or how it could be done within the HSE?  He spoke about local adult intensive care psychiatric units and the provision for those.  Professor Kennedy's contribution was quite lengthy.  He mentioned that parts of A Vision for Change regarding severe mental health conditions had been implemented.  I want clarification on that.  Is that what Professor Kennedy said?  With regard to intensive care psychiatric units, he mentioned they should be more community based.  Could I have clarification on that?  </p></speech>

Professor Kennedy addresses severe mental illness for people who require treatments and conditions of therapeutic security.  He is the expert on that in terms of psychiatric treatment.  In preparation for the hearing I spoke to a number of staff who work in the medical area of the prisons.  They tell me that an issue arises for those who manage to access, for example, an addiction counsellor or psychology services within a prison, for example in the D&oacute;chas Centre or any other centre.  It is particularly an issue for women because women in prison present with enormously complex life histories and experiences.  When those women access services or make progress while they are within the criminal justice system and are lucky enough to have those opportunities the frustration being expressed is that there is not an equivalent service in the community so the person who has been working with that woman or man cannot make the link to a designated person in the community who will continue to provide a similar service for a period of time.  We work in penal policy and criminal justice policy.  We are not mental health experts but we are interested in listening particularly to those who work on the ground with those who are incarcerated and we are interested in considering the problems and barriers they face and what they see is working.  It may assist in answering the Deputy's question.  That is what they are telling me about.  There is a dearth of services within the community for women or men who have made some progress with their mental health difficulty and wish to continue to do so on release but there are not always services there to catch them on release.</p></speech>

There are three kinds of expertise.  There are experts by experience - my colleague here is an example - who have an intuitive understanding of the lived experience of a topic, which is a very important aspect.  There are interactive experts, people who talk to contributory experts all the time and come to understand the vocabulary and can be quite fluent in that vocabulary.  Examples of this type are journalists, lawyers and pure managers.  Contributory experts are a bit like master craftsmen.  They are not only at the top of their skill and ability through training and long expertise but they can expand their subject a bit.  Senior mental health professionals in all the disciplines are the contributory experts who know how to do something and how to make it better.  Managers talk to them every day and absorb from them but will lose their expertise the minute they stop talking to contributory experts.  The HSE, like many health services, is run by these interactive experts.  It is not run by the contributory experts.  That is a problem.</p></speech>

It is not just enough to say that we need 17 general adult psychiatric beds per 100,000, which is what A Vision for Change said - other countries have 40 to 60, or even 80 - but we need to specify different types of beds for different purposes.  There are admission beds, rehab beds and specialist beds for special things like eating disorders.  Crucial in there is local low secure acute units, psychiatric intensive care units.  There should be one for every 300,000 of the population, which is about 12 beds, or roughly three per 100,000.  Some would say the number is 3.5.  I only know of one in the entire country and that is the Phoenix unit.</p></speech>

There must be an ultimate line manager.  That person would also have the level of epidemiological knowledge that is normal for me.  I am able to tell the committee about these numbers because it is my expertise.  There is a need for that.</p></speech>

Their presentations were among the best we have received.  They were fantastic.  There is a great deal of information there for us to work on.  I start with Mr. Donnellan.  I am acutely concerned about Castlerea.  Mr. Donnellan said the services there had been withdrawn.  What impact is this having on the prisoners and staff and what exactly was lost in April?  What exactly was discontinued?</p></speech>

It has a population of 300, 30% of whom are Irish Travellers.  It has a very mixed population with high needs.  I said in my opening statement that the HSE had approved a full-time psychiatrist to work there.  Serious attempts have been made over the last number of years to fill the post but without success.  Over the last number of years, we have been providing services to Castlerea on a wing and a prayer with some part-time psychiatric input.  Professor Kennedy himself used to travel there from Dublin to provide half a day or a day a week to assess people.  We are continuously trying to find somebody who will attend the prison on a regular basis to continue the management and treatment of prisoners.  Very acute people are admitted to Castlerea from courts in the west and north west.  They are met by a nurse and a GP but there is nobody to screen or assess them and there is no one to continue their ongoing treatment if they have been in treatment in the community.  If we have someone who is very ill, we must transfer him in a prison van for either two hours to the midlands or three hours to Dublin which is away from his zone, family and connections.  It is an absolutely acute problem.  The prison governor, Mr. Martin Reilly, brings this to my door every week and raises the risks to prisoners and the pressure on staff.  Prison officers are left to manage this untreated group of mentally unwell people in Castlerea.  It is difficult to get services to places like Castlerea.  We have recently provided psychology services, but my biggest risk today is Castlerea.</p></speech>

There are also risks to our staff who have to deal with acutely mentally unwell people and manage them to ensure they have their food, recreation and exercise and attend all necessary sessions.  Some prisoners may be acutely unwell.  The minute one opens their cell doors, the violence that emanates from the room is enormous.  Prison officers are managing this on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Donnellan to forgive me for asking all these questions but I am trying to understand.  Is the prison using its resources to manage prisoners one-to-one when prison officers should be used to do other work?  How are the resources being provided and managed?</p></speech>

They can only be managed outside their cells for two or three hours due to the resource issue.  This goes right across the Prison Service.  For example, we have 15 very unwell people in Cloverhill today.  Their regimes attract resources away from the ordinary prison population because sometimes very unwell prisoners must be managed through what we call "barrier handling".  That means four or five prison officers are required to manage one person to move him safely from point A to point B.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Donnellan.  Mr. Bergin and I know each other from the children's committee and I am delighted he is here today.  One of my questions relates to the release of children from Oberstown.  What programmes are involved and how does the ACTS team work with the community to integrate these children?  I have been to Oberstown and I have seen the wonderful work Mr. Bergin and his staff are doing out there.  However, I have a concern about vulnerable children who have come from addiction and violent backgrounds and how they are reintegrated to have a reasonable chance at life.</p></speech>

A team of professionals was established by Tusla and based in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  They worked as a team to follow the young people through the care services, whether it was young people in the community, in special care high-support units or in detention.  The idea was that they would be familiar with those young people and be able to pass on the intervention each clinician had to a relevant clinician in the relevant area.  When young people were leaving us, the ACTS team could move with the child or young person.  There has been a review of the ACTS service and rather than to have one national team that moves with the children, five teams have been established, including in Cork and Limerick.  The five teams cover the north, south, east and west and there is one in Oberstown.  The idea is that they will continue to work together.  The team in Oberstown will work with young people.  If a young person goes to Cork, the team in Cork will pick up the support services and work with the young person in the Cork area.  What was happening was that staff were travelling all over the country and were not in a position to provide a robust service.  They spent more time on the road than in delivering services.</p></speech>

As to the repeat offending piece, part of what we have found more often than not when a young person comes to Oberstown is that the ACTS team is already familiar with that child.  The information we can get quickly is very helpful and allows us to look at how we will manage particular behaviours and what services we need to put in place.  From that perspective, it is excellent.</p> <p>  The challenge in moving young people back into communities is not only around the ACTS team but around all of the ongoing services.  Part of what we identified last year when we looked at the young people coming into the service included existing identified needs whether in education, mental health or substance misuse.  The difficulty is ensuring that young people access those services in the community.  What are the support mechanisms either through the family or through communities themselves?  Part of what the ACTS teams and our team have been doing is looking at how we can effect change with parents.  We have Le Cheile and YAP working with families so that when young people return home the families will know the clinician or psychologist is available and will call to the house and can support the young person to engage.  It is about changing the model.  There is a challenge but it is the connectivity.</p></speech>

There were two young people in single separation this morning regarding incidents which occurred last night.</p><p>We are reducing the level of time of single separation.  It is being monitored right through the organisation, from my office down the line.  The focus is having alternative options.  Some of the examples highlighted in respect of complex prisoners being managed behind doors are similar in some instances.  It is about having those alternative approaches.  We are constantly looking at reducing the amount of single separation, looking at what happened and why it has happened and at the contributor factors.  We are reducing single separation all the time, but it is a constant issue.</p></speech>

We do not do that often enough.  We need to constantly recognise the work of the groups that appear before this committee.</p> <p>  In preparation for this meeting, I went through different cases and looked at some of the headlines, including headlines such as court releases man as Central Mental Hospital full, unmedicated and untreated patients at Central Mental Hospital moved to jails because of bed shortage and mentally ill patients being kept in prison due to bed shortages.  That gives a flavour of the difficulties in society.</p> <p>  Ms Malone said that services are at crisis levels.  Professor Kennedy described the services as being at the edge of safe levels.  Clearly, there is a crisis in services.  We know the Portrane facility is being built and will be ready in 2020, but will that additional capacity resolve the bed crisis in the system?</p> <p>  We know the prison population reflects what is happening in society.  There is a crisis in homelessness.  Increasingly, we see that the young people involved in selling and taking drugs are getting younger and younger.  I know of children as young as seven years of age acting as runners for drug dealers.  That is possibly the profile of young children coming into the prison system.  Many of the families contacting public representatives tell us their son or daughter has a mental health issue and that they believe their child will be safer in the prison system.  Is that the experience of the witnesses?</p> <p>  We heard about over-crowding, violence and so on which are part of the system and the fact that some jails are probably more dangerous than others.  We speak of the need for a 24-7 mental health services in the prison service.  Are there times that 24-7 mental health services cannot be delivered?  Are some prisons worse than others in that regard?  Is it worse at the weekend with staff not available and so on?</p> <p>  Mental health screening was mentioned.  St. Patrick's Institution was mentioned and the 23%, and I suppose that screening was done a number of years ago.  We do not have the staff in Oberstown.  Is that screening going on anywhere else?  Will it be higher because of the problems on the outside?  </p> <p>  Solitary confinement was mentioned in one of the submissions.  Of the 514 prisoners on a restricted regime, 325 had been held on 21 hour lockup.  The duration of the time is not generally published.  Some 51 prisoners were held in solitary confinement in January 2016, of whom nine had spent more than one year in isolation.  Is solitary confinement used as a means of controlling prisoners, many of whom may have mental health issues for which the supports are not available?</p></speech>

Currently, we have two secure forensic beds per 100,000.  Most other countries have between five and 14 beds per 100,000 of population.  When we move to the new hospital in Portrane in 2020, we will have 3.5 secure forensic beds per 100,000, comparing like with like.  It will give us breathing space, but very short breathing space.  I suggest that we need to start planning what comes next which will be a greater tailoring of services, according to need.  Within the secure hospitals, we will need admission beds, rehabilitation beds and some slow stream beds, recognising long-term needs which are currently not planned for or recognised in the system we have.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether people are safer in prison.  That is a really difficult question to answer.  I think many people access mental health services for the first time when they come into custody.  There are really complicated reasons for that as well as many different reasons, including stigma, but also because general adult services, and I cannot sufficiently emphasise this, are all part of the same service.  While I am obviously explaining to members the problems in the forensic part of the mental health service, we are an integral part of the mental health service and it all hangs together.  If there is a pressure in one part, it invariably passes up the stream until it lands in the criminal justice system and with us.  We are in that sense the canary in the mine, the barometer.  If we are having significant problems, it is because there are not only not enough resources for severe mental illness but not enough tailoring and diversity of the type of services.  One needs admission beds and intensive care beds.  We also need longer term beds and a variety of things within a forensic mental health service and a general adult service.</p> <p>  We have taken community and in-reach services in the prisons in our aftercare services about as far as we can.  An endless response to these difficulties is to say that we need to do more in the community but that is not the answer to every question. </p></speech>

They believe that by going into prison, they will at least have somebody to identify whatever mental health problems their child has.  These families are desperate because their sons and daughters are involved in all sorts of criminal activity, but much of it is down to their mental state.  Will somebody respond to my question on solitary confinement?</p></speech>

We like to call it a "restricted regime" rather than solitary confinement.  On admission to prison, a number of prisoners will say they want to do their sentence behind the door because they feel at risk being out in the general population because of drug debts or money owed by members of their families outside.  Obviously gangland stuff is playing a major issue in the running of our prisons.  There is that threat in prisons from people of that persuasion.  Of course, there are people with mental health problems.  We worked really hard on this in the past number of years to get our number on this restricted regime down, but the Deputy is correct, that on any one day we do a survey of who is behind the door, we will find that there can be eight to 12 people who are only getting two hours out-of-cell time during a 24 hour period.  That is for all sorts of complex reasons, violence being the number one reason.  Coupled with that is the whole threat that goes with it.  It is about trying to manage this disparate group of people in prison and trying to ensure that everybody gets a minimum of two hours out of their cell per day.  Of course, the vast majority have a normal regime.  There are many complex reasons people are in solitary confinement or on a restricted regime.</p><p>When one assesses any case, one will find all of those reasons.  There is a prisoner in Cloverhill Remand Prison who will be released in two weeks who will not come out of his cell until the day he is released.  Every night I must sign an order that allows him to stay in his cell, rather than physically force him into a regime.  He has threatened that he will do damage if he is forced to do so.  There are all sorts of reason people want to serve sentences behind a door, but we know how damaging it is.  We know about the isolation and psychological damage caused by being in that kind of environment for a prolonged period.</p></speech>

The director general is correct insofar as we have found that the vast majority who are participating in that regime are requesting it because they fear for their lives or safety.  There is a very significant structural issue if there is that number of prisoners in they system who fear for their lives or are in fear of an injury.  It is a significant concern.  The reason I have raised it at this hearing on mental health is, as the director general said, we know that the impact of that type of regime on mental health is so severe and significant.</p> <p>  On families saying they feel their loved one would be safer in prison, I have had the same experience where a family member has told me something similar.  We face a dire situation if families are so desperate about the lack of mental health supports and services that they would rather their family members go through the criminal justice system to access health services.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

The new forensic unit planned for 2020 will maintain a breathing space and that is about all.  This week I believe there are 36 people in the approved centres and prisons on the waiting list for treatment, which seems like a small number.  I imagine the average waiting time probably runs into years.</p> <p>  I refer to those in prisons who are not receiving treatment or refusing it in any form, whether it be medication, talk therapy or otherwise.  They often complete their sentences and are discharged.  That creates the revolving door through which they return with the same mental health issues.</p> <p>  Having involuntary status within prisons or approved centres can sound horrific.  I am not referring to the Central Mental Hospital.  How do the delegates view it?  Perhaps the different individuals might answer for themselves.  </p> <p>  Professor Kennedy referred to changing a unit or units in prisons into designated approved centres.  How would that work in practice?  Is it not anathema to all of the work being done on the stigma attached to mental health and the efforts being made not to enforce the receiving of treatment?  To enforce the receiving of treatment during imprisonment seems like a double whammy.  For years there have been rumours, but can the delegates give us an idea of the plan to have different wings in prisons designated as approved centres, whereby they would become psychiatric centres?  The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 which was related to the Central Mental Hospital provided for something similar.  I expect something like it would have to be done if there was to be such designation in prisons.  I have been hearing about this for years and have a great interest in it.  I remain unconvinced or unsure of its wisdom, but I may need to reflect further on the matter. </p> <p>  On Cloverhill Remand Prison and the lack of a specialist forensic psychiatrist and the inability to recruit one, how many forensic psychiatrists are there in Ireland?  Many healthcare services use locums who may last six months or, if one is lucky, a year to fill the gaps, although they are not trained in the specialism.  This is a particular problem in child mental health services.  Representatives from CAMHS have been before the committee and we know that this is happening in that sector.  Has the Irish Prison Service used locums and, if so, how long have they lasted?  Have they been trained in this specialism?  I presume the answer to the last question is "No."  </p> <p>  I always advocate for the use of advanced nurse practitioners.  The need to be used in order that we can benefit from their skills, education and critical experience, especially when there are shortages in every area of the public health service.</p> <p>  I cannot agree with the delegates on A Vision for Change.  It is incredible that they think we should just bin it.  It was published in 2006.  Some 73% of the recommendations made within it have never been implemented, but I am not going to go through another 12 years of attempts to come up with another document which would sit on a shelf and gather dust.  There is an oversight group which we will have the pleasure of meeting next week at 5.30 p.m.  The delegates should be proactive and actually write to it and take responsibility for changing the oversight group within the mental health service, the prison system and the Central Mental Hospital.  It is not rushing to engage with the delegates, but neither has it rushed to engage with us, with the exception of prods here and there.</p> <p>  I refer to the skill mix within the Central Mental Hospital and other prisons.  Nursing staff were brought into some of the other prisons about a decade ago.  How is it working out?  Is the culture between custodial and healthcare staff knitting together and supportive?  There is much talk about the skill mix.  In 2012 the Labour Court recommended a skill mix in the Central Mental Hospital, but capped the figure at 10%, although I think it may have increased in the past six years.  There is increased use of restraints, medication, assessment and special sittings, one to one, two to one and, in some cases, five to one.  They can only be carried out by registered nurses.</p></speech>

The delegates are seeking to have an overall chief psychiatrist which is probably a good idea.  I imagine Professor Kennedy could write the job description for the post.  Recently, I dealt with a case in which an approved centre had refused to take an individual patient for reasons related to the safety of the rest of the patients in it.  In the United Kingdom under legislation they must take such individuals.  Do the delegates think we should take a similar route? </p> <p> Last August I had research carried out into the matter of community treatment orders.  Will the delegates say where they stand on the matter?  I am not sure I see it as pluses and minuses, but we should consider implementation of something similar if it could save some families from being murdered, which happens rarely but not rarely enough.</p></speech>

It is, however, nearly impossible to get that kind of resource into a place like Castlerea.  We are always clutching at straws and it is very difficult.  However, Cloverhill has excellent services.  It is probably the most resourced prison in the country.</p> <p>  On skill mix, my colleague, Mr. Enda Kelly, is the manager of nursing.  We have many nursing staff in our prisons.  I ask him to comment.</p></speech>

There was a reference to how the culture between the officers and the nurses worked.  It is hugely supportive.  Over the decade I have been with the Prison Service, we have seen great development in joint training between nurses and prison officers.  That is especially the case with mental health.  Nearly 1,800 of our staff are now trained in mental health awareness.  We see that nurses realise that they cannot function without the daily support of the prison officers.  That brings me back to the question of people in isolation. I would like to clarify that it is never done as an easy way to manage somebody with a mental illness.  We have a seclusion policy which is akin to a clinical seclusion policy but it is tightly regulated.  It has to be prescribed by either a registered nurse or a doctor.  The skill mix between the nurses and the prison officers is hugely successful.  It has been the basis for many of our projects in the high-support unit where we have been able to enhance the quality of life for people in prison with major mental health problems.</p> <p>  That also touches on the involuntary status of prisoners.  We cannot forcibly treat prisoners against their will.  Anybody with a healthcare issue of that severity - be it a cardiac or mental health issue - deserves to be in a clinical setting.  If a prisoner is that ill, we clearly advocate that he or she should be properly treated and supported by our colleagues in a hospital in the community.  We are in the invidious position, as Professor Kennedy said, that we cannot get access.  It is important today that we mention the human cost involved.  These are people who are suffering and are terribly unwell and as an organisation we are trying to do the best we can to support them.  We have professionals and all the experts in but we do not have the right environment.</p></speech>

It has been a huge success when selected appropriately for people where it is a proportionate and clinically helpful thing to do.  The crucial thing about extending it more broadly to different groups is having proper evidence that it is effective.  Whether it is a good idea or a bad idea is not a way of telling whether it works - and whether it works is the only question of benefit to the patients.  We need to do much more research in Ireland on what works here.  That is not happening.</p></speech>

Before I call Deputy Browne, I have to ask a question or I am just going to die.  Professor Kennedy spoke about recruitment and how there were no recruitment problems at all when it was being handled internally.  Then it went to going through the HSE panel process.  If the old process was so successful, why did it go to the HSE and when?  I agree it should be an internal responsibility.</p></speech>

I am not great on the exact detail of when that was.  On the question of why, I was told it was national IR rules about recruitment and licensing for who is entitled to recruit.  Prior to that, every clinical service within the HSE did its own recruitment and it worked better that way because people either chose to work in a specialist service like ours or they did not.  We have had mixed results with panels.  It has been better lately than it was before but it could be even better.</p></speech>

We will bring this to the Minister's attention and especially what we have heard today.  I call Deputy Browne.</p></speech>

In 1950, there were 7.9 beds per 1,000 of the population and 22,000 citizens were hospitalised in psychiatric hospitals.  According to the Health Research Board, HRB, there were 17,290 admissions in our hospital psychiatric units in 2016.  That is a rate of 376 admissions per 100,000.  The HRB went on to state that the rate of involuntary admission in 2016 was 48.4 per 100,000.  It is 120 in the UK.  That is almost double the rate of involuntary admissions.  In the EU 28, Ireland has the third lowest number of psychiatric beds per 100,000 according to EUROSTAT.  That is a dramatic change over the last 60 years.  The EU average seems to be 72 psychiatric beds per 100,000 and, according to EUROSTAT, in Ireland it 35 per 100,000.  That is again less than half of the EU average.</p> <p>  Professor Brendan Kelly has been reported saying, "These are stark differences and strongly suggest that Ireland has insufficient psychiatric beds to serve our population."  He went on to say that the "movement away from the excessive inpatient care [in the] 1950s ... towards the present situation [when the] rate of involuntary admission is less than half of that in England, and [that] Ireland&rsquo;s availability of psychiatric beds is less than half of the EU average."  He continued that "the key human rights issue in Irish psychiatry today is not [the] disproportionate denial of the right to liberty due to over-custodial care, but, rather, issues concerning the right to access to an appropriate level of care when it is needed, including inpatient care".  That would seem to chime with what Professor Kennedy said earlier.  Does he think that decongregation - that is the buzzword used - has gone too far?  Has it become either an ideology, or worse, a badge of convenience to effectively shut many units that perhaps, it would have been better to have replaced or done up?  I have heard this reflected elsewhere.</p><p>Have we gone too far such that policy is no longer based on the clinical need of the individual but on getting as many people as possible out into the community, irrespective of clinical need and what community supports are in place for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Harry Kennedy" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018052300002#M00200"><p>It is interesting to compare my colleague Professor Brendan Kelly's assessment of the situation because he works in the very busy general adult service in Tallaght Hospital and he has previous experience of working in the north inner city as well.  All parts of the service are having the same experience.  All of the contributory experts - those of us who do this - are coming to the same view from different starting points.  I would go a little further.  I think the EUROSTAT figure for Ireland of 35 per 100,000 lumps in community hostels, old age intellectual disability and other things.  The HSE number is 20 per 100,000.  Comparing like with like with the EUROSTAT number, the situation is even worse.</p> <p>  The system, following A Vision for Change, was driven by ideology independent of expertise and independent of the research evidence at that time.  A lot of new evidence has emerged since.  For instance, the UK rate of admission under the Mental Health Act has increased in recent years.  It was previously lower than the 120 per 100,000 that it is now.  Forces of nature in the population cannot be blocked by ideology.  There is a certain amount of severe mental illness in the community.  People have genuine needs for levels of care and treatment, which bring us back to this position.  The old asylums were impoverished and negative in every way for all kinds of very interesting reasons.  There was a choice between reforming them or closing them and the choice was to close them.  The obligation on us now is to find something better.  The way to do this is through reawakening the concept of excellence in clinical services.  Excellence is how we keep up with what is happening in the population that we serve.  It will never be the same each decade and so the only way to keep up and ensure we are genuinely meeting the needs of people with severe mental illness and all the range of mental health problems is through the virtuous circle of research, leading to the development of better services; teaching so that we are constantly preparing new professionals in these newly-developed services and training for postgraduate work to provide the people who will do the next round of research, development and teaching.  Other countries have centres of excellence funded continuously to keep up in this area.  The Italians have an excellent centre of excellence in Brescia in northern Italy.  The Dutch have an excellent centre for forensic expertise in Utrecht.  Most other countries have these centres; we have nothing of the sort.</p></speech>

For example, 20 years ago they might have been misusing and abusing hashish, marijuana, heroin and benzodiazepines but they are now misusing poly drugs, which means they have moved from drugs which had a docile effect on them to drugs that have an energetic effect on them.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that issue and also on the level of research here into mental health versus other countries.</p></speech>

We have spent a lot of time with our international colleagues looking on the drugs in prison issue.  The Deputy is correct that there has been a big shift from the drugs of choice in previous years, namely, hashish, marijuana, heroin and so on.  Nowadays, people do not know what they are taking.  They may be told that what they are being given is ecstasy, a benzodiazepine or a roche but that may not be the case.  When people take these drugs the onset of acute psychosis is so rapid it causes a massive management problem for the person in the prison environment or the clinical environment outside of the prison.</p> <p>  In terms of how we as clinicians respond to this, all the international evidence is to treat symptomatically.  For example, one should try to keep them cool because they overheat and their temperatures spike and to try to keep them in a safe environment.  We are finding that once the psychosis passes, these people have amnesia.  They often are missing up to a week of their lives where they cannot remember what happened.</p> <p>  Responding to the drugs people are taking is a huge challenge.  We work closely with the State Laboratory in terms of trying to analyse what we find when people take these drugs.  The State Laboratory and all laboratories across Europe are having trouble keeping up with the chemical formulations that are being put out there.  We are very much working in the dark, which underlines the need for the dual diagnosis service.  We need to get comorbidity tackled.  There are a lot of people with mental health problems not only in prisons but across the whole country.  There are not silos of mental health on one side and drug addiction on the other, these are married inextricably.  The Irish Prison Service has committed in the national drugs strategy to work with the HSE to take a lead on developing dual diagnosis because we are a service that can initiate that help and treatment as soon as a person presents to us.</p></speech>

My first question is to Ms Malone.  In regard to the inadequacies of the mental health service, has this been brought to the attention of the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality?  My next question is to Mr. Donnellan.  He mentioned that 30% of the population in Castlerea Prison are from the Traveller community.  Is that reflected anywhere else in Ireland?  We are quite concerned about Traveller mental health.</p> <p>  My question for Professor Kennedy is, was he included in the planning of the Portrane facility and why did we not know that more beds were needed?  Mr. Hernon might tell us how many children with really severe enduring illnesses there are in the Oberstown facility.</p></speech>

The national forensic mental health service, which provides multidisciplinary teams, is a HSE service.  The drugs in-reach service is a HSE service.  The psychology service is provided by the Irish Prison Service.  Primary care, general practitioners and general nurses are provided by the IPS and we work in a multi-agency way.  For example, probation is a criminal justice service but with social work background and increasingly we are providing mental health social workers as well as part of a pre-release plan.  It is a really complex interagency service at which we are fairly good.</p><p>On Travellers, following a report by the IPRT a number of years ago, we have worked with the St. Stephen's Green Trust about a Travellers in prisons initiative.  We have been working with the national Traveller organisations and one of their key points was that if Travellers are not counted in prison, they will not matter.  We have agreed to take a real census of every person who comes into prison and ask them for their ethnic origin.  We did a pilot at the D&oacute;chas centre at Castlerea and 30% of prisoners on a given day last month identified themselves as white Travellers.  We intend to continue that survey and by October have all prisons done.  We will have a scientific fact for how many Travellers occupy prisons, and it seems to be disproportionate.  Travellers make up 0.6% of the Irish group and if they make up 30% of the Castlerea prison population, we can see that is disproportionate to other groups of Irish citizens in prisons.</p></speech>

Why are the numbers not stacking up?  A story against ourselves, in a sense, is that going back more than ten years ago, we surveyed the population in need of hospital treatment in the Irish Prison Service and the criminal justice system.  We did gold standard epidemiological surveys of need and we published extensively in research literature.  A full report was lodged in the Oireachtas Library. It indicated a need for approximately 350 beds.  The planners in the Department at one stage saw the 350 figure as an argument for 170 beds.  I said to Senator Devine earlier that industrial relations are not the same as professional issues.  People do not get the difference between research and expert evidence and bargaining.  It is not bargaining; it is objective evidence.</p></speech>

In the first quarter of 2017, approximately 23% of the population in the detention school were Travellers.  In the first quarter of 2018, that figure is approximately 25%, so it is a consistent number.  The ratio of Travellers to non-ethnic groups is very high.  Approximately 30% to 50% of kids presenting on campus have mental health issues to varying degrees.</p></speech>

There is a prolonged waiting list of 28 to 30 per day.  Whatever way it goes. whether it is a designated centre within the prison or outside the prison, as the CPT recommended, mentally ill prisoners should be kept and cared for in a hospital facility that is adequately equipped and which possesses appropriately trained staff.  In the view of the CPT, the facility could be a civil mental hospital or a specifically equipped psychiatric facility in the prison system.  Whatever course is chosen, the accommodation capacity of the psychiatric facility should be adequate and there should not be a prolonged waiting period before a person is transferred to a psychiatric facility.  It was noted in the Gary Douch report that this should be 72 hours and, in the UK, there is a recommendation of 14 days.  The transfer is quite low at 34% but we do not know how many prisoners are waiting to be transferred here, the length of time or the number of prisoners in special observation cells.  Mental Health Reform indicated last year indicated an individual was in the system for 8.5 months.  Now is the time to decide.</p></speech>

Getting back to the point about how to use services in prison even better than they are used at the moment, given that there are clear deficiencies, everybody who needs to be treated in hospital should be treated in hospital.  The difficulty is having somewhere safe to send people back to who have been treated.  Invariably, they will relapse on being returned to a prison.  It would be helpful to have, as the CPT notes, designated centres in prisons that would be drug-free and where medication could be continued after the acute phases of treatment.  It would be a practical solution to a practical problem and would take matters forward a bit.</p></speech>

The academy wishes to offer its heartfelt sympathies to all those affected by the current cervical screening tragedy.  Recent weeks have been an extremely worrying time for many women and their families and has also affected the healthcare professionals providing their care.</p> <p>  The academy is the professional body and competent authority representing medical scientists in Ireland.  Medical scientists are a regulated profession.  Since 1996, all medical scientists must hold qualifications accredited or approved by the academy.  We welcome the reviews called for by the Minister and will work with him, the Department of Health, the HSE, CervicalCheck and all other agencies to achieve the best outcomes for women having cervical screening.  The academy is part of the newly established expert advisory group on cervical screening.  The academy will fully participate in, and make submissions to, any Government or statutory inquiry and use its expertise to contribute to initiatives to improve all cancer screening programmes.</p> <p>  In 2008, a decision was taken to tender for screening cytology, that is, cervical smear test analysis, which resulted in this service, previously undertaken in laboratories in hospitals in Ireland, being largely delivered by laboratories in the USA.  The academy wishes to clarify that the Irish accredited laboratories that tendered for the cervical screening service in 2007 and 2008 were informed that they had scored highly in all areas - quality and turnaround times - except cost.  The academy is on record as stating that the decision to outsource this screening service was short-sighted.  One consequence of this decision is that the academy does not have access to information from the laboratories in question and, therefore, is not in a position to comment on the quality metrics or standards of individual laboratories at this time.  Should the Scally scoping report identify any suboptimal performance within laboratories currently providing this service, a rigorous approach to remedying these issues will be required to bring them into line with international standards.</p> <p>  Cervical screening is a screen, not a diagnostic test.  Involving the pathological analysis of cells from the cervix for pre-cancerous changes, it still remains the most reliable and effective way of preventing and detecting early cancers.  Screening that is done through a national, organised screening service, where regular smears are performed as part of a screening cycle, has helped to reduce the rate of cervical cancer in Ireland.  The cervical smear screen is not 100% sensitive for detection of all cervical abnormalities, but when performed to a high standard as part of a screening programme, it should significantly reduce the number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer.  In the UK, there has been a 50% reduction in cervical cancer since the implementation of its screening programme in the 1960s.</p> <p>  Medical scientists examining a smear are required to reach individual "pick-up" or detection rates of 95% or greater for high-grade abnormalities and greater than 90% for all abnormalities.  The minimum standard that the academy recommends and would support for cervical screening in Ireland is for each smear to be examined independently by two medical scientists specialising in cervical cytology, under the governance of a clinical pathologist in accordance with CervicalCheck's "Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Screening".  These guidelines are based on those of the British Association for Cytopathology.</p> <p>  The professional staff in cytology screening laboratories in Ireland are medical scientists and pathologists with specific qualifications and training.  All cervical screening laboratories in Ireland practise to ISO 15189 quality standards.  These professional and quality standards in cytology and other clinical laboratories ensure that the test method and verification, result interpretation and reporting are controlled, audited and inspected.  This is in keeping with international best practice.</p> <p>  The academy fully supports the introduction of the primary HPV test and is available to work with the National Screening Service, NSS, to advise on future pathological service provision for this and other cancer screening programmes.  The system chosen for HPV testing must be selected based on the sensitivity of detection, not cost.</p> <p>  The academy advises and recommends that, on the introduction of HPV screening, the entire cervical screening service should be re-established in Ireland to ensure an entirely integrated service for HPV, cytology, colposcopy and histopathology for women in the one health system, ensuring continuity of care and clinical governance.  The academy advises that this laboratory service be configured, led and managed by consultant medical scientists and pathologists, a service configuration that is now emerging as standard practice in the UK.  The academy recommends and advises that the cervical screening programme that is put in place be quality assured and subject to regular independent audit and review against current best practice.  The academy's position, in the interest of public safety, is that all the clinical laboratory services must be fully integrated with clinical services and provided by qualified, registered professionals in a properly resourced and accredited system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Casey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#D00400"><p>The MLSA is deeply saddened by the impact of CervicalCheck's system failures on individual women and on public confidence in the cervical screening programme.  The screening programme has saved lives but it is now clear that it did not operate to necessary standards, culminating in the serious failings in the CervicalCheck audit and communication process.</p> <p>  Cervical screening was first introduced in Ireland in the 1960s.  Although discussed at the time, a national screening service did not materialise.  By the mid-1980s, there were 15 laboratories providing both a diagnostic and cervical smear screening service, with an estimated 145,000 smears per year throughput and many laboratories experiencing significant backlogs.  In 1987, the then Minister of Health set up a working party whose terms of reference included recommending how to improve arrangements to deal satisfactorily with the workload.  While the final report concluded that no extra Exchequer resources would be made available to the service, it recommended that three regional laboratories be developed to provide a diagnostic cervical cytology service rather than a screening service and that turnaround times should not exceed one month.  However, the continued failure to resource the service appropriately resulted in continuing delays in issuing timely results to patients.</p><p> In 1996, the then Minister for Health advised the setting up of the Irish cervical screening programme, ICSP, based in Limerick.  It reported that in 2001, 217,898 smears were received by cytology laboratories and 203,868 were reported.  It noted that double screening was carried out for 17% of all smears, rapid review was performed in 13 of the 14 laboratories, one laboratory reported complete rescreening on all smears, and waiting times ranged from one week to more than three months.</p><p> In 2004, the ICSP published a commissioned report by Dr. Euphemia McGoogan, a leading UK expert, who reviewed the first pilot phase of the ICSP, now CervicalCheck under the National Cancer Screening Service, NCSS, in the mid-west and made recommendations for a successful national screening service roll-out within an acceptable timeframe.  Among the recommendations of Dr. McGoogan were the need to develop and redesign the existing laboratory structures into four regional screening centres that would &ldquo;serve a defined population through a network of professionals working in primary care, laboratories and colposcopy&rdquo;, and it was envisaged this would be in line with what was developed for the BreastCheck screening programme.  In addition, a single standard screening should be agreed and a move to liquid based cytology, LBC, should be developed which would greatly increase laboratory capacity by increasing the number of slides screened daily by laboratory staff.  Furthermore, each laboratory should employ a quality manager to assist with obtaining laboratory accreditation.</p><p> In June 2006, in response to continuing backlogs, the HSE with the NCSS took a decision to outsource the backlog of cervical smears on an ongoing basis from 1 August 2006 up to 31 July 2008, with an option to extend the service for two years.  On the basis of "urgent medical need", the contract was awarded without a tender process to Quest Diagnostics, an American based international company.  During this period, Irish cytology laboratories were undergoing transition from conventional Papanicolaou, Pap, smear tests to LBC preparation in addition to working assiduously through the process of achieving accreditation in preparation for the roll-out of the National Cervical Screening Service programme.  Some laboratories had already achieved accreditation.  At the same time, laboratory workloads were increasing year on year and the HSE staff moratorium from 2006 was also having an effect on staffing levels in laboratories.  Following a tender process in May 2008, the National Cancer Screening Service awarded the full contract for screening to Quest Diagnostics.</p><p> The Medical Laboratories Scientists Association, MLSA, warned the HSE and the NCSS in 2007-2008 of the risks of the short-term decision to outsource testing to the USA, due to the different testing and screening protocols in place and the disconnect between the outsourced screening programme and the clinical services in Ireland for women subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer.  Concern was also expressed about the loss to the State of the skills to provide the service.</p><p> As a result of the outsourcing of the testing, more than 60 highly skilled medical scientists performing cytology testing in Ireland were redeployed to other areas in pathology laboratories, with a consequent loss of their skills.  As a result, the overall majority of Irish cytology laboratories were not in a position to tender for subsequent NCSS contracts since 2010.  Following the decision to outsource the testing, the NCSS, the Department of Health and the HSE expressed no interest in the development of a cytology screening service in Ireland, in line with the recommendations of the McGoogan report, advising instead that it was their preference to close existing screening services in Ireland and redeploy staff to other laboratory disciplines.</p><p> The MLSA welcomes the upcoming review into the service and calls on the HSE to invest in the retraining and upskilling of medical scientists so that the testing service can be returned to Ireland.  It must be acknowledged also that the recent controversy has also impacted greatly on all the staff who have worked diligently over the past decade to provide the CervicalCheck screening service in Ireland.  Our members hope that lessons have been learned by the HSE and Department of Health about the need to invest in Irish clinical pathology laboratories so that such vital services can be provided within the State in accredited laboratories with essential links to clinical services.</p></speech>

This committee is very anxious to find out exactly what happened regarding the outsourcing and awarding of contracts for cervical screening testing.  Having heard the two submissions, three issues arise, one relating to costs, one relating to standards and one relating to outsourcing.  The witnesses might address the issue of their view of the HSE's decision to outsource.  What were the criteria used?  Was it due to the costs involved, was it the volume in that it thought Ireland did not have the capacity, or was it that the laboratories in Ireland did not reach a certain standard?  What is the nub of what happened in 2008 when the indigenous laboratories in Ireland were not resourced and developed to deliver the service within the country?  Was it related to costs, standards or capacity?</p></speech>

I work in the Dublin Institute of Technology as a lecturer.  Dr. Euphemia McGoogan's report was published in 2004 in which she reviewed the ICSP phase 1 and made recommendations for the expansion to the full national programme.  In her report she made a statement about laboratory capacity.  She said that five major laboratories were screening sufficient numbers of smears at the time for quality assurance in practice and that, with appropriate funding and training, there would be sufficient capacity to provide the full service provided they all moved to liquid based cytology, LBC, which was a different way of taking the cervical sample into a liquid so that it could be prepared in a mono layer.  This was much quicker and easier to read than the previous smears and it also reduced many of the repeat smears that were a problem up to that time.</p> <p>  There was another ICSP report in 2006 prepared by Dr. Marian O'Reilly which examined the way in which capacity could be expanded through training of further medical scientists in the field of cervical cytology.  When the report was produced, the Dublin Institute of Technology was approached.  We set up a degree, with support and financial input from the ICSP, to train a further 50 medical scientists for cervical cytology.  We took in students in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and we were in the process of completing their training to expand the numbers, approximately ten per year, when we had to discontinue that programme because the outsourcing meant there would be no opportunities for those students either to train or to be employed, so capacity was not an issue.  Those were the matters on which I wanted to comment.</p></speech>

There was some funding and a requirement for accreditation of food laboratories but not for clinical diagnostic laboratories.  Many of the Irish laboratories undertook, of their own volition, to be accredited using the clinical pathology accreditation from the UK.  That was a set of standards, which looked, as all laboratory accreditation does, at the pre-analytical variables, the analytical part, which is what happens in the laboratory, and the post-analytical parts.</p> <p>  In 2005, on foot of the EU blood directive, there was a statutory instrument looking for blood transfusion laboratories to be accredited to the ISO 15189 standard, which is the international standard for medical testing laboratories.  That was mandated for blood transfusion laboratories and that was to be achieved by November 2008.  Specific funding was made available in terms of staffing and allocation of resources for the accreditation of blood transfusion laboratories but those alone.  At that time the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, which provides accreditation to the ISO 15189 standards, was not resourced or scoped up to accredit all the laboratories in Ireland and it was working towards the blood transfusion laboratories.  At the same time there was a European co-operation for accreditation, EA, regulation in Europe which provided that accreditation services were not a matter for competition and must be provided by the national accreditation agency.</p><p>That stalled the accreditation process for Irish laboratories, as many people who had been preparing to go with the UK CPA accreditation had to realign themselves with the ISO 15189 standard, given that the CPA was, after a certain time, no longer allowed to provide accreditation services in Ireland.</p><p> Although the laboratories were not accredited, they were all working in a quality management system and most - the cytology laboratories certainly had - had applied for accreditation in anticipation of this tender.  It was similar to the situation with hospital accreditation, where people were working to a standard and self-assessing but had not been inspected by the hospital accreditation system.</p></speech>

For someone to be able to do cytology, he or she must be doing a minimum number of smear slides per year, both positive and negative.  It is not an automated system - one must keep an eye in and maintain one's competence.  Once the work left the country, the scientists in Ireland no longer had the material to work with to maintain their competence.  The decision to outsource the service was a decision to outsource it permanently.  This was warned about at the time.</p></speech>

I received their presentations yesterday evening and have had a chance to read over them.  I have a memory of this happening at the time.  Mr. Casey and I are colleagues and we made comment on outsourcing at the time.</p> <p>  I will focus on what drove the decision to outsource.  My memory is that it was a highly politicised decision.  The comment that was made by the then Minister related only to price.  As the experts in the field, are the witnesses able to advise us of the clinical drivers of the decision?  We are hearing that the preference should have been for the maintenance of the service.  If memory serves, there was a great drive to outsource at the time, and not just in this area.  It strikes me that the then Government's decision was driven by price and not necessarily by quality.  What are the witnesses' views on this?</p> <p>  Regarding the deskilling and redeployment of staff, what shape are we in to insource the outsourced work?  With the introduction of HPV tests, I understand that fewer experts will be needed.</p> <p>  In 2006, a tender process - we only got these documents this morning - was undertaken by the HSE.  It was cancelled in September 2007.  The decision was made not to continue with the pilot programme tender and to develop specifications for a national programme from 2008.  Presumably, that was in line with the McGoogan report and would have involved insourcing.  Have the witnesses any insight to give into what drove the outsourcing?</p> <p>  People from the HSE and the screening programme appeared before us.  We examined the documentation from the time.  One of the assurances given was that there would be regular teleconferences - it was ten years ago, so we might say "Skype" today - between the Irish and US labs.  Will the witnesses give us an idea of the frequency of those teleconferences?  Are they regular, for example, weekly, daily or monthly, or are they scheduled as needed?  A head is being shaken at me, so I suspect that to be the truth.  According to the documentation from the time, there would be regular teleconferences.  We were reassured of it at our previous session.</p> <p>  I will be brief with my next question, as I only have ten minutes and want to leave time for answers.  Will the witnesses explain for a layperson like me the differences in how screening is carried out in Ireland?  We adhere to the ISO 15189 standard.  Does the same standard apply in the US or is it a similar one?  Does the US use different or similar accreditation?  I am not certain about what we are measuring, as we are comparing apples and oranges.</p></speech>

I will address the capacity issue in bringing the work back to Ireland.  My colleague, Dr. Lambkin, will elaborate on it further.</p> <p>  The Minister has referred to bringing the laboratory testing part back.  Were it to return immediately, we would not have the capacity.  This is a direct impact of the outsourcing.  That is the unfortunate thing.  Our recommendation is based on continuity of care and clinical governance in a single health system as opposed to quality standards or the metrics.  We are not commenting on the latter and saying, for example, testing in the USA is inferior.  Rather, we are referring to continuity of care, which we have sought for a long time.  We recommend that, on its introduction, HPV testing be implemented in Ireland.  My colleague will discuss HPV testing and its advantages.</p></speech>

They will also complete a clinical laboratory placement training, which would not be in cytology but in all disciplines of the laboratory.  Post graduation, they would have to train, usually for a year or a year and a half, in cervical cytology.  It has that extra training because one must learn to recognise all of the normal cells, abnormal cells, infectious agents and patterns that are seen in smears.  Those elements can be varied depending on the day of a woman's cycle, whether she has a previous smear history of abnormalities, etc.  It takes a long period of learning before a medical scientist can sign out smears.  In generating that capacity, we cannot just say that we will take all of the tests back in a month's time because we do not have the trained personnel in situ.  We would probably have to bring in people from abroad to perform the smears.</p><p>However, the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, ICSP, has been looking at the introduction of the human papilloma virus, HPV, test as the primary test on the cervical smear sample.  The reason is Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom and other European countries are all moving towards the idea that when a woman has a cervical smear taken in this liquid preparation, the primary test will be for high risk HPV.  About 40 HPVs can be found in the anogenital region, but the ones that are high risk are oncogenic which can lead to cervical abnormalities.  The recommendation in many countries is that the first test be for HPV.</p><p> HIQA brought out a report last year on the HPV test.  It looks as if it will be tendered for.  That is the future for the next developments in the service.  In itself, it will take some time to implement.  When it is implemented, if it is the primary test, for any positives for the high risk HPVs, smears will be prepared and examined as usual.  The Irish laboratories have capacity to deal with the number when there is a reduction, but that will take several years.  The academy's recommendation is that in the short term the plan be to implement the HPV test and then ensure all other testing, including smears, be performed in Ireland.</p></speech>

Laboratories in Ireland had been under-resourced for several years.  Therefore, when the Irish laboratories were tendering for the services, they included the cost of achieving the accreditation standard, as well as the cost of building up the resources and the numbers needed to provide a service.  I am also informed that one of the accredited laboratories which was part of a consortium was also required by its hospital board to include pension costs in the tender.  They were total absorption costs, whereas the tendering commercial companies in the United States were absorbing the work into their existing systems.  There is a suggestion that they may have been looking for it as a loss leader because they were aware of a political intent to look at outsourcing in general.</p></speech>

As medical scientists in Ireland, we have a professional body which can stand over what we do.  All of the standards are in place and we can relate them directly to the committee.  In Ireland this sensitive test is carried out by medical scientists who are highly qualified having spent up to five years in college.  Some of them have Masters degrees and then go on to specialise in this area.  They are not just cytoscreeners which they do not like to be called.  They are highly qualified medical scientists who have specialised in this area.  We know exactly who does the tests here and we can stand over what we do.  However, it is hard for us to comment on what somebody else does.  Fortunately, there is a centre in the Coombe hospital that does this important test.  In 2008 the decision to lose the ability and autonomy of a nation to carry out its own testing for its people was short-sighted and led to this meeting.  That must be borne in mind.  If there is commitment to change this, there has to be a full and proper commitment.</p></speech>

They were held either once or twice a week.  They also continued after the laboratories had disappeared off the scene because multidisciplinary team, MDT, meetings had to take place between gynaecologists and the pathologists in the United States who had done the cytology and the smear.  The difference at the time between the screening in the United States and here was in the volume of work we were doing.  In Ireland initially, when we started screening, we were doing about 32 screens per day.  That changed with the introduction in the early 1990s of the rapid review which was the safety net.  We worked on the basis that we would continue with 32 smear screens.  At that stage in the United States they were doing 100 a day.  Many of them said they had moved to using liquid-based cytology, which we accept.  However, we found it difficult.  We were dealing with what could be regarded as the original pap smear.  We were changing to using liquid-based cytology between 2007 and 2008.  In that case, we were hoping we would be able to increase the numbers we would do on a daily basis.  The Americans still continue with a figure of 100, but we had a full rapid review of all negatives.  In America they were doing a review of 10% of all negatives.  That was the difference between the two.</p> <p>  Was there a clinical need to outsource?  I do not believe there was.  The service provided here is exactly the same.  In fact, I think there was a better quality service here.  On the question of capacity, the idea behind outsourcing was to achieve a 28-day turnaround time.  One of the statements identified five laboratories that had a turnaround time of 28 days, but the rest of us could not achieve it.  The reason we could not do so was the most essential report on the cytology service, especially the cervical side of it, the negative report.  We were consumed by making sure it was negative.  It had to be negative and that took much time.</p> <p>  In 2007 and 2008, when working in a laboratory, I had four people in training.  They were qualified at honours degree level and had trained in the United Kingdom in September 2006.  They had come back to the laboratory where we double-screened their work.  There was a follow-up week in the United Kingdom in July and August 2007.  They made a pre-exam visit to the United Kingdom and in Ireland in December 2007.  We carried out a full review and brought in an international person to deal with all members of staff in April 2008.  In June 2008 they were certified to report on liquid-based cytology.  It took 21 months after completing their degrees and experience in the laboratory to be able to report in the cytology lab.  There was a long lead-in period.  They were essential members of staff.  If one of them got sick or decided to leave the job, we would have been back at square one in trying to get the expertise.</p></speech>

There is a widespread belief the service offered by the US labs was not as good and potentially is not as good as the service offered in Ireland.  That really is what women to whom I am talking want to know.  Was a decision taken, based on cost, to knowingly outsource to laboratories which produced less accurate results?  I was hoping we might get the delegates&rsquo; views on that matter.  </p> <p>  The academy is the professional and expert body.  It has stated it cannot comment on the quality metrics.</p><p>Yet, we have the quality metrics.  The HSE provided the quality metrics several weeks ago.  I have had the quality metrics examined by experts.  The HSE has had the quality metrics examined by experts.  The HSE has stated categorically that there is no difference in quality in identifying pre-cancerous or cancerous cells.  The chief medical officer has stated that categorically and the clinical director of the HSE has stated that categorically.  The independent expert I spoke to looked at the data.  He said that while it would be great to have more data, the data the HSE released showed no difference in quality.  If there is a difference in quality, we need to know and women in Ireland need to know.  Given that the data have been in the public domain for several weeks and that the purpose of this Oireachtas meeting is to get a view on the quality issues, will the academy representatives address this question?  I acknowledge there are labour and capacity issues and that these are important to the academy.  In any event, the women of Ireland want to know whether they are being screened by substandard laboratories.  Every expert we have had before the committee has stated categorically that there is no quality issue.  The data provided seem to suggest there is no quality issue.  The academy representatives have said they have no opinion on whether there is a quality issue.  Why do they have no opinion?  The data are in the public domain and this is the point of this Oireachtas meeting.  Why can they not comment on the quality metrics?  That is the purpose of our meeting, the data are in the public domain and that is what women in Ireland want to know.</p></speech>

The data in the public domain come from the 2014-16 audits.  They are part of the serious incident management team report.  They state that the positive predictive value is within international standards for all the laboratories.  The report lays out the three laboratories: laboratories A, B and C.  There is a variation in the reporting on the CervicalCheck quality assurance document or annual report.  CervicalCheck reports total numbers.  There seems to be variation in the way they are reported and the percentages reported.  We have looked at that and we see there is variation and it needs to be clarified.</p> <p>  The annual report from CervicalCheck states that the figures include colposcopy.  That could allow for the difference in figures.  The serious incident management team report does not seem to include colposcopy.  There is variation in reporting and that needs to be highlighted.</p> <p>  That is where we are on it.  We know ourselves about the quality in our laboratories.  As I said before, medical scientists examining a smear are required to reach individual pick-up or detection rates of 95% or greater for high-grade abnormalities.  If we are talking about smears with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, grade 2 or 3, as in the case of these women, we expect a detection rate for one independent medical scientist 95% of the time.  My colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, will elaborate on this.  We have two independent medical scientists reviewing a smear so the figure will be far higher.</p> <p>  We are talking about whatever is on a smear.  We are not talking about the whole screening process.  We are talking about if there are positive cells or abnormal cells on a smear.  The figure for each medical scientist reviewing it by him or herself is 95% or greater.  In reality, it is far better than that because we have two independent medical scientists or trained cytologists reviewing each smear.  The figures are sent back to CervicalCheck quarterly.  Medical scientists have to achieve this rate.  The figure is greater than 90% for all abnormalities.  We know that-----</p></speech>

I am asking two questions.  What women want to know is not the process used by the professionals.  I know it is important but that is not the question they are asking.  They are asking experts like Dr. Regan, whom we can trust, whether there is any evidence that the screening they have been provided with is substandard.  The HSE has said there is none.  In fact, the HSE has said there is categorical evidence that the quality is the same.  The Department of Health has said there is categorical verifiable data or scientific evidence that the quality is the same.  I am asking the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine as a professional body whether the academy agrees with the HSE and the Department of Health on the data and on the question of whether the quality is the same.  Are the academy representatives asserting that they have data showing otherwise?  We really need to know if the view of the academy is that the quality of the US laboratories is inferior to the others.</p></speech>

I took the figure of abnormalities detected directly to an expert because it was on the front page of one of our national newspapers cited as evidence that the US laboratories were not as good.  The expert said that was nonsense.  He said laboratory B, which is in the Coombe, is showing a higher percentage of abnormalities detected because the Coombe is sent higher-risk tests.  The expert said of course the Coombe would show a higher percentage.  Furthermore, he said that the percentage of abnormalities detected is not what experts use to determine the accuracy of the laboratory.  They use positive predictive value because a false negative is so hard to get since it relies on self-reporting and because moving from pre-cancerous to cancerous cells can take ten, 12 or 15 years.  He said, therefore, that the industry standard is positive predictive value, PPV.  Moreover, he said that when we look at positive predictive value in two of the three years examined the Irish laboratory is the least accurate.  Do the academy representatives believe that using the percentage of anomalies detected is a legitimate measure?  I am being told by the experts is that it is not and that it is potentially a determinant of socio-demographics, that is to say, different test results for different population groups.  I am also being told that the Coombe may be getting what are already identified as high-risk samples.</p></speech>

Programme smears are the same whether they go to laboratory A, B or C.  The Coombe also does smears from patients who are in colposcopy.  They are the women who are already reported as having positive smears.</p> <p>  This is why when we look at the statistics it is really important to know what we are actually looking at, especially in the case of the Coombe.  Are we looking at them with the positive colposcopy in or out?  That will clearly change the percentage of high-grade smears reported by that particular laboratory.</p><p>In different places they reported differently.  My colleague, Mr. Gerard O'Mahony, can go into that with the Deputy in greater detail.  If we look specifically at what has been reported by the investigation team from CervicalCheck, it looked specifically at 1,482 cases and said that in 442 of those one or more elements of their care required review.  Of those, 209 had a variation in their cytology report and, of those, 175 should have had their treatment escalated.  If we take that 175, it is 12% of 1,482 and 39.6% of those whose cytology was reviewed and it was found, based on that review, that there should be an escalation.  I do not know where those cases came from because the report on 1,482 cases does not tell me in what laboratories or in what years the original slides were done so we need more information but I find it a little worrying.  </p></speech>

I am a very simple man so I go back and look at definitions and give simple examples.  In this particular case I go to CervicalCheck for the definition which is in most of its annual reports.  It says the positive predictive value is reported as the percentage of women referred with high grade cytological abnormality who have a histological diagnosis of CIN2, which is high grade or higher.  A simple example of that is taking three labs, X, Y and Z.  In lab X, we give them 100 abnormal slides, they pick up 20 and 16 are accepted to be high grade.  Lab Y picks up 40 and it is confirmed that 32 of those are of a high grade and lab Z picks up 80 and 64 are confirmed to be of high grade.  That would mean that each of those labs working on the same amount of work has a predictive value, PPV, of 80%.  It does not pick up false negatives.  What it identifies are the individuals working in the lab and the number of positives they picked up which go on to colposcopy or biopsy and the confirmation of that.  Each of those labs has picked up a certain pocket of positivity which is confirmed at 80%.  That is what the PPV is.  That is what it is defined as and it is defined over and over again.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about ten years ago when the outsourcing started.  Gibbons reported at that stage that the norm across Irish laboratories was a percentage of 1.8%.  The outsourced work at the time was giving a figure of 1.2%.  He claimed a difference of 0.6%.  That 0.6% is 0.6 per 100, six per 1,000, 60 per 10,000 and it works on like that.  When one goes back and looks at the first figures-----</p></speech>

We put this to both the HSE and the Department of Health and the impression from what they told us was they were not terribly impressed with the analysis.  What they told us, which we did not have time to get into in more detail, was that the testing and the samples being used were non-comparable and that the 1.8% and 1.2% were non-comparable.  We did not ask for a technical note from the HSE or the Department to get into that.  Does Mr. O'Mahony believe it was comparable?  If so, what are the HSE and the Department of Health missing?  They essentially refute that comparison and say it is not an accurate scientific comparison.</p></speech>

The HSE had figures on what was being outsourced and the incidence.  That could have been compared back at that stage.  Unfortunately at that stage there was too much focus on the 28-day turnaround time rather than looking at the quality.</p></speech>

They will have a huge role to play in the coming weeks.  It is a very important role.  Many people watching proceedings are depending on the witnesses.  I know that because people have told me.  There is a need for clarity and honesty.  There is a need for the witnesses to explain what happened in the past.  I have some of their documentation here.  They flagged it in big red flashing lights in their professional analysis with regard to what some of my colleagues have addressed and which I will address with regard to the reviews, audits, processes and what has been delivered.  I will also address the future.  Let us not forget about that because obviously there will be a change.  The dogs in the street know that.</p> <p>  We will bring this back as there would be an outcry otherwise.  How do we resource for that in terms of human resources, IT resources, lab resources and all of that?  How do we plan for it?  Whatever is necessary has to be put in place.  The witnesses will also be dealing with Dr. Karin Denton who is working with Dr. Scally on his work.  I do not know if the witnesses have met or spoken with her yet.  I expect the Department of Health is watching proceedings.  Whoever in the Department of Health is watching proceedings, the Secretary General or whoever, will he or she please organise for these individuals to meet the representatives of the Scally team?  I understand the relevant person is Dr. Karin Denton.  Perhaps that would happen this week because it is very important.</p> <p>  I have a range of questions on the past, present and future.  I have the very strong letter that Mr. Casey sent on 6 June 2008 to members of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association.  He pointed out that they would not be able to competitively tender into the future as a result of the decision and would not be able to develop capacity into the future which would have ancillary restrictions on the work its members do in the future.  It is a very strong letter.  Attached is a very strong statement from the time, which I read in a historical context given what we now know.  It stands out very clearly.  Mr. Casey talks about quality and detection rates, the future ability to tender, the creation of a monopoly, the reduction in mortality rates and the work that was being done on reform.  His statement notes that Ireland stands relatively high on quality of performance.  It is a very good letter and statement.  Perhaps I will put a number of questions and the witnesses can come back on them because I have a range of questions.  Mr. Casey said on quality in detection rates that "from recently adjusted figures, excluding urgent smear policy, at least 30% of cases with pre-cancerous cells will go undetected based on the data from the previous outsourcing exercise by the NCSS to Quest Diagnostics."  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.  It does not have to be Mr. Casey.</p></speech>

I have another question.  That is the first point.  We know now that the 70-30 rule has been cited all along.  I was very much taken by the previous outsourcing exercise because it is a statement of fact.  It also says: "We would be concerned that an increase in mortality and morbidity may result in Ireland by using a laboratory with low detection rates."</p><p>There is a correlation with NCSS going to Quest Diagnostics and mortality rates.  First, there is the 30% of cases that will go undetected based on data from previous outsourcing.  Based on that data the mortality rate will increase because of using a laboratory with a lower detection rate.  Finally, I also have a letter from Alison Malkin of the school of biological sciences in Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, of 17 April 2007, which was sent to Mr. Drumm and copied to Mary Harney.  Basically, it says that because of the decision to outsource, there would be concerns regarding differences between screening algorithms, reporting systems and quality assurance.</p><p> In fairness to all the witnesses, they flagged what transpired to become the main issues, which have left us in a situation where we have a range of problems going forward.  My two questions to Dr. Lambkin are on the definite correlation between the previous outsourcing, on which she might elaborate, and the 30% of cases, and fears about mortality rates because of the outsourcing.  What she said is quite scary now when we look at it in the modern context.</p></speech>

What I am quoting is the D&aacute;il debate of 29 May 2008.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh said: "Quest has won the tender to analyse 300,000 Irish smear tests a year, but consultant pathologists [which are medical histopathologists] from the Coombe Women's Hospital, St. James's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin, and University College Hospital in Galway stated that missed cases would arise because the diagnostic rate of pre-cancerous cells at Quest Diagnostics in the US is 30% less than that of Irish laboratories."</p></speech>

If cancer is only detected in 70 women, the other 30 will develop invasive cancer.  What we are all concerned with is that whatever test the cytology screening programme is doing would pick up preferably 100% of those high grade cases to ensure that there is no mortality from cervical cancer.  However, there is no test that is 100% perfect at that-----</p></speech>

I have more than three minutes.</p> <p>  I refer to the quality of the results being provided.  Letters were issued to women.  A total of 46 got them in time and others only received them recently.  I have a copy of one.  On the left it gives the previous result and, on the right, it is reviewed.  I know from talking to people and through the audit which started in 2014 the volume of women who are going from P2 to P9.  There have been many conversations in the Oireachtas over the past two weeks about statistics, and I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts as well.  However, this is not just a case of carrying out these tests, the statistical comparison being 70:30 and these women being part of the 30%; this is catastrophic human error.  A woman does not simply go from P2 to P9.  The witnesses have a huge role in this.  Do they believe that once the audit process was being conducted - and Vicky Phelan made it quite clear to us in the other committee that it was quite obvious that she had cancer and that it was human error - that there was a responsibility on the HSE when it saw as part of the process that there was such a movement from one reading to the other, to qualitatively analyse what was happening?  That is a critical question.</p></speech>

It should have rung some alarm bells.  We can look at the statistics and say we have a change in results, so it moved from being negative to being borderline.  That does not have a particular clinical impact.  We need to look at the clinical impact of the established error without jumping to conclusions.  I offer my sympathies to all the women who got a letter that indicates that there was a mistake in their treatment, but we have to wait until the Scally report is issued.  He is doing an in-depth audit that will, hopefully, give us what we believe might be a heat map telling us if there is a problem in one particular laboratory, if it was with a cluster of years and if it was a cluster of people who were working there.</p></speech>

I do not have the figures for the particular year but it seems to have been a bad year.  This is not an exact science.  One is looking down the microscope and one is comparing what one sees with what one knows to be normal or what one knows to be abnormal.  If one now knows that this woman has been diagnosed with a tumour or that following colposcopy she has been found to have cervical cancer, then one goes back to look at the review slide with a different lens to a certain extent.  One is looking to see if it was there.  Sometimes one may find it in a slightly different way.  However, we need to look very carefully - and Dr. Scally will do that - at exactly what was happening, where it was happening and who was doing it.  Something that goes from P2 to P9 is not good enough.</p></speech>

Let us consider the note that was prepared by the HSE for the Minister for Health and the Department only a month ago in April.  It states there was no issue relating to quality.  That is famously said in the memorandum.  We all know now that was completely ridiculous and wrong.  I refer to the audit process.</p><p>When the review was carried out, it would have been glaringly obvious that the movement across was so seismic.  In addition, the HSE did not see that there was a quality assurance issue involved and that the movements were so catastrophic that there were issues regarding what was going on and the laboratories.  We need to break down the position in respect of the laboratories.  I have a fundamental belief we need to chase the money relating to the laboratories, where the smears were conducted-----</p></speech>

What we do is subjective.  The emphasis here must be on pre-cancerous cells.  That is the medical scientist who uses his or her knowledge and expertise to subjectively make a call on that.  The integrity of the scientist is of paramount importance here.  We do not want to mask results by bringing in other areas.  We are talking about pre-cancerous cells and the subjective testing of them.  I think that is very important to note.  We need to focus our data on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#L00700"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The witnesses referred to 15 laboratories in the mid-1980s.  My understanding is that there are now two laboratories in Ireland that do this work.  Are there other laboratories doing other medical analysis that could take on some of this work if they got the staff?  What is the position relating to laboratories overall in the country if we wanted to retain all of this work?</p> <p>  In order to retain the work, we would have to upskill people and ensure that we have an adequate number of individuals who are suitably qualified.   A total of 60 people were redeployed as a result of the outsourcing.  If we started a programme today to ensure that this many people would be sufficiently qualified, how long would it take us to ensure that we reached our target?  Are there people conducting clinical analysis in other areas who could be switched with upskilling or must we start from the very beginning?</p> <p>  The witnesses talk about how higher-grade abnormalities should be identified in 95% of cases while all abnormalities should be identified in 90% of cases.  I have seen different reports.  I saw one, a document produced by Professor Brennan, which seems to indicate that his figures would vary somewhat from those of the witnesses.  One of the issues that needs to be identified is the fact that the smear test - and the work done in this area - deals with that specific type of cancer; it does not identify other cancers.  We need to get clarification as well on that because once a person got a clear smear result and even issues arose about which they were concerned, the immediate response was "Well, it can't be cancer.  I've got a clear smear."  Do we need to get an great deal more information out there to the effect that the smear test or even the HPV testing about which we are talking will not produce a finite result of 100%?</p> <p>  We are now in the area of litigation.  If we take the figure of 95% of higher-grade abnormalities, what about the 5% where it is not identified?  How do we deal with that from a litigation point of view?  Last year, we paid out &euro;300 million in claims through the State Claims Agency.  For every &euro;1 million paid out, there is &euro;1 million less available to spend on healthcare.  I am not taking from people affected by errors.  Where genuine errors occur, people must be adequately compensated.  All of the screening is not 100%.  How do we now deal with this issue?  I am not doubting the 95% but there are still 5% of cases we cannot and will not be able to identify.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Irene Regan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#L00800"><p>I will take the first question.  We discussed the capacity issue previously.  Senator Colm Burke asked whether there are other clinical laboratories that can take on this workload.  As we mentioned previously, medical scientists are highly qualified.  They spend up to five years in undergraduate education, which includes an obligatory clinical placement.  Cervical screening is very specialised so they need to train in that area so we just cannot take somebody and train them in a day.  It does take up to two years to do that.  They must meet competencies, look at 5,000 cases in order to be declared competent, be signed off and complete various courses.  That is the protocol for that and the academy would definitely support that and expect nothing else in the future for that.  There is a long training process.  We are talking about quality here and training and standards are very important.  This is what the academy is about.  It is about professional standards and recommending.  As a result, we cannot have a sticking plaster.  If we bring it back here, we want it the experts to do it and we want to assure the women of Ireland that they have a quality system operated by highly-trained experts who specialise in cervical cytology.  It will not be a quick fix.  We cannot just move people back and forth to do this.  Clinical diagnostics is a very specialised area.  We train for a long time to do it.  Many decisions are made on the work we do so it is very important to get it right and to be qualified and expert in it.  The academy would support that.</p> <p>  I will discuss Professor Brennan's report and my colleague, Dr. Lambkin, will elaborate on HPV testing because the Senator asked about that.  There is a bit of debate and confusion regarding statistics concerning the 65% to 75%.  This is about the screening process.  This is the whole process, this is what the 65% to 75% concerns.  It relates to if the smear is taken at the right time and in the right way, and what it picks up.  There will be adenocarcinomas.  There are different cancers that will not be picked up by a screening process.  When he talks about the screening, it is the process and, of course, the laboratory analysis of that smear is included in that.  He is talking about 60% to 75%.  I think it has got lost and it very confusing for people out there.  Women are thinking that it will pick up their positive result only six out of ten times.  This is a positive result at which we are looking in respect of a smear.  That is not six out of ten times.  It is the whole process involving whether it is taken properly.  The women about whom we are talking had positive results.  The cells were on the slide.  This is a very different thing to whether it was taken at the right time or whether they had pre-cancerous cells that could be picked up by the screening process.  There is confusion out there and it is important to clarify what those statistics mean.</p><p>With regard to the 95%, Professor Brennan has said otherwise on the issue because it does not identify other cancers.  When one considers the overall figure it is not 95% of all abnormalities.  As I understand it, the screening process is 90% of all abnormalities in that particular area but not in other areas that are cancer related.</p></speech>

The 90% and 95% areas are observer error.  In other words, out of 20 abnormalities at high grade there may be 5% missed.  That is the entitlement of the medical scientist.  We are looking for that 90% to 95% on target.  Over all abnormalities, including low grade and high grade, one is looking for a return of 90%.  If we do not achieve that then it is a case of retraining or looking again at the positives, or there is another form to get back to that level.  That is the level at which we work.  It is a very high level of detail and is very tiring, but it is the level at which the scientist works and the level he or she is permitted an error of maybe one in 20.  If the scientist makes two errors in 20 then he or she comes off the bench.  It is very simple.</p></speech>

It does not deal with other issues around other cancers.  The misinformation out there is very much that once a person gets a clear smear and a clear result she is totally clear and does not have to worry about it for three years, whereas there are other cancers that the tests may not identify.  Would the witness agree with this?</p></speech>

We are now into the whole area of litigation.  The witnesses have referred to the 95% where it will be identified but there is 5% where it may not be identified, for one reason or another.  If this arises through subsequent audits and reviews where readings were incorrect, as in this case, how do witnesses propose that this is dealt with?</p></speech>

When an individual medical scientist looks at a smear, which may be 95% pick-up of high grade cells, another medical scientist will be screening that slide also as a second screen.  That is the quality procedure as performed in Ireland.  If there is a 95% pick-up by the first screen there is a good chance that the second person might pick up one or some of the 5%.  This is why there are two people looking at the smear - to hopefully pick that up.  There is always human error.</p> <p>  Some individuals who get cervical cancer have a form of cancer called adenocarcinoma as opposed to squamous carcinoma.  Adenocarcinoma, generally, is harder to pick up in smears.  Sometimes when a person gets a negative smear there may not have been representative cells of that tumour adequately present for it to be identified.  The smear is most effective for the identification of cells related to squamous carcinoma.</p></speech>

Nobody has done their job incorrectly.  No smear and no screening test is 100% detection.  It is a screen, it is not a diagnostic.  There are many women present.  When we speak with women we explain to them what is going on.  Women are clever.  Do not promise a woman that a negative smear means there is absolutely no risk that she has it at all.  Be absolutely clear in the communication and be upfront with women, they will listen and accept it.  We cannot accept, however, when there is clear evidence of an abnormality in the sample taken that it is not detected.  This is where the litigation problem arises.</p></speech>

I apologise that I must ask my question and then leave because I have an appointment.</p> <p>  My interest is in the decision that was taken in 2008 on outsourcing the screening service. It is pretty clear that it was a political decision.  The witnesses might be able to fill the committee in on the clinical involvement at the time.  What is the witnesses' understanding on where the decision to outsource came from?  Was there a huge amount of consultation with clinicians in the run-up to the decision to outsource?  My memory of it is that it was a purely political decision and not a clinical decision.  In the run up to the decision being made, what was the level of discussion with clinicians, what were the issues identified and what was the ultimate deciding factor in 2008?  We are all dealing with the consequences of the decision to outsource and it is very material to the discussions that will take place at this committee.</p></speech>

In 2007 there was a backlog of screening in the State.  A number of us were invited, along with the National Cancer Screening Service, to look at where we could find laboratories across the UK and France that might be able to take our backlog, or help us with our backlog.  We researched this and had procurement people from the HSE with us that led the team.  We came back with information on people who were training and people who were being educated in colleges in this discipline, but like a bolt out of the blue, in March of 2008 we were told that the work would go to tender.  I am trying to remember dates but we had travelled to the UK and to France in May and June and it was later in the autumn out of the blue the decision was taken that the work would go to the US.  I certainly did not visit the laboratory in the US, and I know nobody of the cytology fraternity at that stage who had visited a laboratory in the US.</p></speech>

Their information is quite enlightening.  I have a number of questions about the two-year training programme, which is regarded as the ideal situation.  Does this apply in the United States of America and in other laboratories outside of Ireland, and does the sector here have any control over that?</p> <p>  I must mention that I am biased with regard to the need to retain laboratory facilities at home in Ireland.  I have always been strongly of this view.  I do not see any basis at all for outsourcing, except in very short-term situations and emergencies.  We have a right to have the best information available to us in the shortest possible time, and this is the only way to do it.</p><p>Did the witnesses have any forewarning, before recent events, that something might be wrong?  Can they shed any light on that now? <br/><br/>How long would it take to increase laboratory capacity in this country to meet demand at the present time?  <br/><br/>How does the turnaround time in this jurisdiction compared to that in the United States?  <b></b><br/><br/><b></b>Two people deal with every sample.  Are there any procedures which might be dealt with by more than two people, particularly where people get tired?  Is there a checking system where a screen may be looked at for a second time immediately in the laboratory, rather than having the person present for a repeat screening?  <br/><br/>I have spoken, and I am sure we have all spoken, with women who assert that something is wrong.  Even when laboratories and clinicians tell them that nothing is wrong and that all the test are okay they still insist that something is wrong but the problem is they have been proven correct.  Can the witnesses tell us why that might be?  I am talking about some of the most voracious forms of cancer.  My theory is that the patient, who is the person in the eye of the storm, knows best.  They do not have the medical knowledge required to describe what is wrong.  However, if they feel something is wrong, they are usually correct.  That has to be borne in mind.  </p></speech>

The Deputy asked how long it takes to train people.  We have to look at one year, three-year and five-year strategies.  Given the current environment, it will be very difficult to encourage people into cervical cytology; it is seen as a high-risk area now.  It takes a minimum of two years to train people up in this area, and we have to look at how sustainable that is in the long-term to ensure that we will have people working in that profession in the future.  The Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine is concerned with expertise, not just training a person up quickly.  It will take two years, and it involves encouraging people to take up what is seen as a high-risk, difficult profession.</p></speech>

There are screening, quality control and retraining elements while unusual cases have to be looked at.  Time out is also required; staff need their breaks.  If HPV testing was introduced, some 60,000 and 100,000 samples would be generated for cytology, so approximately one third of the 30 or 40 staff required would be needed to meet that demand.  We are close enough to those figures at the moment with public laboratories, and we are certainly over it when private laboratories are taken into account.  If we went to HPV testing to generate 60,000 to 100,000 samples, and we should be in a position, between private and public sector staff, to be able to deal with that in Ireland.  One laboratory is dealing with over 25,000 tests  currently, and I believe one private laboratory is dealing with over 130,000, which gives a total of 155,000.</p></speech>

That, presumably, is the standard with which we would have to comply should the work be repatriated here.  That might have to be modified slightly because if a primary HPV test followed by a cytology examination on those that are positive from that test are required, the turnaround time will be slightly longer given two tests rather than one will need to be done.  I appreciate that women want their results back in a short space of time.  They are worried after the smear and they want to know the result.  I am fairly confident that they would prefer to have the correct result back in two weeks rather than an incorrect result in ten days.</p></speech>

We know that all laboratories are expected to return statistics to CervicalCheck on a regular basis.  Laboratories here are inspected by our national accreditation board.  We do not know what the inspection regime in the United States is because they do not all operate to the same ISO standard that we do.  There is a different accreditation system in the United States.  ISO might be used but the laboratories might also be using the American scheme.</p></speech>

There is a widespread misunderstanding among many people as to what has happened.  There are three issues, the first of which relates to the laboratories.  Some people believe that the US laboratories have been less accurate but the data do not back that up.  However, we should wait to see what the future investigation shows.  Perhaps there are areas where there are difficulties, and we need to investigate them thoroughly.  At the moment there is no data to show that the United States laboratories were inferior.</p><p>The second issue is the question of who made the decision.  The assertion has been made at this committee has been that this was a political decision.  One or more witnesses have just answered Deputy O'Reilly's query concerning whether clinicians were involved in the decision.  The answer provided, when we look at the transcript, will say that there were none involved. </p><p>I would like to quote a speech from the former Minister for Health, Ms Harney, in 2008, because it is important that we understand who made this decision and why:</p><blockquote>The tender was examined not by the Minister or any official from the Department of Health and Children, but by a group established by National Cancer Screening Service, [which at the time was independent of the HSE, with an independent board] which included doctors ... who has been running the service in the mid-west, and a doctor from Northern Ireland, who was charged with the responsibility for quality assurance there and who is also involved in the accreditation process in the UK.</blockquote> <p>The former Minister went on to say:</p><blockquote>The National Cancer Screening Service did not have to go to tender but chose to do so for reasons of transparency, fairness and equity to make sure it got the best quality assured service.</blockquote> <p>The Minister, in 2008, explicitly stated that there were no politicians, no officials or civil servants involved, and that an independent body, the NCSS, brought a group of doctors together to make the decision and to run the process.  The witnesses have just said that there no doctors or clinicians involved and that it was a political process.  Was the Minister lying?  Was she completely unaware of the process she had just overseen?  Why do we have such a massive discrepancy?</p><p>There is a widespread belief among the public that there is a clinical link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for women.  That has been categorically refuted by everyone that I have put that question to at these committee hearings.  Most women I have spoken to believe that the HSE sat on data that it could have provided to doctors, which could have helped them.  That is what most people believe because of deeply irresponsible statements that have been made by Oireachtas Members.</p><p> Mr. Casey said the MLSA is "deeply saddened by the impact of the system failures on individual women."   I acknowledge the association is not trying to add to the confusion but that kind of language adds to it.  The phrase suggests a causal link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for women.  The majority of women to whom I have spoken believe that to be the case.  I will outline what happened.  In 2008, a national cancer screening service or CervicalCheck was set up, which was great.  In 2014, an audit process was introduced.  We are one of the only countries that carry out such an audit process, and that was a good development.  In 2015, CervicalCheck decided to provide full feedback to the doctors for ongoing communication with the patients.  Ireland was one of only two countries that conducted such an audit and gave feedback.  All of these developments were good.  In 2016, CervicalCheck communicated with doctors on the assumption that they communicate onwards.  The systems failure in all of this is that the doctors did not tell their patients.   The doctors have replied that even if they had told their patients it would have made no difference to their treatment.  I know that I have gone on but it is important that we get clarity on this matter.  I do not believe it was intentional but I believe the association's opening statement unintentionally supports the causality argument, which we have been told by every expert that we have questioned is false.  </p><p> I have two questions.  The Minister at the time said that no politician or official were involved and a group of doctors with international group of doctors was brought together.  We were told earlier that a political decision was made without the involvement of clinicians.  Which of those two statement are true?   Is it the witnesses' opinion that there was, or was not, a causal link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for the women?</p></speech>

I accept that the failing was in terms of the communications process that related to the audit.  If there is confusion, then I accept that point.</p> <p>  Regarding the decision to award the entire tender to Quest Diagnostics, I assert that I do not genuinely believe that a Government would allow a service of that nature to be outsourced to a different jurisdiction and that it would not have had any input whatsoever.  Ten years ago when we strongly advocated against such a move, we were not aware that the entire service would be shut down.  That was what we were advised would happen.  Subsequently, the Coombe Hospital stated that there was a requirement for the training of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and, therefore, the retention of quality, which is welcome.  It is a credit to the staff at the Coombe Hospital for insisting that the service would remain.  It is absolutely our view that it was a political decision.  I can back that up because around the same time we were presented with a report that effectively was a proposal to tender for much more of the pathology testing, particularly relating to co-laboratory work and primary care.  At the time we worked hard to show that that would be the wrong thing to do.  We even presented our own report that showed from a cost perspective insourcing would be the right thing to do and we, ultimately, have won that argument.  We remain stridently of the view that it was a Government decision.</p></speech>

She was told "No" by the witnesses.  The Minister at the time not only said that clinicians were involved but that the scheme was clinically-led and then went on to essentially identify the clinicians who were involved.  I have sat through weeks of misinformation being put into the public realm, which has had a damaging effect and eroded confidence in the service.  I hear what has Mr. Naughton is saying.  In my non-qualified opinion, the scientists should have been involved.  Let me outline why I asked about the clinicians.  I fear that the public will, based on answers given to the committee, say that they did not even bring doctors in.</p></speech>

There is quite a difference between an orthopaedic surgeon and an ophthalmologist.  I would not expect one or the other to comment on the outsourcing of their services.  There may well have been clinicians involved but the majority of the clinicians working on the cervical programme are not laboratory medicine-based clinicians.  A decision, therefore, was made about the outsourcing of laboratory tests probably without significant input from clinicians.  When I say "clinicians", I mean both the pathologists and the scientists who are also clinicians in a regulated profession.</p></speech>

I do not say they were not medical doctors.  I am sure a number were involved.  They may have used experts from the UK but the configuration of laboratories in the UK and, indeed, in other parts of Europe, differs from the configuration in this country.  The qualifications of the scientists in this country are the envy of the rest of Europe, and yet our qualification was put to one side and the contract awarded on a cost basis.</p></speech>

Our issue at the time was that the Dr. Euphemia McGoogan report was not implemented.  We were never told that we needed to sort this out, resolve our capacity problem or amalgamate laboratories.

There were catastrophic differences between P2s and P9s.  Given the witnesses' professional expertise, I ask whether a quality audit should have been carried out by the HSE.  I ask all six witnesses for a "Yes" or "No" answer at the end.  I am not trying to catch anyone out.  I just want the professional opinion of the witnesses, given that we now know about these catastrophic changes.  I have seen a few audit reports, including one where there were four errors in a row and then there was a catastrophic change.  I have it here.  It is redacted but it showed me something. </p> <p>  My next question is about Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  She  was on "Morning Ireland" on 27 April 2018 and the figures have been repeated so I am not going to go through them.  I refer to the figure of 1,482 cases.  It breaks down that 277 were reviewed.  There was no change in 71 and we ended up with the 209 figure.  That shows that 75% of the 277 cases were misread.  In light of that, do the witnesses believe - given the percentages - that there was a need for some random sampling of normal smears to establish whether the level of accuracy underpinning the whole programme was working?  </p> <p>  My next question concerns the audit process methodology which we have received.  The witnesses will have seen the Outcomes of audits between 2008 to 2015 document.  There are levels one to six.  Diagnosis after a previous smear that recommended repeat cytology is No. 5 at 11%.  It says to review some cases.  The word "some" has been troubling me.  That means that some were reviewed and some were not.  How, scientifically, was that done?  How are some picked and not others?</p> <p>  My last question relates to the HPV test into the future.  This is important to me and I raised it in the D&aacute;il weeks ago.  There is no way in hell that the witnesses will be able to do these tests without receiving huge resources quickly.  Human resources are going to take time and the witnesses have explained eloquently why that is.  Laboratories need changes and IT needs upgrading.  I am a big eHealth person.  What needs to be done and what is the quickest timeframe in which it could be done?  I was quick as I could be.  I ask the witnesses to start with the first question.  </p></speech>

We have been talking about heat maps.  They can tell us whether the error rate, or the pick up rate or whatever, is the same across all laboratories.  If an error rate is consistent across all laboratories - on a ratio basis because some are doing more tests that other - we would see that one of the outcomes and conclusions could be that this is a limitation of the cervical screening test.  We talked about specificity and sensitivity.  However, if there is a cluster or many of those errors are being found in one place at one particular time, then it would warrant analysis.  It could be seen as a systematic failure.  I am not suggesting it is but we need the heat map and we need to know where the errors are happening.  We do not have that information so we cannot judge it.  Deputy Kelly said it is out there but it is not and it is very important we have it.  We will then be able to see and judge what is happening.  I hope that I have adequately answered that part of the question.</p></speech>

They can then bring that expertise home and set it up.  We need a project that looks perhaps at going to tender or setting up in designated large centres-----</p></speech>

If HPV testing is introduced, what kind of reduction can be expected in cervical cancer?  How long do we need to have it up and running before we can see really positive results?</p></speech>

The aim of any screening programme is to reduce the overall rates of cervical cancer, preferably by 100%, over many years.  If one has a very good cervical screening programme, one would hope to reduce it by perhaps 80%.  The UK has had a very effective screening programme since the 1980s over its whole population, where they have reduced the overall rate by at least 50%.  The introduction of HPV testing will not completely cure cervical cancer but it might allow it to be detected more effectively and more quickly than with the cervical smear alone.</p> <p>  It should also be borne in mind that it is a period of huge change for all screening programmes.  First, we are moving towards HPV testing as a new way of investigating.  Cervical cytology has been the test for 50 years so this is a significant change for all national programmes to introduce that.  Second, vaccination is now in place.  Now that girls are being vaccinated in most countries, it will have an impact on the number of cases of cervical cance, which should drop and hopefully by a dramatic level.  There is lots of research on change.  Changing programmes is a massive undertaking which takes years.  It is not feasible to follow recommendations such as stopping the sending of samples.  It must be planned very carefully and it would take a three to five year programme review and alteration.  If there were errors in one lab, they might be remedied by introducing additional quality control measures and so on.  Switching to HPV testing is not a panacea.  There continue to be many other considerations, research and tracking of the types in the population, and so on.</p></speech>

In a previous incarnation, I tabled parliamentary questions on cancer research, the incidence of cancer and its various forms in different regions of Ireland prior to the National Cancer Registry being established.  It has done an excellent job and a huge amount of work, but since it was established one can no longer get parliamentary replies on the matter.  It is a distinct disadvantage as an occasional probe into the system can often alert people within the system to things that might have passed them by, without there having been any deliberate attempt on their part or the part of others to avoid it.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions, one of which follows from Dr. Regan's remarks.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the measures taken by the cervical cancer national cancer screening services quality assurance in cytopathology.  Quality assurance site visits to laboratory providers is listed as one of the things that must be undertaken, however, it does not say how many visits are required.  In a recent parliamentary question, I asked how many site visits had been carried out on all the labs since outsourcing began and was told there had been two, one in 2011 and the other in 2014.  Do the witnesses think that is good enough?  How bad is this State's oversight on outsourcing of the CervicalCheck programme?  </p> <p>  My second question is one I keep asking and am told that I will be given the answer.  Before he left, Tony O'Brien was before the health committee where he gave a commitment to me that of the 209 misread tests, he would make me a list of the specific laboratories from which they came.  One of his officials, Mr. John Gleeson, said that they would name them lab A, lab B, and lab C, when Mr. O'Brien interrupted and said, no, he would give me the names of the labs.  I have not received them.  At a private meeting with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, with representatives of the health spokespersons from each party, I asked the same question.  The Minister said "We will get that for you Deputy Smith".  Recently when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was filling in for the Taoiseach at Leaders Questions, I asked him and he promised he would get it for me.  All this time has passed and we still have not been given this information.  How difficult or how easy would it be to get the information about which labs the misread tests came from?  Was it ten from one,  20 from another and 30 from the other?  It is a simple question that I have asked repeatedly and cannot get an answer.  The last time I raised it I was told that it would be part of the scoping exercise.  I have no problem with that but when what seems to me to be a simple question is asked, an answer should be available.  Is this a hard question to answer or not?</p></speech>

BreastCheck plays an important role in preventing breast cancer and has identified more than 11,500 breast cancers since the programme commenced in 2000.  It meets the highest international standards for breast screening and, following a detailed audit process, the programme has been internationally recognised as one of Europe's leading breast screening programmes.  I will now ask my colleague and the national clinical lead for BreastCheck, Professor Ann O'Doherty, to provide more information to the committee on the success of the programme and the future plans for the programme.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to reassure the elected Members of the quality and safety of our breast screening programme in order that they in turn can reassure women of the quality of our programme.  The past four weeks have been very difficult for Irish women, and it is incumbent on those of us who deliver the breast screening service to provide the reassurance necessary.  I have devoted my professional life to the diagnosis of breast cancer both in the screening and the symptomatic setting.  I established the first breast screening programme in Belfast in 1988.  I was appointed clinical director of the Merrion BreastCheck unit in 1998.<br/><br/>BreastCheck is the national breast cancer screening programme.  The screening programme aims to diagnose cancers at the earliest possible stage, when there is a better outcome and the cancer, it is to be hoped, may be treated less aggressively and with less morbidity.  The programme was established following the publication of seminal randomised controlled trials in Sweden and other countries that demonstrated a reduction in breast cancer mortality of up to 30% by mammographic screening.  BreastCheck offers mammograms to women every two years.  Initially, they were offered to those between the ages of 50 and 64, but over the past two years we have been extending the age to 69 on a phased basis.<br/><br/>It is important to note that since the establishment of the programme in 2000, we have performed more than 1.5 million mammograms, and in that time more than 11,500 women have been diagnosed with breast cancer.  BreastCheck is fortunate to be well funded and to have state-of-the-art equipment.  Every mammogram is read independently in the static unit by two consultant breast radiologists.  The Irish programme mirrors the UK programme in almost every aspect but with two important differences.  Our programme screens at two yearly intervals as opposed to three yearly intervals.  Recognising that diagnosing breast cancer does not save a single life, we have included treatment and, in particular, the surgical management of screen-detected breast cancer in our programme.  We have been fortunate to have the opportunity to train our radiographers and radiological staff to the highest international standard.  I must mention at this stage that we have had wonderful co-operation from our host hospitals.  Even with the pressures on beds and theatre time, we have been greatly facilitated in the treatment of screen-detected cancer in this country.<br/><br/>BreastCheck has four static units, two of which are in Dublin.  One of these two units is on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus and the other is on the Mater Hospital campus.  The other two units are on the Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway campuses, respectively.  In spite of this, most screening happens on mobiles.  Our aim is to deliver the service as near as possible to the patient's home.  All patients recalled to assessment who have a mammographic abnormality on their initial mammogram are recalled to the static unit.  Patients recalled to assessment have all further tests, tomomammography, ultrasound, biopsy and clinical examination carried out in the static unit.  Patients who require biopsy are discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting and then return for results.  There is a dedicated team of specialist breast care nurses to support patients through diagnosis and surgical treatment.<br/><br/>The programme was established with stringent quality assurance parameters and key performance indicators.  These key performance indicators pertain to every aspect of the programme and are supported by extensive standard operating procedures.  We publish an annual report and we have a multidisciplinary quality assurance committee comprising, <i>inter alia</i>, radiologists, radiographers, pathologists, surgeons, epidemiologists, medical physicists, nursing and administration overseeing the quality of our programme.<br/><br/>Approximately 2,600 breast cancers are diagnosed every year in Ireland and, unfortunately, 680 women die from the disease.  It was noted in the 2016 annual report that BreastCheck screened more than 145,000 women in the previous year.  Of these, 986 women were diagnosed with screen-detected breast cancer.  The aim of our programme is to reduce mortality by 20%.  To achieve this goal, we need 70% of women to accept their invitation to screening.  This is why it is important for us to enlist the support of our public representatives to maintain acceptance rates.  If we do not maintain our acceptance rates, we will not reduce mortality, which is the ultimate goal.<br/><br/>On a happier note, over the past five years, survival from breast cancer in this country has improved from 75% to 83%.  I have no doubt that breast cancer screening has contributed to this improvement in survival together with improved treatment in the symptomatic centres and improved drug management in women with breast cancer.  The programme detects approximately seven cancers in every 1,000 women screened.  It is important for us to keep the recall rate as low as possible, preferably lower than 7%.  The reason for this is that every woman recalled to assessment will experience a diagnosis of breast cancer, and we know from evidence in the literature that it takes women two years to get back to baseline anxiety levels about breast cancer following a recall to assessment.  There is a constant balance to be struck between keeping recall rates low and cancer detection rates high, and this is a challenge to every cancer screening programme.<br/><br/>A women's charter is in place to ensure that the service is delivered in a timely manner and in line with promises made to women when the programme was established.  Since the outset of our programme, we have understood the need to produce and publish our data.  We have also understood the necessity of external accreditation.  Since the outset of the programme, we have had three external reviews carried out.  The most recent inspection was by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services, EUREF.  Following a very detailed inspection, including protocols, procedures and interval cancer documentation, we were awarded reference status last year, indicating that our policy and practices are an example for other national programmes to follow.  EUREF has only awarded six screening programmes accreditation since 2009, only two of which have been awarded the highest quality of accreditation, which is category 4 reference centre accreditation, and BreastCheck is one of those two.<br/><br/>While mammography is the best screening test available for the early detection of breast cancer, it is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific and is not an ideal screening test from that point of view.  Not all cancers are detected by screening mammography, and we need to understand that a screening test is not the same as a diagnostic test and has an inherent false negative rate, as publicised in the international literature.  Women attending for screening are informed of this in all our documentation.  In fact, women who attend for screening sign a consent form that includes a statement to the effect that breast cancer screening does not detect all breast cancers.  In addition, when a woman gets a letter advising her that her screening mammogram is normal, it is stated in the result letter that if she develops any symptoms at any time, she must present to her general practitioner and, if deemed necessary, she should be referred to one of the eight symptomatic breast cancer centres in our country.<br/><br/>Breast cancer detected in the interval between screenings is deemed an interval cancer.  There is an international standard for interval cancer rates in screening programmes.  The expected rate of interval cancers is two per 1,000 women screened.  It is a very important determinant of the quality of a screening programme.  BreastCheck interval cancer rates are in accordance with the international published literature.  In fact, we ourselves published our interval cancer rates in the <i>Journal of Medical Screening</i>in April 2015.  Interval cancers rates are an important parameter of the quality of a programme because, unlike background cancer detection rates, they are independent of the background incidence rate in a country.  We find our interval cancer rate in the following way.  BreastCheck is informed of all cancers by the National Cancer Registry.  BreastCheck then determines if a woman has attended for screening and validates if it was within the past two years and if at the time of diagnosis the cancer was invasive.  If these criteria are fulfilled, it is deemed to be an interval cancer and included in the rates published in our literature.<br/><br/>The formal review has been ongoing since the establishment of our programme 20 years ago and in the UK programme for the past 30 years.  It is by necessity a retrospective and complex process.  The current validated data are available up to 2011.  In association with this, and while the review is ongoing, there is a practice performed in exactly the same way as in other European and UK countries.  In conjunction with this, however, any woman diagnosed with an interval breast cancer can request a review of her screening mammogram, or her clinician can do so on her behalf.</p><p>That review happens in real time at the earliest possible convenience.  It is performed by two consultant radiologists who were not involved in reporting the screening mammogram.  The information is then communicated to the patient.  While screening aims to reduce the mortality from breast cancers by 20%, there are definite downsides to screening of which we must be aware.  The most important one is interval cancers.  Anxiety associated with recall is a downside of screening.</p><p> Another downside is over-diagnosis, which has been prominent in the literature over the past five years.  This is when we commit women to open surgical biopsies for benign disease.  In other words, they have surgery that they would never have needed if they had not come for a screening mammogram because it is for benign disease.  Our aim is to make sure we do not perform any unnecessary surgery.  We may, through breast screening, detect breast cancer that may not affect a woman during her lifetime.  We may diagnose and treat a woman for breast cancer that she may have died with, rather than from.  Unfortunately, we cannot tell when we diagnose breast cancer which cancers will progress.  We do not have that ability at the moment.  With increased and more complex genetic marker testing in breast cancers that may be in our gift in the next decade but at the moment we do not know which cancers will kill women and which will not.  Therefore, we have to treat all breast cancers.  Giving a woman a diagnosis of breast cancer when she may not have died from it is termed lead-time bias and it is an inherent problem associated with breast cancer screening.</p><p> It is appropriate and necessary that we outline our plans for open disclosure.  Open disclosure has been a policy for the HSE since 2013 but it is planned to introduce it for breast cancer screening.  However, open disclosure is not a facet of, and does not happen in, other UK screening programmes.  It has, however, happened only in the past year in England.  On foot of the duty of candour legislation published in England in 2014, a detailed process was put in place to introduce open disclosure.  Even while there was a requirement and a wish to introduce it as quickly as possible, it was introduced only in 2017.  Scotland and Northern Ireland have not yet commenced open disclosure.  We are very fortunate in that we have had a lot of discussion with the English programme and it has shared its methodology and training videos which were released in May of this year, following the UK local elections.  It has released all its information on how it did this to us.  We look forward to implementing open disclosure in early 2019 but I emphasise that open disclosure in screening is very complex.  It is not the same as the symptomatic service or other diagnostic areas.  This complex process will involve many stakeholders, particularly women, counselling agencies, the symptomatic breast cancer service, the State agency, the HSE and the Department of Health.  We may need the help of this committee as legislators in navigating the complex issues surrounding the legal aspects of open disclosure.</p><p> I hope that the committee realises that the Irish breast cancer screening programme operates to the highest international standard.  There are, however, challenges, the main ones for the future being: recruitment and retention of staff which is a real issue, maintenance of acceptance rates in excess of 70% if we wish to reduce mortality, open disclosure and litigation.  I hope I have given the committee reassurance on the quality and safety of our screening programme.</p></speech>

I am quite surprised to hear that there is no policy of open disclosure in respect of BreastCheck because that has been the central issue that we have been dealing with in respect of CervicalCheck.  It has been a policy of the HSE since 2013 and within the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council there is a requirement that there should be open disclosure.  Could Professor O'Doherty comment on the fact that there is no reference to that?</p> <p>  Is it the case that the woman who may have had an interval cancer is only informed that there is a review if she requests it?  Professor O'Doherty said the recall rate is 7% but the diagnostic rate is 0.7%.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

In answer to the first question, the interval cancer reviews are not patient-centred but programme-centred in order to determine the interval cancer rates.  That has been happening since the outset of the programme for 20 years.  We do not contact patients retrospectively when we carry out the review.  We have a very open policy.  If patients want to know about their breast cancer when they present to the treating surgeon, we will do it but we do not trigger it automatically.  We have had the benefit of the UK experience being shared with us.  Only 45% of women have requested open disclosure since the UK brought it in.  It is important that if we are to have open disclosure we make sure the woman wants it and that we have counselling services available.  It has not historically been part of any UK or European programme.  We are not doing anything in this programme that has not been part of established practice and that is not in the published literature.  In every aspect of this programme we have mirrored international best practice.  No other programme contacts women cold.  For many of these women it would have been a long time ago.  Unless they have requested it this takes quite a long time to filter through.  I am not at all reticent about telling women.  We are very happy to feed the information back to any woman who has requested it.  It has not been a part of any other screening service anywhere in the world.</p> <p>  I cannot recall the final question, there were several.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Arnold Hill" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#T00600"><p>A woman is diagnosed with breast cancer in the symptomatic service where I work.  Every time we diagnose a patient with breast cancer who has had a mammogram in the previous year, be it in the symptomatic programme or the screening programme, we openly discuss that with the patient.  We ask if she would like to see her previous mammogram and we will have it reviewed.  There is an excellent process in the screening programme whereby if a woman has had a screening mammogram, we contact the service to say that she has been diagnosed.  The service will offer to sit down with her and go through the mammograms.  Frequently, it may not have been seen on the previous mammogram.  That is the nature of this test.  There is real openness there.</p> <p>  What I find in my personal practice when I am dealing with a woman who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and discussing this openly with her is that it is the last thing on her mind.  What she wants to know is the plan of treatment, will she have chemotherapy and how long it will take.  They are the sort of major issues.  There is a policy and all practicing breast surgeons will offer this to women but is very rare for them to take it up.  If they do want to, there is a superb service in BreastCheck whereby two independent people will review the mammogram and the clinical leads will meet the patient.  It is very rare that women want this.  They want to get on with their treatment, be it surgery or chemotherapy.</p> <p>  It takes approximately nine months for a patient to undergo all her treatments between chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  We see her in follow up.  We follow her up for five years and we frequently ask if she wants to go through that but she usually wants to move on.  It is not a major issue in clinical practice but there is a very open climate about asking if she wants to look back.  We know this is going to happen because of the limitations of the test.  A mammogram is not a perfect test.  We are familiar with this.  Where we see approximately 400 breast cancers a year, there will be 30 or 40 women each year in the symptomatic service whose previous mammogram did not show it.  We are very familiar with the environment and what to do in that case.  There is a really open plan to discuss it with the women.</p></speech>

If ten people are asked to look at a mammogram one or two might say that in hindsight now that he or she knows the person has breast cancer perhaps that vague shadow could have been considered.  It is not a perfect test.  It is really important that is understood.  It is the best test we have but it is not perfect.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Riste&aacute;rd &Oacute; Laoide" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#U00300"><p>The Faculty of Radiologists, which I am representing here today, has involved itself in open disclosure since it was launched in 2013 by the HSE.  We have engaged proactively with the HSE in this regard because this is a very important issue for us in radiology.  It is important in radiology because it is one of the specialties where this is a most difficult and nuanced issue because radiologists work in a profession where mistakes are made all of the time.  In other words, for a practising radiologist, international best practice would be an error rate of 3% to 5%.  We are working in a profession where we know errors will arise.  It is in our interests and in the patients' interests primarily that we have a good open disclosure process to deal with that.  Historically, it has not been there and we now need to put it in place.</p> <p>  When the national document was launched in 2013, we engaged with other jurisdictions, such as The Royal College of Radiologists in London and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, that have similar methodologies to ours.  We also engaged with patient representatives and the State Claims Agency and we produced a document on open disclosure relatively quickly in 2015.  This document was subsequently updated in 2016 and is available on the faculty website.  It sets out our approach to open disclosure.</p> <p>  We are also mindful of the ethical guidelines from the Medical Council on this issue.  We do realise this is an evolving process.  We heard at an Oireachtas committee meeting last week that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was enacted in November 2017 but that it is still awaiting implementation and regulations through the Department of Health, which is outside my ambit.  While we need that legislation implemented, we need more than that.  To do open disclosure properly we have to focus on the patient and in this regard, the environment must be such that the patient is counselled and supported through the process.  There are a number of doctors in this room.  We have all made mistakes.  The serious mistakes that I have made in my career are seared into what I do and so I am very conscious of this.  We need to have a process where the people who are involved in the incident, the patients primarily, are dealt with in a supportive way through appropriate counselling and appropriate infrastructure.  As for the infrastructure required for this process, it has been proven internationally that it has to be provided in a learning environment, a non-judgmental environment and an environment where a single issue does not explode into one of national prominence.  Unfortunately, given Ireland is a small country, we suffer a little bit of the fish bowl effect such that a single issue can suddenly explode into one of national prominence.  I worked in California for a number of years, which is supposed to be a highly litigious society.  The background effect of open disclosure and litigation there was seemingly a lot less because it does not suffer the fish bowl effect that we have in Ireland.</p> <p>  In radiology, when we make an error we are not sure whether that error precisely causes harm.  It has to be looked at in the overall clinical context of the patient and we have to do a systems review of it.  In summary, as radiologists, we are keen to do this but we do need a framework and we need the help of the Oireachtas in creating that framework.  To do this, we need a supportive environment, one where people can learn from their errors without the risk of litigation.  We also need to be honest.  We want to have an open process but we want the whole process to be open on the table.  To be open on the table we need to know the number of errors it is anticipated will happen in our services.  For example, we in radiology, can say that in a model 4 hospital might have approximately 10,000 errors per year.  How is it proposed to legislate to have open disclosure for all of these cases?  If it is proposed to compensate everyone for every error, that then needs to be set out clearly in legislation.  We need to move forward together in this regard because at the end of the day it is the patient who will benefit.</p></speech>

First, how can it be that the HSE implements open disclosure in 2013 and a unit that is part of the HSE does not and six years on is only proposing to implement it now?  Second, was this planned anyway or is it now happening next year because of everything that has happened in CervicalCheck?</p></speech>

I sat on the UK committee for implementation of breast screening for 30 years.  I was allowed to remain on that committee because I was one of the founding members of the committee with the UK programme.  I am very lucky that since coming to Dublin, I have been allowed to continue as an observer on that committee.

There is no other international programme that does it and we were watching with great interest what was happening in England.  We were awaiting developments there and we are now lucky to have at our disposal the methodology by which it was implemented there.  There is no other programme that has done it, other than England.  Scotland and Wales have not done it yet.  We are in the HSE plan for implementation in 2018 but realistically I think it will not happen until early in 2019.</p></speech>

As I explained, the person will present to the symptomatic service and I or one of the other 26 breast surgeons in the country will meet that patient.  If the person has had a mammogram the previous year we always ask if she would like to have it reviewed.  In the vast majority of cases they do not.  It is very rare.  I see 400 patients with breast cancer each year and only a small number opt for a review of their mammogram.  It is not their focus.</p></speech>

If a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and she had a mammogram in BreastCheck the previous year, I, or one of my radiology colleagues, will contact BreastCheck and it will review that mammogram.  The patient is welcome to meet with our radiology colleagues to discus the mammogram.  As I said, very few women take it up.</p></speech>

My question is whether that process is automatic.

My question is whether that is the case in BreastCheck.</p></speech>

We worked off the 1,482 number and the National Cancer Registry was not involved.  BreastCheck takes the totality of that.  For various reasons, it is well in arrears in terms of the time to diagnose, the cancer registry and so on.  At the moment, BreastCheck reports back to 2011.  That is the year for which data is being worked through.</p></speech>

I started in BreastCheck 18 years ago.  It is something of which this country should be proud.  It is a fantastic service.  It was funded well and was set up in a careful way.  It has been externally validated over 18 years and receives the top mark from European accreditors every time.</p> <p>  My concern is that what has come to light about another screening programme over the past month has the potential to force the country to stop screening.  BreastCheck has saved lives from breast cancer.  It has been a fantastic programme.  It is well run and everyone who has been involved is complimentary about it, but I am worried that the current situation will spiral out of control.  We need the committee's support for introducing open disclosure in the balanced, careful and structured way that Professor O'Doherty discussed.  The screening programme costs &euro;40 million.  If the State pays out &euro;100 million in medical legal costs, the taxpayer will have to say "Stop the screening programme".  That means women will die from breast cancer who do not need to.  We have a great programme that is saving lives and doing well.  I encourage the committee to try to ensure balance.  BreastCheck is the best part of the Irish health service.  Its quality assurance parameters are fantastic.</p> <p>  There is no need for me to tell members all of this.  I work in the symptomatic service.  BreastCheck is something that I am proud of, but I am worried as one of the clinicians involved that it could be destroyed for poor reasons.  We require members to ensure there is a balanced opinion out there, the screening programme continues and women turn up for it.  To make it justifiable, we need 70% of the women invited to turn up.  It is good and will save lives.  Please protect it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#V05000"><p>To be crystal clear, we are having this hearing on screening programmes because of a scandalous withholding of information from women, albeit by another programme.  What the D&aacute;il and this and other committees have discussed is the apparent paternalistic attitude of people within the health service towards the women who are users of that service.  With respect, that is why Professor Hill is here today.  It is not because of any failing on behalf of this particular screening programme.  However, if there is a lack of confidence in the screening programmes overseen by the HSE, the blame for that does not lie at the door of the politicians or the women themselves.  The blame lies at the door of the HSE.  We are discussing it because we, as elected representatives, have received calls from constituents who are panicking.</p> <p>  I am a major supporter of Professor Hill's service.  I can count at least two women in my life who I am reasonably confident owe their lives, and certainly their health, to that service.  I encourage all women to use it.  I would love to see the rate climb far above 70%.</p><p>We are all busy but women need to believe that when they present themselves, they will get the best quality service.  Where there is a misdiagnosis, whether or not a woman wants to go back on that road, there should be some learning by the organisation.  We fully appreciate that human beings make mistakes but if there is a perception of people trying to cover up those mistakes or withholding information, issues would arise.  I am very happy to join all the witnesses in encouraging all eligible women to respond to that letter and keep their contact information up to date to ensure they get themselves tested.  The responsibility of the witnesses is to ensure that when women present themselves, they can have confidence in the process.</p><p> When we ask a question about the look-back and whether it is automatic, it is partly for the woman sitting in front of the doctors who may not want to go back.  Surely learning can only happen if we go back and where there is a misdiagnosis it is examined for what was missed, how it was missed and how we can improve things and ensure it does not happen again.  We need to get a sense that it is happening.</p></speech>

Professor O'Doherty might recap as that is exactly the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ann O'Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018052300002#W00300"><p>It is what we do.  Two independent readers look at it.  We look at our misses and our triumphs, as some of the cancers we pick up are at the very edge of perception.  It is an absolute and open learning environment in screening.  The biggest downside is that we do not pick up all the breast cancers.  I work as the lead clinician in symptomatic services at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I do not go in every morning with an expectation I will miss cancers because I have ultrasound and other tests available.  Unfortunately, screening mammography is an inferior test.  As clinicians we must face it that we will let down women.  Not only are we going to let down women but we are going to let down their families as well.  It is a real downside to what we do.</p> <p>  When we see cancers that should have been picked up - let me tell members that there are some cases where we ask ourselves how they were missed - the only way to survive knowing a disservice has been done to the woman in question or her family is to think positively about the pick-ups we have made.  We are the most transparent, quality assured, introspective group of people members will have met.  We are informed by the symptomatic service of an interval cancer.  I can remember at least ten times in my life asking myself how we missed a cancer but when we got the symptomatic mammogram, the cancer may have been in a completely different place.  We are busy and self-critical.  I assure members that we are the most neurotic, self-absorbed group of people running the breast cancer screening service in this country.  Unfortunately, even with the best will in the world, we will miss things, including some obvious ones in hindsight.</p></speech>

I respect that the witnesses offer women the choice to look back and Professor Hill has said it is most probably done.  Is it not written down somewhere that it should be done?</p></speech>

In what way was it transposed into everyday practice?  Have there been seminars or discussions on it?  Have any protocols been introduced?  We were told by very senior people within the Health Service Executive and the Department, as well as some politicians in here, that we did not need mandatory open disclosure or legal underpinning of the concept because it was being done anyway since 2013.  Now the witnesses are telling us it is not done.  The witnesses may practise it in their everyday work but it is by no means a rule.  While I fully appreciate that the witnesses have come to instill confidence in the system for women, a key tenet must be open disclosure.  Maybe a woman does not want to know and is more concerned about her hair falling out.  I do not know that and the witnesses would have more experience of it than I do.  Perhaps a woman would want to know but she is not being asked.  She could be traumatised and very ill.  Surely it should be the first port of call to share that information.  If the woman does not want it, that is grand.  There is nothing wrong with having too much information when one is sick.  People can always say they do not want to deal with it.  It strikes me as odd that this is not par for the course or part of the daily practice.  It might be encouraged and individuals may do it but to my mind, it is a policy failure if it is not happening universally.  Members were wrong to vote through the civil liability legislation without a mandatory requirement for open disclosure.  Open disclosure should be mandatory and have legal underpinning.</p></speech>

I would like to focus on that and I hope that reassures women, as it is absolutely essential that women should be reassured by the quality of our programme.</p> <p>  Screening is different and in hospitals we have an open disclosure policy.  This is not something we have suddenly come to.  We have been watching this happening in England and we have learned from the experience there.  It will make my life much easier and I will be very happy if we get formal open disclosure.  We have already designed a consent form and we can give it to women.</p> <p>  We hope the State Claims Agency and legislators will do something to protect the screening programme.  One of our concerns is that screening must be cost-effective.  I have no desire to hide anything from anybody but the medico-legal position in this country is very different from other countries.  It will be of great concern to me if we reach the stage where we cannot afford to do screenings.  It is not that we have not been disclosing.  We have been doing exactly what every other European and UK programme has been doing.  We can just say that is what we have done.  I am sorry if the Deputy thinks we have been remiss as we have been working very hard.</p></speech>

Will Mr. McCallion explain from a policy and administrative perspective what exactly happened to the 2013 open disclosure document.  In no way have I tried to disparage the programme.  As I have said repeatedly, I am a supporter of the programme.  It is important to me that the women I represent have confidence in that programme.  Perhaps the witness could be less defensive and share a bit more information with us so we can get to that.</p></speech>

Those lessons clearly need to be applied to the three other programmes, including BowelScreen and diabetic retinopathy.</p> <p>  The English experience - the process has still not been activated in other parts of the UK - with duty of candour legislation began with its introduction in 2014.  It took three years to start a policy of rolling that up with all the necessary elements that needed to be put into place-----</p></speech>

I have a very quick question.  In 2013 did the service take the view that the open disclosure policy did not apply to the screening programmes or were people advised that it should not apply?  Does it apply to the programmes but there is an elongated process to put it in place?</p></speech>

I can come back to the Deputy on the history.  We have seen what happened in CervicalCheck and the roll-out of open disclosure.  It has not arisen in BowelScreen or diabetic retinopathy at this point.  A plan has been in place that Professor O'Doherty has set out around the breast screening programme.</p><p>That is continuing and based on the experience of the only other jurisdiction in the European Union which has rolled it out.  I suspect the primary reason it has taken that length of time since 2013 to do it is screening is different from normal day-to-day services and in order to roll it out it is clear from the experience in other countries such as England that it takes time to put it in place.  The plan that has been developed is based on the experience in the only country in Europe which has rolled it out in screening programmes so far.</p></speech>

Mr. McCallion has not answered my question.  Is there a list which shows where it does and does not apply?  I know that my time is up, but sometimes delegates do not help their own cause when they attend committees.</p></speech>

I even wrote an article on it for a Sunday newspaper.  However, as a public representative, I also have a role in getting to the facts.  Unfortunately, this comes under the same tiered structure in the HSE which has let down many women.  We need to see if there are issues which need to be dealt with by the committee.  The reason the delegates have been brought before the committee is there are issues with CervicalCheck and we want to get to the facts.  I hope we will not have real concerns.  In our position we know the difference between screening and diagnostics.  We know that programmes have a percentage of issues.</p> <p>  I am concerned that Professor O&rsquo;Doherty said she would be happy to implement the open disclosure policy.  She does not have a choice.  I become concerned when I hear people keep talking about best international practice.  It is correct that our screening programmes be mirrored against others.  I hate the phrase &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.  I do not believe in it.  I believe there is practice and that there are circumstances.  I believe in the Kilmeaden cheese version, namely, take the best and get rid of the rest because no two circumstances are perfect.  Professor O&rsquo;Doherty must adhere to what is in the law and policy.  A policy of open disclosure should have been implemented but it was not.  To be fair, she has been very open about it, but she has no choice.  In the future it will have to be implemented and should have been in the past.  As a result of what has been said today, the committee must move up the food chain and through Mr. McCallion determine why this did not happen.  That is one outcome from the meeting.</p> <p>  I was the first to raise the issue of National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, and the sharing of information.  At the Committee of Public Accounts last week its director was open about the four screening programmes and where there was sharing and where there was not.  Will the delegates outline in detail what is being shared?  I do not want to find out that information has not been shared at some level.  We have had ridiculous data protection issues.</p> <p>  As clinical director of BreastCheck, does Professor O&rsquo;Doherty have concerns which she would like to express to the committee about how the HSE supports the programme?  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is coming after me and will probably chase the same question.</p></speech>

We know about Ms Melissa Hamilton and Ms Eileen Fennessy.  We know from information made available several days ago that the State Claims Agency has stated there are four cases pertaining to BreastCheck.  How many letters of apology have been issued by the HSE regarding incorrect readings since the BreastCheck programme began?  How many have been issued in the past year?  I saw one that had been issued in the past few months.</p></speech>

They cannot have a mammogram until they sign the consent form.  It states BreastCheck will keep their details in a safe way and, at all times, in agreement with data protection legislation.  It also states we may need to share information with NCRI.  That is why we can do it.  Before women can have a mammogram, we tell them that we may need to share the information.  That is the only reason we have been able to download and ensure we have an audit.  This has been in place for 20 years.  Every woman who has attende for screening in the past 20 years has signed that permission form.</p></speech>

While I cannot speak for any other programme, it is the case for BreastCheck.</p> <p>  With regard to the HSE, I can say with hand on heart that BreastCheck has been well set up and well funded.  If there was anything, we could do with more money in the symptomatic service in which I work.  From the outset, there has been an understanding of the requirement.  If one is to screen healthy women, one must be better if they present because one is dropping a letter on their doorstep and inviting them to come for screening.  There has been an absolute understanding.  I cannot complain about anything in the resourcing of our service.  I mentioned the challenges in radiographic recruitment.  We are doing our best.  It is not an issue of funding.  There has never been any issue with funding.</p> <p>  I do not have a comprehensive knowledge of what litigation cases are in front of-----</p></speech>

My family uses the screening process and my neighbour has been saved by it.  I need to figure out where to go with this.  There are four cases with the State Claims Agency.  We know of two cases, including the case of Melissa Hamilton and the other case that is now public.  They date from June 2015 and June 2016.  That is not long ago.  We now have another issue with this letter, which dates from February 2018.  The case involving the other person was earlier.</p> <p>  As a public representative I realise there are errors and there always will be errors but we need to figure out the scale.  Moreover, we need to figure out whether there is something else.  I am saying this in an even-handed way, to be fair.  The question is whether there is a bigger issue or another process that we need to have examined.</p></speech>

The interval cancer rate is two per 1,000.  We screened 145,000 in the year I referred to.  If there are two per 1,000, then there were 290 interval cancers in that time.</p> <p>  I have been working for 30 years in breast screening.  I reckon I would not have had more than one medical legal case - a case with solicitors involved - per year.  In my unit in the past two weeks we have had 15 such cases.  My great concern for this country is that the litigation will cost so much and that this will result in the Parliament telling us to stop screening since it is costing so much.  Moreover, I fear all the resources will instead be put into symptomatic breast cancer.  There is a significant requirement for resources in symptomatic breast cancer.  We have gone from 7,000 attendances nationally to over 40,000.  I am concerned that we may be asking as a country whether we can afford this.  There have been 15 cases in the past two weeks but previously the rate was not even one per year.  The same solicitors are involved.  There has been a major focus on solicitors and litigation in the media.  We are now seeing that in my numbers and there are four units in total.  There is a major concern over whether we will be able to continue screening.</p></speech>

Everyone in the committee has concerns about this for multiple reasons.  First, we need to get to the facts.  I have outlined some of the cases to the witnesses.  We know of four.  I know of another one and there were two previous cases.  There is a timeline for these cases as well.  These are the facts.  We cannot judge the four cases with the State Claims Agency but those are the facts.  We then have the issue of the dial-up from a litigation point of view and so on.</p> <p>  Let us consider this committee as a forum to help the screening service.  What can we do?  We know there is a process.  CervicalCheck is on a completely different spectrum and it is a completely different issue.  It is on a completely different scale and it is a different scandal and so on.  Anyway, what can be done to ensure, for want of a better phrase, an audit or process is put in place to deal with this and to help renew confidence?</p></speech>

I welcome what Deputy Kelly has said because it is critical.  Professor O'Doherty has explained to the committee the level of interval cancers in the system.

I suspect that sum will go higher in the years ahead.  That is unsustainable.  We could do anything.  When a woman comes to have a mammogram in BreastCheck she signs a document and understands that it is not a perfect test.  In this country, a patient among those ten women is virtually entitled to &euro;1 million in medical legal costs, and that is unsustainable.  I suggest that there needs to be urgent medical legal reform.  We have known this for a long time.  The problem is that vested interests will block it.</p></speech>

A framework is needed.  I suspect that is one of the reasons it has taken several years to get to a point where we can roll out open disclosure in the screening programme.  It is different to adopt it for an individual service or facility or in the practice of a professional individual.  When we talk about a framework, we are talking about supports to women, training of the professionals involved and the medical legal framework.  A range of things need to be put in place.  Screening is different because we are doing a review across a range of people.  We know there is an accepted normal error rate.  We need not call it that &ndash; there is different language for it.</p> <p>  The points being made do not only apply to BreastCheck but to all screening programmes.  There is some useful learning from the UK or England, where they have done this.  Let us bear in mind that England is the only country in Europe that has put this in place for breast screening.  I appreciate that people can refer to the difference between 2013 and what is happening today.  The way the screening programme is rolled out is important.  It should be a model that is effective for patients and cost-effective for the service.</p></speech>

The committee has been experiencing the response to this during the past month.  If there was a policy of open disclosure that was delivered the moment an issue arose, then perhaps Professor O'Doherty would not have the flood of 15 cases coming down the line in a two-week period rather than one per year.  If there is open disclosure, patients are accepting of receiving accurate information in a timely way.  The purpose of open disclosure is of course to disclose.  However, a side issue is that once patients are informed, they are satisfied that no negligence was attributed to the miss.  They are happy to accept that and may not go down the litigious route.  If information is kept from them, however, and then they discover it through other means, they become litigious.  The point of open disclosure is to try to prevent litigation and to maintain confidence in the programme.  That is the point that has come out in this committee and other committees in recent weeks.  The view is that open disclosure will prevent litigation and maintain the financing of the service.  It should not end up being overburdened by litigation.</p></speech>

There is a subtle distinction with screening programmes.  Let us consider the period looking back to 2011.  The real-time hospital setting, as described earlier, is how open disclosure should work best.  The idea is that when it happens, the error is disclosed, the conversation takes place and then it moves on.  The case of screening would involve examining retrospectively to 2011.  It means a long period has elapsed since the episode.  Other aspects of this need to be factored in with regard to how any measure is rolled out.</p></speech>

However, the payout should be commensurate with the error and not depend on whether she has the most aggressive solicitor.  When we discussed the issue, we did not conclude that women should not be compensated but that a mediation process should be provided because we are scared that we will be unable to deliver a screening service if it becomes extremely costly. </p></speech>

It is important that we have that figure for comparison purposes now that we have litigation.  I listened to Professor Hill comments, especially the worry that screening programmes may have to be closed down to reduce the level of litigation, which is clearly not the way forward.  It is important to have figures on the annual cost of BreastCheck and the problems we will face.  The witnesses identified that we are within international standards in terms of the number of cancers missed.  The service is comprehensive and everything is done by all the staff to get the most accurate results possible.  When cancers are missed, if everyone opts for litigation we will end up paying out more in compensation than the entire cost of the service.</p> <p>  I had an interesting conversation with a consultant from Ireland who recently attended a conference in the United States at which the level of compensation paid out in Ireland for medical negligence was outlined.  The attendees were surprised that Ireland appears to pay out much more in compensation than is paid out in the United States.  On the one hand, we want open disclosure.  On the other hand, we want to provide a comprehensive screening system.  If money is taken away from the latter to pay the costs of litigation, there will be a problem.  How have other countries dealt with this issue?  A mediation process was mentioned.  Do other countries provide a mediation service?  If so, does it work?</p> <p>  We heard that 145,000 people avail of the BreastCheck service each year.  That is a significant number.  On the basis of a an interval cancer rate of two per 1,000 people, approximately 290 cases will be identified each year.  That is a small number, although a missed cancer diagnosis is a big issue for the person concerned.  How can we deal with this complex and difficult issue, particularly in terms of what has occurred in the past four weeks?  As a practising solicitor with a legal background, I share Professor Hill's concern about the level of litigation that will arise as a result of what has happened over the past four weeks.  Litigation will not serve the best interests of the medical service or those who practise medicine on whom it also has a traumatic effect.  That message has not been conveyed to the general public but we must ensure it is heard.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the issue of mediation.  </p></speech>

I am not negligent because I make errors.  Even the term "medical negligence" upsets me because it is extremely upsetting when one misses a cancer.  </p> <p>  I am not a solicitor so I do not know how we could provide mediation.  We need to find some method of compensating women in a way that reflects what has happened to them.  As I indicated, many cancers do not progress and a cancer that was not picked up the first time may not have progressed when it is diagnosed.  However, some cancers will kill within a year.  Cancers vary greatly.   We need a great deal of advice from the State Claims Agency and solicitors on a mediation service.  </p></speech>

The issue is even broader than screening.  We know we have predictable errors in radiology and we can provide figures on the large number of errors that will occur.  Thankfully, most of them do not harm patients.  However, some do and one cannot predict which one will cause harm.  If we want a good and open disclosure process and an open environment, everything must be put on the table.  We need to be open and decide what to do when litigation occurs.  We must decide whether to put patients through the traumatic process of going through the courts and being brought to the footsteps of the courthouse.  That seems to be an horrendously cruel process.  We need to consider everything.  We are intelligent people and I agree with Deputy Kelly that we do not need to copy what has been done in other countries if we can do it better here.  We need to consider ways of doing it better here and I firmly believe that we can do so because at the moment it is poorly done.  </p></speech>

I was also my party's spokesman for this area many years ago.  If the programme us to be successful, it must be efficient, effective and protect itself.  Those involved in the programme cannot leave themselves open to allegations of negligence, in particular.  I accept that people will make mistakes.  To err is human but to cover it up is a different story.  I do not suggest there has been a cover up.  I suggest that for the organisation to protect itself it needs to be open about disclosures in the event of a mistake taking place.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Professor Hill.  Let us say a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer after availing of a BreastCheck examination at some time in the previous couple of years.  I understand why she will not want to know about anything except treatment.  Can she be told at that stage that the failure to detect the cancer in the BreastCheck test was fundamental to her condition?  My next query relates to the point made by my colleague earlier.  I am not certain as to how such a scenario automatically opens up the litigation gates given that the screening system cannot be 100% accurate.  </p></speech>

We have to explain the limitation of the test and that a cancer will not be picked up in 10% of cases.  A mammogram test is not a perfect test.  It is a very good test and the best one we have but it is not perfect.  We need people to understand that the test is limited in its value but it is the best one we have.</p></speech>

I often wonder whether it might be better for the system to respond without prejudice and to talk about arbitration or whatever the case may be.  One can achieve quite a lot without massive costs.  This is not a stroke against my colleague or anything like that but I have to mention a recent experience I had where a legal practitioner became very animated when it was discovered I had been probing the system to ascertain what went wrong.  It was not a deliberate mistake but it was a simple thing that could happen.  Like Murphy's Law, if it can happen it will happen.  The point I am trying to get as is we need to use open disclosure to a greater extent, particularly when it is there.  It is there for a purpose.  I do not think it undermines the case.  I do not think it will open up floodgates.  If it does open up floodgates that has to be looked at again.  The United States is a classic example.  We all know about that.  It has been that way for the past 40 years at least.  It is getting better or worse as the case may be.</p> <p>  To go back to Professor Hill, when the patient is diagnosed with cancer, and let us assume she goes home and discusses it with friends and family, which is a natural thing, it is a very difficult, isolated and frightening position to be in.  Can Professor Hill tell her with any degree of certainty, given that the screening system is not 100% accurate, that it is 75%, 80% or 90% accurate?</p></speech>

It is fine but it is not accurate.  If a woman happens to be one of the 10%, she will obviously feel aggrieved.  Is there anything we can learn or do to try to narrow that any further?  We have listened to the witnesses' submissions.  Repeated mammogram tests might not be the answer either.  It might cause greater stress and so on.  Is there any way we can deal with that particular aspect of the system?  To move away from open disclosure and to become secret and defensive about it will not work in today's climate, unfortunately.</p></speech>

When we are in the symptomatic service we do ultrasound on every woman with a lump.  Ultrasound on its own picks up 60% of breast cancers.  Mammography on its own picks up somewhere in the mid-80s.  The two together have a negative predictive value of 97%.  Ultrasound is incredibly time-consuming and operator-dependent.  We could not possibly have a screening programme using breast ultrasound.  We do not have a better test available.  We might in ten years' time when we have genetic markers and blood tests.  It may well happen in our lifetime but at this moment we do not have a better test.  I wish we did but we do not.</p></speech>

The purpose of the committee is to be constructive.  I understand the misgivings the witnesses have but we are trying to be constructive.  Questions have been asked about how we can improve the service.  There are obvious lessons that can be learned from today's hearing.  From my own experience, lack of communication leads to greater litigation.  The greater the communication the less litigation there is.  Fundamentally breast screening is a very important service.  We do not want to in any way damage that service by having our hearing today but we want to improve the service and examine the aspects of it that can be improved.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending and taking time from their other work.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, 6Mr. Derek Rafferty, principal officer with responsibility for social housing reform, and Ms Marguerite Ryan, principal officer with responsibility for the housing assistance payment scheme and social housing co-ordination in the Department.</p> <p>  The supply of social housing is a critical success factor in the management of local authority waiting lists.  Accelerating supply is something on which the Department and all stakeholders have been earnestly and intensively engaged in the past few years.  In 2016 a special Oireachtas committee recommended that 50,000 additional homes be added to the public housing stock.  Rebuilding Ireland will achieve that figure by 2021 through a range of build, acquisition and leasing schemes.  In addition, it will deliver a further 87,500 housing solutions under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, with the aim of meeting the housing needs of over 137,000 households over the lifetime of the action plan.  Over the first two years of the plan almost 45,000 families and individuals have had their housing needs met.</p> <p>  A key priority under Rebuilding Ireland is to increase the level of newly built social housing year by year.  In 2016 and 2017 delivery programmes focused on harnessing the best options available to secure early and increased delivery.  It included acquisitions of vacant stock nationally, completions of unfinished estates, advancing straightforward build projects that could proceed quickly and ensuring maximum use was secured from existing local authority housing.  In parallel, the new build pipeline was expanded significantly to underpin the much increased delivery projected for the years 2018 to 2021, inclusive.  In 2018 we will see the results of enhanced building capacity across local authorities and approved housing bodies which will further enhance our capacity to meet individuals&rsquo; and families&rsquo; needs across the country through the provision of additional stock.  The total target for all building programmes in 2018 is 4,969 units, which is more than 50% higher than the corresponding target in 2017.  Overall, it is expected that more than 25,000 additional households will have their housing needs met in 2018.</p> <p>  Seeing ambition translate into activity is critical.  One of the key outcomes of the second housing summit with local authority chief executives in January was a commitment to drive greater transparency and accountability at individual local authority level in the delivery of the targets under Rebuilding Ireland.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has advised all local authorities of their social housing targets for 2018 and also the multi-annual period to 2021.</p><p>In setting these targets, the Minister was explicitly clear that they are minimum targets, and that where additional capacity to deliver arises, we will work in partnership with local authorities to accelerate delivery.  He was also adamant that local authorities should be guided by the make-up of their waiting list, as set out in the detailed Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2017 report, as they plan and deliver these increased supports over the coming years. </p><p> Regarding the social housing assessment process, the new approach to social housing assessments came into operation in April 2011, under the social housing assessment regulations, as amended, which set out, in great detail, the process that must be followed by all housing authorities when making a determination on applications for support.  This new process followed a two-pronged approach that required applicants to be both eligible for and in need of social housing support, but also restricted households by ensuring only one local authority could be applied to for support. </p><p> Eligibility for social housing support rests on the following four criteria: income, residency status, previous rent arrears and the availability of alternative accommodation.  Once the household meets those criteria, the local authority progresses its application to the second phase, which involves making a determination of their housing need and this is done by considering the household's current accommodation against criteria set out in regulation 23 of the assessment regulations.  A household will only be placed on the housing waiting list once the relevant local authority is satisfied it meets all of the eligibility criteria and has a housing need. </p><p> The summary of social housing assessments, SSHA, is now an annual assessment compiled and published by the Department with the assistance of the Housing Agency and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA.  The latest SSHA is in respect of 2017 and provides the most up-to-date, accurate and reliable record of the number of households which qualified for social housing support under the social housing assessment regulations and whose housing need is not being met.  The data were compiled following a common methodology across the 31 local authorities and a subsequent rigorous analysis of the data collected.</p><p> The 2017 figure of 85,799 represents the "net need" position and was calculated, having excluded duplicate applications, households appearing on multiple lists in different authorities, for example, households legitimately on more than one Dublin-Cork-Galway list, households already in receipt of a form of social housing support such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, and households which have applied for transfers. </p><p> The 2017 assessment was encouraging as it indicated a drop of more than 6% in the numbers on local authority waiting lists across the country from just nine months previously.  This is a very early indication of the positive impact of the various delivery measures under Rebuilding Ireland but also signals clearly that there remain many qualifying households whose needs are still to be met. </p><p> The ongoing multi-annual funding resources provided through Rebuilding Ireland are allowing us to continue to respond in a significant manner.  More than &euro;1.4 billion was provided for investment in housing in 2017 and this is being increased significantly to &euro;1.9 billion this year.  This investment will fund substantial delivery activity and ensure that we make further significant progress towards meeting the overall target of delivering 137,000 social housing solutions in the period to 2021, supported, as I said, by an overall Exchequer commitment of more than &euro;6 billion over the six years to 2021.  We believe this will effectively meet the needs of the vast majority of those currently on the lists. </p><p> Although the specific topic for this session is local authority housing waiting lists, many of the answers provided to the questions outlined in the invitation are likely to be more closely associated with allocation policy, as this is what provides the mechanisms for moving households from the waiting list into social housing supports.  The two topics are closely related.  Allocation is a key part of the social housing process and, under housing legislation, local authorities are required to produce an allocation scheme that will set out the manner by which dwellings will be allocated and the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation.  It is important to note that producing an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the elected members. </p><p> While slightly different operational approaches may be followed across the country, all local authorities have one common policy goal, namely, to ensure that social housing goes to those households in Irish society who need it the most.  That is also the goal of my own Department. </p><p> I thank the committee again for its invitation here today.  Mr. Derek Rafferty, Ms Marguerite Ryan and I are more than happy to answer and questions or queries the members may have. </p></speech>

I am here in the context of my role as member of the housing and building sub-committee of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, along with my colleagues, Ms Catherine Keenan and Ms Mary Mulholland.<br/><br/>This submission has been compiled having regard to the specific questions the joint committee requested be considered when making it.  I will go through those specific questions.  The first is, what are the exact structures and processes in place currently with regard to local authority housing waiting lists?  The legislative provisions regarding the assessment of applications for social housing support, the adoption as a reserved function of an allocation scheme and the compilation of local authority housing waiting lists is set out in Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended.  That Part of the Act provides for the provision of social housing support, social housing assessment, summary of social housing assessments and allocation of dwellings.  <br/><br/>In addition to the Act, there are regulations which are relevant to the compilation of a local authority&rsquo;s housing waiting lists.  The regulations clearly set out the procedure for housing applicants to be assessed and if successful they become approved housing applicants on the waiting lists.  Local authorities assess all applications for social housing support in accordance with the foregoing Act and regulations.  All local authorities have adopted, as a reserved function, an allocation scheme which is used for determining the priority accorded to approved applicants for social housing support.  If applicants for social housing support have housing assistant payment, HAP, tenancies, they are deemed to have their housing need met and they are then removed from the housing needs assessment and placed on a transfer list should they wish. <br/><br/>The second question was whether the structures currently in place are sufficient and are operating as effectively and efficiently as possible.  Yes, in the event there are any issues with the allocation scheme, it is open to a local authority to review and amend it, provided any proposed amended scheme is in accordance with the Act and regulations and is submitted to the Minister for consideration and possible direction prior to adoption. <br/><br/><b></b>The third question was whether there are any problems or bottlenecks or areas in need of improvement.  In respect of the housing list applications process, the problems identified include that there is a standardised process that is unable to react to exceptional circumstances.  Also, political representations and the role of advocates must be clarified and transparently managed.  In respect of bottlenecks, improved inter-agency communications would be of benefit.  There is ongoing work in this area such as the web API, applications programming interface, for HAP, which involves data sharing with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Regarding areas for improvement, home visits could greatly inform the process and improve the customer experience but it is very resource intensive.  Area-based clinics are a possible alternative.  Some counties do home visits.  There are further examples in our briefing document.<br/><br/>As for what, if any, improvements can be made, the definition of &quot;homelessness&quot; needs to be clarified or reviewed.  Those availing of emergency accommodation should be visited regularly and receive active supports to source alternative accommodation, including rental accommodation.  A place finder resource is to be rolled out nationally as soon as possible.  All development proposals relating to the provision of social housing by private developers via turnkey projects or approved housing bodies via leasing or a turnkey project should be made eligible for consideration by county councils through the Part 8 planning process to speed delivery in supply.  There are other examples in our briefing document.<br/><br/>As to whether there are any examples of best practice in the area, there are examples of best practice in the use of information technology.  An initiative has been undertaken in Monaghan that has seen a reduction in the turnaround time for the reletting of houses.  Since 2014 the average relet has reduced from 19.5 weeks to 8.03 weeks.  The reasons for this include the abolition of town councils, which has led to a single housing authority operating in Monaghan, housing becoming a centralised function, a subsequent standardisation in processes, an increased use of the housing information and communications technology, ICT, system rather than many <i>ad hoc</i>solutions, and the introduction of a paperless housing department. <br/><br/>As to whether there are local authorities with innovative practices, choice-based letting is currently being rolled out in many local authorities.  In November 2015, Cork City Council introduced a choice-based letting scheme, which advertises most properties online in order that applicants on the social housing waiting list can express interest in a property.</p><p>Properties are then allocated in accordance with the allocation scheme.  A profile page on the website shows the applicant his or her household composition, his or her time on the list, and his or her application address on file.  Originally, Cork City Council considered the introduction of choice-based lettings due to a high refusal rate.  In practice, it has proved an informative and transparent way to allocate social housing and it has reduced letting times.  The refusal rate lowered from between 25% to 60% to between 5% to 20%.  Further details are in the briefing document.</p><p> As to how does Ireland compare with other countries in regard to the average time spent on waiting lists, we have not been able to identify a readily available source to give a comparison. </p><p> Question No. 8 seeks the average waiting time when placed on a housing waiting list.  The waiting time varies from local authority to local authority.  Figures from the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2017 indicate that the highest percentage on the waiting list is seven years or more, and the next highest is five to seven years, then three to four years.</p><p> Question No. 9 concerns whether the operation of the housing waiting lists is transparent.  At present, the prevalence of customers presenting as homeless results in a lack of transparency in the operation of the waiting lists.  Those in rental accommodation will face longer waiting times for housing allocations than those presenting for emergency services or those with specific needs, such as a disability.  The large number of people currently within the HAP system means the transparency of the waiting list is distorted as these candidates are deemed to be housed but remain on the transfer list.  Transparency cannot be provided until length of time on the waiting list has a real influence on the allocation scheme again.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us today.  Ms Mulholland, Ms Keenan and I will answer any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Guy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#H00300"><p>With regard to our briefing document and the questions outlined, question No. 3 was on whether there are any problems, bottlenecks or areas in need of improvement with the structures and processes currently in place.  The housing needs assessment form needs to be processed more quickly.  On average, it can take six weeks in certain local authority areas.  Where we have a contact in a local authority, we have seen the form dealt with in as little as 24 hours, but this is the case only if there is a contact.  We would like to see the form being assessed more quickly.</p> <p>  There is a direct knock-on in regard to people accessing the HAP.  If someone is looking for a property in the private rental sector, it is imperative that he or she be able to move quickly and have access to HAP as soon as possible.  Accessing the list is difficult in itself.  There is an onerous paper-based application.  From the perspective of a housing adviser who helps vulnerable people, I believe it can be quite a challenge for someone who does so on a daily basis, especially if each local authority operates a different scheme of letting.  Therefore, it is imperative that access to the list be streamlined and made more accessible for everyone.</p> <p>  Income thresholds need to be reviewed.  They are too low at present.  Many clients coming to us are excluded from social housing altogether because their income threshold is too high.  They are unable to afford current market rents.  We see a general lack of transparency in how houses are allocated.  There was a perception that people who may be on a list for a certain time see others getting a house ahead of them.  They feel there is a who-you-know approach to allocation.  We feel more transparency in the whole process would benefit everyone.</p> <p>  The choice-based lettings system is very welcome and positive.  It does, however, create a change in the dynamic of how houses are allocated.  The applicant must take the initiative in expressing interest.  An obvious benefit is choice and control for the applicant.  It is a change affecting many who might have been on the  list for a long period.  If this is implemented, housing supports and advice will be necessary to complement it.  In addition, it is IT-based.  Many of our clients whom we see daily may not be proficient in IT or may not have any access to IT systems. </p> <p>  On question No. 4, on what improvements, if any, can be made, a national policy on housing allocation should be implemented.  It would offer better transparency and consistency between the approaches of each local authority.  Ultimately, it would be of benefit to the service user.  For instance, a score sheet based on a points system concerning the time one has been on the list would give one a better understanding as to where one stands and how long it may take to be offered a property.</p> <p>  Choice-based letting should be introduced across the board through all local authorities.  However, housing supports and advice should be given alongside this to ensure those who may not have access to the appropriate systems or who may not have an understanding of how the system actually works will not be put at a disadvantage.</p> <p>  Question No. 5 seeks examples of best practice in the area.  The choice-based letting system offers best practice in the Irish context.  We feel it could be a fair system.  Any housing options a local authority is developing should be offered with housing advice and support services in a wider context as part of homelessness prevention work and wider housing services. </p> <p>  Question No. 6 concerns whether there are any local authorities with any innovative practices.  While not a local authority, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive uses the ETHOS typology of housing assessment.  ETHOS is a broad definition of homelessness and housing exclusion and includes households that are roofless, in insecure housing or sofa-surfing.  This approach should be used by all local authorities and should certainly be adopted in changing the definition of homelessness.  Each local authority, particularly front-line staff, should be given training in using this typology and assessment method.  </p> <p>  On how Ireland compares with other countries in regard to the average time spent on waiting lists, we feel the social housing system in each country is unique, which makes it extremely difficult, and potentially misleading, to make comparisons between countries. </p> <p>  With regard to the average waiting time when placed on a housing waiting list, our clients regularly report very long waiting times.  We have seen people on the list for over ten years.  In Galway, for example, most people have been on the list for over ten years.  Some people we encounter have been on the list for up to 14 years.  It is difficult to say but the majority of clients are definitely on the list for more than five years, and sometimes more than ten.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  I will briefly give some context and then I might answer questions Nos. 1 and 2.  Mr. Guy has answered Nos. 3 to 7.</p> <p>  In broad terms, there is a fundamental lack of supply coupled with insecurities within the private rental sector.  The housing waiting list system is couched in a system whereby, from the point of view of the local authorities, construction, vacancies and acquisition are predominantly of three and four-bedroom houses, yet we have an ageing population and an increasing number of households in smaller housing units.  There are many single-adult households.  What is required on the macro scale is a greater balance in construction and acquisition to reflect the nature of the list itself.</p> <p>  Of particular interest to Threshold, as the national housing charity working with renters, is the level of priority given to the transfer list which impacts on HAP, and the issue of responding to hidden homelessness.  Mr. Guy mentioned the ETHOS definitions and the broader typology of what homelessness is and how it presents.  Regarding the new scheme of lettings that Dublin City Council has been debating, many of our clients are arguably in very challenging and worse positions than certain households in emergency accommodation settings and are, in effect, homeless.  They are sofa-surfing and sleeping on people's floors.  That has to be reflected in allocations.  </p> <p>  On HAP, there is clearly a lack of security of tenure.  While we welcome many things the HAP system brings, the differential rent scheme and recent legislative improvements in security of tenure, clearly there is much stronger security of tenure when based in a local authority house or an approved body housing unit.</p> <p>  I will respond briefly to question No. 1.  When filling in the housing needs assessment form, our advisers, such as Mr. Guy, have an extensive sense of the process.  Once households get approved for a housing list, however, the advice is usually to find a house using HAP.  Beyond that, we have limited knowledge of the system.</p> <p>  The waiting list system does not work as effectively as it could.  There is no unified electronic system across all local authorities and no national standard in the methodology of assessing housing needs and the scheme of letting priorities.</p><p>A lot of these issues are debated and decided at local level.  We welcome Dublin City Council's attempts to try to have a conversation about rebalancing that transfer list to make more allocations from that list.</p></speech>

I have a number of comments and questions.  I am a huge fan of choice-based letting, having been on South Dublin County Council for a number of years.  Not only is it a much more efficient system in terms of turnaround properties but it also gives the applicant some control over the properties they express an interest in.  We should not discount that.  There are a number of issues, however.  Threshold raised the issue of people who do not have access to computers or who are not computer literate.  It is important that local authorities that offer choice-based letting provide a walk-in service for people who, on the days when choice-based letting is open, can go into the local authority and have their expressions of interest done by a staff member.</p> <p>  In large urban areas where there might be a housing estate that for whatever reason has a particular reputation, tenants who are in more secure rental accommodation will not express an interest in that area.  Tenants who are in more insecure accommodation and have more complex needs will express an interest and, by accident or default, there might end up being an over-concentration of families with specific sets of needs in certain geographical areas.  There is a need for that to be acknowledged and for flexibility in the allocation scheme to prevent that concentration.  Some local authorities do that but others do not.  </p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland contained a commitment to a roll-out of choice-based letting across all local authorities.  I would like an update from the Department and the CCMA on where that is at.  As long as those caveats are dealt with, choice-based letting should be the primary mechanism for allocating 70% or more of properties that are not on the priority lists.  </p> <p>  There is an urgent need to review the income thresholds.  The economy is picking up and people are getting back into work but we have two other difficulties.  As a result of the housing crisis, multiple generations of the one family, through no fault or desire of their own, are being forced to live together in private rental accommodation.  People are being removed from the housing waiting list because they have their adult children living with them, even though their adult children do not want to live with them but they cannot secure rental accommodation elsewhere.  Their income is pushing them over the threshold and, because the review is annual, more of them are being excluded.  Where people are involuntarily sharing, there should be a different way of calculating the portion of the adult children's income that is taken into account, for example, a disregard of 50%.  I have said before in the D&aacute;il that FIS should not be included in the calculations of the income thresholds for eligibility.  The fact that a family is on FIS is the State saying its income is not adequate.  I had two cases in the past 12 months of families being less than &euro;1,000 over the threshold on an annual basis because of FIS and they were removed from the list.  They then had this terrible Hobson's choice between not applying for FIS the following year, thus reducing the family's income and losing their position on a local authority waiting list.  In both cases, they were nine or ten years on the list.  In addition, an increasing number of local authorities are refusing the inclusion of adult children on the list.  An example is a woman who lost her job, went back to education, could not afford her private rental accommodation and, therefore, decided to move in with her parents.  She is in her mid-30s and when she applied to go on the housing waiting list she was told she did not have a housing need because she was able to live with her mam and dad.  It is bizarre stuff that makes no sense whatsoever and it needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  With regard to lettings, residency needs to be reconsidered particularly in respect of women fleeing domestic violence.  Greater flexibility is needed in order that, for example, somebody is able to move from the local authority in which they have habitual residency to a neighbouring local authority to access accommodation, particularly in smaller local authority areas where there are very real safety issues.  Some local authorities apply that flexibly and others do not.  It needs to be standardised.  A similar point could be made regarding Travellers.  </p> <p>  I will not get into an argument about how good or bad the HAP and RAS schemes are but the simplest way to deal with the HAP transfer list is to give those on it access to choice-based letting.  That tackles the transparency argument because they now know the issue is length of time on list through choice-based letting.  Some local authorities have started to do that and, therefore, they are not counted in the global housing list figures.  They are on a HAP transfer list but they have access to choice-based letting on exactly the same terms as they had previously.  I keep saying this and Ms Hurley is blue in the face listening to me say it but the Department should just decide that is the way it should be done and issue the circular.</p> <p>  I have a big concern about the annual reviews.  The idea is good in principle but it is a significant administrative burden on local authorities.  The way the triennial reviews used to be conduct in the large local authorities was complex.  People would be written to, sometimes on multiple occasions.  Some local authorities would follow that up with a text message, particularly to try to access vulnerable, hard-to-reach households.  Additional effort would be made to try to reach people with literacy issues.  When we move to the annual review, local authorities will not have the capacity to conduct that big exercise through no fault of their own.  I am worried we could end up losing some of our most vulnerable housing applicants because the local authority does not have the capacity to conduct the same extensive review it would have done previously.  </p> <p>  I refer to home repossessions.  The difficulty for families that are having their homes repossessed is they know there will be a date when they lose the property.  In some cases, the local authority does not know what the income the family member will be left with after the house sale if it is in positive equity.  There is a bizarre scenario where they cannot apply to go on the social housing waiting list until the repossession is complete even though that process takes approximately year.  As Threshold said, they then have to wait six or eight weeks before it is processed.  Only then can they start applying for HAP.  There has to be a way of saying there can be an in-principle processing in advance of the repossession date.  That can then be finalised once the income benefit to the family is known.  The family can, therefore, get onto the list immediately for the purpose of securing HAP accommodation.  It is a simple measure the Department could implement.</p> <p>  The figures the CCMA has given are interesting.  I would have loved to see them go beyond the seven years.  I have the figures from my own local authority.  Perhaps the CCMA could provide figures at a later stage from across the State for the years 2007 to 2009, 2009 to 2011, 2011 to 2013 and 2014 onwards.  If the CCMA follows the scheme it has up to 2014 onwards, it would be good.</p> <p>  I know Ms Hurley's job is to present these figures as positively as possible and she is exceptionally good at it.  There are 85,799 households on the waiting list but there are also 36,444 active HAP tenancies.  The vast majority of those people who want council housing are in short-term insecure tenancies.   There are still approximately 20,000 households in RAS.  As Ms Marguerite Ryan will be aware, because I have been pestering her about it recently, RAS is under pressure.  There is a gross housing need of 142,244 on the basis of the figures.  I do not mind separating them out because that is valuable but we need to understand if the 36,000 HAP tenancies were all put on choice-based letting, they would bid for properties.  Large numbers of them would not be willing to forgo the possibility of a long-term secure tenancy for a perpetual cycle of two years.  I understand why the Department presents the figures this way but, in total, 142,000 households need long-term secure social housing.</p></speech>

Regarding the presentation of the numbers, and the needs of 37,000 households being met by HAP, 350 tenancies per week are being added under the scheme.  We are seeing it work well for people and we are seeing people in secure tenancies that are lasting.  Some do not and where that happens, we try to work through the place finder to find them other accommodation.  However, people are having their housing need met by HAP and they are comfortable within that group.  There are 86,000 households on the waiting list and we are targeting those most in need.  They are the priority people.  For us, the 86,000 are the people on waiting lists.  People on HAP are in houses and homes that are secure.  That is where I am seeing it from.</p> <p>  I will work through some of the issues the Deputy raised.  On the choice-based letting, we are all in agreement it is a great scheme and it works well.  While it has been rolled out in all areas, it is operational and fully working in only 16 of them.  We are working with the other local authorities to make sure it is fully rolled out.  Cork and south Dublin are great examples of how it works.  It is agreed that choice-based letting is a good scheme and it is something we are trying to encourage local authorities, in which it is not fully operational, to operate.</p></speech>

We may not have all local authorities operating it because some are saying it might not work for them.  There is work to be done in this regard.  It is operating well in 16 local authorities.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the walk-in service.  That is in place in Cork and it works well.  It is something which we will work on with our colleagues in the CCMA and LGMA with a view to rolling it out in other areas.  It is important for people who do not have access to the online service.  Choice-based lettings is a priority for us and we will work with the other local authorities in which it is not fully operational over the coming months.</p><p> We are examining the FIS issue at the moment.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  We are looking at the suite of eligibility criteria.  Members will be aware that a review of income eligibility for social housing is under way.  The Housing Agency is doing some modelling in that regard.  Our colleagues in Threshold referred to that.  Work is being done on the composition of the lists, eligibility and which people need to go on the list and we expect the results of that towards the end of the summer.</p><p> With regard to the movement of households, I was asked about domestic violence.  Other situations may arise whereby households need to move from one local authority area to another.  We have been working with local authorities on greater flexibility, in particular around homelessness.  At the first housing summit, the Minister focused on cases in which people were willing and wanted to relocate from pressure areas to rural areas and indicated that we could facilitate that through local authorities.  We have been working with local authorities on greater flexibility in specific cases, including cases of this sort.  My colleagues in the CCMA can speak to this also but my understanding is that where these special situations arise, people are facilitated with the agreement of the local authorities.  We encourage local authorities to work together on a range of issues to facilitate households that need, and want, to move.  My colleagues can probably discuss that in greater detail.</p><p> I was asked about annual reviews.  One of the reasons we were carrying out annual reviews was to get an accurate picture.  The process has been under way for a number of years and it is getting sharper.  Concern was expressed about people who did not respond and might fall off the list.  In that regard, the first time the review was carried out, there was a large and detailed exercise as to where the list was at.  Mr. Rafferty has been providing training sessions to local authority staff and working with them to ensure we capture everyone in need and we have the most accurate list.</p><p> I was asked about home repossessions.  We are trying to focus on prevention where people present at local authorities and it is better if they never enter emergency accommodation in the first place.  Ms Ryan is working with local authorities on the place finder service.  If we know that someone will lose his or her home in six weeks, it makes sense to commence working with him or her immediately.  That is something we will follow up on.</p></speech>

It is difficult when the local authority does not know about a person.  Certainly, we can engage in a campaign around prevention.  We encourage local authorities, to facilitate people they know are going to lose homes, whether through a notice to quit in a private rented dwelling or through the repossession of a home.  We are also working mortgage-to-rent scheme.  There are 671 mortgage-to-rent cases in the system now.  Where people lose homes and are eligible for social housing, the best solution for us is to keep them in those homes.  We can work on that under the scheme.  Ms Ryan will respond to the Deputy's queries on HAP.</p></speech>

That is working quite well and it gives people the option to retain places on the existing transfer list while seeking accommodation in neighbouring or different local authority areas.  We have been engaging directly on HAP and RAS with local authorities and a couple of different strands are coming together to enable and support local authorities to negotiate to retain existing RAS tenancies using enforcement opportunities under the Residential Tenancies Acts and to facilitate what we can by looking at HAP as an opportunity for RAS tenants.  That would have to be on the basis that the RAS tenant was interested in, and accepting of, the move to HAP.  Our focus at the moment is on trying to work through all the opportunities in that area.</p></speech>

Some of the smaller local authorities are of the opinion that it might not suit their circumstances.  The IT system has been shown in Cork to work well.  A manual system is seemingly resource-intensive.  I take the Deputy's point that people need support.  In addition to the concept of a walk-in clinic, the potential exists for people to use libraries where staff would be in a position to help people with the online system.  The income issue is being examined.  It causes issues, in particular when people in bordering counties may be in different bands.  That is particularly frustrating for everyone involved.  People can find themselves just over the limit because they are a few miles down the road from the area they see as their natural home.</p> <p>  Different local authorities approach the issue of single people who live at home in different ways.  People's circumstances are assessed on a case-by-case basis.  Traditionally, they would never even have been considered, but that has changed.  It is provided for in the regulations that a local authority should take into account the accommodation the person is in but the schemes are flexible enough to allow local authorities to have regard to individual circumstances.  Equally, the case of a person from one county who is in a domestic violence situation is dealt with on a case-by-case basis and between adjoining local authorities.  There is no blanket rule to say that a person from Carlow, for example, who experiences domestic violence must be dealt with by Carlow County Council and not by another local authority.</p> <p>  The HAP transfer list could be examined in respect of choice-based letting.  I do not know off the top of my head whether that is used in any local authority area.</p></speech>

Transparency is part of the issue and that has come up a few times in the questions.  When dealing with competing balances and people with difficult circumstances, including medical conditions, homelessness and domestic violence, it is difficult to keep everything entirely transparent.  As such, a person who thinks he or she is in the top ten and sees that 20 houses are coming on stream might be under the impression that he or she will definitely get one and that creates a challenge.</p><p>In respect of the annual review, local authorities would make contact on a number of occasions.  A number of local authorities would use social media to advertise that a review is being carried out and publicise it in local newspapers.  I know from my own experience that the three-year assessment used to give rise to people being taken off the list but the main criterion is there - that they come back on.  The door is not closed to them if they come back on.  They can be dealt with.  </p><p> In our submission, we made a comment regarding the concept of home visits.  If one was aware of people on the list who were vulnerable and had that resource available and they were not responding, it might be possible to follow up in that sort of scenario.  Likewise, the placefinder process enables us to look at people who may not yet be evicted or have their home repossessed so both of those could be looked at.  </p><p> I think the Deputy asked about further details on the breakdown of the length of time.  I am sure we can look to see if we can get to that.  Just because somebody is ten years on the list does not necessarily mean they did not get offers of accommodation.  In some cases, people have declined many offers of accommodation.  </p></speech>

I will keep my comments and questions very focused on what we are dealing with today, namely, examining local authority housing waiting lists.  When I looked at this, the first thing that came to mind was transparency because a lot of people on our housing lists cannot understand the inconsistencies.  I have one question for Ms Hurley.  We see her all the time so I will stay fairly focused.  She had it right there when she spoke about a common methodology across the 31 local authorities.  My experience is that it is different all over the place.  I will not cite particular councils because they are not here, that would not be fair and I do not want to misinterpret my understanding of these local authorities.  Some local authorities have a numbering system.</p><p>D&uacute;n-Laoghaire-Rathdown is the one with which I would be most familiar.  People can ring in and say they are &quot;X&quot; and are told what number they are on.  I know there are always deciding factors.  One can never tell anyone where one will be but one has a sense of what one is about.  There are other local authorities where someone can ring up and be told something different three times in the one week.  They have no number so the person has no allocation number.  We have heard anecdotal evidence of political patronage and I know the CCMA and the witnesses have mentioned it.  There is a perception that if one knows someone politically, it helps one.  Politicians have fed into this and I will be critical of politicians when I say that.  They are being entertained in pubs, clubs and various places where people have meetings or clinics and are being told: &quot;I'll put in a word for you.&quot;  That is grossly unfair but that is what people go away thinking.  They decide to do the rounds so they hawk the kids around to three clinics of three different politicians on Saturday morning because they think they have nothing to lose, it might get them a way up and the politicians might show them great understanding and might have a relationship with the housing manager.  I am not saying this happens because I do not believe it does happen.  I think that is worth saying.  I think it is all above board but people must have confidence that it is above board and it must be transparent.  I am very familiar with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and how it had to tackle waiting lists because I was a director there.  I consider that to be the same issue.  It is about data, embracing technology and putting systems in place.  Would the witnesses or the CCMA look at the possibility of adopting a standardised electronic process where once the application has been judged valid, each individual could access a central register on a IT system, key in their independent identification number and be able to see where they are because there is nothing more soul-destroying than people coming and saying they thought they were number 20 but have now discovered they are number 40?  Accountability is an issue.  I think it is to protect the staff and everyone against accusations or suggestions that there was something below board.  Transparency must be the key message coming from our deliberations here today.</p><p>I will go into the question of data but there are all sorts of different data.  I circulated a bit of data relating to councils around the country last week.  I was quite amazed by the responses I got.  They are all in writing and I have them all so I can show them to anyone who wants to see them.  They disputed these figures whether they related to the delivery of housing, the lists, how many people are on them and the categories they are in.  That is another day's work but that feeds into all this.  I think the more data we have and the more we embrace technology, the better because it is really important.  </p><p>I have a few points to raise with the CCMA.  The witnesses from the CCMA talk about a standardised process being unable to react to exceptional circumstances.  I am advocating a standardised process but I do accept there is that variance.  Ms Holohan might comment on that.  I touched on political representations.  She talks about political representations and how the role of advocates needs to be clarified and transparently managed and I agree with her.  We need a protocol around that in terms of Oireachtas Members.  Some councils will ask one to present a letter of authority because in many cases, politicians are making representations where they do not always have the authority.  I agree with Ms Holohan.  I think that is a really positive thing.  We need a standard protocol around the entire country in respect of that.  </p><p>With regard to people aged 55 and over specifically categorised for accommodation, should we look at pushing that out to 60?  I think we should but, again, I acknowledge that each local authority adopts its own scheme.  It is a reserved function and I am loath to interfere with reserved functions.  They have very few of them and this is one of them.  Perhaps the witnesses might give us some commentary on that.  </p><p>Can it be confirmed that Placefinder is operating everywhere?  It should be rolled to all 31 local authorities.  On the one hand, there is a balance between the Department coming the heavy on councils and councils being undermined.  There is an issue of balance there.  When we decide on policy, and Placefinder is a good one, we need progress on that.  Could we have a list of choice-based lettings, particularly in respect of Kilkenny, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Carlow because the three individuals are here.  Could the witnesses tell us their intentions regarding choice-based letting because that is really important?  I have dealt with the issue of transparency.  </p><p>Threshold made a really good submission.  I think the witnesses spoke in great detail about single people being discriminated against.  This is the case.  I spoke to a man from Rathmines who has been on housing list for 17 years.  He had been in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He discovered he was on two lists, which he should not have been, so he looked at the options and found that Dublin City Council and Rathmines represented the better option for him when it came to getting accommodation so he is now solely on that list.  He told me that he had been told by officials that he will have to wait another few years and that then he will get the accommodation by virtue of his age.  That is a terrible thing to have to say.  </p><p>I thought the point made by the witnesses from Threshold was a really good one.  In <i>Housing Law, Rights and Policy</i>, Padraic Kenna writes that:</p><blockquote>There is a widespread assumption (whether justified or not) that the allocation of Local Authority housing has been part of the local political patronage or clientelist network of Ireland.  The absence of a national, transparent accessible and objective system of managing waiting lists and allocating homes has fuelled this view.  </blockquote> <p>I will leave it at that.  I think that is the challenge.  We need a proper transparent process that can be independently validated and that gives people confidence in the scheme.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John-Mark McCafferty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#L00700"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for the feedback about the input.  One of the key points he raised that we wanted to raise in the question and answer session is around single people and how, in effect, the system intentionally or unintentionally discriminates against them.  One could argue that Threshold was founded partly on the basis or strongly on the basis that even when the State was providing a high quantum of social housing, many single people were left to the vagaries of the private rented sector long before it was regulated in the way it is now and that many people had to face bed-sits or other poor-quality accommodation and unregulated levels of rent.  All ruling parties since the 1980s have made a very deliberate decision to divest themselves of a social housing system and to rely on the market to provide for people on middle to lower rents in the private rented sector.</p><p>We welcome the fact that we now have frameworks in place like HAP, improved security of tenure legislation although there is still a fair bit to go, and the removal of bedsits, which we warmly welcome.  We have still a good way to go in terms of standards and I know that the committee will consider the matter in the future.</p><p> A key issue we want to mention is the fate of single person households.  We urge the committee to be mindful that the number of single person households in the State is increasing.  A family comprising two or three children and two parents is still part of society but the share of that size of family has radically shifted in terms of household composition.  Neither the housing market nor developers has reflected the change when they choose to build.  The planning system does not reflect the change and public policy does not adequately reflect the change.  That scenario is manifest in the housing situation.  We seek a shift in policy in terms of how the change manifests itself in allocations, and also in the wider construction and acquisition strategies of local authorities and approved housing bodies.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#M00200"><p>Senator Boyhan asked about common methodology.  The process has been set out in the assessment regulations.  Local authorities process applications in accordance with both the regulations and the legislation.</p> <p>  Part of the point that we made in our submission concerned transparency and, in particular, general data protection regulation, GDPR, in terms of the responsibilities of local authorities, the rights of housing applicants and the potential responsibilities now being placed on public representatives due to what the regulations may require them to do.  </p> <p>  In terms of the legislation and regulations, clearly there are certain circumstances in which people must be considered in terms of an overall priority situation, perhaps somebody living in a dangerous building.  There is prioritisation.  Some local authorities use a numbering system.  Housing officials can say to somebody, and it has been their experience, that he or she is tenth on a list but something can happen for any number of reasons where that person is displaced due to an overall priority scenario.  It is not that local authorities do not want to be transparent.  We want to be transparent and we want to help people, as best we can, to understand where they are on the list.</p> <p>  Different systems have been employed over the years.  For example, with the points system people could move up or down the list.  Next there was a closed list and a points system, which meant people knew their place on a list for six months or a year.  However, when the list was reviewed people often were moved further down the list.  The work is challenging but the sector is keen to develop a standard process for use across the system.  One is never going to get a 100% transparent system due to emergency circumstances.  Housing officers try to balance the competing needs of the various people on their housing lists at all times.  Such work is challenging at present due to the high number of homeless cases and the increasing number of medical cases presenting in different local authorities.</p> <p>  In terms of providing accommodation for people who are aged 55 or 60, some of the larger local authorities have specific accommodation for the elderly and might operate same on that basis.  There is potential because last year's assessment of housing need showed 45% of applications were from single person households.  We must decide whether we need to change the profile of our housing stock to meet that need.  In many cases those single person households might be due to marriage or relationship breakdown.  The applicants may have their children to stay for weekends or holidays, which poses a challenge in terms of saying that the people are only entitled to a one-bed unit yet they really need a two-bed unit.  There are some very good examples of developments that are specifically for the elderly, which is something that local authorities will continue to do.</p> <p>  The placefinder service has not been rolled out in every local authority.  My local authority is operating it and we have recently been sanctioned by the Department to recruit somebody specifically to do such work as their role.        </p></speech>

All local authority officials work to the legislation, regulations and to the personal circumstances of housing applicants.  It is a very difficult balancing exercise.  Over the years there have been cases where people told public representatives information pertinent to people's housing circumstances but the people have not told the local authority.  I make that point in order to be fair.  </p> <p>  The choice-based letting system is not in operation in Carlow but we are considering the matter.  I call on Ms Mulholland to reply.   </p></speech>

The technology has been piloted in the Cork and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown areas.  When the system is correct and read to roll out we will implement it on a full-time basis along with an ICT system.  Recently we have manually operated the system on a case-by-case basis with a small scheme allocation.  We found that it takes quite a lot of work to write to everyone in the area who has expressed a preference in the area where the scheme is and ask them to express an interest.  Therefore, an ICT system is necessary and we need one in place before we can fully roll out the system.</p></speech>

At the beginning we piloted hard-to-let properties.  The system has worked so well that the number of refusals has decreased from 35% in 2016 down to 24% in 2017 and we will roll out the system in July.</p> <p>  The county council is developing a new civic hub that will be staffed by 16 people who will deal with many queries, including housing queries.  We will provide kiosks so that people can access the properties online.  We will also provide support to people who wish to apply for housing and general housing supports.  The initiative will free up staff who work in the backroom offices so that they can concentrate on allocations and other aspects of homelessness. </p> <p>  In terms of accommodation for elderly people, 50% of the one-bed or two-bed need can be found in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  We have provided a number of elderly accommodation sites in Rochestown and Sallynoggin.  We have embarked on a pilot scheme that provides a larger one-bedroom unit that can be divided into two to enable a carer or family member to stay overnight.  In June, ten such units will be opened at a location called The Brambles in Sallynoggin.  That proves we are aware of these problems and are addressing them. </p></speech>

We found that people lower down the list were accepting them, not those high on it.  When a person gets into what we call an "offer zone", we seek Garda vetting and so on.  As people lower down the list would not be in that zone, it might take longer.  We expect it to even out when we put everything not going on the priority list on the standard list for choice-based letting, CBL.  We asked customers how they felt about it.  They would like to see properties and more pictures of the inside of properties online.  We can do some of this.  Showing properties is difficult.  It is very resource intensive.

To date, we have had confirmed expressions of interest and starts in 14 local authorities.  We continue to engage with several additional local authorities.  There are two elements to the place finder service and homeless HAP scheme, one of which is the resourcing of a staff member to assist in the on-the-ground place finding, while the other is access to deposits and advance rental payments to secure additional properties under the homeless HAP service.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, acts on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities.  We have been meeting it regularly, even as recently as last week.  It is a question of drilling further into the reach of the place finder service, ensuring the local authorities, where it has a responsibility, have access and that we widen the scope and resources available to make sure a place finder is available in each of the local authorities and that there is a contact point in each of them.  There is no difficulty in resourcing or the administration of the place finder service.</p></speech>

I will go easy on Ms Mulholland.  </p> <p>  The lack of housing supply is the biggest issue facing us.  While I welcome the housing assistance payment, HAP, there are major problems with the scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Last week I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government about the rent pressure zones.  He said he would be breaking the law if he were to include Carlow or similar areas in the scheme.  Today we discussed the rent pressure zones with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which stated it could introduce them because the Department was considering a second phase.  It is in the amendment that all county councils and local authorities be considered for inclusion in rent pressure zones.  There are 21 such zones.  It costs &euro;1,000 to rent a house in Carlow.  The cap for the housing list is an annual income of &euro;27,500.  The maximum payment under the HAP scheme for a couple with one child is &euro;600 per month.  A lone parent with three kids receives &euro;700.  The problem is that because rents have gone up so much there is a balance of &euro;300 to &euro;400 that people are not able to pay.  There is an appeal mechanism and I am constantly in contact with the local HAP section, but it is not enough.  Rents have risen and HAP scheme payments are not half what they should be.  While the Department has created rent pressure zones to help, it has created a disaster in other areas which I see.  Because of this people are only barely surviving.  It is causing a lot of hassle.</p> <p>  A person included in the HAP scheme or the RAS receives his or her payments but someone in receipt of rent allowance does not qualify to go on the local authority housing list.  The rent allowance is too small.  If there is a crisis and someone is not on the housing list, we go to the Intreo centre which we would have known as the social welfare office where the person can receive rent allowance in an emergency.  It is very small; a person would be lucky to receive &euro;500, but the monthly rent is &euro;1,000.  We are creating a situation where people are starting to become homeless.  In my area, because the criteria do not add up, it is causing problems.  I was all in favour of the HAP scheme because I felt the rent allowance scheme was not good enough, but now the HAP scheme is causing too much trouble. </p> <p>  I think the RAS needs to be changed.  A person can only be taken off it if he or she has been on the housing list since before 2011.  Many want to come off it.  I do not think they should have to have been on the housing list since before 2011.  That is part of the policy and I have many issues with it. </p> <p>  At &euro;27,500, the housing list cap in Carlow County Council is one of the lowest in the country.  I have been bringing up this issue for months with Ms Mulholland.  I know people who do not qualify to go on the local authority housing list because they are in receipt of family income supplement, which puts them in a dilemma.  The Government has brought forward a new mortgage system which does not consider family income supplement payments, although they are considered in being on the housing list.  No such payments are considered in the case of a mortgage.  People are becoming homeless because they may be &euro;1,000 over the limit in seeking to go on the housing list.  The constituency is Carlow-Kilkenny, but in the case of Kilkenny County Council, the cap is &euro;33,500.  The difference does not add up.  People are panicking and I am really concerned.  Ms Mulholland has said there will be a decision on the cap by late summer.  I hope that by the end of September she will be able to tell us there is a different cap for Carlow County Council.  </p> <p>  Reviews are carried out every two or three years.  Persons who have been on the housing list for eight or nine years may be taken off it because they are over the limit, but are not given a chance to appeal.  I have made representations for several people in that position.  The council needs to put a system in place for them because being taken off the list can have an awful effect on them.  They are down in their rent allowance payments and may not qualify for a mortgage.  The council needs to put a system in place to prevent that from happening.  I think this is happening in all local authorities.   </p> <p>  Owing to staff shortages, a person who applies to the local authority may have to wait up to ten weeks to be put on the housing list.  I cannot blame any local authority for this, but the issue needs to be examined.  I know of cases where people have been waiting ten to 12 weeks, which is unacceptable.  People need to have their interview within three to four weeks because they are waiting for rent allowance payments and need to know if they qualify to be put on the housing list.  There needs to be a system in place such that everybody will be given a fair hearing, but that is not happening.  </p> <p>  The approved housing bodies, AHBs, have started to buy and build a lot of houses lately.  A total of 15% of the persons who qualify for one of these houses do not have to be on the local authority housing list, but 85% of them do.</p><p>When these houses are given out, people work through the local authority and the names are given by the authority to these bodies.  They will interview people and they go on need and sometimes they will not go on time spent on the list.  Somebody might be only three years on a list and somebody else might be eight years on the list and not get one.</p><p> We have to welcome the fact that all these agencies are buying houses, but the problem is there is no joined-up thinking.  Is there some system where the approved housing bodies can work with local authorities on this?  They provide names, but perhaps a system could be put in place.  I understand some people may be more in need of housing because they have children with disabilities or illnesses.  I understand they need to be a priority.  Carlow County Council would be accountable and at times when I go in I would think I have a good case and the council workers would have to listen to me.  Working with the local authority system for 20 years, one would know most families over generations.  It is what happens in our line of work.  I can honestly say accountability is 100% with us.  The criteria for special cases are not clear.  What I class as a special case might not be classed as a special case by Carlow County Council.  Guidelines must be put in place in all local authorities.  We need to have a particular timescale.  Focus Ireland has played its part lately by working with local authorities.  Are we moving many cases from local authorities to Focus Ireland?  We need a system in place in this regard and we should look at that.</p><p> I understand anti-social behaviour does not happen too often but the only reason for eviction is non-payment of rent.  If somebody causes anti-social behaviour, it can be very unfair on good people.  It does not happen too often but it happens.  A system should be in place for the local authority to sort this out.  It cannot happen in the courts - I am dealing with some matters in court currently - as a log is required of what happens every day and there must be formal complaints.  It does not work as the process is too long.  It is not a massive issue but it can be a concern for people living in an area.</p></speech>

With our build delivery this year, AHBs work very closely with local authorities and they will deliver 1,500 build units this year, with local authorities delivering 2,300 new builds.  It is a partnership.  Local authorities always have the nomination rights so AHBs do not decide who goes into particular houses.  They will get the nomination from the local authority.

Those 20 people would be interviewed and then there would be a decision.  That is great and I welcome that but it can be confusing for people who are longer on a list and do not understand the process.  I can see that sometimes there could be ten houses with 20 names going forward before a decision is made.  They are good decisions.</p></speech>

It is very much that the local authority, in order, would nominate the household for the house and then it would work with AHBs.  If somebody refused the house, the process would move to the larger group nominated for the house.</p></speech>

There is a different make-up to the list.  That is why there is a slight difference in everybody's allocation scheme.  The schemes are run in accordance with the scheme of lettings.  The needs may take in medical or homelessness priority and the schemes are operated according to the list.  With AHBs we have first tried to build capacity because of the challenge ahead.  They will deliver a third of our social houses to 2021.  It is also about encouraging great collaboration between the local authorities and AHBs.</p> <p>  The Senator is very passionate about people who fall just outside of eligibility, and she raises their cases all the time.  There is a review under way of income eligibility for social housing.  The Housing Agency has been doing modelling in that regard and we expect to get something, as I stated, over the next few months.  We will be looking at that.  We are looking at the family income supplement issue raised by the Senator as part of the review of income eligibility.</p></speech>

The annual rate of inflation must be at least 7%.  The rents are monitored closely by the Housing Agency and, following consultation with the local authority concerned, it may propose an area to the Minister.  There is a process behind that.  The Senator asked about the difference between rent supplement and HAP.  She knows rent supplement has been replaced in the majority of cases for new applicants by the housing assistance payment.  We cannot comment on rent supplement specifically because it is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  From our perspective, however, we see HAP as open, transparent and it is clear what a person is eligible for with respect to rent and limits for each household type.  I am not sure about the Senator's comparison of the two.  She mentioned rent supplement not being sufficient.</p></speech>

It is &euro;600 per month for a person with two children and &euro;700 for two adults and two children.  That is low because rents have gone to &euro;1,000 per month.  People are not able to meet the &euro;300 differential.  They also pay the council &euro;70 or &euro;80 per week.  People are falling behind so it should be examined.</p></speech>

From a statistical perspective we are not seeing that it is hitting the maximum of 20% in the majority of cases.  However, individual cases may vary.  It is a matter for the authority to consider specifically.  In addition we have section 43 determinations that provide a little additional scope in terms of specific household classes that fall outside normal bands.</p></speech>

It is a relatively small number that are affected but it happens.  The Department's view on this, as communicated to local authorities, is that when a person is removed from the list, he or she should be given every opportunity to engage.  People are typically removed because they do not engage or respond to correspondence from local authorities.  They can get back in touch and there is usually a three to six-month period in which an authority would allow them back and put them on again.</p><p>In the specific case of an income review, where the applicant has been told that he or she is over the income limit, while it is more clear-cut, obviously a conservation should be had with the local authority.  The CCMA can answer this more directly but those conversations take place.  If there were to be a mistake or if it were to be wrong, it would certainly be corrected and they would be put back exactly where they were, with no loss of their place on the list.</p></speech>

That is the problem.  If a person is taken off the local authority housing list and gets back on the list a few months later, he or she starts from the beginning.  I have had many experiences of this.  The previous record of six or seven years on the housing list is not recognised.</p></speech>

People are given every opportunity to get the information back in.  Where people are removed from the list on the grounds of income, the eligibility is clearly set out in the regulations.  If there is an issue where a person is not meeting the eligibility criteria, we have to work within the regulations.  Where people are in a situation where there is a capacity issue or illness and they have not returned their information in time, they are not removed from the list but are put back in with the entitlements they had.</p> <p>  Issues in respect of eligibility criteria are different because if they want to return to the list, their circumstances would have to change again.

There is no comparison.  There are people who are not on the list because they do not qualify on the basis of income levels but who should be on the housing list.  I thank Ms Mulholland for clarifying the information but the system is just not right.  The income eligibility limit is the reason so many people in County Carlow do not qualify.  There are 6,000 people in County Carlow who do not qualify at present to go on the list, but many more would qualify if we changed the income eligibility cap.</p></speech>

The counties in the south east have an arrangement under homeless funding, that is, section 10 funding for tenancy support and sustainability service, which is delivered by Focus Ireland in the local authorities and works very well because it raises the customer focus within the overall service and it deals with avoiding a homeless situation in the supports and advice service they give.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on transparency and what the applicant is entitled to because I am getting different feedback from different local authorities.  What level of information is the applicant entitled to?</p> <p>  I wish to deal with the administration and bureaucracy around the housing assessment form.  Ms Mulholland mentioned the choice-based letting and the administration involved in that.  We seem to be consumed by bureaucracy and paperwork which takes away a resource that could be spent better somewhere else.  Is there any technology that can streamline the process and make it more beneficial to everybody involved so as to keep the key resources to be spent on more important issues?</p> <p>  I have not had much experience of choice-based letting because it is more the traditional way of letting in County Wicklow.  Is there a comparison of how the two systems are working out?  I imagine the only way we can work this out is by the refusal rates and the reasons for refusals.  Have we data on refusals of choice-based lettings compared with refusals of traditional letting?</p> <p>  The CCMA gave us the average waiting list and the breakdown of the numbers.  Threshold said that 45% of people on the waiting list are single people.  Do we have a breakdown not just in years on the list but the different categories of people on the list, such as the number of single people on the list?  We are saying that 24% are on the list for seven years or more.  Of that 24%, would the number of single people be 75% of the total?  Do we have an analysis of the data giving the different groupings and how long they are on the waiting list?</p> <p>  Ms Kathleen Holohan mentioned home visits and perhaps she could elaborate on those.  Does she mean that when an application is made, an official goes out to ensure that the application is returned or is there something else that I am missing in respect of home visits?  Ms Holohan also made the point that the definition of homelessness needs to be clarified or reviewed.  Will she explain what exactly she means by that?  We had a debate with the Minister last week on homelessness.  Will Ms Holohan revert to us on that please?</p> <p>  Ms Holohan mentioned data and the transfer of data information between different bodies and different sources.  How can we streamline that process because in some ways that can block up the whole system?</p></speech>

There are some very good examples and we have heard about choice-based letting.  There are other examples across government, in motor tax, student support grants and most recently the Passport Office.  In partnership with CCMA and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, we are looking at the best options and it would require significant investment, but we see the value of it.</p></speech>

The Department is very clear and is of the view that people should be able to find out where they are on the list.  A number of local authorities are very clear on that also.  In Dublin City Council, the applicant gets a reference number and can track it that way.  In some local authority areas it is possible but in others they do not tend to give the applicant the place on the list.  The reason those local authorities give for not providing the information is that they do not wish to raise expectations as people will be disappointed because something may happen.  People are watching the list.  The Department would be in favour of people knowing their place on the list.  The operation of the list is not straightforward so it is understandable in some local authority areas that they try not to raise people's expectations.  From the examination we have done during the course of the review, however, we are seeing that many local authorities give the information on where the applicant is placed on the list but some do not.  Those that do not give the information will engage with the applicant and tell him or her about the waiting period and the potential timeframe.</p></speech>

Will Ms Holohan comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#P01400"><p>Some of the comments in our submission are in the context of transparency and, as I said, we want to be as transparent as we possibly can be with people who are seeking housing from the local authorities.  As Ms Mulholland has said, part of the challenge is that we have to deal with exceptional circumstances.  We are dealing with homeless, medical and emergency cases, and that has become more difficult in recent times because of the increased levels of homelessness and an increase in some local authorities in medical cases as well.  One may run the risk of giving an applicant the impression that he or she is likely to be housed in six months to a year, and then something happens which means that does not happen.  This is particularly the case in areas of high demand or where there is a smaller amount of accommodation available.  If an emergency occurs or somebody must be housed because of a compassionate situation and there is very limited stock, it causes difficulties.  It would be something that we would be interested in trying to standardise as much as we could across the system.</p> <p>  There have been some efforts to improve the bureaucracy and paperwork in the administration of housing.</p><p>Earlier, I mentioned Monaghan County Council.  It has done considerable work in its processing and its ability to process housing applications using a paperless system.  In recent months, local authorities in the south eastern region met to consider how we can move that forward.  Data sharing is another area being examined.  Under an ongoing project between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Cork City Council, the candidate local authority under a national programme board, the Department and local authority share data.  The system allows for the extraction of information required about a person.  Not only can this be used for the housing application but also for the assessment or a rent review, for instance.  We hope that type of exercise can be expanded with other State agencies but that will require work to the information technology systems on both sides.  Someone applying for social housing, for instance, will need a form stamped by the Revenue Commissioners declaring whether the applicant is in receipt of tax relief on a mortgage.  Most local authorities do not have a Revenue Commissioners office in the county.  In some cases, such as Kilkenny, the Revenue Commissioners office is not open to the public.  That is a challenge in itself for housing applicants.  </p><p> At a general level, the County and City Management Association, CCMA, is looking at the current housing IT system.  Most local authorities use a system called iHouse, although the Dublin local authorities use a different system.  A project board is in place to upgrade the system to achieve a much better, more user-friendly system with greater functionality across the sector.  </p><p> On the housing needs assessment, it is possible to do an analysis to show the length of time on the list and the age profile.  </p><p> On home visits, traditionally some of the bigger local authorities inspected accommodation at the time of the application.  Inspections were not always done and they have been somewhat reduced in number.  They were used in the past, particularly when there was a points systems and it was necessary to calculate whether accommodation was overcrowded under legislation.  Our view is that home visits would bring about a better understanding of the circumstances in which people are living and would be a form of outreach to the housing applicant, especially those who might have challenges in terms of their ability to communicate with local authorities or understand the system.  However, as we noted in our submission, this approach would be resource intensive.</p><p> Similarly, the comment on the definition of homelessness relates to transparency.  Currently, local authorities are trying to provide solutions for people who are at risk of homelessness.  A definition is not provided for in the legislation.  We raise this issue in the context of providing clarity for everyone involved.</p><p> The project I outlined in Cork is an example of the transfer of data, an issue raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Rafferty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#Q00200"><p>I will reiterate Ms Ryan's earlier remarks about the better use of technology.  The Deputy's point was well made.  Ideally, we would like the application for social housing support to go online.  That would be a progressive step.  We are looking at it as part of the broader social reform agenda.  Similarly, as part of the broader reform agenda, there is a case for having the application for social housing support, which is virtually the same in every local authority, dealt with by one authority rather than 31 different local authorities, as is currently the case.  These are broader reform issues, and there are many other things below that to be implemented, but they are on our radar.</p> <p>  On the issue of using data to give us a better idea of the people who have been on the housing waiting lists for seven years or more, it is possible to do so.  The process which we go through with the CCMA and local authorities to get the summary of social housing assessments, SSHA, each year is exhaustive but once the data have been cleaned up, they give us an incredibly detailed dataset that we can mine.  We are planning to create sub-reports of the summary of social housing assessments that would look at specific issues.  That will probably be done this year.  Waiting lists would be one sub-report, while the situation of older people would be another.  We would certainly be able to get the data to which the Deputy referred.  We can probably interrogate and investigate the data to the nth degree.  We will examine this issue in the context of the 2018 SSHA, which should be published by the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p></speech>

Is research being done or are data being collected on choice-based letting?  Is the number of refusals declining?  What reasons are being given for refusal compared with the traditional form?</p></speech>

It is a little early to do comparisons.  Reducing the refusal rate was one of the motivations in Cork city, but the council has seen greater benefits than that.  It had refusal rates of between 35% and 60% and these rates have fallen to between 5% and 20% which is very significant.  Ms Keenan will have seen similar changes.</p></speech>

I urge caution, however, as there is a correlation between the fall in refusal rate and the type of accommodation we are providing.  We are building again and building high quality homes that people would have no reason to refuse.  Some research might also need to be done on that aspect.</p></speech>

I must concur with Senator Murnane-O'Connor who raised the HAP cap.  The cap has been set at &euro;575 in County Kerry.  People can appeal and, if lucky, the threshold will be raised by 20%.  However, rents around Killarney have increased to &euro;1,000, &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,500 and &euro;2,000 and the HAP payment in no way meets the needs of many people who are homeless, living with parents or friends or in other scenarios.  Can the limit be increased in Kerry?  We have a great housing section in Kerry County Council and it does great work.  I appeal for an increase to the HAP limit in Kerry.</p> <p>  There is also an issue with applicants being removed from the list because they do not reply to the assessment when they get it.</p><p>People move around and it is difficult to stay in the same place because landlords only allow people to remain for a certain length of time.  The next thing they are gone, so when a letter comes from a local authority, it is not answered.  In one case I dealt with, there was a family dispute and the poor girl moved from one parent to the other.  She never got the notice.  After she received a phone call, she rang the general number for the county buildings.  Since no one on the switch could tell her who had rung, she could not get through to anyone.  She is off the list and must now reapply.  It will be a battle to have her years restored.  That is wrong.  In another instance, a man was also thrown off the list after he had moved.  I have several cases like this.  These people are being asked to fill out the application forms again.  Once they do, their previous years on the list should be restored automatically.</p><p> It has been suggested that public representatives were making representations on behalf of applicants without being requested to do so, but that is not my experience.  I have enough to do making representations for those who are asking it of me.  I do not know how a representative could find out that someone was looking for a house.  Elected members do not get the housing list like we used to years ago.  The only way I know of to find out whether someone has made an application is if he or she contacts us.  There is no other way.  As such, I reject the assertion that people have been making representations without being asked.  It is not happening.</p><p> I am dealing with people who have been on the list for 14 years and are in private rented accommodation.  When I ask why they have not been granted local authority housing, the answer I receive is that they are too young.  They are 33 or 35 years of age.  It is unfair.  Fourteen years is a long time to be on the list.  The assertion that they have been left behind because they are too young needs to be examined.</p><p> I have always said that there should be no such thing as one-bedroom houses.  We should be building two-bedroom houses instead.  Invariably, people will need someone to stay with them if they are sick at night.  Friends and relatives visiting is the one thing that might brighten up their lives for a small while.  The spare room need only be a small one.  This would not cost much extra.  It would be just as cheap to build a two-bedroom house as a one-bedroom house.</p><p> From my knowledge of Kerry, there is no rent allowance.  If a current tenancy expires, there is no rent allowance or RAS option.  The only show in town is HAP or long-term leasing.  The latter is a serious option for some people because they are taken off the listing as a result.  This is a Government-led idea to show that it is doing something about reducing the list by taking people off it.  Even though people enter into long-term leasing, if the landlord is not happy, he or she will invariably say that he or she will be selling the house or putting a relative into it.  The tenant then goes to the bottom of the pile and must start all over again.  These are the types of battle we are fighting in Kerry.  It is wrong.  There is a claim that people are being housed and have security of tenure through this long-term option, but they do not.</p><p> For a long time, we have been asking for the return of the tenant purchase scheme.  It was abandoned for four or five years.  Now it is back, but in a changed format.  Pensioners who have saved enough are not allowed to buy out-----</p></speech>

I thank Ms Mary Hurley for helping with a couple of emergency cases during the week that I raised at this committee last week.  It was appreciated.  I also thank D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which is at its wits' end, the same as most public representatives, with the housing emergency.  The council must deal with the difficulty of the lack of local authority housing and the impossibility of trying in many cases to source HAP accommodation, which is the only housing being offered because rents have gone through the roof.</p> <p>  I would like an answer from someone, although I know that this is a political matter and my question is really to the Government.  HAP cannot deliver the quantity of social housing that has been set as its target under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is a fantasy that is exploding in our faces and will explode in an even bigger way in the coming years as it becomes more apparent that HAP is not social housing in any meaningful sense.  It is not secure in the way a local authority tenancy is.  I do not count long-term leasing as social housing, but even if one accepts the figure of 50,000 that includes long-term leasing, the rest of the 133,000 units targeted under Rebuilding Ireland are HAP, RAS or various forms of outsourced private rented accommodation.  That cannot happen.</p> <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has always been ahead of the game.  Even when rents decreased in the rest of the country, they never really decreased in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  In 2011, we were able to flag that the move away from direct council housing construction was going to cause a housing crisis because it was obvious in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that one could not deliver through outsourcing.  The rest of the country discovered that in 2013 and 2014.  We had been warning about it.  Will the same not become apparent with HAP?  The experience in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and south Dublin shows that HAP cannot deliver for large parts of the country.  The council can confirm it for me but the figure in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for new HAP tenancies this year is only 17.</p><p>There has been a significant drop in new housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies and the figure has certainly fallen since last year.  How long can we pursue the fantasy that HAP can have significant impact on the housing waiting list in places like the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area?  What does one say to somebody who is facing eviction or is in homeless accommodation?  I want to know what is the official response when a person has a list of places they have tried?  I ask everyone who contacts me on this issue to write down details of every private rental they have tried to secure under HAP.  Some of them have filled out three or four foolscap pages listing 80 or 90 places they have tried to rent.  Not everyone is able to do this, however, and we can forget it in the case of a person who is dragging three or four kids around from a family hub to school.  How are people who have done everything possible within the limits, yet cannot find accommodation and are facing eviction, supposed to secure a HAP tenancy?  I know several people who are in this position.  What is the official line to be given to such people when it is obvious that what is offered to them simply cannot be procured with HAP?  I believe there is no answer and that needs to be admitted in certain parts of the State.</p><p> The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, situation is also precarious.  Do the officials in the Department or local authority accept that it is precarious?  I am dealing with a case where a woman who had been on the housing waiting list for 19 years is to be evicted from a RAS tenancy in July.  She cannot even get back onto the main list because the council argues she did not apply to go onto a fixed transfer.  The woman claims she did apply but the files have been lost or whatever.  This woman, who was on the list for 19 years, is to be evicted from a RAS tenancy that was supposed to be secure social housing.  What is she supposed to do?</p><p> On the income eligibility criteria, what are people supposed to do if they are offered a little overtime which would take their income over the threshold?  I am aware of people who have been taken off the housing list as a result of this.  Are people supposed to refuse overtime  to stay on the housing list?  One woman has refused a &euro;10,000 pay increase because it would result in her being removed from the list.  I will not name her because she has not given me permission do so, although she probably would give me permission.  She is appalled by this criterion but she knows that even with the pay increase, she could not secure any accommodation in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  The woman is living in poverty to stay on the list.  What will be done about that issue?</p></speech>

Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was the Minister when the legislation establishing the housing assistance payment was introduced.  We argued in the D&aacute;il that HAP was a fantasy and a measure such as a place finder service was required, although we did not have a name for it then.  We have been told a few times by the Minister that there was a place finder service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I am bemused to discover, therefore, that the council is only now employing a person for the service.  I do not understand this.  Having been told in this room that there was a place finder service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, we are now being told that the council is about to employ someone for a place finder service.  I would like this mystery explained.  What exactly will the place finder service do?  I want it to help those who come in with reams of lists of places they have tried and failed to rent.  I want an answer to be given to such persons, one which may involve raising the cap to enable them to secure a place.  I want some system in place for a person who is making an effort in order that he or she is  told, "Tough luck".  There has to be something more than that.  Will a place finder service do that?</p></speech>

At this stage, there are 37 homeless HAP cases and 85 standard HAP cases, which gives a total of approximately 120.  Given that our HAP target for 2018 is 240, we are about halfway there as we reach the midpoint of the year.  I have to acknowledge that it is expensive to rent or buy a house in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is no doubt that people have difficulties in this regard but we are securing some properties under the scheme.  The figure referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to homeless HAP cases and did not include standard HAP cases.<br/><br/>Obviously we have a duty of care with regard to RAS that we do not have in respect of the housing assistance payment.  I do not know of the particular case the Deputy described but we have a duty of care in finding another RAS property or another solution.<br/><br/>On the cases of income eligibility and overtime payments resulting in people being removed from the housing list, I understand that this can present a difficulty.  However, as noted earlier, the limits have been set and we must work within them.  The Department is considering reviewing the limits nationally because they are relatively low.<br/><br/>On place finding services, we have increased the number of staff in our homeless and allocation sections to deal with what we can.  We have people who will help out where they can.  The Deputy spoke of raising the cap on the housing assistance payment.  This is done regularly where we can do it.  We are aware that people cannot find houses.  Ms Ryan will verify that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council provides a higher cap for rents under HAP.  We try to help vulnerable people who are having difficulty in finding placements by trying to locate properties for them.  Of course we have difficulties in this regard because the supply is limited, but we do what we can.<br/><br/>The council will open a civic hub in July, which will be staffed by 16 people.  The hub will deal with queries besides housing but it will be able to support people who come in and there will be kiosks where people can look up websites such as<i>myhome.ie </i>or <i>daft.ie</i>.  Additional supports will be provided where we can do so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.696" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hurley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018052300002#S00900"><p>I will come back in with a couple of points and I will deal with Deputy's question first.  I will also address the place finder service, which the Deputy has raised in the House a number of times.  The place finder service is relevant to the search for units for people.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, operates a shared place finder service across Dublin's council areas.  There has always been a place finder service reaching out from the DRHE and working with the contact point in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  We met the DRHE this week and one of the options we are considering as we try to ramp up our prevention efforts is the possibility of locating satellite place finder offices in the other three local authorities.  The Deputy is correct that there is nothing like having people on the ground to find places.  We have supplemented the teams in the various Dublin regions and Ms Keenan and her team have been trying to find places also.  There always has been a place finding service operated through the DRHE and it is a shared service.  It has been able to facilitate the rent supplement uplifts and the homeless HAP.  That is done through that process.</p> <p>  We saw last week how families were finding it very difficult to find accommodation.  Where HAP is not yielding rental units at a particular point in time, there are a number of things we do.  One is the inter-authority movement where we try to facilitate people in other HAP local authority areas.  We also try to secure extra units through another form of accommodation such as long-term leasing.  It is a mix of measures to try to accommodate people within the various different delivery mechanisms.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is probably the most challenging of all the local authority areas with regard to HAP because of the price ranges for properties.  We work closely with Ms Catherine Keenan, director of housing, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on this.  It is very challenging when a HAP unit is not available but we find alternative solutions.</p><p>Unfortunately, some people end up in emergency accommodation.  We try to work them out through the HAP place finder.  If there is a gap where we do not get accommodation, we try to get it as quickly as possible.  </p><p> I refer to the figures of 50,000 and 87,000.  Members have concerns about HAP, which they have set out on a number of occasions in the House.  In the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, there is a target of 1,544 homes to be built, acquired or leased up to 2021.  We expect about 70% of them to be built.  Then there is long-term leasing, which comprises contracts of up to 25 years.  The contracts we have range between ten and 25 years.  We are now putting in place a lot of 25-year contracts, which give people security.  Separate from the HAP element, there is the build and lease acquisition element of the 50,000.  We have been working with Ms Keenan and the team on trying to accelerate delivery there.  We are seeing some good projects being delivered in D&uacute;n Laoghaire with George's Place opening up next week.</p><p> It is all about acceleration.  We know that we need to accelerate more, and we are saying to local authorities that the targets are a minimum.  Where they can do more, the Minister has made clear that the funding will be available, and we will support local authorities on delivery.  Our new housing delivery office is working closely with local authorities.  For us, it is all about homes and getting people into them.  We will continue to try to do that.  We will continue to try to make HAP as flexible as we can, and to put in place whatever supports we can to bring in units.  That will involve increasing the place finder service in the DRHE.  We need more people in there now.  We have put additional resources in over the past number of months, but we will continue to add to them.  It is important to get the right skill set in there.  We need people who know what they are looking for and can get out there and do it quickly.  There is a body of work under way there, and we will continue that.</p></speech>

It is a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.</p> <p>  From the Garda Inspectorate I welcome Mr. Mark Toland, chief inspector; Ms Pauline Shields, deputy chief inspector; and Mr. Hugh Hume, deputy chief inspector, to all of whom I offer a sincere apology for the unfortunate circumstances in which we had to let them go on a previous occasion, about which we are very sorry.

We fully understand why we were unable to appear before it on the last occasion.  I am the chief inspector and accompanied by my two deputy chief inspectors, Ms Pauline Shields and Mr. Hugh Hume.</p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate is a statutory body that is independent in its operation and functions.  Our main goal is to try to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses its resources efficiently and effectively.  Representatives of the inspectorate last appeared before the committee in October 2016.  We welcome the recommendation made in the committee's subsequent report that the inspectorate be provided with a statutory power to conduct unannounced visits.  The inspectorate notes that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2017 contains such a provision.  However, we believe the requirement to obtain the approval of the Minister to exercise this power should not be included.  Following a request from the Policing Authority, the inspectorate is conducting an inspection of the delivery of police services to local communities.  We are also in the final stages of completing an advice paper for the Minister that is looking at opening up entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  "Responding to Child Sexual Abuse" is a follow-up review to a previous report published in 2012.  For the first time, we forensically re-examined a previously inspected area to assess progress in implementing our recommendations.  The review also examined joint working arrangements between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla under Children First.  Since the 2012 report, there has been a considerable increase in the risks posed to children by the Internet and social media and the volume of online child abuse material is growing exponentially.  This area was also examined in the review.</p> <p>  Child sexual abuse is one of the most serious types of crime with which garda&iacute; will ever deal.  The review found that 66% of all recorded sexual offences in Ireland involved a child victim.  As part of the inspection, the inspectorate critically examined 211 child abuse cases to assess the quality of Garda investigations.</p><p>This analysis identified that the age profile of victims in these cases ranged from as young as three years of age and that only 5% of suspects were described as strangers.  Since the publication of the original report in 2012, only 45% of the recommendations can be considered fully implemented.  Processes in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla for managing child protection cases are inefficient.  Despite some progress in joint agency working, many barriers still remain.  Joint agency meetings to discuss serious cases do not always take place and decisions are often made separately.  We found that other jurisdictions have more structured and dynamic processes for making decisions in these types of cases.  While the 2012 report recommended multi-agency specialist child centres to provide medical examination, victim interviewing and therapeutic services, there are no such centres in place.</p><p> There are still delays in recording crimes on PULSE.  Some Garda investigations were conducted expeditiously and to a high standard while many others drifted with significant delays in taking victim statements, arresting or interviewing suspects and sending cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Inexperienced garda&iacute; are still investigating child sexual abuse.  This is not good practice.  Joint interviewing of a child victim by garda&iacute; and social workers is not in place.  Victim support organisations, however, reported that the relationship between victims and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has improved.</p><p> Not all convicted sex offenders who should be monitored by the multi-agency SORAM process are subject to those arrangements.  This review examined 2,000 referrals of child sexual abuse material sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We requested an update on these cases.  Despite repeated requests, 12 Garda divisions did not provide updates for some of the cases.  We found significant delays at all stages in processing these cases.  There was an insufficient online Garda presence at the time of the review.  Other jurisdictions have a stronger online presence to target those grooming children and those accessing child abuse material.  There are still very long delays in the forensic examination of computers and other devices.  This is an organisational risk.  Technology that provides real-time intelligence on those accessing child abuse material was available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but was not activated at the time of completing this review.  The inspectorate was recently informed that it is now in use and that additional online Garda resources are in place.  Like other jurisdictions, prosecution and conviction rates for child sexual abuse cases are low and long delays in conducting investigations do not help.</p><p> The inspectorate welcomes the creation of a Garda national protective services bureau and the roll-out of divisionally based protective services units that will have specially trained staff.  These units have the potential to professionalise the investigation of child sexual abuse and provide better victim care.  To address the findings on joint agency working, the inspectorate believes that all relevant Departments and agencies need to work together to reduce the risk of child sexual abuse and exploitation and make the physical and virtual worlds safer places for children.  An important part of the review was the engagement with two adult survivors of child sexual abuse.  Their testimonies gave an insight into the difficulties victims sometimes endure once they have reported abuse.  The inspectorate is very grateful for their contributions, and the changes recommended in this report are designed to improve services for all victims.</p><p> There are 24 new recommendations in this report.  They include developing a national strategy for child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and online risks to child safety; that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla develop a more dynamic and structured approach to managing child protection cases; developing multi-agency specialist child centres and ensuring joint interviewing of a child; urgently addressing the backlog in forensic examination of computers and other devices; adequately resourcing and completing the roll-out of all divisional protective services units by the end of 2018; and ensuring that sufficient Garda resources are in place to provide a strong online Garda presence.</p><p> In November 2017, the inspectorate made a submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This is available on our website.  We firmly believe that there is a place in the oversight architecture for an independent inspectorate that is focused on conducting inspections, audits and examinations to ensure that Garda reform is progressed and at pace.  As a new team and having examined most aspects of policing, the inspectorate is in the process of developing a strategy and action plan for future work.  We are proposing to approach this on a risk basis so that we inspect areas of most relevance and impact having regard to any human rights issues that may arise.  In this context, the power to initiate our own work, which was included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act of 2015 following a recommendation by this committee, will be most useful.  While our work to date has mainly been large-scale thematic inspections, future work could include post-implementation reviews, compliance audits and cyclical inspections.  The inspectorate has declared an interest to the Department of Justice and Equality in participating in the inspection process that will be required following the ratification of the operational protocol to the Convention against Torture.  This would involve conducting visits to places of detention maintained by garda&iacute;.</p><p> The objective of the inspectorate has always been to help make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a better service - better for the public, for victims of crime, for all the people working in the organisation itself and for the criminal justice system in Ireland.  It has always been the inspectorate's view that implementation of our recommendations is the way forward to reforming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but we are disappointed with the pace of change.  I thank the members for listening.  My team and I are happy to take any questions they may wish to ask us.</p></speech>

I want to talk briefly about the inspectorate's review of child sexual abuse.  Obviously, it is a matter of extreme concern not just to this committee but to all of the Oireachtas and all of the public.  Two statistics are particularly worrying.  The report found that 66% of all recorded sexual offences in Ireland involve a child victim, which is particularly worrying.  The report contained a statistical finding that does not surprise me but is something of which we should be aware, namely, that only 5% of suspects were described as strangers.  This reveals that in the vast majority of cases, abusers of children are people who occupy positions of trust.  One of the findings in the report is that not all convicted sex offenders who should be monitored by the multi-agency SORAM process are subject to those arrangements.  Will Mr. Toland tell us whether anything been done about that because that would be an issue of considerable concern to him and this committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018052300002#E00400"><p>We were also shocked by the statistic that two thirds of all victims are children.  It is a crime that is under-reported.  We also found that significant numbers of reports are made much later.  In many cases, they are made a year or sometimes many decades later.  This affects the Garda when it is trying to investigate it because it will have lost corroborating evidence and forensic evidence.  The Deputy is right to acknowledge that the majority of people who abuse children in reported crimes are either within the family or people known to them such as neighbours or people in authority.</p> <p>  We looked at sex offender management.  A good multi-agency process is in place.  It has been a pilot for a long time and has not been officially launched.  Agencies are coming together and dealing with some of the most difficult people to manage.  There are some processes in the courts that we think need to be addressed.  One of those is a pre-sanction report.  Once a person is convicted and before sentencing, we think it should be mandatory for every adult to be subject to a pre-sanction report so that the Probation Service can present to the court its suggestions for the best way to monitor that offender in the future.  Some of these people are very high-risk.  We found that out of about 250 people who would go before the court, only about 160 would end up with a post-release supervision order.</p><p>If they do not have an order in Ireland, they will not be monitored by the SORAM process, and that is a gap that we think needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Only 15% of people on that register are subject to the multi-agency SORAM approach.  Some of those sex offenders will be very low-risk.  They are risk assessed to see whether they will reoffend.  They are all subject to some level of monitoring.  Even those who are considered to be low-risk will be subject to one of the agencies, usually the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will visit that individual to continue to monitor them for the entirety of the period in which they are subject to notification requirements.  Everyone is still monitored, but only a small percentage are monitored by the multi-agency group.</p></speech>

We met a senior member of the national unit in November 2017 who informed us that a significant number of additional garda&iacute; had been appointed into that national unit and had been deployed to things such as victim identification, which is looking at an image that the Garda receives to see if it can identify a child in Ireland that might be at risk.  The Garda now have more members who are proactively on the Internet trying to deal with those who are seeking to groom children and those who are seeking to share indecent images with other abusers.</p></speech>

I apologise but I will have to depart in three or four minutes to take part in an interview so I will have to be very brief.  If it is any consolation, as it happens, one of my priority questions for later concerns the updating of Garda IT systems with the specific aim of tackling child abuse online, so I will raise some of the issues in Mr. Toland's statement with the Minister.</p> <p>  I will ask just three questions.  I would appreciate it if Mr. Toland could address them together insofar as possible and I will try to look back on the transcript for any of the other contributions.  It is about 12 months, I think, since the publication of the section 12 audit carried out by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  That report was very much of the view that individual garda&iacute; were doing all they could and were very committed and professional but that there were systemic failings that related not just to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to Tusla as well.  Will Mr. Toland give his view of the progress in this area, generally speaking?  One of the recommendations in the report was the need for co-location in terms of multi-agency work.  Will Mr. Toland comment on that?  In addition, is he satisfied with the functioning of the protection services bureaux to date?</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na underwent a sea change in 2016 in respect of specialisation, which we welcome.  The Garda had taken the view that any Garda member had the skills to investigate the rape of a child, which is not a view we hold and is not good practice in any other police service.  We are delighted the Garda is introducing a protective services unit in every Garda division.  There are four in operation.  They will be properly trained, form a specialist unit and be a single point of contact for other agencies, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and Tusla.  We welcome this.  We are a little worried they will not be rolled out quickly enough because there will still be occasions on which inexperienced Garda members are dealing with child sexual abuse investigations, which is not something we would like to see.  We also found a gap in local interaction between senior Garda managers and senior Tusla mangers.  That gap has now been plugged, and the Garda has now introduced a formal process locally in every area across Ireland, where senior managers will come together.  We think this is a good thing.</p> <p>  Co-location, in some aspects of this, is very positive but it still should not be a barrier to better inter-agency working.  Some progress has been made between the agencies but they still have a very inefficient process for making notifications.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's notification system is paper-based.  We want to see an electronic version, which would speed things up.  We also found that the two agencies tend to make decisions separately.  We would like to see more of a coming together with the professionals to make decisions about child protection cases so the case proceeds much more quickly.  In other jurisdictions - I know the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla have visited the UK - there are some good models that could be adapted to work very well in Ireland.  We are not prescriptive about the model, just the way in which the Garda would operate and deal with the most serious cases.  It should deal with them much more quickly than it does.</p></speech>

It must be incredibly frustrating that so long after the inspectorate's original report, only 45% of the recommendations have been fully implemented.  This kind of carries on from the inspectorate's previous very insightful reports on overall policing needs and targets.  A minority of what it is recommending is being implemented.  Does the inspectorate have the facility to raise this general issue and these concerns with the Minister or the Department?  Frankly, it is just not good enough.  My feeling is that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is just replicating the job of work that the inspectorate did a number of years ago.  It is completely unnecessary, but here we have it again: work the inspectorate did not being implemented.  Is there a forum for the inspectorate to raise this?  Has anyone come back and apologised and said they were improving, or are we in a cycle on this?</p></speech>

They included other organisations.  This is why we have included a recommendation in this report for a whole-of-government approach that needs to bring the key agencies together.  The one that sticks out for me that was not implemented is child centres, specialist centres of excellence, where a child victim can be taken immediately to have medical services, to be interviewed and to have the therapeutic needs of the child dealt with.  That needs more than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to come together.  We were disappointed to see some of the recommendations that were within the gift of the Garda either took a long time to implement or have not been implemented.</p> <p>  What I would say about the conclusion of this report is that for the first time the Minister has brought together an implementation group.  That is different language.  It has an independent chair bringing together those agencies to try to drive not only the recommendations from 2012, but also the new recommendations in this report.  The Policing Authority has filled a gap in ensuring that our recommendations are implemented, and we were delighted that it received a previous report, Changing Policing in Ireland.  There are some matters in this report that could go to the Policing Authority - that decision has not yet been made - but a different language is being spoken at present.  A lot of work is going on to try to address some of these recommendations.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has been looking at children's centres.  There is a lot of activity to try to address these recommendations, but we do not want to go back in two or three years and find that change has not happened.</p></speech>

Is that purely for investigative purposes?  What is the difference between that and the multi-agency specialist child centres?  Should there not be an overlap there, or would the bureau not be envisaged to be in a Garda station setting?  I know it certainly should not look like a Garda station, but what is the crossover between those two bodies?  Should they not be developed-----</p></speech>

They are the national unit and they devise policies and directives.  What was missing was something locally, at a Garda divisional level, a smaller version of a national unit that investigates the crimes.  Each of the 28 Garda divisions should have an investigation unit, which will be called a protective services unit, and they will be working, it is to be hoped, consistently across Ireland to investigate child sexual abuse.</p> <p>  The child centres are a separate entity.  In the case of a child who is a victim of child sexual abuse, the centre is normally sited within hospital grounds.</p><p>It is a separate building, a purpose-built facility.  It takes into account the needs of a child and the family.  We went to Norway and Northern Ireland to look at two centres.  They are fantastic facilities.  The child will go there immediately and be assessed by medical professionals to decide whether he or she needs to be medically examined.  That examination will take place at the venue.  The child will be interviewed and the centre will co-ordinate the interview.  The centre has proper specialist interview facilities.  The centre will also examine the child's emotional and therapeutic needs.  It is all co-ordinated.  There is usually a multi-agency set-up.  It is a purpose-built centre for looking at the needs of the child.  Some of the centres cater for adults as well.  The Northern Ireland model takes adults as well as children.</p></speech>

We went to Norway, where some of the investigators are based at the centre, but we also went to Northern Ireland, where there are not.  It is not a deal-breaker.  The idea is to have specialist garda&iacute; who would come in and, jointly with a social worker, conduct the interview in that location.  I do not think co-locating garda&iacute; there is a deal-breaker.  It is an option.  I do not believe it makes a great deal of difference whether we assign garda&iacute; there full-time or simply to carry out the interview.  Anyway, the facilities are excellent.  We were disappointed that no pilot is in place and no trial centre is in place.</p></speech>

The implementation group is due to meet in the coming weeks.  It will be for that group to decide whether it can force through the target.  That is what we have set.

At what level does the Garda Inspectorate engage?  How regular is that contact?  I am somewhat shocked but only in the sense that nothing has changed by this.  It seems 12 divisions out of 28 did not even bother to reply to the inspectorate.  That is scandalous but it would indicate that perhaps nothing has been learned from the past years.  Is that still the case?  Do they all come on board eventually?</p></speech>

We waited five months, a period we believe was far more reasonable than would have been expected.  Non-compliance is an issue for the Garda Commissioner.  The most important thing is that the 105 cases need to be investigated properly and progressed.  We met the acting Garda Commissioner and his top team recently to talk about all our work, including our work on child sexual abuse.  We have regular meetings now with the Policing Authority.  The authority asked us to give an opinion on whether recommendations have been implemented to our satisfaction.  We believe that is a good process and we are fully involved in it.</p> <p>  We do not know how the implementation group will interact with us on this child abuse report but we are keen to offer our services and opinion on whether something has been implemented.  This is the first time that we have gone back and forensically looked at a block of work.  We believe it gives a good flavour of the position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  We believe this is a good approach that we should undertake in future.</p></speech>

Has time moved on so much that some of the original recommendations are outdated?  In that context, we had a discussion last week about the growth in online behaviour and the concerns of the inspectorate about the lack of monitoring.  I am unsure whether the inspectorate was involved in the digital age of consent issue.  Did anyone ask for the opinion of the inspectorate?  I am curious about that.</p></speech>

We do not comment on Government policy but we were not asked.  European countries are looking at different ages.</p> <p>  The 24 recommendations are brand new.  We have restated some that were not implemented.  We did an assessment of the previous recommendations because time had moved on.  We still believe they are valid recommendations but we can see that they could be changed somewhat in order that they are fully up to date.  We have accepted that while the recommendation from 2012 on the question of child centres was good, it could be adapted to have a slightly different centre but with the same principles.</p></speech>

It is probably an unfair question &ndash; if it is Mr. Toland should say so &ndash; but it comes from my experience.  Perhaps it is not about apportioning blame.  It relates to liaison between the Garda and Tusla.  From what Mr. Toland has said, it continues to be problematic.  I do not mean to overstate that.  I understand that at the top level those involved are beginning to come together.  It is precisely as a result of the Geoffrey Shannon report that the disconnect still seems to be there.  How long has it been since those reports were published?  That was a key body of work.  How is that going to be unlocked?  Is it a matter of political will?  Is it at the top of those organisations?  Is it a lack of prioritisation of this issue?  It is simply people working in their own way?  What is at the root of that?  I really do not get it.  It seems to be behind many of the issues.  There seems to be a mismatch of communication and decision-making.</p></speech>

We believe it would make them more efficient.  One is simply the governance structure from the top, where the two organisations come together.  They have good policies.  The Children First guidance is an excellent document.  It is a question of making those policies live on the front line and in front-line services.  We believe there was a gap between the governance of the two at a national level and in the delivery of local services.  They have, to a certain extent, plugged that gap with the introduction of a new formal structured meeting process that will bring together local senior managers to ensure that Children First guidelines are delivered on the front line.  Numerous committees are in operation.  We simply comment on ensuring that the national committees ensure that policy is delivered on the front line.</p> <p>  Tusla is still a relatively new organisation.  It came into existence in 2014.  The structure of Tusla is different to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Tusla has 17 areas while the Garda has 28 divisions.  It ends up with managers having to deal with more than one Garda division.  Those systems do not help.  There is little co-location of staff.  The joint interviewing was disappointing.  They need to train more social workers to participate in those interviews.  We made several recommendations that we believe would help those two organisations to work more effectively and to be more dynamic.  Certainly an electronic system of passing information between those two agencies would really help.</p></speech>

My instinct is that Tusla is probably a greater part of the problem, although it may sound ironic for us to say that.</p> <p>  Two others issues arise that are not linked to child protection.  One relates to the report being prepared by the inspectorate on entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is that at all levels?  Does it apply to promotional grades external to Ireland?  Is it linked to civilianisation?  It is to overcome the process of having to join and go up?  In that scenario a person cannot come from another police force?</p></speech>

We hope to hand it over shortly.  We are looking at how to open up entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have a view on civilianisation and we have expressed that in previous reports.  First, the Garda needs to decide whether the post needs Garda powers or whether it could be performed by professionals who need not be trained as police officers.  That is the starting point.  This is very much looking at how to bring in people at garda level right up to Commissioner level.  We hope to give that to the Minister shortly.  Many people are very interested in that report.

I am not sure about that myself even though I consider the Garda Inspectorate to be hugely important and believe it should continue to function as a key oversight body.  Given that we are talking about inspections of all places of detention, not just those in Garda stations, how would that work?  Would the inspectorate see itself inspecting stations, overseeing the transit of prisoners to court and the whole shooting match?  How many staff does the inspectorate have who could do that job?  It could be labour intensive.  It is an interesting idea and I want to get my head around how the inspectorate might do that work.</p></speech>

We think we have the skills and expertise to visit Garda stations and look at places where people are detained, and ensure their rights are being communicated appropriately.  It would be a multi-agency task.  There is a new inspector of prisons who is coming to meet us shortly.  We think there is a place for us in the inspections process which is why our independence is so important.  We think we have the skills and expertise.  We go into custody facilities at the moment.  The only thing we do not do is talk to people who are currently detained in Garda stations to ensure they have been dealt with appropriately and that their rights have been properly communicated and adhered to.  We already look at lots of aspects of detention and how suspects are dealt with when they are brought into a Garda station.  We have a role in that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, they include healthcare settings as well as places of detention operated by police or prison services.  A model that appears to work quite well is the one involving an overarching co-ordinating body for the national preventive mechanism and then a number of other organisations which inspect within their areas of expertise.  Coming at it from that perspective, the inspectorate has the independence, knowledge and experience to examine places of detention where garda&iacute; detain individuals.  That would then feed into a co-ordinating body which would, in turn, report through official channels on the operation of the protocol in Ireland.</p></speech>

Resources will be needed to carry out a baseline assessment but an ongoing programme of inspection might require a lower level of resources over time once the initial baseline is there.

A number of questions arise from the witnesses' contributions.  The 2012 report recommended multi-agency specialist child centres to provide medical examinations, victim interviewing and therapeutic services.  However, no such centres are in place.  The witnesses pointed out that there are very good models which we could replicate if we cared to look at them.  It is six years since 2012.  Given the level of public concern in this area, what in God's name is wrong that after six years no centres have been provided?  Why is that?</p></speech>

Capital funding is necessary and locations must be identified.  It involves more than just An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but includes the HSE, Tusla and other organisations which need to come together to agree where the centres will be provided.  We envisaged and recommended in 2012 that two pilot projects be commenced and we were disappointed that not even one pilot scheme has been done.  We are frustrated but there is a great deal of activity to get those centres up and running quickly.  Existing facilities could be used in the interim to at least bring services together so that a child needs to attend only one location.  It is not right that a child or adult victim of sexual assault must travel to different locations for different services.  Parents and guardians from other jurisdictions are happy to travel longer distances to a specialist centre where they know they will get a really good service.  It is not the case that they need to be located all over Ireland.  The minute a child comes forward with his or her family to report child sexual abuse, there should be a dedicated centre to which the child can be brought rather than having to ring around to find a hospital or paediatrician that can see him or her.  Sometimes children have to travel all over the country.  It is an unsatisfactory outcome but there is a commitment to get the centres up and running pretty quickly.</p></speech>

For example, the online threat brings in the Departments of Education and Skills and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  A national approach is important.

I am sure the inspectorate is well aware of the many failings of the PULSE system.  We have been highlighting the huge sums the Garda spends on IT in return for a very poor service.  The Garda does not even follow procurement guidelines.  It has been a horror.  Has the inspectorate an input into how this should be done in future?  If the system set up in this context is a mere add-on to the current arrangements with the likes of Accenture, we are looking for trouble.  Has the inspectorate an input in this area?</p></speech>

The issue is transferring it through an encrypted service to Tusla.  Part of the problem is that Tusla has five or six different IT systems, not a national IT system.  PULSE now includes a facility to allow for the electronic transfer but the movement from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Tusla is the difficulty.</p></speech>

We have said this is another year away, that it should have been done prior to this and needs to be done immediately.  All it does is add time.  This is information which travels through the postal system which is not efficient.  Some of the quality of the forms travelling between the organisations is poor.  It ends up with a social worker trying to ring a garda who may not be at work or vice versa.  This is inefficient and we would like to see an electronic version which speeds matters up.</p></speech>

We have commented in our report on other jurisdictions and how they get around it.  In Northern Ireland, the protective services of the police have reorganised themselves to fit into health authority areas.  That is one way of dealing with it.  In the UK, there are centres where one will have social workers, police officers and health professionals all in the same building.  This is a multi-agency hub at which conferences can be held.  We watched one and it looked very professional.  They come together immediately.  The three organisations in the UK share information about a child and make decisions.  That is a good model which could be replicated in Ireland.  One could have a model which deals with rural parts as well as the cities.  We give options for a better system than is currently in place.</p></speech>

It is not in the executive summary which the committee received.  We do not particularly like naming and shaming.  However, we felt it was so significant in this case that we did.</p> <p>  The issue of compliance is one for the Garda Commissioner.  Again, as I said earlier, the most important point is that those 105 cases are investigated and progressed because there could be images of a child who needs to be rescued today.  The image points the Garda to an address.  It needs to go to that address to see if that child potentially is at it and needs rescuing.  It is an important piece of work.</p> <p>  In the future, all of these cases will go to the protective services unit.  At the moment, they go to a division which allocates them to a variety of different people who may have had no training in how to investigate that type of crime.</p></speech>

The lack of training and education in all of these areas must be the largest factor, apart from funding.  Is there a will there to address this deficit and change that dramatically?</p></speech>

Apart from a homicide, it is probably the most serious crime.  One cannot expect an organisation to train 13,000 members to investigate that type of serious crime.  We hope that it will have a protective services unit and train the members of this unit to a high level.  They are starting to do the training.  That is where we would like to see investigations sit in the future.  It should not be for any of the other 13,000 Garda members, just those specialist officers.</p> <p>  Another piece that is missing is that Tusla and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did joint training between social workers and Garda members when Children First was launched.  That was a good piece of training.  We have recommended that should be replicated.</p> <p>  The protective services unit will become a single point of contact for Tusla.  At the moment, a Tusla senior manager has to contact several Garda superintendents across various districts.  The new system will mean the Tusla senior manager will go straight to the head of the protective services unit.  A much more linear communications train, rather than the current system, will be in place.  That will help Tusla rather than having to work out in what area has a crime taken place and to which superintendent does a Tusla manager need to talk.</p></speech>

There is a need for general education around this area for the public.  Many people do not know how to react if their child has been abused.  It is an incredible challenge for them not to report for 12 months but not surprising.  Is there any general effort to educate the public in this area?</p></speech>

Children do not always understand they have been a victim of crime or what has happened to them.  Sometimes they are embarrassed.  There is a real challenge around teenagers, particularly boys who do not report offences.  In our report, we have looked at online child exploitation.  Children do not want to tell their parents that they have shared an indecent image of themselves with an abuser on the Internet.  Schools could play an enormous role around the online piece.<br/><br/>There are some good websites to assist parents.  For example, <i>CyberSafeIreland</i>is one we quote in our report.  It gives advice to parents on what steps to take if they find their child is engaging with a stranger online and having inappropriate conversations.  It is important that, if they have protective service units locally, they can publicise them with NGOs and support organisations.  NGOs have been vocal and have noticed a change in how Garda members deal with them on this issue, particularly over the past several years, which is positive.  Local support services can direct victims, particularly parents, in a very difficult decision.<br/><br/>The important point is that it is reported.  Whether they want it to go prosecution is another issue.  I would always encourage parents to come forward.  If they are dealt with by specially trained Garda members and social workers, they will tell other people it was professional and they were dealt with appropriately.<br/><br/>We have, however, given testimonies in our report of two adult survivors who said they would never go back into the criminal justice system because of the way their cases were investigated and what happened to them.  In one of the cases we cite, a relative of the complainant decided not to come forward because of their experience.</p></speech>

That is an occasion where the agencies need to physically come together.  As the Garda member investigating the crime might be on night duty or might not be in a specialist unit, he or she is not always available to go to that meeting.  Sometimes the investigating Garda member is not available and sometimes conversations take place on the phone.  I think it is a commitment to the process that one physically turns up and something is lost if the people are not in the same room.  People might have had a conversation over the phone but it is important that the agencies come together and for each agency to provide information that it has got on its systems about the family and the suspect.</p> <p>  We went to look at UK models.  We went to Scotland and to the West Midlands - to Birmingham city centre - in the UK and while they operate slightly different systems, they are all co-located.  A notification comes in that it is a serious case, it goes to a social worker, the social worker carries out an immediate assessment, and then the social worker arranges the meeting.  We sat there and watched the meeting.  The agencies are in the same location, they come together, they share their information and they make what I would call executive decisions.  These are all trained personnel - a paediatrician, a highly trained police officer and a highly trained social worker.  They predetermine what happens next such as whether the child will be medically examined or will be interviewed, the dates of those examinations and the interviews.  This is all done before a police officer has been told that he or she has been told he or she is investigating the crime.  So the police officer investigating is given the crime and already important things have been done.  The process is just much quicker and more dynamic plus highly trained people make those decisions.  That is a model that we really like.  In Scotland, they do a similar thing but information is shared online at the start.  Sharing data is a major barrier in Ireland but it did not seem to be a problem in the UK and Scotland, where they shared the data and willingly gave all of the information they had.  We found reticence here about sharing data in the fear that it would be disclosed to a third party.  We have recommended that this issue should be addressed.</p></speech>

Are the processes haphazard, depending on the district?  Have the agencies adopted agreed guidelines?  Has that been established yet?  Should statutory guidelines be applied whereby, if a particular allegation is made, X, Y and Z agencies, health bodies and Tusla must come together within a particular amount of time in a certain way at a designated location like what happens with some of the statutory health processes?

We have found that in some places there is a very good contact between Tusla and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but there is an <i>ad hoc</i>or unstructured approach in other places.<br/><br/>Many of the Garda members that have been given liaison roles with Tusla have other jobs.  They might be a community policing sergeant who also has to liaise with Tusla.  That means he or she is not always available and it is not his or her full-time job.  That is why we think a dedicated specialist Garda unit in a local division that covers a county should be a single point of contact for Tusla.  The establishment of such a unit will address many of our concerns.  Those specialist officers will then be available to attend meetings where they will discuss serious cases.</p></speech>

However, we must ensure there is constant oversight and, as Mr. Toland has said, ensure that is done on a multi-agency basis.</p> <p>  Mr. Toland also mentioned the delays in recording crimes on PULSE.  Does he believe that the PULSE system will ever be functional?  PULSE has been a theme at all of our meetings.    </p></speech>

It is a good system for recording lots of data but it does not allow one to record the investigation of a crime.  The PULSE equivalent that operates in other jurisdictions allows one to record everything that has been done with a crime.  Recently attempts have been made to enhance the PULSE system but we feel it should be replaced with a system that is built around case management and crime investigation.</p> <p>  PULSE in itself is not the problem with recording; the problem is a Garda member not putting an entry on to the PULSE system.  That is the problem.  Once a crime is recorded on PULSE, one can supervise and monitor it.  If a Garda member makes an arbitrary decision not to record a crime on PULSE then that is a major issue.  We have recommended that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na check its call recording systems so that if someone has rang up to say he or she has been a victim of a sexual assault then the authorities should check to make sure there is a corresponding PULSE record in place.  Let us say someone walks into a Garda station and reports child sexual abuse, if that Garda member does not record it immediately then the only two people who know about the abuse are the victim who went to the station and the Garda member.  That is a weakness in the system.  PULSE relies on a Garda member recording a case immediately.  The PULSE system also needs good supervision to make sure that that is done. </p></speech>

The situation makes data monitoring and the accuracy of data extremely difficult.  At least PULSE is one system that we can go to but it is not easy to extract information from same.  We mentioned in our report that we had difficulty in correlating or reconciling Garda figures with Tusla figures for notifications.  We found that there was an enormous difference between both figures.  We have recommended that this matter is examined in order to makes sure that things are not lost.</p></speech>

We see that we should remain independent.  Every jurisdiction that surrounds Ireland has an independent inspectorate.  We are very clear that we should not be doing academic pieces of work and research pieces of work because sometimes we are given such work.  We think other bodies could do that work and we should carry out inspections, go back and check to make sure things happen and focus on implementation.  We have had these enormous reports that we have been asked to complete.  There is no need for us to go back and do a whole-of-organisation report in the immediate future.  Instead, we should be going back to check whether previous recommendations have been implemented.</p> <p>  We recognise that we need to provide a service to the Policing Authority and we have had a number of meetings to discuss how we can operate.</p><p>Ms Shields is doing a piece of work for the Policing Authority currently and this is the first report we will do for the authority.  We believe we can provide it with our expertise.  The problem we would have in the future, if we became part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or the Policing Authority, is around the level of trust we have when we conduct inspections.  When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate conducts investigations it is not responsible for investigating complaints and is not responsible for Garda members' promotion.  We are seen as an organisation that can help them.  People trust us and they provide us with information.   When one considers the level of detail in our reports, and the accuracy of what people are telling us, I believe that people would be afraid to engage with the inspectorate in the future if it was attached to the Policing Authority or another organisation.  It would damage our relationship.  We say it as it is, we do not pull any punches - as members will see in our report - and the richness of our report comes through our interaction with reserves, civilians and Garda members.   It would damage this relationship and make it more difficult for us to get to the root of what the problems are.</p></speech>

Some of this might involve turning up and doing on-the-spot inspections.  We would like the facility to be able to go to a Garda station unannounced to do checks, to get a reality check and a real life check.  We can see the sense of doing this in the future.  We would like to do more of that.  We want to do what it says on the tin, namely, inspect.  We are an inspectorate and we see it as our function to do that.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate needs its independence to do that.  It is a small organisation and we believe we can produce work much quicker if it is more focused and bespoke.  We can do more work, but some of the reports we have done recently have been on enormous topics and thematic reviews.  We want to go back now and add value.  We have a responsibility to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement recommendations.  We do not want to just hand over a report and recommendations.  We want to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to make sure its members fully understand the recommendations and we want to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement them.</p></speech>

Understandably there has been a lot of discussion around the identified deficiencies in the collaboration between Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other relevant agencies on this very serious matter.</p> <p>  Mr. Toland referred to the North and a particular facility in the North.  Given the nature of our society and of cross-Border movement, and with regard to the victims of sexual abuse and exploitation and the perpetrators, is Mr. Toland content with, or has he looked in any great detail at, the level of co-operation and information sharing that exists between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other associated bodies with responsibility in that area?  With the current set up, does Mr. Toland foresee, or wish to comment on, any difficulty arising in the existing arrangement as a result of Brexit?  If Mr. Toland has a view on this, has he seen any evidence that the Garda or the PSNI are planning for the future in the context of Brexit to offset any difficulties?</p></speech>

There are security issues in the North around police officers being located full-time in that centre and this is one of the reasons it does not happen.  The level of interaction is very different.  We found that the services appear to work very well because different organisations come together at the centre.  At one point I believe that Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were looking at whether they could actually use the centre for victims of crime, especially those from Donegal or northern counties.  That has not been agreed but it is an option that would perhaps save some families and victims having to travel to other centres.</p></speech>

We went to the centre and saw the facilities there.  We then met with senior managers from Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Whether they could get access to that facility was one of the aspects they had considered.  Obviously it would need to be agreed with the facility in Northern Ireland.  It is a wonderful purpose built facility that provides a very good service.</p> <p>  With regard to Brexit we have not really been involved in that process.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate has its own view on the implications and on a hard border.</p></speech>

In my previous role, before I was lucky enough to take up this one, I oversaw the unit that was responsible for exchanging information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on suspects of sexual crime   I can reassure members that the information sharing was dynamic, very operational and practical based.  It was unencumbered by any concerns other than those of potential offending.  It was an excellent relationship covering everything from preventing the movement of people for sex tourism right through to those people who pose a risk to society.  It was a first-class operation.</p> <p>  On Brexit, I am aware that there is significant planning going on within policing to try to ameliorate any risks that arise around it.  I would not be up to date on where these are at this stage, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Were there any submissions by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate or has it been afforded the opportunity to make submissions if that is appropriate?  The witnesses can tell the committee if they believe this is not within the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  I contend that it would be a valuable input to have but I am curious to try and tease this out.  Much of this boils down to the mechanics and I want to steer clear of the bigger political dynamics at play, because we all know the difficulty therein.  I take Mr. Hume at his word about information sharing and if that is the case, when we get down to the nuts and bolts of this, we do not want anything to happen to damage or undermine this relationship.  The inevitable question is, if the information sharing is of such a high standard, what good is it if it is going to one of the bodies and not dealt with appropriately as evidenced by some of the problems the witnesses have identified with information sharing and other related matters within the Garda also.  I would like to get the other views on Brexit and the current status on information sharing.</p></speech>

We are about to go to Northern Ireland to meet our counterparts to talk about how we will work together in the future and what the implications are.  This is one of the items on the agenda for discussion.  We are very keen to do work with our counterparts.  When they do an inspection they quite often come to the South to look at issues here, and we go to the North, because it is the nearest border.  There is good learning to be had in both jurisdictions.  We want to maintain that relationship.  We are happy to give our professional advice.  One of the things the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate can do is provide advice and we should do it more often for the Policing Authority.  Recently the Minister asked us to look at entry levels and in this case we are giving advice to the Minister rather than an inspection.  We believe that our policing skills add value.  We also look for international best practice.  If a measure works very well somewhere else it might be possible to transfer to these shores and be implemented here.</p></speech>

We have met with the commission formally to do a presentation.  Ms Shields did this because I was at GSOC at the time.</p><p>We have been invited back to some of their subgroups, one of which was the subgroup on oversight.  Clearly they are looking at how the Department of Justice and Equality, GSOC, the inspectorate, the Policing Authority and other agencies will work together to deliver better oversight.  In January we kick-started an oversight forum with the Policing Authority and GSOC and hope to meet again next month.  The aim is to avoid duplication of activity, co-ordinate how we conduct inspections and look at what themes GSOC and the Policing Authority have picked up.  We need to develop our relationships with the other agencies.  It will be positive in moving forward.</p><p> I was asked if we were in danger and the answer is I do not know.  The commission will report in September and I hope we will continue to do what we do as the quality of our work speaks for itself.  However, we recognise that we are only as good as our last report, but we think we have done some quality work.  Other organisations have looked at things at which we have looked and not found additional items.  The Policing Authority has commissioned work to look at areas at which we have inspected previously and we have not been found wanting.  We identified a number of the factors which have ended up in tribunals and other areas.  Our view is that if those issues had been addressed at the time, some of the tribunals might not have been necessary.  We add value and would like to continue.  However, we recognise that we need to have a different relationship with the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

However, we have not found another jurisdiction around us that has put an inspectorate into a policing authority.  There is another issue.  Ms Shields is doing work and we are looking at areas in which the Policing Authority has responsibilities.  We could not self-inspect if that was the case.  As such, there are areas at which we are going to look in which GSOC takes people into Garda stations.  One has to have that independence.  For the Commissioner, the fact that we are independent has led to greater acceptance of the work we have given to the Garda.  My ex-boss used to say we had no dog in the fight and were there simply to make policing better in Ireland.  We are not aligned with any other organisation.  As such, it would be a shame if we were to lose our independence as it would damage the quality of our work.</p></speech>

The five-month delay in responding is interesting.  The last correspondence the committee received from the highest office in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was exactly five months after we had sought the information and, at that, it was anaemic.  I can think of no other word to describe it.  It is important to point out that the frustration is shared.</p> <p>  The inspectorate has conducted a review of child sexual abuse and issued a report.  The committee is also in the process of conducting a review of its own oversight and accountability report which Mr. Toland referenced in his opening remarks, for which I thank him.  There was only one recommendation that was specific to the inspectorate.  I again note that the committee is very strongly of the view that the inspectorate should have access by way of unannounced visits.  That is essential.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan did not ask Mr. Toland to elaborate on his second comment, but I would like him to do so.  He referred to the Private Members' Bill, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill, and the provision therein that ministerial approval would be required to exercise this power.  That would not be my view and I doubt it is the view of Deputy Mick Wallace.  I can almost anticipate from where he will come on the matter.  We share a disposition on many matters.  Would Mr. Toland like to elaborate a little on what he said?  This series of engagements with GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate is taking place against the backdrop of the publication of our report and I would like Mr. Toland to give a little more information on same.</p></speech>

It would enhance our abilities and mean that we would not have to make appointments to carry out visits.  We do not get the impression that our visits are always stage managed, but it is important to be able to go in and carry out real-time checks in certain areas.  If we were to get involved in inspecting places of detention, it would be a prerequisite.  One has to be able to turn up unannounced in that context.  In a response in Parliament the Minister has said he does not think his approval is required every time we want to make a visit.  It may just be the way it has been written, but to us, it seems impracticable that every time we wanted to make a visit, we would need ministerial approval which might be required if it was an issue of State security.  It might be something that would need to be considered if we were to go into an area to inspect very sensitive material.  However, we do not think we should need to seek ministerial approval in general before we visit a Garda division or region or most national units.  I am not sure it was intended to be drafted in that way, but that is very much how we have interpreted the Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>

On one of the first occasions on which we sought to visit Portlaoise Prison, some serious opposition was expressed in terms of what the hell those people were coming down for and the question was asked as to why the hell we were being let in.

Deputy Mick Wallace raised with them the recommendation made in the inspectorate's report on multi-agency specialist child centres.  Mr. Toland referred to two pilot projects to be undertaken on foot of that recommendation.  Was the inspectorate specific about the projects to be undertaken?  Was it just a recommendation that there be two or did the inspectorate have a wider view of the cities that should be involved or whether it should be a rural pilot project?  Were there other elements and dimensions to it other than a recommendation that there be two such projects?</p></speech>

I cannot remember if it was recommended that both take place in cities, but it was felt we should start in a city centre because travel would be easier and it would be easier to involve the strategic agencies.  I think it was envisaged that they would probably pilot the project in cities.  It was about bringing agencies together in a single location with all of the services a victim of child sexual abuse needed.  As far as I am concerned, existing facilities could be used while purpose-built facilities were being planned as that will take a period of time and require funding.  Children have to travel to the interview suite looked after by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the place where they can be medically examined.  They are separate locations and it is traumatic for a child to be brought from one location to another.</p><p>At the centres that we visited, the children are met immediately by professionals who explain exactly what will happen, which relieves much of the worry of parents.  They explain what the medical examination will involve.  What we found in the other jurisdictions we examined was that parents and guardians are more likely to agree to medical examination and to assist with a police investigation.  In Ireland, we found that parents are often put off by the explanation and quite often refuse to allow a child to be interviewed or medically examined.  As a result, the prosecution cannot proceed or is very unlikely to do so.  We believe the proposed approach would encourage parents to come forward and assist with an investigation, whereas under the current approach parents seem reticent about allowing their child to be examined and do not always allow their child to be interviewed.  That presents serious risks because the abuser is still a risk to other children.</p></speech>

However, I do not know if we would be able to extrapolate all of the critical information if both pilot projects were city based.  Different circumstances and realities apply in rural Ireland.  I have in mind travel time from various locations.  People in a city location would have easier access to a cluster of these centres than people where I am from. </p></speech>

From the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I welcome Mr. John Fitzgerald, principal officer with responsibility for legislation, licensing and property management.

Since 1834, when the first commuter railway in the world was opened in Ireland, railways have helped us to conquer space and time by bringing cities, towns and villages closer together.  They have always been very important to rural Ireland.  The committee decided to make consideration of rural transport and connectivity a priority in its 2018 work programme.  We have met representatives of the National Transport Authority.  A great deal of progress has been made in Dublin with light rail and there are plans for a metro.  We should not forget that there are many opportunities for investment in heavy rail throughout the island of Ireland, including some low hanging fruit.  Funding may also be available from the European Union.  I suggest we need to improve connectivity by designing intermodal nodes such as heavy rail connections at ports and airports.  One of the most important heavy rail projects in recent years was the restoration of the railway line between Galway, Ennis and Limerick as the first phase of the western rail corridor.  The line has increasingly frequently been closed for long periods as a result of groundwater flooding at Ballycar, probably due to climate change.  Groundwater flooding is not as well understood as other types of flooding such as river flooding, rainfall-related flooding or coastal flooding.  It seems to be particularly common in rural Ireland, especially in several western counties, including Clare, Galway, Longford, Mayo and Roscommon. The committee has asked Geological Survey Ireland which recently took over as the lead agency dealing with groundwater flooding for its advice on the causes of such flooding and how the risk of such flooding could be mitigated.  I understand there have been some successes in County Galway.  It is possible that these lessons could be learned in Ballycar.  </p><p> I ask the director of Geological Survey Ireland, Mr. Verbruggen, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

GSI, Ireland's national geoscience organisation, is a division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It has just under 100 staff, most of whom are geoscientists and technical specialists who operate from offices in the Beggars Bush area of Ballsbridge.  It carries out its role as a key knowledge centre and data repository with a library, archives and extensive digital data holdings.  It provides an extensive advisory service, particularly for local authorities.  It has a statutory role as a national archive and a consultee on planning in areas such as wind farm development, county development plans and foreshore licences.  In addition to supporting the Government and the local authorities, it provides data and advice for industry and researchers and acts as a project partner in all aspects of Irish geoscience, especially in European projects.</p> <p>  GSI carries out a number of major initiatives, in addition to the geological mapping of Ireland's bedrock and subsoil.  INFOMAR, Ireland&rsquo;s national seabed survey and marine mapping programme, is on schedule to complete the mapping of all Irish waters by 2026.  It is funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, managed by GSI and delivered jointly with the Irish Marine Institute.  GSI operates five inshore survey vessels.  The data collected are used to update national charting and support maritime policy and Ireland's marine plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  INFOMAR is globally acknowledged as a world class endeavour.  It has trained over 100 people in modern, high-tech seabed surveying methods.</p> <p>  Tellus is the national geological and environmental baseline programme which will complete its coverage of the entire island of Ireland by 2028.  There are two components to the acquisition of data through Tellus: airborne plane mounted geophysics mapping which records magnetics, electromagnetics and radiometric properties; and ground geochemical sampling of soils, stream sediments and surface waters.  The data generated improve our mapping and inform the agriculture sector in areas such as animal and plant health.  It underpins radon mapping which is conducted in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as peat mapping and environmental assessments.  As the programme involves flying at the low altitude of 60 m and aerial surveying, an extensive communications and outreach programme is carried out in advance.  All householders are leafleted and there is extensive direct consultation with owners of sensitive livestock.</p> <p>  Groundwater 3D is a major groundwater resources and protection characterisation project.  It is targeting high priority regional complex groundwater systems, including those where there have been pollution incidents or boil notices have been imposed on public or private drinking water supplies.  The programme builds on a long history of work in this area.  GSI has been instrumental in developing the groundwater protection schemes risk assessment methodology and providing national maps to enable planning and licensing authorities to carry out their functions with respect to groundwater protection.  The groundwater programme collaborates with Irish Water, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the local authorities, the Office of Public Works and other State and non-governmental organisations.  It supports the implementation of the water framework directive, the drinking water regulations and the nitrates directive through the provision of data and expertise.</p> <p>  In addition to the specific programme areas I have mentioned, GSI holds databases and carries out work across a range of geoscience areas, including minerals, aggregates and metals.  It is involved in geoheritage, for example, by supporting geoparks.  Its work on geohazards includes mapping of landslide susceptibility and ground motion.  It provides advice on tsunamis and volcanic ash.  It is also involved in geotechnical and urban geology.  Its extensive data holdings and maps are made available online for free via a suite of websites and digital platforms.  It also supports job creation through a dedicated business cluster programme, Geoscience Ireland, with assistance from Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  GSI also supports research through data, partnership and funding and regularly provides co-funding with Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council and EU programmes.  It helped to set up and is now supporting the Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geoscience which was established recently with support from Science Foundation Ireland and industry.</p> <p>  On groundwater flooding, GSI has developed particular expertise in understanding complex karst systems, including turloughs, which can be important conduits for pollution.  The climate change and flooding section of the 2016 programme for Government, under the heading of Turlough Systems, promises to "provide resources to the OPW to commission studies into individual problematic (prone to flooding) Turlough systems, if requested by a local authority or another relevant State agency".  GSI has been tasked with gathering historical and new information to deliver on this objective.  It has initiated a new dedicated groundwater flooding project in response to it.  It is working with and supporting researchers at Trinity College Dublin in the specific area of modelling the behaviour of complex turlough systems such as those in the Gort lowlands, building on previous studies.  The primary objectives of the project are to liaise with key stakeholders to provide technical input into proposed flood protection schemes; to install a temporary exploratory network to maximise data collection, with over 60 monitors having been installed to date; to establish permanent monitoring networks to provide long-term quantitative flooding data; to develop a methodology for improving groundwater flood hazard maps and real-time monitoring of groundwater flooding; to develop modelling and analysis methodology for estimating groundwater flood frequency, or the likelihood of flood events; and to assess the likely impact of climate change on groundwater flooding.  In 2018 GSI will deliver new groundwater flood maps to the OPW, as required, in the second implementation cycle of the floods directive.</p> <p>  The area of Ballycar affected by flooding is not listed as a turlough and is not one of the areas selected for monitoring by the programme in consultation with the local authorities.  GSI was not consulted on the railway development plans.  It received reports on the issue from the committee at the end of last week, followed by further updates yesterday.  Unfortunately, therefore, we have not had an opportunity to carry out a review of the information.  After GSI was contacted for information by the committee last month, it was able to download satellite data from the European Space Agency and create a visualisation of flood extents in the area in the time period of interest to the committee.  It has been provided.  My colleagues have put together a short presentation which provides some more details of our work in the areas of turlough flooding and the Ballycar visualisation.  They will go through it briefly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.839" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Owen Naughton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#C00300"><p>I will give an introduction to the nature and characteristics of groundwater flooding.  I will speak about how it differs from other forms of flooding and the influence it has on the flooding at Ballycar.  Historically, groundwater flooding has been relatively poorly understood and overlooked.  The standard of data on this form of flooding is very poor, especially by comparison with that on river flooding.  There are no established methods for risk management or frequency analysis of this kind of flooding.</p> <p>  Groundwater flooding in Ireland is strongly linked with geology.  It occurs mainly in the west in areas of pure well bedded limestone that are susceptible to a process known as karstification which occurs when limestone dissolves to form caves and conduits.  Such areas tend to have discontinuous or absent surface water drainage.  This means that it does not tend to be the case that there are continuous rivers draining rainfall out to sea.  Instead, the groundwater system plays an important role in drainage.  The movement of water through the landscape occurs mainly through the groundwater system, rather than through the surface water system.  Groundwater flooding tends to require sustained rainfall of relatively long duration.  Fluvial flooding tends to occur after hours, days or, in some cases, weeks of rainfall, whereas groundwater flooding tends to be caused by weeks or months of rainfall.  The documentation I have furnished to the joint committee provides some examples of this.  It includes three representative hydrographs for groundwater flooding.  As members can see, there is quite a range.  The red dot on the hydrograph shows where the annual peak takes place.</p><p>In terms of flood management, it is the highest level reached in any given flood season.  The top turlough responds quite quickly so the annual maxima is quite early in the season.  That is responding to rainfall in the order of two to three weeks.  We get a range of those from weeks, to two to three months, all the way to maybe six months.  </p><p> The second and third graphs show that the flood peak happens later in the season.  The flood extent in any given year is a function of the amount of rainfall that fell in the previous three to six months.  Ballycar appears to be in this range.  Flooding tends to occur due to sustained rainfall over months.  This also gives rise to the longer durations as it takes quite a while for flood waters to build up and it also takes quite a while for them to recede.  </p><p> The other element of complexity with groundwater flooding is that there tends to be a range of flood mechanisms.  This is the way in which a flood manifests.  Groundwater flooding is more related to volume than discharge.  In rivers, the flood is the peak discharge so it is the peak flow.  In groundwater it is more an accumulation of water.  It tends not to be flowing water; it is more hydrostatic water.  It is just a build-up of volume within the landscape.  We have developed some conceptual models for this.  The most common form of groundwater flooding in Ireland is the turlough.  These are topographic depressions in the landscape.  They tend to dry out during summer but during winter, because there is a discontinuous surface drainage system, there is not enough storage in the landscape.  What happens is excessive recharge is stored in these depressions so there is a build-up of flood water over the winter period which is then discharged back into the ground water system when the capacity becomes available.  In most years this would not present a flood risk but in some cases, in periods of extreme sustained rainfall events, it can pose a flood risk to surrounding areas.</p><p> Another flood mechanism of particular relevance to Ballycar is backwater flooding.  This is where there is point recharge, where a stream or river is discharging into the groundwater system.  Under normal conditions, the capacity of the groundwater system to drain this water away is sufficient not to cause an excessive build-up of floodwaters so there would not be a flood risk.  Under extreme circumstances, such as in the example in the second graph, there can be a large build-up of floodwater that can pose a flood risk.  What causes this is the balance between the rate at which water enters the sink and the rate at which it exits.  The rate at which it exits is a function of the size of the conduit draining it.  It can be a function of downstream hydrological conditions.  That is the most relevant groundwater flood mechanism with regard to Ballycar.</p><p> That is the background.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Dr. Ted McCormack.  The purpose of our programme is mainly to address the lack of historic data and provide more relevant information on how, why and when groundwater floods occur.</p></speech>

The project is a collaboration between Geological Survey Ireland and Trinity College Dublin.</p> <p>  One of the primary things we did early on was set out our monitoring network.  We have 60 monitoring stations in various flood-prone turloughs around the country.  These sites were chosen primarily if they were brought to our attention by a local authority or the OPW.  I should have said that 20 of these sites will be upgraded to telemetric status so they can be accessed online.  It is a work in progress.  Aside from those 60 stations, there are about 400 turloughs in Ireland.  We cannot put physical monitoring in all of them so we came up with a strategy for monitoring the turloughs that we do not have equipment at.  These ungauged catchments are important if we want to implement the second cycle of the EU Floods Directive.  To create our groundwater flood map of Ireland, we need the data from all these sites, both current data and historic data.  This is accessible by the Sentinel-1 satellite as part of the European Space Agency programme.  It offers good spatial coverage.  It is an all-weather day and night system.  It is systematic data collection so we get an image over Ireland four days out of every six.  It is good resolution which is useful for turloughs.  These satellites were operational during the 2015-2016 floods so we have good images of the worst flooding that occurred.  </p> <p>  I will show members an example of normal aerial imagery of Ballycar.  I will hopefully move to a video that works.  I will show the committee what Ballycar looks like during a summer from a synthetic-aperture radar image.  It is pretty blurry and that is due to the nature of the radar but it is still useful.  The video shows the 2015 floods as well as the most recent floods, both of which closed the railway line.  The ultimate output of the timed series of satellite images combined with topographic mapping is to pull out elevations of the flood in the image.  This image is our synthetic hydrograph of Ballycar flooding.  It is preliminary.  We are still working on it so the numbers are not perfect.  It gives us a good idea of how bad the floods were in 2015 and more recently.  </p> <p>  The reason we are collecting this data for everywhere is that we can apply hydrological models to them to start building long-term hydrological data.  If we have three years of synthetic satellite generated hydrographs, we can apply models to them using rainfall.  For as long as there is a rainfall record, we can go back and estimate 70 years of flooding in the turlough and how it operated and that gives us a grip on coming up with a one-in-100-year flood at the turlough.  That is useful for flood risk, climate change and conservation objectives.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.842" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fitzgerald" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation and for the opportunity to make this presentation on behalf of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Our Department has not had any central involvement in the various issues surrounding the flooding in the Ballycar area or the various engineering solutions being considered over the years to alleviate this problem.  While the Department does not have a decision-making role in the technical, funding, planning consents or environmental issues on any project that may emerge, should the committee wish, I am happy to outline, in so far as it may be helpful or relevant, how certain sites of nature conservation value are protected, the role of our Minister in nature conservation, as a prescribed body and also in environmental assessments.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, like all member states, Ireland is bound by the requirements of the EU nature directives.  The Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive are the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s nature conservation policy and establish the EU-wide Natura 2000 ecological network of protected areas.  These directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  These directives have in turn been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, the Planning and Development Acts and the Wildlife Acts.  In Ireland, there are some 439 sites selected for protection as special areas of conservation including Lough Gash turlough at Ballycar.  There are 154 special protection areas and 148 areas designated as natural heritage areas.  </p> <p>  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is the statutory authority for nature conservation in Ireland and also has a number of statutory functions, including that of a prescribed body or consultation body under various statutes, including the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>As such, the Minister may provide observations and advice to relevant public authorities on the implications of the activities they are regulating, which may have an impact on the built or natural heritage.  In this capacity, the Minister&rsquo;s role is not a decision-making one but rather to provide observations that may assist a consent authority in its consideration of the implications of a proposal for the environment and in its own statutory decision making role.  The Minister may also provide observations on the implications for the natural and built heritage of plans and programmes that public authorities may wish to undertake.</p><p> All public authorities, including the Minister, whose functions may affect nature conservation must exercise those functions in compliance with the habitats directive and the birds directive.  In that regard, public authorities are obliged to ensure that they do not undertake or adopt, or give consent to any party for, any plan or project that may adversely affect the integrity of a European site.  This is achieved through the appropriate assessment provisions set out in Article 6 of the habitats directive.  These provisions require that a screening for appropriate assessment of a plan or project for which an application for consent is received, or which a public authority wishes to undertake or adopt, must be carried out by the public authority.  The purpose of this screening exercise is to assess, in view of best scientific knowledge, if that plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on the conservation objectives of a European site.  If, following an appropriate assessment screening exercise, it cannot be excluded that the plan or project will not have a significant effect on a European site, this does not mean that the project or plan cannot go ahead.  Instead, the public authority concerned then undertakes an appropriate assessment before deciding if consent may be granted for the plan or project.  Having carried out an appropriate assessment, a public authority can grant consent for a plan or project where it determines that it will not adversely affect the integrity of a European site.</p><p> As regards Ballycar Lough catchment, the Department understands that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned RPS Group in 2010 to carry out a flood risk assessment of the Ballycar catchment and to undertake an assessment of flood alleviation options for Ballycar Lough.  RPS Group issued its report in 2011.  At the time, RPS Group consulted various bodies and stakeholders, including our Department.  Following this assessment and a review of the potential implications of the various options identified, the consultants put forward a preferred option for a variety of reasons.  RPS Group then carried out an appropriate assessment screening on that preferred option, identified in its report as Option 1C.  This option involved the construction of a pipe culvert along the underground section of the Ballycar Lough outflow channel.</p><p> The appropriate assessment screening report examined the impacts of the preferred option in terms of its potential impacts on the Natura 2000 sites in the area.  Lough Gash turlough special area of conservation lies within the study area and some other European sites also lie adjacent to or within a 5 km distance of the study area, and these Natura 2000 sites are the focus of the consultants' appropriate assessment screening report.  The report concluded that as the full scale and magnitude of potential impacts on Lough Gash turlough special area of conservation were, at the time, still to be determined and due to the sensitivity and importance of this Natura 2000 site, an appropriate assessment should be carried out regarding the preferred flood alleviation works.</p><p> We note that in its 2011 main report for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann RPS Group had outlined what it saw as the next steps to progress the project.  These steps included consultations with stakeholders, including the NPWS of our Department, public consultation and an information day, preliminary design of works, carrying out of an appropriate assessment and obtaining the necessary consents and planning approvals.  We in the NPWS are not aware of any initiatives or steps taken since the 2011 report was published; certainly, we have not been contacted since on the project and are not aware of any planning approvals being sought.  In the last couple of days, in the context of documents being made available for the meeting of this committee, it became apparent to us that the 2011 RPS Group report has been followed by a 2015 report.  The Department had not received or previously been made aware of this report but on request yesterday it was made available to us yesterday evening.</p><p> The Department fully appreciates the importance of this issue in this part of rural Ireland, as it appreciates the need to deal with flooding more generally around the country.  The Department, including through the NPWS, is more than willing to work with the proponents of any project in a constructive fashion on this matter, for example, with regard to the scope of any further assessments that may be required for any flood alleviation works that may be pursued.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their attention and I will try to answer any questions that may arise.</p></speech>

The OPW engaged constructively with both Clare County Council and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann over recent years in considering the flooding problem at Ballycar and participated in a working group on the matter convened by the council in 2014.</p> <p>  In 2011, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned a leading international firm in the area of flood risk assessment, RPS Group, to undertake a study of Ballycar Lough and its associated flooding.  However, the OPW had concerns about the solutions proposed in the 2011 RPS Group report, specifically that what was being proposed by way of drainage of the lough would involve discharging the flood waters downstream to an embanked area that experiences flooding occasionally, contains some critical low lying air traffic control infrastructure, was in part the subject of significant environmental designation and where discharges to the sea were subject to the tidal cycle.  The OPW identified that the proposals in the report would require some further mitigating measures not taken into account at the time.</p> <p>  The RPS Group report also did not include a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed flood relief works.  Proposed works on this scale could only proceed on the basis of an appraisal which indicated clear economic justification for spending in the order of &euro;10 million.  The estimated cost of raising the railway line was only marginally more than the cost of the flood relief works that were proposed.  However, when account was taken of the additional cost of further mitigating measures that would be required but were not covered in the report, the economic argument clearly tilted in favour or raising the railway line.  The OPW has been clear in its position that as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is the primary stakeholder and beneficiary from any proposals to resolve the flooding problem at Ballycar, it is for that body to take the lead in resolving the matter.</p> <p>  At a meeting of the working group in September 2014, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann confirmed its acceptance that it had the lead role in resolving the railway line flooding problem.  Following the meeting of the working group in 2014, RPS Group was requested by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to review its 2011 report.</p></speech>

The 2015 updated RPS Group report acknowledges the concerns raised by the OPW and, following an assessment of five flood alleviation options, proposes as its preferred option raising the existing railway embankment in the vicinity of Ballycar Lough.  RPS Group states that this preferred option has been chosen because it provides the least ecological impact on the special area of conservation, SAC, and other protected sites in the area, it does not increase flood risk elsewhere in the catchment, especially at the internationally important air control communications infrastructure, and it has the least negative effect on geology and hydrology in the area.</p> <p>  The OPW supports the finding and recommendations of the updated RPS Group report.  It is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to progress the proposed preferred solution of raising the railway line and to pursue the associated funding requirement through its normal channels for investment in its infrastructure.  It is to be noted that the estimated capital cost of the proposed solution is just under &euro;10 million and the benefit to cost ratio is calculated by the consultants at just &euro;400,000.  The proposed works, therefore, are not economically feasible.  I also note that as a result of the road raising works carried out by Clare County Council in 2015, all residential properties in the area now have access to their properties even in extreme flood events.</p> <p>  The OPW will continue to co-operate with Clare County Council and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in whatever way it can in this matter.  I thank the members for their attention and I am happy to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

The Newmarket-on-Fergus drainage district is one of the drainage districts within County Clare for which Clare County Council has a responsibility in a maintenance context.  This drainage district is part of the issue surrounding Ballycar but, as I said, we have a maintenance responsibility in respect of that drainage system.  We have had serious concerns over the years about the fact that the extent of flooding which occurs in this area goes above and beyond what normal maintenance requirements can facilitate.  Our concerns about the importance of finding a resolution to this problem have been repeatedly aired.  We have a flood alleviation role as a local authority in dealing with various flood alleviation issues as they arise here and there around the county, but this is generally in the context in which residential properties, business premises and so on are impacted, as distinct from this case, in which flooding has not been a major issue from a domestic flooding point of view.</p><p> We are available at all times, and always have been, to support the development and maintenance of key infrastructure such as the railway line which facilitates strategic access between Ennis and Limerick, the western rail corridor, etc.  We see ourselves as having a facilitation role and have always made ourselves available to facilitate the resolution of this issue in whatever way we can.  We have liaised in recent years with both the OPW and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in a bid to facilitate an appropriate strategy to deal with this problem.  The key meeting in this regard, which Clare County Council, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the OPW attended, was held in September 2014.  There was a clear understanding at that meeting that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann saw itself as the lead agency in the pursuit of a resolution to this problem, it being the key stakeholder.  Clare County Council's concerns until that time had related not just to the railway line, but also the fact that local roads in the area became inundated from time to time through flooding events which have evolved repeatedly over the years, with the result that access to a number of homes was cut off.  Clare County Council dealt with this issue in 2015 by the reconstruction of a local road to an elevated level in order that the homes in respect of which access was affected in those extreme flood events were facilitated in all circumstances.</p><p> As I indicated earlier, Clare County Council sees itself as a facilitator in whatever way possible to move this issue forward.  We remain available to facilitate in whatever way we can, whatever solution, whatever options, may be put forward in this regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#F00500"><p>Along with my colleague, Mr. Colin Hedderly, I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to attend to discuss the topics of flooding at Ballycar and opportunities for heavy rail investment.  Before I directly address the two issues, I will give the committee a brief snapshot of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann today - our services and service outlook for the future.  Our team of more than 3,800 colleagues maintains a network of just over 2,200 km of rail; operates 4,300 services each week; carries just over 900,000 customers per week, with numbers growing; operates 144 stations across the network; transports 100 million tonne-kilometres of freight by rail; and brings 2.3 million tonnes of freight and 900,000 passengers through Rosslare Europort annually, for which we are the port authority.  After an extraordinarily challenging decade, in 2017 we equalled our previous record number of customers at 45.5 million passenger journeys for the year, and 2018 will undoubtedly see a new record high.  Our funding shortfall, while not fully resolved, and while the accumulated impact remains, has been reduced significantly, and the commitment in the national development plan to bridge the shortfall completely by 2021 is very welcome as it will give us the foundation on which to play the fullest role possible in the future.  We are ambitious for our rail service and for how it can deliver solutions to congestion and environmental sustainability for Ireland.  I will address this further as we look at opportunities for heavy rail.</p> <p>  As chief executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as a former district manager in Limerick whose area of responsibility covered the Limerick-to-Ennis line and as a Clareman who lives close to Ballycar, I am acutely aware of the impact of recurring flooding at Ballycar on our customers and services.  We are all aware of the unique hydraulic constraints which have been identified in the Ballycar Lough catchment.  The underground section of the Ballycar Lough outlet channel is the main hydraulic constraint on the Ballycar Lough drainage system.  This restricts outflow and thus causes flow backup and flooding in the vicinity of the lough.  The Ballycar Lough catchment is a very slow response type catchment owing to the mild nature of the topography.  Diversion of the Rosroe Lough catchment flow to the Ballycar Lough catchment increased the flows in channels within the Ballycar Lough system.  The stream channels do not have adequate capacity to deal with the increased flow, and the inadequate capacity of the existing bridges and culverts located at various locations on the drainage system also restrict flow.</p> <p>  Without delving too much into history, it should be noted that while the railway line has been in existence and operational since 1859, no flooding was recorded prior to 1930, the year after the Rosroe Lough catchment diversion was undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  The 1930 flooding was the first of 17 flooding closures to have occurred since.  That five of these closures have taken place in the past decade illustrates how climatic factors are increasing both the frequency and severity of flooding, particularly as the line was raised by 0.7 m, or approximately 2 ft 6 in. in old money, in three separate works programmes between 1984 and 2000.  The most prolonged flooding event occurred from December 2015 to May 2016, with a peak flood level of 1.4 m over the rail, while the most severe in 2013 saw flooding peak at 1.9 m over the rail.  The flooding event earlier this year saw the line close for seven weeks from late January.</p> <p>  In 2011, following engagement with the Department of Transport, the OPW and Clare County Council, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned a study by RPS to examine potential flooding alleviation options.  The consultants and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann worked closely with the OPW in particular in undertaking the study.  The study, which has been provided to the committee, identified five potential flood alleviation options, numbered 1 to 5, with three flood flow discharge routes, A to C.  The optimum solution which, as well as alleviating flooding impacting on the railway line, ensures that flooding risks in other areas such as Newmarket-on-Fergus are not worsened was option 1C, namely a 1.5 m diameter piped culvert, with inflow to and outflow from Lough Gash via the existing inflow and outflow stream channels.  It is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's position that this approach should be pursued jointly with the OPW and Clare County Council, and that just as the railway is not the cause of the flooding, the solution is one that requires a more holistic approach than a focus on the railway line alone, given the potential impact on the wider catchment and the expertise of the agencies involved.</p> <p>  In the absence of progress on the optimum solution, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has identified an option of track raising which will reduce the probability of line closures.  The cost of this solution is in the order of &euro;10 million and involves raising the track by 1.2 m.</p><p>The proposal will not resolve the issue, however, and would merely reduce the frequency of flooding events to approximately a quarter of the current level and reduce the length of individual closures.  Therefore, the option is not as attractive as the optimal solution I have outlined, not to mention the potential worsening of flood levels as the impacts of climate change continue.</p><p> I will now discuss investment in the rail network.  Both the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, provide for significant rail investment and the expansion of our role in meeting the transport needs of Ireland over the coming decades.  While the NDP explicitly details funding of &euro;2 billion over a decade for what has been referred to as the DART expansion programme, this refers to the physical location of these works.  The benefits of this programme are national and network wide.  Put simply, it will allow us to operate more trains with more capacity on all radial routes on the national network.  It includes meeting the steady state maintenance and renewal requirements of the network by 2021; delivery of the national train control centre to maximise the capacity and performance of the existing network; non-tunnel elements of the DART expansion, including increasing the capacity of key rail corridors such as Cherry Orchard to Heuston station, which will benefit all Heuston intercity routes, and Maynooth, which will benefit the Sligo line; the targeting of improved inner-city journey times on the Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Cork and the Limerick and Galway routes, with knock-on benefits for Kerry, Westport and Waterford; enlargement of the rail fleet by 300 carriages to give network-wide benefit; further appraisals of projects such as the western rail corridor phases 2 and 3, Cork commuter rail and a high-speed Belfast to Cork, M3 Parkway and Navan line; and investment in park-and-ride facilities, rail station improvements, passenger information and accessibility enhancements.  These elements are all part of the plan.</p><p> The national planning framework is supportive of all that I have outlined and of further investment.  While it is silent on some aspects of the roll-out of rail, we must stress that we in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann view the strategy as very positive.  Railways, more than any other form of public transport, rely on critical mass and higher density population centres to provide the economic case for investment and societal benefits.  By developing strong cities as a counterbalance to Dublin, we will ensure that the development of railways in Ireland in the future is beyond Dublin-centric commuting, as critical as that requirement is.  As things stand, the existing network is underfunded, and we in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann must see the funding issue resolved before further network expansion can be considered where increases in the public service obligation, PSO, funding are likely to be required.  While previous studies have shown a weak business case for further regional rail lines to be opened, the renewal studies conducted as part of the NDP will definitively establish the position under the current Department of Finance investment guidelines.  In the meantime, nothing will occur that will prevent the development of railway lines should a business case support it.</p><p> I will now discuss greenways, which have generated considerable debate in many parts of the country.  Our position is that where there is no realistic medium-term likelihood of a rail line being reopened, greenways help to protect the rail alignment from encroachment and adverse possession by providing a public amenity on otherwise unused alignments.  In every case where we, along with CIE property, issue a licence for the operation of greenways on disused alignments, it is with the explicit provision that the alignment would revert to us should a decision be made to invest in the reinstatement of the railway.</p><p> I have outlined our position to the committee in terms of the agenda and welcome any questions on the issue.</p></speech>

It is important that we discuss and debate the issues of concern to committee members and, indeed, the wider public.  When we consider our national transport routes, whether they are motorways or rail networks, it is important that we acknowledge and identify where problems arise.  That is why we are discussing the issue of flooding at Ballycar in County Clare and how flooding has a negative impact on the Galway to Limerick railway line.  I am from Waterford which is in the south east, so this issue does not impact on me personally, but I have an overall interest in sustaining the national rail networks.  I supported Deputies and Senators when they sought this debate and asked the committee to invite the representatives that are here before us today.  I have no problem supporting them again.  I want to put it on the record that I am disappointed that some of the Deputies who promoted this issue are not present today for a debate, a fact that should be noted on the minutes of this meeting.</p> <p>  With regard to flooding on the Galway to Limerick railway line, I found the various submissions interesting.  I note that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned RPS Consultants to carry out flood risk assessments and to bring forward recommendations of which there were five in total.  As somebody who lives outside of the region but is an observer who is interested in sustaining the national rail lines, it seems to me that when State agencies are not directly responsible, while they will say they will facilitate, that they are available to assist and that they acknowledge the problem, unfortunately, when it comes to putting their hands in their pockets and dealing with the problem, they run a mile.  I am being blunt when I say that but that is what this looks like.  It is not in the national interest for the State agencies to do so.  I also say that directly to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Clare County Council and to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is experiencing a very real issue with a significant piece of our national transport infrastructure.  I am disappointed with the representatives of our State agencies, who represent our citizens who depend on them to act in their best interests.  The answers and submissions are now on the public record and sound like these people have washed their hands of the problem.</p> <p>  Five recommendations have been made and the optimal solution was put forward by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I am disappointed by the silo mentality that has become apparent straight away, and we have seen this happen with many issues of public concern.  The attitude adopted is one where if it is not my problem, it is someone else's problem, I will give it lip service, I will talk about it, I will offer my help, I will offer to facilitate, but when it comes to dealing with it and putting my money where my mouth is, it is not my problem.  Essentially, there is no solution.</p> <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann wants to invest &euro;10 million in raising the railway line but I believe that is not a good way to spend taxpayers' money.  I am sure the company could find a lot better ways to invest that &euro;10 million such as promoting more use of rail services.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann depends on the assistance of other agencies and the assistance of the State.  I am disappointed with the replies that I have heard from the various agencies.  They will walk away, which is their right from today, as it is not their direct responsibility, but the problem will remain.  Until the next flood arises and citizens kick up again and flooding becomes an issue of public awareness, the agencies will make statements and repeat the cycle but the problem will remain unresolved.  It is important that we have had this debate because we have been afforded an opportunity to hear the witnesses' replies and put them on the record.  There is no point in beating around the bush.  The problem is not resolved.</p> <p>  I will take the opportunity to deal with some other issues.  I mentioned the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is important that the delegation is here.  I wish to acknowledge the organisation's important statutory role in the protection of our natural heritage and conservation.</p> <p>  During flooding events in the area that I represent in the south east, and I refer to where the River Suir and its catchment area experienced serious flooding, I detected poor co-operation from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I saw farmland flooded and people being put out of their homes due to flooding.  When attempts were made to repair the riverbanks, however, all that the National Parks and Wildlife Service meted out was bureaucracy, licensing and planning issues.  These issues are not a primary concern when somebody is on their knees, and I mean farmers who had their land and property flooded and who were forced out of their homes.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service can rightly point to EU directives, national policy and all the rest, but I am talking about a time when citizens have had to leave their homes and land due to flooding.  All those citizens want to do is repair a breach in a riverbank, yet they are read the riot act about bureaucracy.</p> <p>  Rather than trying to gain stakeholders' support for conservation and the protection of habitats etc., which we all should try to achieve, all I know from being a public representative for the past 20 years is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service has gone the wrong way about things.  If we want to garner support for conservation and protection, we need to engage with stakeholders in a proactive way, identify their problems and show empathy when people experience problems.  When a family have been forced out of their home due to flooding, they do not want to hear about bureaucracy, directives and rules.  All they want to hear are solutions.</p> <p>  This is not the way that national agencies should work towards solutions.  Rather than bureaucracy and orders, we should consider engagement, solutions and protocols in times of an emergency.  I mean instances where directives and orders may be circumvented in the event of an emergency so that a breach on a riverbank can be repaired, thus getting people back into their homes.  If that is done, then State agencies will receive great support from local communities.  I would like the witnesses to respond to my comments.</p><p>We are here to talk about solutions to flooding problems, but there is not a solution in every case.  We all know and have to accept that there are flood plains, but there are practical solutions to difficulties where citizens are impacted on, whether on a railway line, a farm or in a house, and we should all work towards them.  </p><p> One of the best ways to travel is by rail.  It is peaceful and a person can work or engage in good conversation while travelling.  It is also very safe.  I do not believe, however, that we are doing enough to promote rail travel.  I see the odd advertisement on television, but the benefits are not being sold to the younger generations.  Older people have used rail services far more than young people.  One could point to the motorway network and the increased use of cars.  Every young person now has a car.  Every family possibly has two or three cars, especially in rural Ireland, but if Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann sold the benefits of rail travel better, there would be increased use, even during a trial period.  It needs to do more in that regard. </p><p> Does Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have plans under the new national planning framework, Ireland 2040, to invest more?  Mr. Meade spoke about enhancing routes from Dublin to various cities.  He said "improved inter-city journey times will be targeted on the Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Cork and the Limerick and Galway routes."  As somebody who comes from the city, I am very disappointed that Waterford is only mentioned as an afterthought, with County Kerry and Westport.  According to Ireland 2040, the population of the city is expected to double from almost 50,000 to 100,000.  I would not, therefore, have expected Waterford to be an afterthought.  As one of the five cities identified in the national planning framework, I expect it to be a priority.  I, therefore, urge Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to upgrade what I have just read from the submission to ensure Waterford will be a high priority.  There are huge plans for the redevelopment and regeneration of the entire north quays and Plunkett Station.  CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are co-operating with the various stakeholders in moving the plans forward.  Waterford has to be a priority.  As it is just 20 years away, we need to plan now for the priorities identified in Ireland 2040.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has huge responsibilities in that regard.  I would like to hear responses to my questions. </p><p> Rosslare Europort has been mentioned.  I understand Waterford Port is one of the only ports in the country where the railway line passes directly through the port, next to where ships berth.  It is essential that there be investment to take some of the heavy freight off the roads and use the rail infrastructure which I believe is an asset to deliver freight from elsewhere in the European Union and around the world to Waterford Port and Rosslare Europort, if necessary, and redistribute it throughout the country through the rail network.  I would be interested in hearing a response on this point.</p><p> I welcome the co-operation of CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on greenway development.  It is a huge area of growth.  In County Waterford we have seen the advent of the Waterford city to Dungarvan greenway, one of the biggest tourism success stories we have had.  There were challenges in and barriers to getting back land that had originally been part of the railway line and which had been taken over by landowners.  By way of the proactive approach taken by Waterford City and County Council and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann solutions were found.  They did not just walk away as we are doing today.  It took almost ten years to find solutions, but they were found and the council made it happen.  The citizens who reside in the area are very grateful; the landowners who were engaged with are happy, while the many thousands of tourists who come from all over Ireland and beyond are also very happy.  I encourage continued engagement in that respect and a positive perspective.  Does Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have a formal protocol in dealing with greenways, learned from other experiences, that it can adopt and adapt for use in other areas?</p><p> I am sorry for going on a little, but it was important to outline many of my views and there was an opportunity to do so this morning.  We all have a responsibility to deal with flooding.  Politicians are often left to carry the baby when the crises happen.  We look to the State agencies for help.  We do not expect them to look the other way just because it is not their direct responsibility.  We expect them to come to the table to find solutions and work with all stakeholders in finding them.</p></speech>

In rail terminology we think of the radial routes.  Westport is not on a secondary route; it is off the Galway route.  That is the layout.  I am glad that the Senator mentioned the Plunkett Station development which we see as very exciting.  We are very involved in and supportive of it.  We have recently done some major work in Kilkenny in resignalling.  It is on the Waterford line.  We treat all lines equally and want to continue to grow services and achieve journey time improvements on all routes.  There is no question of Waterford not being on a par with other cities.  It absolutely is.</p> <p>  Rosslare Europort is under our direct control, whereas Waterford Port is not.  Our general manager responsible for freight is in constant communication with Waterford Port and, with Brexit on the horizon, considering how the two ports can contribute in the long term.  It is on our agenda with our commercial people and freight manager.  </p> <p>  We have a protocol for greenways and are actively engaging with any group that wants to discuss or consider the provision of greenways because they are a way of protecting our alignment and protecting us from encroachment or adverse possession which we have had going back decades.  Reference was made recently in a different conversation, outside this building, to the Harcourt Street line having been in State ownership and going out of it and how it had taken a lot of work to bring it back into it.  We recognise that mistake from the past and will not be relinquishing ownership of any route.  They will all be protected and if greenways are the way to protect them, that is what we will do.  If in time there is a business case to go back to providing rail services, we will be building this into the greenway licence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.860" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fitzgerald" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#H00300"><p>I am not aware of particular circumstances on the River Suir or what happened there.  The Department is not responsible for planning or whatever licences are involved.  Throughout the country many of our regional management staff were first on the ground with the other agencies to try to help people find solutions.  Our aim on those occasions was to put people first.  There may sometimes be sense in assessing emergency works.  It is possible that they could have effects on other communities downstream and it is often worthwhile carrying out some assessment of what is proposed to ensure they will not.  The Department has been working very closely with other agencies in the meantime, for example, the Office of Public Works on its catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  We have been as proactive, helpful and co-operative as possible.</p> <p>  We will continue to work within our statutory functions.  On emergency works to relieve flooding, we have put the details of liaison officers in each area in the country on our website.  People or agencies that have concerns can contact the regional staff who will be available to deal with them and co-operate in whatever way they can.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government co-ordinated an emergency response protocol between various agencies and the National Parks and Wildlife Service will work with them.  It has been a question of people first.  As I said, I am not aware of what happened on the River Suir or that we have to any extent put barriers in the way of emergency flood relief works.  In Ballycar we will work within our statutory remit to do what we can.  We do not have funding to carry out these infrastructural works.</p><p>However, we will do what we can to help in such situations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sydenham" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#J00200"><p>As Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned, the OPW has undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the flood risk countrywide, culminating in the recent launch of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which is a ten-year, complex programme involving the development of approximately 150 projects, incorporating 118 new projects as well as existing projects in the pipeline.  When complete, it will have protected approximately 95% of the properties in the country that are at risk.  We are working hard on the problem of flooding nationally.</p> <p>  The Ballycar problem is a slightly unusual one insofar as it relates to a particular aspect of the catchment, that is, the rail line.  While it sounds harsh, that is not cost effective in an economic sense.  I accept that there are broader issues and I appreciate the concerns in that regard and the importance of rail.  In developing CFRAM, we had to examine quite a number of areas countrywide where there were properties at risk.  After assessing the pros and cons of possible solutions, any project that did not pass a certain threshold in terms of economic viability - the benefit-to-cost ratio, BCR - was not one that we could progress.  There is an economic reality to which we must adhere.</p> <p>  That said, we work extensively with bodies countrywide.  It is in everyone's interest to work collaboratively in attending to flooding problems.  Even though there are many matters that are effectively not our job, we will do everything we possibly can to work with local authorities and other agencies on attending to serious problems.  Everyone working in the field of flood relief and flood risk management sees the devastating impact on communities, which is problematic and recurring, so it behoves everyone to work together.</p> <p>  There has been an emphasis on the 2011 RPS report.  After assessing the five possible solutions, the revised report that was published by the same consultants in 2015 recommended raising the rail line.  That is an important consideration.  When they are looked at, there is a solution to most problems.  Senator Coffey asked who would pay for this if it came down to a simple issue of funding.  There is more work to be done collectively to find a solution, as there are differing views in the room this morning.  We need to be clear on what can be done to fix this, what is the best approach and from where the funding will come.  It is a piece of infrastructure and there are well-tried methodologies for obtaining funding to invest in infrastructure, which is an important criterion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.863" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#J00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The year 2011 was mentioned.  I am not from the area in question, but I am well aware of the problems experienced by people who have travelled on that line in recent years.  I am looking across at the witnesses, where one side of the State is telling the other side what it cannot do.  Were they in the private sector, they would not have jobs.  If one cannot deliver, one will not have a job.  Senator Coffey pointed out how one crowd will write to the other telling it that doing something is not "cost effective", which I have just heard from the OPW.  The west does not deserve a train line because it is not cost effective.  The OPW is considering how many houses there are in an area.  I know how it analyses cost effectiveness.  The number has increased slightly in some areas.  However, we are talking about the bigger picture.  This is about the tourism on which Clare, Galway and Limerick are relying.  This is about the west.  Do we just want to shut the train track down?  It looks like that will happen.</p> <p>  We have been looking at the same problem for seven, eight or ten years.  No one else would still be looking at a problem after so long.  Nothing is being done because, given what has been said, no money will be forthcoming from the OPW.  Five different solutions have been examined.</p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the NPWS helping.  Given the loughs and turloughs in the area, any farmer, council or State body undertaking work must adhere to 34 types of permit.  This even affects private property, which is a burden the State has placed on owners because of EU regulations.  The 5 km up the road and the environment were mentioned, but we should be discussing the people in the area and those who travel on the train line.  They come first in my book regardless of the EU or statutory obligations.  The term "statutory obligations" is used time and again.  The first thing we are elected to do is represent the people of an area and solve problems.</p> <p>  It will cost &euro;10 million to raise the track, but Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann does not have that money and there is no point in saying it does.  Debt has been taken on in respect of Lough Funshinagh and elsewhere in County Roscommon, but we want solutions.  Four or five years ago, two of us went to a field with diggers and dug through the night.  Fair play to the council in Galway.  We opened a drain all the way down to a river.  From that day on, 10 km of flooding was solved.  We did that work voluntarily because it would not have been done quickly enough otherwise.  It was piped and done.  Why can the NPWS not install a pipe that would take the overflow?  It could then worry about the environment while ensuring that enough water was held.</p> <p>  Due to the hen harrier, many parts of the country are drowned because we cannot clean drains and alleviate flooding.  Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the NPWS being helpful, but he should go to Connemara in County Galway and see the problems being caused on its roads.  The NPWS objected to them being widened.  When the council opened a drain on a road that was flooded, the NPWS rang up to tell the council to close it again because it was a suck-all SAC.  Am I correct in saying that there is not an individual statutory instrument in respect of every SAC?  I followed the situation in question tightly.  It was a site of community importance.  My understanding is that at least half of our SACs are not actually SACs.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Tiernan from Clare well in his retirement.  He said that he and the council would help in any way and that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was the main stakeholder.  Of course it is - it has the train line.  However, does that benefit Clare, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere in the west?  Do we want to shut the line and, as per usual, say it was causing problems and that the people can either go to Dublin or jump on a plane at Shannon and leave the country?  From what I have read and heard, we have been dealing with a bit of a flood for eight years.  When there was flooding in Athleague, we voluntarily used our own diggers to solve problems.  There were no papers, meeting after meeting, environmental impact assessments, appropriate assessment screening reports and so on, as we would have been told by the NPWS to go through the imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROP process, which would have taken four more years and seen the can being kicked down the road.</p> <p>  This is about solutions and someone making a decision quickly.  There are five options.  If the recommended one cannot be afforded, then it is gone.  It is as simple as that.  Will the Government provide &euro;10 million to raise this track?  Would it be good value for money?  Culverts in various areas were mentioned.  Could a pipe be placed along the line?  Would that help a larger catchment area?  The pipe could be laid at a height that would not damage the environment because a trapdoor can be placed on any pipe to let out as much water as desired.</p><p>However, no one will make a decision.  Everyone will say that we cannot do that but there is no solution as to what we can do.  At the end of the day, we will keep reading in the newspapers or hearing on the "Nine O'Clock News" that the line is blocked.  We are trying to get balanced regional development, to get people to live and work in Clare and the west of Ireland and to get businesses to set up there so that people can go to work.  Government after Government and the great EU, that devised all these regulations, talk about public transport.  From what I have listened to today, the flora and fauna, birds or whatever else is more important than a person.  If that is the way things have gone, by God our country has gone wrong.  This happening countrywide.</p><p> Business people around the country are afraid to go near certain areas because of the amount of designation.  They are closed off.  A circular - it is not even a law - has been sent to every council from the NPWS to set a 15 km buffer zone around an SAC.  I can be contradicted on this if I am wrong but I have been met officials from Galway County Council, Roscommon County Council and so on.  The 15 km buffer zone is in case the integrity of a site might be damaged.  If we want to go by the book then every part of the west of Ireland will be caught in that.  </p><p> I address my next comment to Mr. Meade who talked about greenways.  I am fully in favour of greenways and rail services but he mentioned a greenway or a rail line not being upgraded or opened in the "medium" term.  What does he mean by "medium" term?  I would like a straight answer because I spoke to him earlier on and I found him a straight talking person.  I do not want anyone saying it is the NTA's problem.  It is and it will give the money.  Having read the rail review, etc., does Mr. Meade believe the Galway-Athenry-Tuam section will open the medium term?  There is wording in Government documents, and everyone is saying everything at the moment and dancing around in circles but no one is cutting to the chase to say one way or the other.  It is a good to know if a person is going to be told today or tomorrow.  We need to be told directly if this will be opened in the medium term or will it go beyond that?</p></speech>

The medium term is five plus years.  We have a plan to which I referred in my opening statement.

It is relevant that when RPS Group carried out the work, it identified one option as being the most likely to enjoy success.  It was suggested, as I mentioned earlier, that an appropriate assessment should be carried out on the Lough Gash SAC.  However, there were five other SACs in the area and the company concluded that it would have no affect on those areas.  Not every SAC within 5 km, therefore, is affecting every single project.  I can understand sometimes that there may be frustration around the country with the various existing laws.  I cannot apologise for the NPWS following its statutory role.  That is the role the Government has given us.</p> <p>  I do not know if there is a narrative suggesting that the NPWS is against everything.  That is an unfair portrayal of what happens on the ground.  For example, the service is a statutory consultee under the planning process.  More than 3,500 applications were referred to us last year by planning authorities for comments and observations.  In those cases, the Department did not lodge any appeals on nature conservation grounds against any of the decisions of the local authorities in those cases.   Of all of the applications received in the Department through natural and built heritage last year, recommendations were given to the planning authority that permission not be granted in seven cases out of the 3,500 referred.  None of those cases related to the NPWS.  They related to the built heritage.  In 2018, to date, approximately 1,800 projects have been referred to us for our observations and we have not recommended a refusal in any case.  I just wanted to put those statistics on the table as well.</p></speech>

Some projects may have implications farther down the line than 15 km, for example, such as a development that is upstream of an SAC.  That could well have implications for the SAC regardless of the distance.  Each case has to be examined on its own merits.</p></speech>

There is a general appreciation that something needs to be done.  It can appear frustrating for people at times with multiple agencies involved.  There is a fundamental issue with Ballycar.  We have had conversations around various options and what the solution might be.  Some have challenges relating to the railway line and others do not.  There needs to be clarity on what is being recommended, on how that gets delivered and what is involved in doing that.  We then come to the issue of who funds that.  There is further work to be done.  We discussed reports from 2011 and 2015.  People will wonder what has been happening since then, where are we with this, what happens next and what is the solution.  We need to look at that in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-23a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018052300002#K01800"><p>I welcome the officials and thank them for their presentations.  However, I broadly concur with some of the comments made by my colleagues, Senator Coffey and Deputy Fitzmaurice.  We all experience frustration dealing with bureaucratic bodies.  That is the perception of the witnesses' organisations.  Rather than engage with stakeholders or affected persons in a practical way, much of the time agency personnel clothe themselves in the armour of bureaucracy.  I could give a multitude of examples after 35 years as an elected representative.</p><p> I do not know anything about the flooding in County Clare, but listening to the discussion about it brings to mind the flooding of Westmeath from the Shannon, which was heartbreaking.  In 2000, I brought forward legislation which sought to get all of the organisations talking to each other.  All of the agencies are working in silo, like cocks crowing on their own dunghill.</p><p> The CFRAM report is an excellent document, in respect of which I salute the OPW.  It is well drafted.  It is an iconic document on which the OPW is to be commended.  In my experience, getting a practical response from some of the agencies is as rare as a white blackbird.  When I was a member of Westmeath County Council, Jim Hearn, the county engineer, was always trying to come up with solutions, but when it came to getting a response from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, one had a better chance of winning the lottery.  When it came to proposing solutions to road issues, for example, taking a piece of land from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the process was mind-boggling.  The agencies need to buck themselves up and accept that they are public servants working on behalf of the public.  They need to treat the public as their paymasters.  We have had enough of them passing the buck.</p><p> As I said, I know nothing about the problem being discussed today but this has all the hallmarks of passing the buck.  We were told earlier by the witness from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, that he only received most of the documentation required for this meeting late last night, which is desperate.  The 2011 RPS Consulting Engineers report included no cost-benefit analysis.  A first-year student would know that such analysis is vital.</p><p> In regard to the work done by Clare County Council, county councils can be a little obstructive at times but generally they can be brought around because local authority members require to be elected every five years so they can be held to account.  The local authority executives know they have to run a show but they generally come around to practical solutions.  I have no doubt that Clare County Council will rise to the occasion.</p><p> In September 2014, the OPW, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Clare County Council came together on the issue.  In 2015, they had another run at it, yet in 2018 the issue has still not been resolved.  As stated by Deputy Fitzmaurice, this is unacceptable to those who are being flooded and cannot access their homes and so on.  There are all sorts of emergencies, which we are hearing about constantly on "Liveline" and "Morning Ireland".  The agencies need to get their act together.  The Ballycar problem tallies with what I have experienced.  Many ordinary Joes and elected members have been dealing with flooding issues for many years and they have good ideas on how to address them.  Many years ago, we had small stone drains.  There was many a good job done by people who did not have expertise or a list of letters behind their names.  We sometimes need to listen to ordinary people because they often have the solution to the most complex problem.  I am flabbergasted but not surprised that eight years on this problem has not been resolved.</p><p> I would like to deal now with rail issues.  I note Mr. Meade is new to his position and I wish him well.  I am an advocate for public transport provision.  I know that, as in the case of hospitals, it is not possible to have light rail at every corner.  People travelling to Dublin from Mullingar, however, benefit indirectly from light rail transport.  It is to be hoped the issue around Luas provision at Maynooth will be sorted out soon.  I would like to be able to leave my car at home and travel to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann via light rail transport.  The Dublin local authority wants a ban on cars in the city centre, but that is a nonsense without proper connectivity.  At what point will I be able to connect to the Luas to get to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  Theory must complemented with practical solutions.</p><p> When it comes to heavy rail infrastructure, what is proposed in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, and the national planning framework sounds great.  The Sligo-Edgeworthstown-Mullingar-Enfield-Maynooth to Connolly Station route is one of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's busiest.  I travelled on this line many times 35 years ago when I was studying law in Dublin and I regularly took part in the so-called guess the breakdown station competition.  Every winter I could be certain that the train would break down at the Hill of Down.  My wife also travelled on this line when she was going to the health centre in the Croke Park area.  It was horrendous.  From November to March each year this service was a disaster and it left a sour taste in people's mouths.  In fairness, the service has improved but more needs to be done.</p><p> We need more carriages.  I note it was mentioned that 300 carriages will come on stream over the next number of years.  A good share of them is required for the Sligo-Longford-Mullingar-Maynooth to Connolly service.  As the Chairman will be aware, people do not mind standing an odd time but in general people paying a weekly or monthly fee want to sit down.  Some people do some work on the journey to Dublin.  We have a huge migration from west to east, unfortunately.  If IDA Ireland did more work for the west, people would not have to travel east for jobs.  People need to be properly accommodated in terms of seating and I appeal to the witnesses to ensure it is provided.</p><p> I am a supporter of greenway development.  I was one of the first people to get involved in the restoration of the Royal Canal from Spencer Dock to the Shannon.  I am delighted with the Athlone-Mullingar greenway.  It is being well used.  However, there is a huge lack of commonsense when it comes to the rail structure between Mullingar and Athlone.  Mullingar is akin to the capital of Westmeath and Athlone is a huge industrial belt in Westmeath.  There has been mass migration of students to Athlone Institute of Technology.  People from Athlone come to Mullingar to attend the Midland Regional Hospital and for various other reasons.  The railway structure from Mullingar via Castletown and Streamstown to Athlone is in pristine condition.  There is a rail connection between Athlone and Galway and Athlone and Tullamore.  There is also a rail connection from Athlone to Dublin, yet there is no connection between Mullingar and Athlone.  Every time it is suggested it is rejected.  It is included in the Westmeath County Council county development plan.  The greenway has been developed.  It runs alongside the railway line and would not interfere with a rail service.</p><p> I will give another example.  I am sure Deputy Fitzmaurice will go mad when he hears it.  The area of east Westmeath has exploded.  Kinnegad, Killucan, Raharney, Milltownpass, Rochfortbridge and The Downs have exploded in population.  A huge number of people could access the train at Thomastown.  There is an area at this location where the train could pull up.  Currently, every train that passes it has to pull up to allow the train coming in the other direction to pass.</p><p>A local businessman, Mr. Shay Murtagh of Riverdale, was prepared to put in money to help as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, like everybody, was down in the dumps during the recession.  Mr. Meade knows who I am talking about.  We acknowledge that.  Mr. Franks knew about this and he was positive and kind of saw the benefit.  It would cost approximately &euro;500,000.  The company would have had to run more trains but it would have been environmentally friendly and people would have had to park their cars.  There are people willing to deal with the company over bits of land to make sure parking would be available.  It is common sense.  With a gobdaw like me suggesting this solution, one might say, "He is half loony, he knows nothing."  That is fair enough but many other people far smarter than me are also looking for this.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Denis Leonard, was a councillor out there.  He is a guy with an interest in the environment and he was absolutely on fire about this.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, promised on floor of the D&aacute;il in December 2016 to come down but I have never had sight or light of him.  It was a solemn commitment given on the floor of the D&aacute;il to come down to see it.  Mr. Meade knows about it and somebody has tipped him off about it.  It is an example of the type of frustration felt by people.  The company could make a major contribution to getting more people to use its service by advertising the rail links.  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice and although it is not my bailiwick, I go to Westport and its environs.  There is a large tourism element in this and people love travelling by train.  If they get to Westport, they can go on the bike trail for as long as they like, as some of my relations do.  It would all contribute to the economy.  Despite being "culchies", as many people call us, we should not be put on the back burner.  We are entitled to respect and we pay our taxes.  We contribute a fair bit to the economy.  We might not have the population levels of cities but we might if we got the same level of infrastructure development and accommodation that everybody else gets.</p><p> I am concentrating on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann this morning and I thank the Chairman for allowing me to do so.  I heard good things about Mr. Meade and I was delighted he got the job.  The company had a few issues and dealt with them.  As a Labour Party representative, I ask him to always look after the working people on the railways and on buses.  If he does, it will pay him well.  The Minister must have bitten his tongue while saying he would be prepared to have a share option with workers.  Hear, hear.  The entire matter has somersaulted.  The workers play a positive role in ensuring transport in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  They have taken many cuts over the years and they made a contribution to sustaining services.  The company should play a positive role and explore every option to ensure they see decent standards as well.</p></speech>

There is some good news for him and as part of the development plan we are starting with the Maynooth line on the Sligo road.  As the Deputy rightly points out, it is an area that has seen much growth even in the past decade, during the recession.  There are big numbers coming on to it.  Our priority for electrification is to develop that route.  I can confirm we have already started the process for a new fleet and we recognise that fleet capacity on the network is a key matter.  We have started the process for the 300 new carriages I referred to in my opening statement and it will take a couple of years for the wheels to start turning and earning their keep on the ground.  The service certainly needs to grow.  To be upfront and honest, there is still no plan to reopen the line between Mullingar and Athlone.  It may be looked at in future but certainly in the current national development plan-----</p></speech>

Thomastown station is ready and trains just have to pull up there.  I would appeal for a bit of investment.

It would mean Mr. Meade would make a great start to his tenure as chief executive.</p></speech>

Higgins, lived in Ballycar and was raised there.  He lived very close to the rail line we are discussing.  It is the next parish to me, Newmarket-on-Fergus.  It is a long-standing issue and as I understand it, over the past ten years, the railway line has been flooded six times.  I have raised this, as have many other public representatives in Clare, and absolute frustration has been expressed today by all the members here.  Standing back to look at this, nobody wants to grasp the nettle or take responsibility.</p></speech>

There is a willingness to try to deal with this and everyone feels every agency could have an input.  In fairness to the Office of Public Works, there is frustration and we want clarity on what solution should be put in place.  There must be an agreement between all agencies and a decision on who will pay for this.  Could each agency make a contribution towards a solution?  Why does it have to be one agency above another?  This is about County Clare, the west of Ireland and the attractiveness of the mid west.  It is about commuters, whether they are working or going to college or school, and tourists.  This really takes from County Clare.  Every year the railway line is closed for an extended period, which is just not good enough.</p> <p>  The pass the parcel approach that has gone on for the past ten years must stop.  Through the former county manager in Clare I proposed some years ago that a working group be set up.  When that happened, there was a bit of engagement but it has now been parked.  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice on calling in the agencies again in six months.  They could then have some solution worked out with a recommendation on how it would be funded.  I ask each agency to reflect on these deliberations and recognise that a solution must be found.  This infrastructure is important and it is just not good enough for it to lie idle for months on end, as occurs far too frequently now.</p> <p>  There is a section of rail line with a speed restriction from Ballybrophy.  Is there an intention to try to address that?  I advocate the need for a spur from the Limerick-Ennis line to Shannon Airport.  I know some work has been done on a proposal for that.  It would complement the infrastructure that we have at Shannon.  An alternative to that would be a regular commuter bus to bring passengers from the airport to Sixmilebridge station.</p><p>Frequency needs to be improved.  Adding another service to improve the frequency on the Limerick-Ennis line was also discussed earlier.</p></speech>

Currently, all we are doing with the Ballybrophy rail line is maintaining it as is until we get a definitive decision from the Department and the NTA on its future.  It is part of the rail review that was done and we are just awaiting a decision on that.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct that the airport study was done.  I was involved in it in a former life and a former role and a route was identified for that.  Clare County Council is preserving that route.  That was the decision at the time.  It was costly because of the terrain it goes through.   It has not been advanced in more than a decade since it was looked at.</p> <p>  With regard to the commuter bus, I respectfully suggest that we need to sustain the Ennis-Limerick line by understanding how we prevent the flooding.  We will then talk about expanding the service on it but there are opportunities to do so and I fully support that.</p></speech>

At the time there appeared to have been an impasse that needed to be overcome.  We felt that it was overcome by virtue of the fact that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann took on the report that had been prepared by RPS Group in 2011.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann ran with it and reviewed it based on comments and observations that had been made on the report, in particular by the OPW.  The points were taken on board and the revamped report emerged in August 2015 with the recommendation in favour of the raising of the railway line, as distinct from a drainage solution, which had been proposed in the previous report.  I can understand why it was not the most palatable solution in the world, due to the cost-benefit ratio when it was isolated from everything else, and because of all the various points that the members have made.  It is understandable when the cost-benefit ratio of 0.4 or thereabouts.  A little persuasion or cajoling is needed in those circumstances.  Clare County Council will not be found wanting in terms of whatever way that can be facilitated.  The chief executive officer is not present but I am sure I can speak on his behalf with regard to a willingness to re-engage and to up the ante to move this issue forward.  Mr. Leahy and I will give a commitment to try to reinitiate that approach.</p></speech>

What is the view on that?  I understand it is up to the NTA but Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has an input into that.  Does Mr. Meade believe it to be an unwise decision?   Would it be fair to say that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is more in favour of rail lines in parts of the State than other forms of public transport?</p></speech>

It outlined the cost of operating each part of the network on a segment-by-segment basis.  As railway people, we do not want to close any line.  If there were no issues, we would like to open and run more railways.  The decision is not ours to make; it is with the Department and the NTA.  We fed all the information into it and they developed the document.  The decision is with them and we are not making a recommendation one way or the other.</p></speech>

I refer back to Project Ireland 2040.  If the population projections for the five regional cities of the State and the increased populations in their hinterlands are not taken into account in the review, then the review is not bona fide.  Project Ireland 2040 is an ambitious plan that, for the first time, provides for capital expenditure in tandem with the growth strategies for the State.  If we are planning for population growth, it is important that we also plan for the infrastructure associated with that growth such as housing, broadband and especially public transport.  Any review that does not take Project Ireland 2040 into account needs to be reviewed again because that is the plan for the next 20 years.  When the ten-year capital plan is announced, there will be funding to support that.  We should certainly take account of that plan, especially with regard to rail infrastructure, and support it where possible.</p> <p>  I reiterate my earlier point on the promotion of the benefits of rail travel among our younger generations.  Many younger people have not experienced it because most of them have cars and are using motorways.  It is a diminishing return.  Students will use it for college if it is on their doorstep but additional benefits to rail travel could be promoted.  If a promotion was run to attract younger people to use the railway, we would see the benefits of that.  There is a future in rail travel and I am certainly supportive of it.  I would support Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in any way to try to promote rail travel.</p></speech>

The committee recommends that a working group be convened and we will be in touch with each of the representatives on this group to get an update and progress report with a view to having a further meeting, if needed, in six months in order that the group can present a solution to the long-standing problem with the flooding at Ballycar.</p></speech>
