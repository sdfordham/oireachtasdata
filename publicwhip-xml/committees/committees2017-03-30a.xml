    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#A00100"><p>I begin by urging everybody, including those in the Gallery, to please switch off all mobile phones immediately as they interfere with the sound recording equipment.  As the members of the press are taking their seats, I reiterate that they should please ensure mobile phones are switched off.  No apologies have been received this morning.  Today's public session is a discussion with the Garda Commissioner on issues of public concern that have been the subject of media coverage in recent days, including fixed charge notices and how it is that 14,700 wrongful convictions were secured as a result of Garda error; and breath test data that revealed 937,000 breath tests were falsely recorded on the PULSE system.</p> <p>  I welcome the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is joined by Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, Deputy Commissioner John Twomey, Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn and Mr. Joe Nugent, who is chief administrative officer with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are joined in the Gallery by Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications; Superintendent Marie Broderick from the Garda Commissioner's office; and Superintendent Paul Murray, the press officer.  On behalf of the committee I thank them for their attendance today and accepting our invitation in order to discuss these important matters.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question and answer session.  Before inviting the Garda Commissioner to begin, I must provide the normal caution relating to privilege.  I draw the attention of all witnesses to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask all members to conduct their questioning without recourse to inappropriate language or charge.</p> <p>  I remind members the committee does not have the power to make findings of fact or expressions of opinion adverse to the good name or reputation of a citizen not a Member of these Houses.  I also remind members to confine questioning to the matters directly before us for address today.  The Garda Commissioner will address those now in her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#A00200"><p>As the Chairman outlined, the people with me today are Deputy Commissioner John Twomey,  Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in,  Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, who is in charge of roads policing, and the chief administrative officer, Mr. Joe Nugent.  As Garda Commissioner and on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I sincerely apologise for the grave mistakes and wrongdoing during the last decade that have led to the two controversies we are here today to discuss.  Those mistakes and wrongdoings are unacceptable in policing terms, unacceptable in ethical terms, unacceptable in terms of public trust, and, most critically, unacceptable to the advocacy and support groups involved in road safety and to those who were wrongly brought before the courts.  They have raised serious issues about how at all levels the service was managed, how certain garda&iacute; operated on the ground and the supervision applied.  Given the scale of these issues, they cannot simply be blamed on one individual or one area.  It is a collective failure from top down and bottom up.  We all take responsibility for this and for ensuring we establish how this happened and that it cannot happen again.  The committee has been provided with a detailed timeline of events for both matters.  As these are two separate issues, I will deal with each one separately.</p> <p>  I will start with the issue of summonses for fixed charge notices, FCNs, being wrongly issued.  In February 2016, a garda contacted our call centre, known as the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC, in Castlebar and alerted them that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was issuing summonses for not having a valid national car test, NCT, certificate when it should have been a fine.  GISC put checks in place to stop this happening but some summonses had been previously issued and were still in the system.  Discovering the issue was nationwide; we took two actions.  The first was to put an information technology fix in place to prevent it happening it again.  An instruction that all proceedings incorrectly instituted be withdrawn was also issued.</p> <p>  We immediately initiated a look-back, which demonstrated that a number of cases had already been incorrectly referred to the courts and dealt with by way of summons rather than FCN, and this had to be rectified.  In each and every case an offence had been committed, but an incorrect procedure had been employed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Courts Service about how to address cases where a penalty point has been imposed.  A dedicated team has been set up and we are liaising with the Courts Service to expedite this process.  We will be writing to all the people affected from 3 April 3 2017 on the foot of the advice we sought from the DPP.  We will explain what happened and how we propose to rectify the matter.  Any fines imposed will be reimbursed and all records involved will be corrected.  Anyone who believes they have been affected by this matter will be able to contact a helpline from 3 April 2017.</p> <p>  I will deal now with the separate issue of breath tests.  Correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to the Minister responsible for transport was brought to our notice in 2014, where the issue of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints and other matters were raised.  The fact that the original complaint was anonymous hindered our ability to investigate the matter fully.</p><p>However, I issued an instruction to deputy commissioner of operations who subsequently directed all regional assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents to ensure effective mechanisms were in place to monitor the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing, MAT, checkpoints within their respective divisions and districts.  The Department of Justice and Equality was also advised of this.  In addition, we set up a working group to review the recording of traffic equipment and PULSE related data.  The outcome of this working group indicated significant discrepancies in data in one region.  Following this, a nationwide review of all breath test data commenced in June 2016.  We then notified the Department of Justice and Equality of this review and put a note on our website saying our breath test figures were subject to review.  The review was unable to reconcile the PULSE data and the paper-based breath test data, primarily due to significant gaps in the manually recorded breath test data.  To validate the data, we asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to provide us with  the data from its breath test screening devices.  In terms of the scale of difference between its data and ours from 2011 and 2016, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na PULSE data was 1,995,369 and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety data was 1,058,157.</p><p> In November 2016, new electronic procedures were installed on the Garda PULSE system.  This meant personnel had to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test, plus the meter reading, before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint and it indicates that our figures match with those of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for 2016-17.  The breath testing and FCPN issues are being resolved and this will be externally validated.  However, the fact is that we now know some garda&iacute; recorded exaggerated numbers.  At worst, this was deception.  At best, this was incompetence.  Either way, it was individually and organisationally shameful, and will be seen to be shameful by the public and the thousands of garda&iacute; around the country who operate every day to the highest ethical standards.  It also raises serious questions of supervision and management.  My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data.  I will ensure that the people responsible at all levels will be held to account.</p></speech>

In her statement, the Garda Commissioner apologised for the grave mistakes and wrongdoing of the Garda which led to these two controversies.  In regard to the breath test issue, what was the wrongdoing on the part of the Garda for which she is apologising?</p></speech>

The wrongdoing for which we, and I, have apologised is for our having misled the public in terms of the data on the Garda website regarding the level of activity in regard to breath tests.</p></speech>

That is what I apologised for at the press conference.  I was aware that the data was on the website and that the public was being misled by it.  I made the decision that we would remove that data from the website.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01000"><p>Perhaps I could respond to that part of the question.  What I am apologising for is the failures that have happened over the last ten years, not only in regard to breath testing.  Since 2014, we have been on a major programme of reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are trying to put things right and trying to ensure that we serve the public in an open, professional, transparent and ethical manner and to the standards that would be expected of a modern, professional policing service.  In doing that, we are turning over a lot of stones.  We do not leave a stone unturned.  The turning of one of those stones involved a review of issues that were raised with us around the conduct of MAT checkpoints and the breath testing issue that arose in that regard.</p> <p>  Last March, assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael Finn, identified massive discrepancies between the recorded breath tests on PULSE and the records held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  Last Friday, I appointed an assistant commissioner to investigate how this happened.  What we do know at this point is that these discrepancies occurred individually.  In other words, individual members entered numbers on the system that do not match or correspond with the numbers recorded on the system of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01100"><p>Does the Commissioner accept that that was done, on occasion, dishonestly by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01200"><p>As I said in my opening statement, we have not yet got to the bottom of exactly what happened but what we do know is that the numbers do not match.  Therefore, the assistant commissioner has to establish how this was done.  In other words, was the information entered erroneously and so on.  As I said in my opening statement this is either deception, in so far as somebody picked a number and entered into the system, or it was an error or miscount of numbers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01300"><p>The reason I am concentrating on this is the Commissioner's apology in her statement for mistakes and wrongdoing.  Clearly, somebody inputting information inaccurately or inadvertently would constitute a mistake.  However, the Commissioner has also apologised for the wrongdoing.  What I am asking is, does she agree that one of the examples of wrongdoing for which she is apologising is the input by members of the force of information about breath tests which they knew to be false?  It is a simple question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01400"><p>It may well be the case that the assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, will discover that individual members deliberately input into the system figures that were not correct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01500"><p>Who in the individual stations had responsibility in that regard?  I am not in asking that question seeking the names of individuals.  When garda&iacute; return to a station following a checkpoint and say that they carried out 40 breath tests when they only did 20, who in the station is responsible for inputting the information into the system?  Is that the function of the traffic inspector or the garda involved in carrying out the checkpoint?</p></speech>

If there was no sergeant involved it would be the responsibility of the senior garda involved to input the information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B01700"><p>In regard to the figures, it is apparent that the input of incorrect figures was systemic throughout the country.  Would the witnesses agree with that?  For example, in the south eastern region, there was an increase of 153% and in Dublin, the least offensive region, there was an increase of 68%.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Would he agree that the reason for this was, in part, a desire of particular Garda regions to present themselves as being more efficient than they were?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finn" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#B02200"><p>It was never a desire within Garda regions to compete with each other or to inflate figures such that one region would look better than another in terms of breath tests.  Our focus was always on saving lives on the road, arresting people for drink driving and carrying out checkpoints, which reassure the public and the law abiding motorist that we are enforcing the law.  I can honestly say there was never a competition between regions or chief superintendents in terms of the number of breath tests recorded.</p></speech>

I have looked at a number of divisional plans.  In regard to the indicators of performance on the road traffic issue one of the indicators in many of the divisional plans was that there would be an increase in the number of persons breath tested in public places.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The Road Safety Authority surveys indicate to us that the greater the visibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of checkpoints and breath testing, the more likely the general public will comply with the law.</p></speech>

When I was a divisional officer, what we looked at during our management meetings was primarily the number of arrests, the numbers of fatalities and serious injuries on the roads, the number of checkpoints and how it was impacting overall in terms of performance.

In the wider area of road safety, we were taking a number of actions, a number of which were focused on enforcement and identifying and bringing to court those people who were misbehaving on the roads.  A number of other actions were taken in the area of prevention and preventative actions.  We should see this in the context of trying to save lives on the roads and make them much safer.  If memory serves, in 2005, when a restructuring and reorganisation of traffic functions took place across the organisation, almost 400 people were killed on the roads.  There has been a considerable improvement in that regard.  I say this to provide context.  As enforcement improved, the focus was on behaviour, prevention and compliance.  Mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints and breath tests focus on compliance.  They were included in policing plans and used from a prevention perspective.</p></speech>

I spoke to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in relation to this aspect.  The bureau's audit in the middle of 2015 was in relation to an audit of their equipment.  It was done by the people in their stores, talking to the people in our stores up in Santry, where we keep the devices.  That is the level at which the conversation took place.  I was told that by Professor Cusack himself.</p></speech>

The people in their stores section spoke to the people in our stores section on how many mouth pieces for the breath test devices we had in stock.  I had that confirmed by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in recent days when I spoke to the professor.  That is the level at which the conservation took place.  It was not happening at Commissioner level.</p></speech>

Professor Cusack was on the airwaves the other morning and he made it very clear that it is quite simple to monitor these devices.  Before the Garda goes out, a record of the number is taken and the same is done when he comes back.  The Garda introduced that system, that paper audit, in April 2016.  Why did the Garda not do it in 2014 when the Garda knew about this?  Why did the Garda wait until March 2017, after <i>The Irish Times</i>article, to ask the Medical Bureau of Road Safety about it when the bureau had this information all along?  The Garda did not need to have an internal audits.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety had the information.</p></speech>

In November 2015, as Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn has already stated, the Garda had the information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety audit.  I know that.  The question is why did the Garda wait until April 2016 even to put in place a paper audit, where the person would be checked going in and going out?  The second question is why the Garda waited for another full year, as in last week, to ask the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for that information, when it had it all along?  The reason I am asking these questions comes back to what the Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn said earlier about data.  Mr. Finn has apologised for data.  Can he understand how difficult it is for us to accept any data from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given what we have heard?  Will the Garda team answer those two questions?  I have a further question relating to data, but I am conscious of time.  The team need to try to answer the question asked.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure our data is 100% accurate today.  We have given a commitment that the data will be externally verified.  What we were endeavouring to do was to try to reconcile our own figures.  There are in excess of 373,000 checkpoints.  The 1.9 million breath tests come from those checkpoints.  We are grappling with huge numbers on a paper-based system.</p></speech>

On the question of data, which is of major significance, I noted at the press conference, Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn spoke about checkpoints.

How can we take solace from that?  Will Mr. Finn comment on the fact that a former Garda made internal reports that suggested that it was an instruction by management.  There is a difference, as the assistant commissioner knows, when a checkpoint is set up, management instruct and set a target for each station as to how many checkpoints should be carried out by that station and that district.  Obviously events happen unexpectedly and the target cannot be the scheduled checkpoints, and checkpoints are often cancelled.</p><p>We are led to believe that management issued an instruction to say that the number of checkpoints scheduled, rather than the number of checkpoints actually carried out, should be recorded.</p></speech>

The Commissioner's opening remarks were very brief.  I suppose the timelines we were given constituted half-information in some ways, without being derogatory about it.  The Commissioner spoke about fixed charge notices for NCTs.  They accounted for just 6% of the incorrect summonses that were issued.  Are the witnesses saying that the communication to the Department of Justice and Equality and to the Policing Authority related to the NCT fixed charge notices only?</p></speech>

We initially wrote to the Department in June of that year in respect of the NCT offence.  We had to review all of our data back to 2016 after we learned that an offence that should have been dealt with by fixed charge notice had been dealt with by summons.  The person had an offence to answer to but the procedure used was incorrect.  We knew from looking at that data or we certainly questioned whether this could have applied to other issues, given that it had applied to NCT data.  All other offences shifted from summonses to fixed charge notices over a number of years from 2006 up to the current date.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste told the Seanad that errors cannot be repeated because "a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place".  How confident is the Garda that this is the case?  How confident can we be that this is the case?  I am thinking of the public, in particular.</p></speech>

I know it is a fact because I have received a few fixed charge notices before.  I know what they look like.  If I had received one in this instance, I would have known.  Coincidentally, on receipt of a fixed charge notice in October of last year, I was in Naas court and I met some people who were there precisely because they had not received fixed charge notices and had been summonsed to court.  They spent a day in that court.  The judge adjourned because they were pleading not guilty.  They had to come back on another day.  That was in October and December of last year.</p></speech>

I am saying that where a fixed charge should have been issued in every case, it is our view and belief here today that that is the case.  That is why I have said I would like to see the detail.  A fixed charge notice should issue in every single incident where a fixed charge notice applies.  That is not to deny that some people may not have received their fixed charge notices for various reasons and were therefore unaware of the position.  We know this issue about An Post delivery appears before the court on a regular basis.</p></speech>

It is causing a lot of confusion around the country.  Any of the offences linked to the GoSafe vans that are parked on the side of the road or the vehicles we use to detect non-intercept types of offences are not linked in any way to the fixed charge notice issue we are discussing here.

The point here is that because of the reality which has been posed in front of the public, its members cannot trust information coming from senior Garda management.  The Commissioner's opening speech suggested that much more can be expected.  We heard on the radio this morning that domestic violence figures might be all over the place.  The witnesses cannot really reassure me in terms of the checkpoint figures.  I have given them my own direct personal experience, and the personal experience of other people I met in court on a different day, which belies the narrative the witnesses have put forward, which is that the problems in the system have been corrected.  That is what we are trying to get to the bottom of.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the apology she has given regarding the specific incidents we are talking about here and the questions that have arisen.</p><p>I would like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks she should apologise for the manner and the way in which she and her senior management team have conducted themselves and the investigation or audit into this process.  Before the Commissioner answers me, I want to put a couple of questions and points to her.  Yes, we are talking quite big numbers, it is a discrepancy of approximately 1 million and we are talking about a lot of mandatory tests, but she commands a force, and by her own statements, she has been conducting her own investigation that started approximately in 2014.  She has come in today, and she has said that the Garda management has still not completed the audit.  Does she think that is acceptable?  </p><p> I would be very interested to know if the Commissioner could give me a logistical breakdown on how many people have been deployed to carry out this work, from the initial audit in the southern region to date.  That speaks volumes to how seriously she is taking this.  If she does not want to apologise for it, can she explain to any reasonable person why, when it came to her attention in 2014, she is still not able to give complete information to us here today at the end of March 2017?</p></speech>

This issue was raised in April 2014.  I want to preface this statement by saying that this is not an excuse, these are just facts.  The facts were that the former Commissioner had retired.  I was acting in an interim capacity only, performing the functions of the Commissioner, both deputy commissioners - Deputy Commissioner Operations and Deputy Commissioner Strategy and Change Management - so I was the single person in the executive.  I had the most seriously reduced management team ever in the history of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The assistant commissioner who was given this responsibility to do was carrying portfolios, three very significant portfolios.  These are not excuses but the facts were that the layers of management below that were depleted.  To link in with Deputy Daly's question - the committee members will understand but I say this for the benefit of the public - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has devolved functions.  There is the Commissioner, there are deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and they form the nucleus of the management team.  At that stage, we were dealing with such a depleted management team that I was almost single-handed, with a team of five assistant commissioners, trying to run what was then a 14,500 person organisation.  To be fair to the individual who was given this task, he had to do it with a myriad of other responsibilities.  I do not have a logistical breakdown of the people who applied but I would be very happy to provide it to the committee.</p> <p>  The chief superintendent, who was in the traffic bureau at the time, was also carrying multiple portfolios, as was the superintendent.  We had come through a very significant recession and the Garda were no different from anywhere else in the public or private sector but some of the legacy issues that we are dealing with now arise from the deficit and depletion of the supervisory and management capacity.  It is worth remembering that I spent nine months in that position as interim Acting-Commissioner.  I was appointed in November of that year.  It took a further 11 months to have two deputy commissioners appointed and it is only in January of this year that we eventually got the appointment of a full executive, that is the people you see here.  We very much welcome the transition of senior Garda appointments to the Policing Authority and thankfully, last week, along with the Policing Authority, we eventually got a panel of assistant commissioners -----  </p></speech>

She has said she is not making excuses but she then delivered a complete set of excuses as to why she did not do something.</p> <p>  I asked how many people were deployed to the audit.  She does not know.  That is incredible.  There are two aspects of this that are very important.  First, the Garda conducted the initial audit in the southern region.  Whatever about the time lag between the Garda management deciding to change processes afterwards, the initial audit was conducted in the southern region and something obviously registered with the Garda that there was a problem, regardless of how many people were not there to make decisions.  Did the Commissioner not think that problem was so serious that she should inform the Policing Authority properly?  I put it to the Commissioner that not only did she not think that the problem was serious enough at that stage to inform the Policing Authority, but that in some of the answers which she and her colleagues gave to the Policing Authority, they went out of their way not to make it obvious that they were dealing with something very serious.  The Commissioner knew it was serious enough that processes were going to have to be changed.  She knew it was serious enough that she would have to trigger a national audit, even if she took forever to do it, but the knew it was serious enough.  She did not think it was serious enough to go out of her way to forthrightly bring it to the attention of the Policing Authority, or to anyone else, to say there was a belief there was a very serious problem.  Maybe more was done in private in which case the Commissioner might tell us, but in public answers to the Policing Authority a minimum amount of information was given.  </p> <p>  The reason I asked the Commissioners to apologise for how she has conducted the investigation is that Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management has a method of answering questions which involves not supplying information unless we absolutely get to the heart of it.  It deeply upsets me and is unacceptable in our time.  Again, I ask, how many people were involved in the audit?  Does she have any indication as to whether it was one person writing letters?  Does she have any indication as to whether a team was established?  Does she have any indication as to whether, if that team was established, there were, say, ten people on it or 15?  She is in here and says that it is not completed.  How many people are currently working on the audit?  What level of priority is given to it?</p></speech>

Deputy Commissioner, John Twomey, was there for the initial part of the audit and it has continued.  I do not have the logistical breakdown of the individuals but we are happy to provide it.  The Deputy makes a very interesting point about the old culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of waiting until we get to the heart of the answers.  That is the way we do things.  We have been brought up as policemen and women and we like to establish the facts before we come out publicly.  Part of the commitment to openness and transparency which we committed to in our modernisation and renewal programme, and that we committed to and I committed to as part of the Government reform programme, was exactly what we saw happen in this case.  We do not have all the answers.  The assistant commissioner has outlined how it was of such significant proportions that we made a decision and the assistant commissioner raised this with the public.   In June 2016, when we became aware that there was an issue with the fixed charge notices, we put a notice on our website to tell people.  On the breath tests, we put a qualifier on the website to say that this data is subject to review.</p> <p>  For the record, as the committee knows, the Policing Authority was constituted on 1 January 2016.  The authority was not there in November 2015.  I will ask the deputy commissioner to deal with the informal briefings that were given to the authority.  It is a matter of regret that when the Policing Authority was constituted, it was not informed of this fact.  We have apologised for that and have said that it was an oversight.</p></speech>

Was it an oversight because the Commissioner thought it was not important enough to tell the Policing Authority?  Was it an oversight because the Policing Authority is new and the Garda did not understand that it had to tell them?  Was it an oversight because the Garda management decided it was just not going to tell these people?  Why was it an oversight?</p></speech>

It was an oversight because there is a transition arrangement.  We have explained this from the outset and even in the preamble to the establishment of the Policing Authority.  There is a perception that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a very data-rich organisation, has systems which at a press of a button can produce and present data.  We cannot.  In this case, both of my colleagues sitting to my right and left, can explain how this would mean a trawl through volumes, mountains of paper records to try to match them with the PULSE system which the Garda inspectorate quite rightly pointed out is outdated and archaic.  We have now secured Government funds to make improvements to it and we are doing the upgrades and improvements.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned process.  A process must be gone through to ensure we establish the facts without, as the assistant commissioner stated, applying fixes or information that is wrong or distorted.  We are trying to do that.  I used a metaphor the other day - we are trying to keep the lights on while rewiring the house.  It is important that people understand this.  We are dealing with an old system of paper records that are mountains high.  Some of them are in basements of Garda stations, others are in station attics and others are in desk drawers in stations.  They must be taken out and gone through.  Yes, it took-----</p></speech>

Does he know how many people are conducting the audit?</p></speech>

When they considered the examination of the southern region, between six and eight people were involved at the outset.  Six people were directly tasked with it and they brought in others to support them.</p> <p>  I will repeat what the Commissioner is trying to outline about the scale, the number and the complexity involved.  It is difficult to defend before the committee what is the indefensible.  The Commissioner has outlined that what happened was unacceptable behaviour.  Not for one second are we making excuses to the committee or covering up in any shape or form.  Rather, we are trying to provide members and others who are watching the answers they are seeking.  In some cases-----</p></speech>

Six people started on the audit of the southern region.  The Garda realised from that that there was a problem.  How many people are now working on the audit?</p></speech>

It started out as a review of all of our data, PULSE systems and how we managed traffic data.  The working group just happened to pick the southern region as an example.  Roll on to where we are today and we are undertaking the national audit because we discovered discrepancies.  The working group highlighted that there was a problem.  In the middle of June last year, we decided that we needed to examine the issue across the organisation to determine how large its scale was.  The traffic section, which is where I am, sent out a series of questions on all of that-----</p></speech>

Staff in the respective divisional and traffic offices are trying to compile it.  It was out of sheer frustration when we could not get the data - we were looking for paper records from as far back as 2009 to try to reconcile our data - that I went to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and asked for data that it was prepared to share with us and that I could use to validate ours.  When I got those data, I gave it to my analysts.  Two are working for me.  They do a great deal of other work besides this, but I got them to work-----</p></speech>

As late as yesterday, every chief superintendent in the country came to Garda headquarters.  We can get the breakdown of which officers are working on this per division for the Deputy.  We do not have that information with us, but we would be happy to provide the Deputy with the logistical breakdown of how many people are working on it.  It has been made clear to all of our managers that this is a priority.  It must be finalised as soon as possible.  As the assistant commissioner said, there are two analysts in the Garda traffic bureau.  Recently, we secured a commitment from the Government, working closely with the Policing Authority and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to recruit civilians with the proper skills and qualifications.  It has taken us a very long time to do that.  As we discussed yesterday at our meeting with the chief superintendents, we have identified the positions required to put in place divisional business units so that, if we need to do something again, it can be done more speedily and efficiently and with systems that enable us to have the data.  However, it is a work in progress.  We do not have it as yet.  We are doing with the old system-----</p></speech>

It stems from her opening statement and the extensive coverage that one part of her statement yesterday received after it became public knowledge.  She stated: "My fear, and my real fear, is that this falsification is not confined to traffic data."  Is any investigation audit process under way in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is examining data on a problem that is similar to these two matters, in respect of which the Garda has established an audit, and about which the Garda has not informed the public or the Policing Authority?  If so, what is the specific area of investigation?</p></speech>

In my opening statement, I said that I had a fear.  At a time when we are going through such a radical organisational and administrative overhaul, we are rooting out issues to ensure they are right.  We are not leaving any stone unturned.  As one overturns a stone, one finds something.</p> <p>  Additionally, we are benchmarking ourselves against best practice.  As we bring in different people and perspectives, we are looking at things.  When we identify issues, we will do precisely what we have done in this case.  We will deal with them and put them right.  We will be open and transparent about that.  A number of reviews are under way.  I can allow the deputy commissioner to talk about them.  Everyone in this committee room is familiar with the Garda Inspectorate's report, particularly as regards data quality, crime classification and crime recording.  We are working closely with the CSO.  We continue to review all of our processes.  We are introducing something that we never had before, namely, standard operating procedures, overhauling the roads policing unit and introducing new measures to ensure we have consistent-----</p></speech>

The answers are not simple.  To put it as simply as I can, I chair a group that is tasked with examining our data quality.  We specifically consider the issues that were raised in the inspectorate's report, namely, crime classification, crime reclassification and incidents mark detected.  More recently, we have examined our approach to domestic violence and what is being done in that regard, which Deputy Daly referenced.</p> <p>  Is there something that we are not mentioning?  Absolutely not.  I cannot tell the committee that everything is perfect within the organisation or that we will not find something down the road.  What is more, I cannot tell it that we will not make mistakes.  We will make mistakes.  Everyone does, but I am giving the committee a clear commitment that we are doing everything to address those issues in respect of which we are being asked to change.</p><p>I would like to get more time at a later stage to explain what we are doing in the context of our data quality.  We have done considerable work in what we call our centre of excellence with the Garda information services centre, GISC, which is a recommendation from the inspectorate.  That commences next Monday in the northern region and it is only happening as a consequence of staffing being provided in the past couple of weeks.  I would like the opportunity to expand in more detail because I think it will address the question-----</p></speech>

For background, every checkpoint is authorised in law.  Following the introduction of revised legislation on mandatory alcohol tests, random breath-testing was enabled, prior to which it was on the basis of reasonable suspicion.  There is authorisation for every mandatory alcohol checkpoint that has been conducted.  An inspector or above must authorise it in law.  That evidence is subsequently produced in court for any prosecution.  That evidence was initially in a paper-based system and, at a later stage, it became part of our PULSE system.</p></speech>

Even though this was anonymous, it was suggested that it was from a Garda Reserve member.  A number of seminars were held around the country with the Garda Reserve to address the issues, to address inclusivity for the Garda reservists in order to ensure that they were valued, and to give a forum where reservists could raise the issues they wanted to.  The correspondence indicated that this individual had written to the Road Safety Authority because that person felt there was not a forum to express issues.  We put that in place as well.  That was the purpose of addressing that.  Separately, the deputy commissioner was dealing with addressing the general issues raised in the correspondence.</p></speech>

Therefore, it would often have been the following day before a member would have had an opportunity to input information on a MAT checkpoint, or it could have been a few days later if he or she happened to be resting for the few days following a shift.  I think this compounded our problems as to why the data were inaccurate.</p></speech>

Outside facts, I will offer a hypothesis.  As the deputy commissioner mentioned, MAT checkpoints are a preventive measure.  They are actually not designed to detect and catch people but to encourage compliant behaviour.  One of the significant changes we have made in our culture is making sure we put prevention first and at the heart of everything we do.  The following is a hypothesis - I want to be very careful - that perhaps the preventive nature of MAT checkpoints was not valued or viewed as being as important as detections.  I do not wish in any way to detract from what I said in my opening remarks about the very good, diligent, professional and ethical work done by the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na every single day, but one hypothesis is that because of this, recording accurate numbers, be it 24 or 48 hours after a very busy period - that does not lessen or diminish the actions involved - was not seen as important as being accurate in the detection of offences.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#J03300"><p>I have a few more questions to ask, but perhaps I might get to them later.  There must have been a cultural trigger for these actions and the representatives must provide some idea for the committee as to why they happened.  It is not acceptable simply to wait for a factual understanding.  They should give us, as senior members of the Garda, as the ones who accept responsibility collectively, as they stated, some idea as to why this happened.</p> <p>  I want to track back.  Again, I am interested in the period from 2006 to 2009.  There are a number of reasons one could have had a cultural trigger.  One was there would have been an incentive.  There can be an incentive for a member of any organisation to do better or perhaps gain credit within the system in terms of promotion.  That is one question.  Do the representatives believe any Garda member anywhere tried to manipulate data to drive potential promotional opportunities?  </p> <p>  I refer to the bonus-related payments system in place from 2006 until 2010.  We know that senior officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service were paid bonuses based on particular outcomes driven by human resource management within the context of whatever system in which they were operating.  We know that a bonus system was in place for members of the force from assistant commissioner level up.  What were the performance-related targets at the time when bonuses were paid and could this have been the trigger for driving data upwards in the force?  Was that the trigger that drove a cultural norm within the force to maximise data outcomes?  We know that bonuses were paid to most senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the time the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, criticised the bonus culture across the senior sections of the Civil Service and the wider public service, but we know that senior officers in the Garda also received bonuses.  What I want to know specifically is whether data for traffic, alcohol testing and checkpoints were potentially linked with bonuses?  In a particular division if one Garda member had a better outcome in the data submitted as against his or her colleagues, was there a difference in the bonuses paid?  Were there performance-related targets linked with bonuses which we know were paid to senior officers in the force at the time.  Could this have been the cultural trigger?</p></speech>

Would that be true?  Mr. Finn accepts some responsibility for the fact that things went haywire around the fixed charge notices.  Mr. Finn will have noticed that yesterday I raised in the D&aacute;il the issue of a female garda who is stationed in Bray.  I have the result of an internal disciplinary inquiry here and both Mr. Finn and the Commissioner signed it.  Dismissal is being recommended on five grounds, one of which was failure to put a criminal complaint on PULSE.  A second ground was failure to safeguard a statement.  This is a station where the GPSU report found that 30% of the files could not even be found in the station such was the anarchy prevailing in it.  Given that Mr. Finn accepts responsibility for over 13,000 mistakes, how, in God's name, can he recommend dismissal to a female garda for these two incidents?</p></speech>

I must be careful.  We will not speak about any specific case.  Sometimes, by putting information into the public domain, particularly if there is a sequence of events, it can lead to the identification of an individual and to be fair to individuals, we cannot do that.  However, what I will say is that where any individual is identified as engaging in some type of wrongdoing, a process is undertaken which is a disciplinary process.  In some instances, cases end up as criminal investigations and persons are charged before the courts.  That is a very different thing from what we are talking about now.  What we are talking about now, as Deputy Jack Chambers said, is a systemic-wide issue.  The assistant commissioner, as the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing, ook responsibility and apologised for those systemic widespread issues.</p><p>That is a very different scenario from somebody being identified and accused of wrongdoing.</p></speech>

We will have to investigate to find out exactly.  The data I was able to verify I have verified, and I went off externally to do that.

I want to be clear on this point.  With regard to the excesses in fixed charge notices, it was given all of the information we had.  It is only since 10 March this year, following further consultation with other agencies involved, that we have been able to narrow down the numbers.  As soon as we had the numbers, they were given to the Policing Authority in advance of the press conference.  With regard to the fixed charge notices, it was briefed on it from June last year.  That is clear.</p> <p>  With regard to the breath tests what happened was letters were issued, including a letter issued to the Department, and a note was put on the website.  This was the context.  The issue with regard to the original numbers came to notice in November 2015, and that was in advance of the establishment of the Policing Authority.  I have spoken on a number of occasions to the Policing Authority and we have outlined the position on what happened.  We had written externally.  We had put a note on our website on the fixed charge notice.  We informed the Policing Authority and briefed it.  We meet every month and we answer all the questions on this.  All along the way every effort has been made, and as late as last night further correspondence was provided to the Policing Authority to keep it up to date.</p></speech>

Cathal Mac Coille stated the bureau knew enough in 2014 to ask the question, to which Professor Cusack replied the numbers simply did not add up.  Cathal Mac Coille asked whether Professor Cusack had a meeting with the Garda, to which he replied he had regular meetings with it and he was told the Garda did not need any more mouthpieces.  Professor Cusack stated the bureau does not in any way become involved in Garda operational matters and it took it at face value.  Professor Cusack went on to say that in August 2015 the bureau carried out a survey of 200 of the 1,200 devices and it found, with regard to the estimation of the average use of those 200 devices, that it appeared there were not 400,000 plus tests being done on the devices but closer to 200,000 and the Garda was informed of this.  This was in August to September 2015.  How in God's name did that not ring alarm bells?  That was a year and a half ago.</p></speech>

We have a chain of command.  This job was given to the deputy commissioner, who gave it to the assistant commissioner in traffic.  In the roads policing bureau as it is now, which was the traffic bureau then, there are various people who and structures that deal with various issues.  As the assistant commissioner outlined earlier, we understand the issues raised by Professor Cusack related to the procurement of mouthpieces for the Drager units.  I can ask Assistant Commissioner Finn to deal with it in more detail again.  It was dealt with by the traffic policy bureau department.

It goes without saying at this stage that there have been so many investigations and reports.  Things are not really running awfully smoothly.  Surely the buck stops with the Commissioner.  The last Garda Inspectorate report in 2015 stated that no one had made the change happen.  The Commissioner was almost two years in the gig at that stage.  If the Chief Inspector was to do another report now, he would find that things have not improved since.  With regard to implementing his recommendations, the Commissioner put a guy - I will not name him here today as people get upset about names - in charge of implementing that in Garda headquarters in the park.  He is the subject of three protected disclosures.  I do not understand how the Commissioner can expect things to change if she is going to put the fox in charge of the chickens.</p></speech>

Again, I will not speak about any individuals but I want to be very clear about something.  This is a statement of facts.  When I took over as acting interim Commissioner and applied for the job of Garda Commissioner in 2014, the job description included delivering on the Government reform programme that was necessary for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but no one told us what that reform consisted of.  Let me be crystal clear about the demonstrable track record that is there to prove what we did, albeit with, as I say, a very depleted management team.  We took not only the 11 Garda Inspectorate reports but the 43 reports that were completed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the previous ten years.  I was asked about those ten years.  The 43 reports contained no less than 1,400 recommendations and a significant number of those were from the Garda Inspectorate.  For the first time ever in the history of the State and the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we set about developing a comprehensive and coherent reform programme and last June we launched the programme.  The last time I attended the committee, we shared that document with it.  However, we did not just launch a glossy document.  We set out a roadmap of precisely what we were going to do over the next five to seven years.  In that intervening period, we set about ensuring we influenced Government and got its commitment in terms of people and human resources, technology and funding needed to make it happen.  We started making that happen but what really made a difference to communities throughout the country were victim service offices, our protective services bureau, Operation Thor-----</p></speech>

Will she explain why, from the feedback we are receiving, the vast majority of the people in her force no longer feel she is the right person for the job?  Lastly, she might address one other small issue.  Press releases on breath test figures etc. have been issued after Christmas and bank holiday weekend campaigns.

I would like to begin by summing up these issues and events as sloppy, appalling and an unprofessional catastrophe.  I think this will have long lasting effects on Garda morale and public trust.  I have listened carefully to the Commissioner's remarks on a number of specific questions and am minded to recall her summing up of Deputy Chambers's examples of his views and others on this matter with the term "unprofessional".  She used that term herself.  Notwithstanding the direction of the Chairman, in terms of morale and public faith in the management team or individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or both at this point, my first question is whether the Commissioner accepts that the public and Members of these Houses are greatly concerned about the current direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, notwithstanding the document that is under her left elbow.   I recall going through that document with the committee.  Would she accept that point?</p></speech>

As I stated, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also concerned.  This is not just a document under my left elbow.  This is a programme that we have been working on for three years.  We have delivered tangible results that are making a difference to communities and individual citizens of the State throughout the country.  Otherwise, we would not be doing it.  I am not in this just to produce a glossy document to talk about here or, indeed, to hide behind.  I am ensuring that we are improving and professionalising the service that we deliver to every citizen of the State.  I will continue to do that.</p></speech>

As Assistant Commissioner Finn has said, the press conference was being dealt with by the chairman and CEO of the Policing Authority.  Separately, the deputy commissioner had communications with the Department, and we can give date for that - prior to that happening.  There is a distinction to be made in that we were not aware, at that time, of the figures.  We did not have the figures when the communication was communicated to the Department.</p></speech>

While the press conference as ongoing, and while Assistant Commissioner Finn was outlining the information, the executive, the Garda Commissioner, myself and the others were actually in a meeting with the Policing Authority at that time giving them a full briefing.  They had been given the documentation and we were giving them a briefing on that same day.</p></speech>

As the former assistant commissioner for change management, does the Garda Commissioner not recognise the forthright breakdown in communication and information to the oversight bodies responsible for the Garda and that we absolutely need frontloaded honesty here at all times? I appreciate the mentality she outlines, and that she has said "We have been brought up as policemen and women ...", which I understand.  Does the Garda Commissioner not understand that sometimes the provision of a small amount of information, perhaps not the overall figure, is an absolute requirement when it comes to the purpose of this committee?  In the last D&aacute;il this committee painstakingly went through a process, including a visit to Northern Ireland and Scotland, to provide the Department of Justice and Equality with examples of what the implementation of a new policing authority would look like.  Does the Garda Commissioner not recognise that this is needed? While it might be privileged information to a small group at least the information is then in the hands of a responsible authority which then can make a determination for itself in a professional way as to whether parts of the information should be made public.  Does the Garda Commissioner realise that she has a responsibility as part of that process?</p></speech>

We are doing our very best to ensure that the provision of information becomes much smoother, not just to the Policing Authority, also to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  Now that we have secured the commitment to allow us to employ some civilian members it will be very helpful as it will allow us to put the administrative structures in place to ensure that smooth transition of information.  Some of that administration, to be frank, is complete work overload and we are expecting people to do a lot of things.  There is an importance to that work and a seriousness in actually providing information.  In between our authority meetings there are a number of committee meetings each of which the people at this table attends.  There is a two-way flow of information.  Reference was made earlier to not just waiting to write and those interactions and meetings are very useful.</p></speech>

Deputy Commissioner Twomey put a rough figure on it.  I want to extrapolate this a little bit.  I appreciate that he does not have the exact figure and that he will come back to the committee on that.  Could we put into brackets the numbers of individuals across the State who are working on this?  The deputy commissioner mentions between five or six and ten people, with additional personnel being brought in to support.  Would he estimate that it is fewer than 20 or more than 20 individuals; are they all sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or are they also professionals within the force?</p></speech>

It is both sworn members and civilian members.  There are skilled analysts providing the number crunching.  At the moment there are a number of people in every Garda division doing the exact same work.  We are talking about closer to 80 to 100 people now.  Every Garda division has a number of people working on it, both sworn and civilian members, supported by analysts in all of those cases.  It is complex.  It starts in 560 Garda stations and is cascades up to 103 Garda divisions where the superintendents compile the numbers.  Then it cascades again up into the 28 Garda divisions.  There are people everywhere and that is the region of the number we are talking about at the moment.</p></speech>

The witness said earlier that sergeants were responsible for inputting the records of breath tests, either at the time or a couple of days afterwards depending on shifts and workload.  Is that only done by sergeants or is it the individual member who was in charge of the checkpoint?</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Brophy's query earlier, Mr. Finn spoke of personnel who were deployed on the street and who did the breath testing and inputted the figures into the system, either entirely accurately or entirely inaccurately.  Could the witness explain if any of the fact-finding personnel under Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan are the same individuals who would have been out on the street or their senior personnel?  Has the Garda Commissioner ensured that the personnel involved are not, and never have been, those who stood at computer terminals punching in the numbers?</p></speech>

I have adequately outlined how important it is to provide information even if it is not a full picture, in order to give that information across.  The Garda Commissioner was fairly blunt in her opening statement, which I appreciate, but the matter that came to my attention yesterday on the publication of the internal audit was alarming to say the least.  The sheer timescale of that report and previous reports, with partial implementation and then slip-back, was appalling.  </p> <p>  One issue is most stark in all of this.</p><p>I will use the term misappropriation while others might use stronger terminology.  When it came to the leasing of a farm that had been earmarked for certain facility upgrades to Templemore College, which was then leased to a farmer with the proceeds ending up, I understand, in the canteen and shop account that amounted to hundreds of thousands of euro.  I do not have the report in front of me so I am guesstimating.  Those moneys were then expended on whatever was deemed appropriate.  There is a word that I would attribute to such activity.  I shall parse myself carefully to say it would appear to be embezzlement because, when one thinks about the matter, it is receiving moneys that were not rightfully one's own and putting them into, effectively, one's own account and then using the moneys for personal reasons.  </p></speech>

Again, presumably for uses for the personal benefit of the individuals who had access to the account or perhaps those within Templemore College but I am not sure.  I wish to refer to the alarming responses by the auditing service within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, indeed, the previous financial director's report from 2008.</p> <p>  Can the Commissioner any the following questions?  Are the individuals who were in charge of Templemore College up to 2008 still serving within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Clearly, I do not need to hear their names as I do not wish to identify individuals.  Are the people in management positions?  Are they no longer present in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Does the Commissioner accept the seriousness of the interim report?  Does she accept the nature of the investigations that are now required by, presumably, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and-or others?  Does she appreciate the seriousness of that issue?   </p></speech>

So much so that when I received the interim audit report, containing the recommendations, I immediately tasked the deputy commissioner and the chief administrative officer with putting in place structures to implement the recommendations, even pending waiting for the final report.

It is important to send that message to the public that the trust in the college and the financial controls that are necessary to run a modern institution are resolved and will be in place by the middle of this year.</p> <p>  As the Commissioner has said, the Commissioner directed that the interim recommendations in the report - and if I can, Chairman, I shall make a brief sidebar on this piece - were implemented before the finalisation of that audit report.  I will explain the timeline on that in a moment.  What does that mean?  It means that the report arrived formally at the audit committee last week.  In the intervening period when the draft had been prepared work had commenced on resolving the issues.  We absolutely take them most seriously.  There is a dedicated team in place to resolve these issues.  They report directly to me and will report directly to me until such time as the recommendations are finalised.  I commit to the Commissioner that that will be done by the middle of this year.  </p> <p>  I will explain the timeline between the two pieces because I think it has been a matter of public comment.  A draft report was presented to the Commissioner in or around the end of August last year.  The normal process associated with those audits is that individuals who have an interest in this matter have the opportunity to make comments.  Given the number of people involved that meant the report could not be finalised until relatively recently. </p> <p>  Deputy Farrell has raised some very serious questions.  I am conscious of other issues that are on.  I am more than happy to brief the committee, individually or collectively, around this issue.  We can get more information on that at a later date, if that would help.  </p></speech>

The Commissioner, in her statement to the committee this morning, mentioned the anonymous nature of the complaint made by a person who claimed to be a Reservist in 2014, which was sent to the Road Safety Authority, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the then Minister for Justice and Equality and the Commissioner herself.  She mentioned in her remarks that the fact the source of the document was unidentified was a hindrance.  Can she clarify why unidentified information was a hindrance to the investigation that ensued?</p></speech>

At the outset it is only fair that we put on the public record the good work that is being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the thousands of men and women who risk their lives for us on a daily basis.  We should always take cognisance of that fact in our deliberations.</p> <p>  I will make one comment on Templemore College.  It is quite remarkable that Templemore College is where the fraud squad is trained and now we have learned what has gone on.  Perhaps the matter is for discussion on another day.</p> <p>  In terms of the inflated figures for breath tests, how many individuals from the time that a garda on duty inputs his or her information do the figures go past before they are published?    </p></speech>

I will make a broad statement.</p> <p>  In relation to the audit report, I want to make the following very clear to the committee, and obviously the report has been examined in detail.  There has not been any criminal aspect identified at this time.  I just wanted to be clear on that.</p> <p>  As well as doing traffic enforcement and preventive measures, all of the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must deal with very serious threats from crime, organised crime and, indeed, from terrorism.  We have to take that in context. </p> <p>  I call on Assistant Commissioner Finn to answer the questions on sequencing.  </p></speech>

He or she fills out an authorisation to say, "You have to do ten checkpoints over the next period," or whatever.  They get put on our PULSE as an incident that needs to be done.  It is recorded on a PULSE system.  After the checkpoint is completed the member would come back.  He or she may very well ring our call centre in Castlebar from the scene, as happens in cases, and he or she can update that.  As I explained earlier on, if it was a Friday night or a very busy occasion, he or she may be unable to do that on the day so it could be the following day before it happens.</p> <p>  If there are a number of people at the checkpoint, and there might be a sergeant in charge, but if the sergeant is out there with a number of people, and sometimes we conduct super checkpoints on the motorways, it is a big grouping-----    </p></speech>

It is technically possible and that will be part of what my colleague, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan, will be doing to see is there any evidence of that.  If there was, we are confident that we could find that out because every record that is created is on our PULSE system and if there is any amendment to a record, we can track down who entered it, who changed it, when and where.

Did she not think that this was serious enough that an outside body should have conducted the audit for the Garda?  Given that the problem arose within the force, did she not think it would have been more appropriate for an outside body to have carried out this audit?  It took the Cabinet last Tuesday to decide to carry out an outside investigation.  Did she not think that this was serious enough that it warranted bringing in independent external expert to carry the audit out?</p></speech>

I had written to the Policing Authority asked them in their deliberations and consideration of the matter would they consider perhaps handing the matter over to the Garda Inspectorate or some other competent body to look at it.  The purpose of bringing in the internal audit - that was on the advice of our own audit committee - is to look at the audit that has been done and just to check the methodology and the processes, etc., that we used for that.  Our audit committee has raised the question of whether this was an audit within the meaning of an auditor's audit or whether this was an examination.  It was probably more of an examination and a review as opposed to a technical audit but, nevertheless, Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; C&uacute;al&aacute;in, instructed the head of internal audit to come in and have a look at the process that had been employed.  It was always our preference to have somebody independently look at it and that is why I wrote to the Policing Authority.</p></speech>

My concern is that, as part of their job, they have given evidence in court and people have been convicted on the basis of their evidence.  There are people in jail as a result of the evidence given by individuals who inflated figures relating to breath testing.  To bring this to its logical conclusion, if they were prepared to input figures on paper or into a computer that were incorrect, they could have given evidence in court that is incorrect and, potentially, people have been convicted of crimes and are serving sentences on the word of these members, which has to be questioned.  Is that a fair, logical conclusion?</p></speech>

The hypotheses is that people did not consider it.  We are talking about preventative checkpoints that had been done and then as the Assistant Commissioner outlined, a day or two days or after a shift or two shift later, somebody was asked to enter a figure on behalf of the team that did the checkpoint.  I absolutely accept it was administratively sloppy, as Deputy Farrell said.  Hypothetically, did somebody not remember the number and make up a number?  We have evidence to prove that there are reviews, checks and balance in respect of detections, arrests and prosecution under Operation Thor.  The rigour applied to that is a different type of rigour and the rigour that applies across the broader spectrum of policing is what I have tasked the assistant commissioner with in the context of the overhaul and review of traffic and roads policy that we are doing because that rigour may not have been applied in the same way as would be applied to other policing activities, particularly around criminal enforcement and investigations.</p></speech>

If somebody is prepared to falsify information at a lower level, then they are capable of falsifying information at a more senior level and for more serious offences.  This is extremely serious as well but if they are prepared and happy to be sloppy in the recording of information, it is possible that they will be sloppy in giving evidence in court.</p></speech>

We are here today.  We have put the checks in place and that is a lesson learned for us.</p></speech>

She is aware of the Templemore scenario, which she got into the public domain quickly enough, but I would like to give her the opportunity now to give us a heads up regarding other issues of serious concern that she has identified or that she suspects are there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#P01000"><p>I have no specific information at this point about anything but when we are identifying where we are right and where we are wrong, we are identifying bad practice but we are also identifying good practice and I will give some examples of good practice.  When we started looking at how victims were being treated, we looked at areas of good practice.  We were able to pick them out and implement them nationally but putting a standard operating procedure in that supports that practice to make sure we have consistency nationally.  We looked at our protective services bureau, for example, and we will be able to roll those out in the next few weeks.</p> <p>  I do not know what is coming down the tracks but we have systems, and we are putting structures in place, that make sure we identify issues, deal with them and put them right.  If we identify them, we will do what we did in this case and make everybody aware of it, including the Department, the Policing Authority, the audit committee, this committee and the public.  A positive thing always comes out of a negative.  One of the positive things that has come out of this discovery relates to young members around the country whom the Senator mentioned.  In January this year, we launched a code of ethics with the Policing Authority and it is important that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understands and realises that ethics is about doing the right thing when no one is watching.  If I am the garda who has to enter the figures, I have to understand their importance to traffic enforcement and to the reputation and credibility not just of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but, most important, to the trust and confidence every member of the public has in the force.  Since I became Commissioner, I have said trust and confidence is built one encounter at a time no matter who you are in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is an opportunity for us to drive that home to every member.  We spoke to our chief superintendents yesterday who said that since last Thursday, we have been inundated by individual garda&iacute; coming forward and saying, "We realise the importance of this".   There is a huge lesson in this for everybody.</p> <p>  There is no question we will deal with how this happened and that is what Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan is doing but this helps us hugely in shifting the culture.</p></speech>

In terms of the people who are carrying out this audit, led by Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, are they working 100% full time on this audit?</p></speech>

We were asked about the gravity with which we take this audit.  Mr. Michael O'Sullivan was only recently appointed assistant commissioner by the Policing Authority.  Such is the gravity that I take this situation with, I have not assigned him any responsibility other than sole responsibility for dealing with this matter.  He has given a commitment that he will provide a report within three months.  He will provide a report within one month to the authority.  For the information of the committee, there was an independent review or examination announced by Government.  We will very much welcome that.  As part of the work that Mr. O'Sullivan will do, he and his team will be there to support whatever that investigation is.</p></speech>

Has the witness received any correspondence lately of an anonymous nature or otherwise outlining other bad practices within the force not necessarily similar to what we are dealing with today?  Has the witness received any correspondence in the last six months outlining bad practices that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now investigating?</p></speech>

We will have to check and see if there is anything specific.  I can certainly come back on that.  Anything we do receive, we deal with.  It can come in at different layers of the organisation as well.</p></speech>

It does not give me any pleasure to say this, but at this stage the dogs in the street do not have confidence in the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not know how it is going to repair that.  At what point would the witness consider her position and those of her senior management team to become untenable in terms of the future of the force?</p></speech>

We are quite prepared to go out there and have courage, because it does take courage and it is not easy.  The push-back we get is immense, both internally and externally.  It takes courage, determination and drive, particularly at times of crisis.  Deputy Wallace was asking earlier about the period since 2014.  The fact is that since 2014 we have been dealing with a lot of historic reports and issues that only came to the fore at that point.  We are not afraid and we have the courage to deal with those.  We have the determination.  The Senator asks a very important question about public confidence.  What is needed is strong and visible leadership, internally and externally.  That is why we make ourselves available both internally and externally.  We are not just the policing service, we are the security service as well.  At a time when we are dealing with a threat from organised crime, a threat from the volume of crime throughout the country and a threat from international terrorism, we have to be there to show strong, visible leadership and be in a prepared state to be able to respond, which we have done to the organised crime threat and which we will continue to do.</p></speech>

Yesterday afternoon, we met all of the assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and civilian support staff from all around the country.  There was a very clear determination from everybody in that room that whatever action needs to be taken throughout the country will be taken to rebuild whatever damage is done to the trust and confidence and to which the Senator quite rightly referred.  The errors of today, which the Commissioner and members of the committee have described in many different words, will become strengths as we move on.  The strength of the organisation is built on what has happened in the past.  There is a very clear and palpable determination from the people to reach out to every member in every corner of the country to address the very issue the Senator asked about.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that the witnesses themselves are not so easily in a position to vacate their seats.  Perhaps after the next couple of speakers, if the witnesses would like, we could take a ten minute break to allow use of the facilities.  We are extending the sitting with the witnesses' co-operation, if that is in order, to allow each member an individual contribution of five minutes, which includes not just their questions but also the response to those questions.  I need the members' total co-operation on that.  We will go into private session immediately following that.  That is the order in which I intend to conduct the remainder of the meeting.  At this point, I call Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  After the next contribution, a break for ten minutes might be appropriate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I thank the Commissioner and her team for attending.  A number of colleagues have tried to tease out with limited success through no fault of their own the mechanics and timelines around the disastrous controversies that the Commissioner has outlined.  I want to home in primarily but not exclusively on the rather short statement the Commissioner made to the committee this morning.  While I concede that I do not have the legal experience or prowess of some of my colleagues, I did note the Commissioner's very careful use of language in her opening lines.  Even at this stage, I wonder why this disastrous controversy is regarded as either "grave mistakes" or "wrongdoing", especially as she later went on to concede in her oral contribution that we may be dealing with a situation in which garda&iacute; knowingly submitted false information.  The other scenario she offered up was that they did this somehow in error or through ignorance.  I was always told and directed that ignorance of the law was no defence.  Either way, I am curious to know why this is not a much more serious issue than simply a mistake or a wrongdoing.</p> <p>  In terms of the witness's own remarks and her contributions to the press over the last couple of days, I wonder whether she specifically informed the Minister for Justice and Equality before she or her organisation spoke to the press.  When did she make the Minister aware of the scale of this controversy and of the falsified breath tests?  What was the level of information that she offered to the Minister in that regard?</p> <p>  I understand we are under time pressure, but I wish to make a point that deeply troubles me and should cause this committee and the public great concern.  It relates to the second last line of the witness's opening remarks today, in which she said, "My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data."  I think the Commissioner does us and the public a terrible disservice by raising a red flag like that without expanding upon it.  She raised that red flag and then told us she has no specific evidence.  Has she limited evidence?  Has she an idea?  Has she had any kind of confidential disclosure?  For example, has she had any detail around whether this data relates to the recovery of drugs, weapons and firearms, domestic violence statistics as referred to earlier today, or the arrest and registration of sex offenders?  Where exactly are her concerns on this?  The witness has spoken about leadership and I agree with her.  At times of crisis in particular, there needs to be very strong leadership indicated.  I do not think that coming in here and raising that red flag is showing leadership.</p><p>I think it is bordering on showing contempt for this committee and indeed the public.  I would hate to think it was, worse again, in some way a red flag to try to distract from the controversies referred to today.</p><p> The Commissioner said if you overturn a stone you find something.  I noted that Senator Conway referred to it and I was glad that other members were aware of what she said.  One does not always find something when a stone is overturned.  Sometimes one finds only grass or sand or the ground.  It is a really insightful comment from the Commissioner about the scale of the cultural problems within her organisation.  That is why public confidence is at rock bottom.</p></speech>

We came in here to try to be open, frank and honest.  I would not like anyone to believe we are being contemptuous in any way whatsoever, quite the opposite.</p> <p>  As the Senator says, sometimes when one turns over a stone one finds nothing and that is very good but sometimes one finds a little pearl.  We have found good practice.  The Deputy Commissioner has outlined precisely what he is doing in respect of the reviews that are ongoing on the data quality committee.  I was not raising a red flag but saying, not in a contemptuous way at all, that the reality is that as we go through the type of really deep organisational, administrative overhaul we are going through we might find something.  Have I anything at the moment?  No I do not.  We will continue and when we do find something we will identify, address it and make it known to the people who need to know, such as the Policing Authority, the Department, this committee and the public.  That is what we will continue to do because that is important to us. </p> <p>  We can go through the detail of the sequencing of the correspondence with the Department again.  The Deputy Commissioner can go through the dates and what we did and told, and the Assistant Commissioner can give the dates of when we discovered this precisely.  We are happy to go through that with the committee. </p></speech>

She is accountable to the Minister.  Would she not have thought it was far more appropriate to engage the Minister and indeed the D&aacute;il, and even this committee, dare I say it, before this was released into the public domain?  What steps did she take over the past couple of days and weeks in respect of this controversy and her engagement with the Minister?</p></speech>

We did not have the facts but, as the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Finn, outlined, when we became aware of them and they were available to us, the Policing Authority was informed, everybody was informed.  The Assistant Commissioner Mr. Finn, the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Twomey, and I had a meeting with the Minister in her Department on the Monday morning.  At that stage we had the detail that was outlined and we shared that with the Minister and the Department.</p></speech>

They relate to the broad brush of our data and our data retention.  It identified specifically crime classification, reclassification, attention and complaints.  It recommended that there were too many people involved in that entire process up along the chain and there was no strict rigidity in how we dealt with it.</p> <p>  On Monday, in our information centre in Castlebar, we made the decision that it will become the centre of excellence for the country.  All decisions on classification, reclassification and detection will be made in that centre.  In the work over the past year we have been considering the processes and procedures.  We had to get two things into place, one was additional staff and one was additional information technology, IT, facilities to do that.  The staff have now been provided.  With effect from next Monday all stations in the northern region of the country will enter into this process.  In essence what will happen now is that a crime will be classified by Castlebar, by the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  The quality assurance will be provided by the same centre.  Any decision about reclassification will be made by those particular people.  They will assure the quality of all the data that comes in.  That will cascade around the country and will take control of it.  That is a clear recommendation from the Garda Inspectorate.  It goes a step further in that it takes out an individual layer the inspectorate suggested should be there.  On reviewing it we took that out.  </p> <p>  We will review the crime classification, the reclassification and the detections, for example, a new domestic violence policy is coming out.  The Commissioner spoke about the protective service bureau that has been established in the centre.  It quality reviews incidents daily.  The divisional protective service units will be in place next month, May, in three divisions around the country and that will continue to roll out.  The domestic violence policy will ensure that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trained in doing a risk assessment in advance of the incident; doing a risk assessment while at the incident and in the interaction that will take place with the various non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that work in this area.  There is a great deal of work coming through in that specific area.  Our most vulnerable victims will have access to fully trained, fully resourced investigators, interviewers and people who can deal with these dreadful issues that they encounter.  That will start from next month.  That is the process and that is the work this committee has done.  It is an ongoing process.  It takes time from a resourcing perspective and a research perspective.  That work will continue.  It starts on Monday and we expect that it will be completed by the end of the year.</p> <p>  The committee is aware from previous presentations that we are unable to properly record our call data.  There is an interim IT fix coming in.  It has started and we expect it to be everywhere throughout the country by the end of June, and by the end of the year there will be a form of integration with police using leading systems effectively, PULSE.  We are dealing with very old technology and we are trying to bring that up to modern standards.  We are putting a fix into something that is 25 years old.  That is where we are coming from.  We have repeated on several occasions that where there are issues of wrongdoing or matters of concern that we need to tell people we will do that.  That is what we are doing in this instance.  It is unfortunate that we do not have all the answers everybody requires because we took the unprecedented step of putting the information into the public domain when we felt it was the right thing to do from a cultural perspective.</p></speech>

The Commissioner might elaborate on the protocol in terms of what is currently happening, not just in terms of investigation but where problems, wrongdoing and negligence has been identified, the next steps that will be taken.  Also, to go back to Deputy Clare Daly's point, will the Commissioner accept that she, too, has a responsibility and that ultimately, as Commissioner, the buck will stop with her?  Given the scale of this problem, there is a great degree of lack of public confidence in her and in her organisation, as well as among the membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does she concede and accept that she is as liable to be held responsible for her actions?</p></speech>

As members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we are all responsible and accountable; I am no different in that regard.  I am a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the same as everybody else.  There is a statutory and legislative framework in place that can deal with that.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the processes in place.  I outlined earlier that Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan has been appointed to undertake that process, and it is important that the committee understands that it is a process.  His investigation will identify what precisely happened, how it happened and who was responsible, and then the appropriate action will be recommended.</p></speech>

Would Senator Frances Black and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee mind if, following that, we then had the toilet break for ten minutes following which we will resume?  By way of clarification for members, it was always my intention that we would break for ten minutes, which will bring us up to about 12 noon.  When we resume, Senator Black and Senator Clifford-Lee will be the first speakers.  I will then offer members the opportunity, and it is not obligatory that they take it - in fact, it would be great if some did not - to have a further five-minute bite, so to speak.  I will call members in exactly the order in which they contributed in the first sequence as they indicated, and as I have personally noted them.  That is how we will do our business.  Members should remember that the five minutes will have to be strictly applied.  It will be for the question and also the reply, following which we will thank our visitors and go into private session.</p></speech>

That is misguided on her part.</p> <p>  With regard to the figure of 14,700 we have heard about since the press conference, can the Commissioner inform the committee if it is the case that each of those 14,700 prosecutions were carried out as a result of the persons involved not being afforded the opportunity to pay a fixed charge notice?  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Assistant Commissioner Finn has clarified for the committee that the 14,700 cases brought before the court and from which convictions arose were issues where summons were issued without them being given an opportunity to pay a fixed charge notice.  That is what he said in his press release on 27 March.  My question is on the review, which identified 1,130 cases where summons had been issued for offences where the fixed charge notice had already been paid.  This is an additional number of persons who have been convicted before our courts; I presume some of them were convicted.</p></speech>

The Garda  had become aware of this on 6 February.  Why did it take until 16 May to issue an instruction that all summonses would be withdrawn?  Why did the Garda leave it that long?  The reason I ask these questions is that I want to try to understand the disjointed nature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is management which has responsibility for supervising and ensuring all pieces of information.  These are citizens who were being prosecuted falsely.  As such, why did it take the Garda three months to issue an instruction that summonses should be withdrawn?  It seems that there was a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to the fact that the Garda knew three months earlier that it was prosecuting people unlawfully.</p></speech>

Summonses are created centrally in the GISC, but they are also created at local level because it is not an automated system.  It was only in April 2016 that a specific case came before a court.  At that stage, it was evident that we had a bigger problem than we had thought originally - the NCT as a specific, sole issue.  It was evaluated and examined and only at that stage was there was an awareness that it could apply to other offences where it had changed from a summons to an FCN over the course from 2006 on.  There was a fix and an instruction was issued to withdraw summonses.</p></speech>

A garda rang the GISC call centre to ask if it was still issuing summonses and said it should not be doing so because it was now covered by an FCN.  It had come in on 1 January 2014 and we began an investigation to look at the NCT because we thought that was where the problem was.  Hence, we went back to the first date to see if more NCT summonses had been issued and, if so, what was the problem related to it.</p></speech>

She said the letter contained information that the Director of Public Prosecutions had indicated that a review should be extended to include cases before 2014.  This letter was issued to the Minister in 2017, but the Garda had become aware that this was a wider issue a full year before that.  Within ten days of issuing the Minister the letter setting out the 1,781 figure, the Garda provided figures of 14,700 at a press conference.  There is still a serious question over the attitude within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the false prosecution of citizens of the State and the efforts it has made to identify each and every individual in the first place.  The Garda had to be directed or asked by the Director of Public Prosecutions to do so.  The fact is that it took it a long time to identify the individuals involved.</p> <p>  I am conscious of what the Chairman said and have a list of questions relating to------</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I do not have an opportunity to go into the issue of the falsification of data.  I presume it is a criminal offence for any garda to falsify the data of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps the Commissioner might confirm that it is.  She has given the committee a very clear impression, or I take it from her comments, that this is a case of "Back me or sack me".  She has referred to the statutory role of holding the Commissioner to account.  As somebody who has the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at heart, she will know more than most that there comes a time when garda&iacute; rely on the confidence of the public, which is sacrosanct.  There must be the confidence of the public for rank and file garda&iacute; and also for senior management.  It is clear that support is ebbing and that, in terms of management and her own position, it is gone.  The majority of Members of the D&aacute;il do not support or cannot express confidence in her.  Does she believe there is a responsibility at a certain point for senior management, regardless of the legal provisions to hold the Commissioner to account, to do something in the best interests of the force to restore confidence?</p></speech>

Why has all of this happened?  What was the thinking behind it?  It is awful that the number of breathalyser tests was overstated by 1 million.  Has this been used as a justification for Garda overtime?  I know we spoke about bonuses earlier.  Were garda&iacute; getting overtime for this and, if so, can we put a value on it?  What was their thinking in doing so many breath tests?  That is really the only question I have.  I could ask many other questions, but I am conscious of our time constraints.  My question relates to an aspect of this matter that jumps out for me.</p></speech>

The reality of the culture, in which there are several sub-cultures, is that traditionally we have always been focused on waiting for a crime to happen and then investigating it.  We do a pretty good job of that.  We are good at crisis management and operational decisions.  We have changed, with this shift in culture, to ensure a focus on prevention.  This is in everything from road traffic all the way through to the likes of the Garda national protective services bureau and the domestic violence assessment tool that we spoke about.</p> <p>  We are trying to shift to that culture.  We are trying to make it valued in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that our job, in the first place, is to prevent crime from happening.  When it does happen we are there, we investigate the crime professionally and see it all the way through the courts system.</p></speech>

We certainly agree, however, with the point the Senator is making.  We do not have a specific offence of domestic violence as in other jurisdictions.  Other jurisdictions have a specific domestic violence offence.  We do not.  We have an offence for which that motive can be considered.

It is very difficult for us to believe any of the information the witnesses have given us.  They have said that in their attempt to clear up incorrect data, they found out that there were one million breath tests carried out, despite the fact that they had previously said two million had been carried out.  In the same breath they expect us to believe, and have stated repeatedly, that there were 400,000 checkpoints carried out during that time.</p> <p>  I put the question to the assistant commissioner, how in God's name could that be possible?  That would mean, in effect, that every checkpoint tested approximately two and half people, when the witnesses know that the guideline is that a minimum of five should be carried out to make it worthwhile even to set up the checkpoint in the first place.  Is it not more credible that, instead of having carried out 400,000 checkpoints, in actual fact it was probably the case that there were only 200,000 checkpoints carried out?</p><p>If that is the case, as the figures seem to indicate, is it not the case that our entire road safety policy and everything that everybody who uses the roads believes the Garda is doing has been turned on its head?</p></speech>

If that is possible, does the Commissioner still think it is acceptable that, on foot of the first investigation into the southern region where she knew the Garda had such a problem, she has still not been able to supply proper full audit information to this committee, the Policing Authority, the Minister for Justice and Equality or anybody else?  She did not seem to take this at all seriously.</p></speech>

It is a huge disappointment that we have not been able to, but we have tried to give an overview of the exhaustive searches and the compilation of material that has to be done.  That will actually help Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan in his job because that mining, if one likes, has been done.  The data are available - not completed yet but nearing completion.  That will assist the assistant commissioner in his investigation and the speed of his investigation.  Indeed, it will greatly assist the external investigation that has been set up by the Policing Authority because the information will now be available in a more usable format than the initial audit was able to get.</p></speech>

The Commissioner talked about turning over stones; I think we need to look at moving the boulder and seeing what lies beneath it.  Beneath stones there will be stones.  We can get into philosophical analogies.  I think it goes deeper than unwinding the exact timeline.  If the Commissioner cannot answer this question today I ask her to reply to the committee secretariat.  During the 2006 to 2009 period, who approved the bonus system for each individual senior garda?  What were the specific criteria?  Were there any linkages with traffic data?</p> <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn said that the assistant commissioners set the targets themselves.  Does he want to qualify those remarks?  Did the assistant commissioners set their own targets to get bonuses from the State in that period or what was the system of bonus allocation at that time?</p></speech>

This sergeant prepared a report for his district officer before retiring last year in which he pointed out that the official figures for checkpoints completed could be up to twice the number actually performed.  He stated that the reply he got dismissed his concerns and criticised him.  Were the targets for checkpoints between 2011 and 2016 unrealistic, given the Garda resources on the ground?  Who set the targets for checkpoints?  Were there any penalties for not meeting the targets?  Were any garda&iacute; promoted on the basis of fraudulently claiming to meet these targets?</p><p>The Commissioner spoke earlier about the lack of resources, which may have played a role in underachieving in certain areas.  She is the boss.  Given that she has only recently put together an expensive team of individuals of her choosing to deal with the Charleton inquiry, she clearly has the wherewithal to determine where resources are used.  If I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality how resources were allocated, she would tell me it was an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does the Commissioner think she could use the resources at her disposal more effectively?</p></speech>

In the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is personnel.  The Commissioner is no doubt aware, as are all Members of both Houses, that information provided to the Garda at a local level is extremely important in terms of the public perception or interpretation of the performance of the Garda in terms of detection rates and so on.  We have had issues with the statistics, as the Commissioner is aware.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is standing over the statistics and publishing them.  I am happy that more recent reports indicate at the bottom that they are produced by the CSO.  However, the CSO assesses and produces information for joint policing committees, JPCs, and for this House based on core information provided to it by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the Commissioner's opening statement, she has called into question whether statistics from PULSE and elsewhere are valid.  The figures being produced on behalf of the Garda by the CSO are, therefore, potentially flawed.  We earlier talked about the flaws in the cultural approach of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which have led to this.  Can we believe the figures that are being produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

Gurchand Singh, the head of the Garda analysis service, works very closely with the CSO in this regard.  He sits on a working group with the CSO.</p> <p>  We are extremely anxious.  As the Deputy rightly said, the Garda is engaged in evidence-based and intelligence-led policing so the statistics it produces need to be accurate.  This matter is very important.  I have tasked the deputy commissioner in charge of operations with ensuring that we review all data we have produced.   I hope the involvement of the CSO gives some confidence to the public.  However, we do not take that for granted.  We must ensure that the reliability and validity of our data is flawless.</p></speech>

During my 13 years in politics, there have always been questions about the figures produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda is the source of the data.  If there is an issue with the production of the information, it makes no difference how trustworthy the CSO is, it will not be able to interpret the data accurately.  I accept the Commissioner's point and I understand the basis upon which she makes it.  I am sure that Deputy Commissioner Twomey is doing his best.  However, the bottom line is, if the information is tainted, how can we trust it?</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate's report was to employ a data quality manger.  That step alone will not fix the issues.

Deputies are being called to the D&aacute;il for an imminent vote.</p> <p>  As I have been saying for a number of years, the amount of controlled drugs that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is holding is bizarre.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has asked the Commissioner for a report on this.  The most recent figures I have are for the period 2010 to 2014.  They show that of the &euro;529 million worth of controlled substances held by the Garda, only &euro;35 million worth has been destroyed.  That does not take account of the previous amount of drugs.  Can the Commissioner reassure me that the information that has been provided to me is accurate and that in the last five years the Garda does hold over &euro;500 million worth of controlled substances?</p></speech>

That is representative of the work that is going on every day.  Exhibits must be retained while cases are before the courts.  That happens in drugs cases as well as other cases.</p></speech>

I do not accept the Commissioner's contention that it is highly unlikely and most improbable that figures were not redacted when they were sent to senior management.  It would be worthwhile to reflect on that.  It is possible that this is being orchestrated by a smaller group rather than being systematic.</p> <p>  Does the Commissioner have any concern that statistics for complaints made by members of the public against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been altered or changed in any way to make the force look better and that there are fewer complaints recorded than have actually been lodged?</p> <p>  When did the Commissioner engage with the DPP on the fixed charge notices?</p> <p>  I hope the Commissioner can regain public confidence.  If she does, she will put Lazarus in the ha'penny place.</p></speech>

I am always very keen to parse that.  The Commissioner referred to "mistakes and wrongdoings".  To my mind, "wrongdoings" constitute immoral or illegal acts.  There is no other way of interpreting the word.  It might sound less dramatic than words like "immoral" and "illegal", but there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that we are certainly talking about wrongdoings that equal immoral or illegal acts.  Without question, there is a public sense - not just a political sense - that all this must have consequences.  Some members of the committee have reflected the fear in this regard.  The Commissioner said earlier that "we all take responsibility".  She is well aware of the adage that when we all take responsibility, nobody takes responsibility.  Nobody is responsible.  I am not putting the Commissioner in a difficult position when I say, as Chairman of this committee and as an elected representative of my constituency and my community over many years, that I believe there is a critically important need to address this matter in a substantive and forensic manner.  There must be a clear understanding that wrongdoing is an immoral or illegal act and must have consequences.</p><p> I ask the Commissioner to respond as she deems appropriate to a final comment.  In the closing part of her opening statement, she summed up what has taken place by saying "at worst, this was deception".  Again, this is a question of language.  I do not know whether the word "deception" is a sufficiently strong portrayal of what has taken place here.  Our understanding of the word "deception" is that it means the act of deceiving.  It involves a person having someone else believe something that he or she patently knows to be false, or setting out quite purposely to have somebody else believe something he or she knows to be false.  It is a very serious matter.  This is important because words like "wrongdoings" and "deception" do not quite hit the pitch in what we are discussing here.  Some key questions arise in this context.  Who were those responsible seeking to deceive?  That question has not been asked.  Were they seeking to deceive An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, senior Garda management or the public?  The Commissioner's very interesting hypothesis may very well be the case, but it is important that in the production of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report, there is clarity as to the purpose, intent or motivation, or all three, of those involved.  Motivation is an area of clear interest.  What was behind their action?  What was their purpose?  Was there a return or reward for acting as they did?  It is important for the answers to these questions to be established properly and placed in the public arena.  I hope this exercise will be as comprehensive as the Commissioner has assured the committee this morning it will be.  I invite her to respond to the issues I have highlighted and to make any other closing remarks she would like to make.</p></speech>

We will not be able to identify anything other than that until Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan and those involved in the external investigation carry out their work.  We had a deep and robust discussions on these matters when we were crafting the statement.  As I said, what we have at the moment is "at worst....deception".  We concur with the full description of deception as set out by the Chairman just now.  That, at worst, is what we have at the moment.  At best, what we have at the moment is incompetence.  That will remain the position until Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan carries out his work and the external investigation concludes.  Beyond that, we do not know.  I will conclude by giving the committee an assurance, as I did at the end of my opening statement, that we will identify those who are responsible and accountable for this and we will hold them to account.</p></speech>

I think the detailed and incisive exchange we have had has been very useful.  I offer a sincere "go raibh maith agat" to everyone who has contributed.  Before I adjourn the meeting, I would like to notify members that it had been planned to continue this meeting in private session, but that is no longer the intention.  I will notify members through the secretariat of the plan to reconvene the joint committee next Tuesday, 4 April, to address the issues that have been highlighted here today.  At that meeting, members will have an opportunity to express their views, consider any collective action we may wish to take as a committee and decide whether we wish to enter into any correspondence.  Committee Room 3 is available on Tuesday between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.  We will endeavour to establish the appropriate time.  We will notify members to that effect before the day is out.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
