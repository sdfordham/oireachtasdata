    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#B00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as permanent witness to the committee and he is accompanied today by Mr. Shane Carton, director of audit.</p> <p>  There are just a few items of correspondence since our meeting of yesterday.  In category A correspondence, we have correspondence items 374, 378 and 379, the opening statements from the University of Limerick, University College Cork and Dundalk Institute of Technology, in advance of today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish those?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to meetings.  Correspondence items 384 (i) to (iii) were received from the HSE yesterday as follow-up to our engagement with the director general last week.  The letter also states that there was not time to respond to the further questions sent yesterday morning.  Members may not have had time to read that letter, which arrived last night.  In any event, as a result of yesterday's meeting, we sent three further requests for information and the HSE stated it did not have time yesterday.  Given that we are still awaiting further responses, I believe that the best course of action now is to put the HSE officials on notice that they may be required to appear before the committee the week after next.  We could decide a definite position on that at our meeting next Thursday when we receive the correspondence.  We have received a response to what we requested last week.  Yesterday morning we asked for three further pieces of information.  Understandably, that has not been received yet.  The HSE has indicated it will deal with it as soon as possible.  I suggest we wait until we get that.  In advance of receiving that we should now put its officials on notice to expect to appear the following week.</p></speech>

We will put them on advance notice, even at this point.  That is as much as we can do this morning.  We can note and publish the response received yesterday evening in any event.</p> <p>  In category C, correspondence item 380C received on 29 March 2017 from Waterford Intellectual Disability Association relates to matters raised during our meeting with the HSE last week.  We can note and publish that.  People may want to consider it.  It relates to the case of Grace in the south-east region.  People can take that into account for the next meeting.  We will not be opening up new topics now.  We will be very specific when they come in next time.  We want to deal with it conclusively the next time they are here.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 380 is correspondence from Deputy Mary Lou MacDonald on matters relevant to our meeting with University of Limerick today.  Is that noted?  Does the Deputy want to comment?</p></speech>

The only difference since yesterday is that on 22 June we have scheduled the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with its accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General special report No. 95 on financial reporting in the public sector.  We will need to arrange a separate meeting on the special report published earlier this week on the collection of motor taxation.  I have not had time to review it yet.</p> <p>  Also on the work programme, we have always said we would come back to the section 38 and 39 issue and the 2015 financial statements of the HSE.  That will all happen in May or June.  We will call the HSE back to deal with its overall financial position.  HSE officials have been here to deal with specific issues, such as Console and the Grace case.</p></speech>

We also have very serious issues with the Garda training college in Templemore.  We do not know who the Commissioner might be by the time we get around to it.  Irrespective of who it is, that person should appear before this committee along with the Accounting Officer for the Department.  The Chairman said that another Accounting Officer should appear before the committee in respect of the training college.</p></speech>

It relates to the repayment of fines.  Those fines would have been paid into the Courts Service and the repayments will need to start with it.  It is part of the process.</p></speech>

Certainly with the training college some serious issues arise relating to governance and how accounts were managed.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General audit the Garda training college in the first instance?</p></speech>

Most of the expenses of the college are charges on the Garda Vote.  Yes, I audit the college itself.</p></speech>

I believe there was a further report in 2010.  There were some changes, which were then reversed.  At any point was the Comptroller and Auditor General aware of very serious issues?  Did he ever address them in any of his reports?</p></speech>

They were not known publicly - that is my reading of the report - and we were not told about them.  We were not aware of the work that was done in 2008.  It was done within the finance-----</p></speech>

If that is the case, then there was an internal audit of which the Comptroller and Auditor General was not made aware.</p></speech>

It was an exercise that was undertaken, as I understand it, by the finance division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Internal audit only became aware of it at some point.  That is my reading of the report that was published yesterday.</p></speech>

Is the latter separate from the vote for the Department of Justice and Equality?</p></speech>

It is also stated that the new wording will have to be agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  What is the process for amending the appropriation account reports?</p></speech>

We were aware of this from last year.  From 31 May last, we were aware that internal audit was about to go in and carry out an exercise there.  In the circumstances and given what we knew about it at the time, we asked the Accounting Officer to put something into the SIFC-----</p></speech>

Does it mean that will then form part of a more in-depth look at the training college?</p></speech>

Obviously, they must also deal with the Templemore issue.  This matter has been referred to us by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we have to deal with it.  Separately, we have a meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality on its Vote and the issue of direct provision on Thursday, 11 May.  When do members want to start scheduling the meeting we were talking about?</p></speech>

I am not disagreeing with bringing in officials.  My concern is that it is premature at this stage.  We need to allow time for the full facts to be gleaned because we do not have them at this stage.  There is no point in bringing in officials when we will not get the answers that we desire.  We should wait a little longer.  That is my view.</p></speech>

I was more than taken aback yesterday evening to hear on the floor of the D&aacute;il that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had threatened, through the Chairman, to injunct this committee.  I would like the Chairman to give us an explanation as to when that happened and the context in which it happened.  We should have been made aware of that fact.  That is my first question.  Second, if it is the case - I take the Chairman's word and I have no reason to disbelieve him - that such a threat was made against this committee we need to take that matter head-on.  We need to correspond with the Minister for clarification as to his rationale.  As the Chairman stated yesterday, the Minister clearly did not injunct us and it is not a case of withdrawing the threat.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, are elected on an equal basis, as is the Minister or anybody else, to come in here and do our job.  I am of the view that we are due an apology for that deeply ill-judged threat made against us.</p> <p>  I also want to say this - I was a member of the previous committee and I am a member of this committee.  That it is a matter of record.  It was also alleged on the floor of the House by another member of Government that this committee had brought politics into disrepute in the previous D&aacute;il.  I want to make it absolutely clear, as somebody who was a member of the previous committee and who might be regarded as one of its disreputable members by those in government, that we did our work fairly and without fear or favour.  Dare I say it, we did our work very well.  We did it on a collegial basis.  Far from bringing politics into disrepute, I would argue that we injected a level of optimism among the general public that some level of accountability in Irish political life was possible.  I am referring to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I was taken aback because it is not his form to be aggressive in this manner.  He was referring matters relating to Angela Kerins and Rehab.  For the record, we won the court case relating to the latter.  That might upset elements of the political establishment, including some here.  We actually were vindicated in the courts.  I wanted to make those points as well.</p> <p>  My question is as follows.  Having dropped that bombshell last evening, the Chairman now needs to explain to us when it happened.  Was it during that conversation to which the Chairman referred previously when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had sought to speak to him that the threat was made?  What are we going to do about it?  I would not be happy to simply carry on regardless.  There are those who would wish to spancel the work not only of this committee but also of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A message needs to come from this committee that neither will happen.</p></speech>

I am not trying to bring the Chairman's character into disrepute but I thought it was opportunistic to say it under the rule of privilege in the D&aacute;il when it should have been said to us here and the Minister should have been afforded an opportunity to respond.  Also, there is very much an assumption on this committee- with which I have difficulty - that the Minister approached the Chairman or that we seem to believe that the Minister approached the Chairman rather than it being the case that the Chairman approached him.</p><p>We do not know what happened and this scenario is all alleged.  I am not saying the Chairman's words are untrue and conversely, I cannot say what the Minister has said is untrue.  We have a difficulty and we must get to the bottom of it.  It is incorrect, however, to assume the Minister for Finance's bona fides are incorrect and I was very disappointed by that stance.   </p><p> My integrity, as a Fine Gael Deputy on this committee, is important.  Therefore, I cannot stand over a report the words within which are not to my satisfaction.  I am entitled to take such a stance.  If I believe the rest of the committee is using political manoeuvres, then I am entitled to say so just as much as anyone else is entitled to say it about us.  That is all I want to say.</p></speech>

That is outrageous.  Throughout all of this process politics did not come into it.</p> <p>  I shall talk about the injunction in a minute and I might not be so gracious.  I thank the Chairman for chairing these meetings fairly, under extreme difficulty and following serious attacks on a constant basis in the media and, in particular, leaks that I would say did not come from any of us present today.  That raises questions in itself to the point where I said that we should not have private meetings any more.  I suggested that we should have public meetings in order that we can determine the narrative.  To state there was political manoeuvring is disgusting really - over a process politics never came into until the words "not advisable" cropped up.  Simply, Fine Gael wanted to insert the words "not advisable".  We changed our words to make the report as soft as possible to say not procedurally correct.</p></speech>

Let us park this thing about politics because the claim has been made, on purpose, by Fine Gael.</p> <p>  I was taken totally by surprise by the Chairman's comment in the D&aacute;il.  In the first instance, he should have told us about it.  Perhaps he can clarify why did not tell us.  If he remembers the private session, I was the person who raised the comment in terms of the Chairman's conversation with the Minister and I said I was unhappy.  I referred to a scenario in which pressure was being applied for us to change our words and asked what would happen if he spoke to each member of the committee in turn etc.  I raised the matter with the Chairman at the time in private.  Each of us are equal.  It is a serious threat if that was the threat.  It adds to the serious pressure put on this committee.  I shall leave my comments at that and look forward to his clarification.</p></speech>

It is important, in the first instance, that we do not allow issues like this to become a sideshow or act as a distraction because this very much mirrors what happened when NAMA first came before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with the committee's examination of Project Eagle.  At the time there were unprecedented attacks on the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, on him personally and on his staff.  We have dealt with all of that in our report.  There was an attempt, on NAMA's part, to set a fire somewhere else and for it to be the narrative.  There was an element of that yesterday when the Minister was in the D&aacute;il.  As the Chairman quite rightly pointed out, he wanted to make the debate about him and that issue.  We need to keep the focus on the reason we carried out the report.  We have a job of work to do to ensure there was value for money and proper examinations were carried out.</p> <p>  Having said that, it was outrageous that the Minister for Finance called on Deputy Fleming, as Chairman of this committee, to resign for doing his job.  As I said yesterday in the D&aacute;il, it is important that members of this committee reaffirm their confidence in him as Chair.  I certainly have confidence in him as Chair.  It was outrageous that he was asked to resign on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  The Minister cast aspersions on members of the committee and its work.  He claimed that we did not fairly carry out our work and did not conduct a proper examination.  I take great offence at his claim because we sat here, as the Chairman knows.  The members of this committee in this room were the ones who sat through nearly all of the hearings.</p></speech>

We just did our job, without fear or favour.  We have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As I said yesterday and will say again, I was not a member of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  There seems to be a particular political slant on this committee during this term that was not evident in the past.  That is deeply unfortunate because it is undermining the committee.  That situation manifested itself on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday.  There were slurs made against my party, and against me personally, by the Minister.  He did so simply because he was upset or annoyed about two words that were used in the report.  If anything, we could have gone much further in our criticisms.  Our report was very fair and we need to respond.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that we cannot leave this matter at that.  It would be completely unacceptable on our part.  We have a responsibility to protect our integrity and that of the role of the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We should do so by asking the Minister for an apology.  He should have the good grace to make an apology.</p></speech>

They happened a couple of times when Teachta Connolly spoke.  Every time that we raise issues that are directed at the Minister or a Government representative, the Government representatives on the committee interrupt us.

Why the constant interruptions when we make points?  A fair procedure would be to put one's hand up, wait until the person makes his or her point and if one disagrees with the person, then one can come back in.  The constant interruptions are a source of irritation for those of us who simply want to do our job fairly.</p></speech>

There is no us.  Deputies Cassells, Aylward, the Chairman and I do not meet upstairs on the fourth floor to decide what our angle is on any given day.  I have the experience of having been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for quite a few years.  I was also a member of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and recall that the debates during private session were extremely heated, and intra-party at times.  Deputy Michael McGrath and I were on both committees, from a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective.  At times we were at each others throats, for want of a better expression, as was everybody else and we were also in dispute with the clerk to the committee and the  committee secretariat at times.  I am saddened by the politicisation of today's matter.  Yes, it involved criticism being levelled at the office of the Minister for Finance in terms of the scheduling of a meeting, of which the timing was inappropriate.  As I said in the House yesterday, it was absolutely clear, which the minutes prove, that the man was not in town to collect for the Red Cross.  It was another timing matter in terms of meeting these people, if they wanted to, at some other date in time.  That was wrong.</p> <p>  For different reasons some of us are absent for part or all of a meeting.  At a critical stage when we were talking, and we had a lengthy discussion on the wording of the report, no Fine Gael representative was in the room.  None.  In fact, it was clear it was about to come up as the next item on the agenda.</p></speech>

The person of whom we speak is box office so they had to come in, all guns blazing, to defend this and that was totally inappropriate.  I would speak much more strongly if I could get away with it but I will pick my words.  It is disingenuous to accept the word &quot;advisable&quot; while, on the other hand, going against an entire report because <i>en bloc</i>they have decided as a party not to support it.  My party colleagues, Deputies Cassells and Aylward, and I do not decide <i>en bloc</i>what to do and I have not seen this happen in any committee in 15 years here.  It is fundamentally wrong.  I have great time for the Minister and I praised him in the House yesterday, as I have many times for his good actions through the years, but he must be losing some of his match fitness because it was an own goal to call for the head of one constitutional committee of the Oireachtas and to level abuse at the integrity of all people on the committee, including Fine Gael members.  If they really feel as they say they do, why do they not resign from the committee?</p></speech>

If it is appropriate for me to criticise the actions of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on a given issue, I will not hesitate to do it.  I did so in the banking inquiry, as Deputy Pearse Doherty and others will agree.  On live television, I robustly questioned party colleagues who were also box office in my party.  They would have respect at an Ard-Fheis but this is a long way away from Ard-Fheiseanna.</p> <p>  Anecdotal evidence suggests the Minister apologised to the Chairman yesterday and last night.

The Committee of Public Accounts has to be beyond reproach and beyond politicisation and we need to embrace that from now on.  I wanted to see unity in regard to reports and it was unfortunate it came down to literally one word.  We have a lot of serious work to do and we need to deal with what happened yesterday and move on.  We had some very serious issues regarding the Grace case last week and there are some outstanding questions.  There are questions relating to the Garda Commissioner, who is before another committee next door.  The issue is important to me because I represent the area.  We are all capable of working together in a non-political way and I have seen the committee work together well.  I am very proud of the way we can support one another in here, share information and work together on questions though politically we would be adversaries.  We need to get back to what this committee is good at and move on.  I do not mean we should forget about it but we need to deal with it and move onto the work programme - that is what we are here for.  There is an incredible amount of work to do on some serious issues and we should focus on that.  That is my priority as Vice Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#E00800"><p>Members have asked me questions and I will explain the full background.  I explained previously that the sequence commences with the letter of 15 February 2017 from the Minister to this committee, which is reproduced in full in the report.  Before the members had an opportunity to consider that letter, the Minister was before the finance committee dealing with Estimates.  He took the opportunity to speak at that committee about the letter he had sent and that is fine.  I read the last sentence of the letter which stated: "I am also sure that any conclusions which do materialise in the Committee's final report will be based on available evidence, due and fair process and logical reasoning which will withstand challenge."  When I read this, I took it to refer to a legal challenge.  The letter had that reference in it and I took it to mean that we were to be on notice that the report might be subject to challenge.</p> <p>  Later on the same day, in the restaurant, the Minister asked me to have a word and I agreed.  I have good personal relations with the Minister, and the Minister has not disputed that this took place.  He said we had not been fair and should have given him an opportunity to come in and speak to the committee.  I replied that he had not been fair.  He was here for five hours and was the only one in possession of the information.  He could not accuse us of not asking him about things which he did not know of.  The conversation continued about who had been unfair to whom and concluded with the Minister saying, "You know I can injunct you".  That was the end of the conversation and, having read the letter a few hours earlier, I could see that this was the frame of mind the Minister was in when writing it.  The extra bit was confirmation and an advance on the previous situation but it was not new ground.  It was highly serious, nevertheless, and I told members of the committee.</p> <p>  It is important for the Committee of Public Accounts that I make this statement, which is broader than my discussion with the Minister.  I think the fact that some people tried to put pressure on the committee when we issued our report did not undermine the committee but strengthened it.  It will strengthen the committee to be seen as fearless and not prepared to take a rebuke from anybody.  My priority as Chairman was to get a report agreed and I felt that to overelaborate further, notwithstanding that there was a reference to a legal threat in the letter, which every member could have read themselves, would further upset the possibility of getting an agreed report.</p><p>I am only new to this job since last year.  I take it as normal that the Chairman of a Committee of Public Accounts will come under pressure from a variety of sources.  I take it as par for the course and it does not influence how I am.  I want to go on to talk about two further people who threatened legal action in respect of this committee and its proceedings..  First, in my conversations with the chairman of NAMA over a period, he first mentioned that legal advice was being considered but the high financial cost to NAMA was something that had to be taken into account.  That remark did not influence me or my work here.  I am just putting it on record.  </p></speech>

I took it as par for the course in my job as Chairman to deal with that and move on.</p> <p>  I am now putting on record that I think the fact we did our work has strengthened the committee, despite people's efforts to undermine us.  We are a stronger committee for it.  With regard to NAMA, I have served on this committee for a couple of terms and, during those terms and perhaps this term, I have often been critical of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and why issues were coming to light that had not been highlighted earlier.  I was told NAMA had a dossier prepared of all my previous comments on the Comptroller and Auditor General over a period of several years and that, if we were backing up the Comptroller and Auditor General, that would be used to show that I had no problem criticising him on previous occasions but was not necessarily going down that road now.  I was made aware that was there.  I have no problem; I am proud of everything I have said during previous PAC meetings.</p> <p>  I am just saying, as Chairman, I have come under pressures from three sources, none of which influenced me one way or the other in terms of completing our work.  I actually think we are stronger for having withstood that pressure, despite people's efforts to limit what we might actually say.  The conversation with the Minister is there.</p> <p>  On Deputy MacSharry&rsquo;s point, I personally hold no personal angst against the Minister for Finance.  We are here a long time and we have good, friendly and cordial relations.  He came over to me last night during the course of the vote on the floor of the House to shake my hand and ask if we could make up and move on.  We shook hands and said, "Let us move on."  There is no personal angst but there is a serious professional disagreement between us.  </p> <p>  I know people will be surprised by what I am saying.  In our report, there are two paragraphs out of 101 pages in respect of our comments on the Minister.  There are three full pages from the Minister on his view of what we had to say about him.  In fact, in terms of fairness, he has been given far more space for his views.  For anyone to suggest he did not have an opportunity, there are three pages of a letter from him on his views of the matter in our report.  That is more than fair play.  </p></speech>

He is right that it is par for the course in terms of the role he sits in, and that this will happen from time to time.  However, to be fair to members of this committee, when we are preparing a report, if there is a threat of that nature from a Minister for Finance, we should be aware of it.  Certainly if there were threats from senior officials &ndash; and I think we should know who that senior official is because that senior official tried to thwart the work of this committee, not you personally as Chairman but all of us - we should have been made aware of that notwithstanding the Chairman&rsquo;s assertion that it strengthened us because we carried on regardless.  We would have done that anyway.  With respect, that information should have been shared with us, although I accept the Chairman used his judgment.   On the exchanges in the D&aacute;il yesterday, comments were made publicly in the D&aacute;il by the Minister.  It is not acceptable that you just have two boys who shake hands and make up.  That is politics of old.</p></speech>

As the comments were made in the D&aacute;il Chamber, they need to be corrected there.  I agree with Deputy MacSharry, we need the Minister &ndash; if he did offer an apology &ndash; to offer it in public at the next available opportunity, not just to you, as Chairman, but to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the slight in his comments on the work of this committee.  I am not interested in personal handshakes during a vote.  It is not good enough.  We need to write to the Minister to ask that the apology be given in public in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I would like that to be summarised and presented to us in the afternoon.   It may be something we were not fully aware of; I was surprised to hear it.  I presume it is in Standing Orders.</p></speech>

I am only new to this committee and I know we must protect its autonomy.  Despite what other members may believe, as a Fine Gael member, I have always endeavoured to do that and use my own integrity and bona fides.</p> <p>  I do not want to discredit the Chairman&rsquo;s character because he said he made judgments at the time but I do not accept those judgments.  He should have revealed those serious allegations &ndash; and they are only allegations.  We are hearing from the Chairman what the Minister for Finance said to him.  We do not know what his answer to that is.  Going on the Chairman&rsquo;s comments, he did not offer an apology last night.  It sounds like they shook hands but I did not hear the Chairman refer to an apology.</p> <p>  The letter from February 2017 uses the term to "withstand challenge".  That does not necessarily mean a legal challenge.  That could just mean withstanding probity or further scrutiny and, therefore, I do not accept that.  There are serious allegations.  We want to move on but I am extremely disappointed by the way this has been handled.  We should have been given that information; the Minister should have an opportunity to defend himself on this.</p></speech>

We felt pressure on this with the continuous leaks.  The person who leaked did it deliberately and shamefully and if he or she is within this room, I hope he or she looks within himself or herself.  I reiterate that we should have no more private meetings.  We should take the power back to the committee.</p> <p>  Second, we have three third level institutions waiting for us.  We have attended diligently, particularly the Chairman.  I realise as Chairman of an Irish language committee it is not easy.  There is additional pressure on him with constant correspondence from people.  We have been flooded with e-mails even in respect of the universities about serious issues.  People are calling themselves whistleblowers and so on.  We are the last hope for them and it is extremely difficult.  We are here now, we return for another meeting at 2.30 p.m. and we met yesterday.</p> <p>  The Chairman has gone through a number of issues.</p><p>The Minister had every opportunity last night to say the Chairman was not telling the truth or that he was wrong and he did not do so.  In fact, he left the Chamber.  I understand last night's debate was rearranged twice to facilitate the Minister being present.  When it came up last night, he came in and left shortly after his contribution.  He had an opportunity to contribute later and say that the Chairman was wrong about what he said and he did not take it.  Therein lies an answer.</p><p> To think that the Chairman was told that NAMA had a dossier on him referring to all his previous criticisms is truly shocking.  The fact that NAMA officials were speaking to him is in itself shocking because he is simply Chairman of the committee and we are all equal.  If NAMA, the Minister or any senior official had anything to say, they should have written to us and the Chairman should then have highlighted the correspondence, as he always does.  That was not done.  If we focus on the politics, that ignores the most serious threat to democracy.  From day one, I said the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was a rational, reasonable, mild report, which highlighted concerns about a sales process.  NAMA went into full attack mode rather than asking what is in this.  I believe it was not even read in total and they picked out a 10% or 5% discount rate and zoned in on that with tunnel vision as opposed to what the report was about, which was accountability and holding a system to account.  NAMA officials could have come in and said, "We agree retrospectively.  We should have followed up the conflict of interest but we were under enormous pressure."  They did nothing like that and went on the attack over a small section.</p><p> The Minister did the exact same.  There are 32 conclusions and, in the D&aacute;il last night, he said we were "conjuring up criticism".  He said that twice.  I am delighted the Chairman has made up with the Minister because it is important to have cordial relations.  However, men shaking hands - or as I used to refer to them on the city council, the boys in the short pants - is not good enough.  It is good for them to do that and I am delighted for the Chairman but boys shaking hands does nothing for me and nothing for openness and accountability.  These are serious issues.  We need to deal with this serious threat to the committee and the democratic process.</p></speech>

However, focusing on that misses the point.  There are forces within the system which wish to thwart our work.  People can call me a cynic but I am not hugely surprised to hear that because the experience on this committee is that at a certain point during the previous term the system intervened, not because we were doing a bad job but we were doing too good a job and that caused a problem.  We need a simple assertion from the committee, irrespective of our political stripe, that we are here to do the work of the citizens and of those who send us here and no Minister, officials or head of any State agency will get in our way.  However, we need to be single minded in that regard.  The Chairman should have shared this information with us.  I will not second guess his honourable position in making the call he made but it was a mistake.  It is important that we understand that there are those who wish to thwart our work and we cannot allow our work to be thwarted.</p> <p>  What do we do next?  We need the Minister to apologise to the committee.  To suggest we are "conjuring up" allegations or findings is outrageous and is beneath a member of Cabinet.  He needs to clarify that.  I do not know what we do regarding the official if the Chairman is not prepared to name who it is.  I am sure there is a Standing Order that facilitates a report to be-----</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, nobody will stand in the way of us doing the work we are sent here to do.  We should have been told about this.  It is not good that we got wind of this on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am delighted the Chairman made friends with Deputy Noonan.  Fair play to him.</p></speech>

This is the Oireachtas; we are democratically elected politicians.</p> <p>  The other issue is given the abuse the constitutional Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General received, we probably got off rather tightly and we should not be surprised by these bullying tactics.

First, it was not a threat.  He was apprising me of the Standing Orders of the House - that the CPP has the authority to consider any draft report.  I take it the official was, to use his words, "trying to be helpful" to me by explaining to me Standing Orders of which I may not have been aware.  It was not a threat, but it means ultimately &ndash; which I regard as a far more serious issue and we will get the Standing Orders &ndash; the committee can actually conclude a report but may not be allowed to issue it.  That was news to me and we need to get that issue clarified.  I was being apprised of that fact.  That is a simple issue.  We will find the Standing Order and the procedures involved.  The matter has not been teased out; I was just apprised of it.  We will get to the bottom of that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#H02000"><p>The financial statements before the committee for UCC today relate to the academic year 2013 to 2014.  The University College Cork financial statements before the committee today relate to the financial year ending on 30 September 2014.  In that year, UCC recognised income of just over &euro;340 million.  Academic fee income totalling &euro;120 million represented over one third of the total, of that, some &euro;43 million was received directly from the HEA.  In addition, recurrent State grant funding from the HEA totalled &euro;47 million; and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;55 million was also recognised.  Research grants coming from State bodies, the European Union and industry totalled &euro;79 million.</p> <p>The percentage distribution of income is included in my written submission.  The university&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2013/14 was over &euro;345 million, with pay and pension costs accounting for nearly 74% of that figure. The result for the year was a deficit of almost &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  My audit opinion in respect of the UCC financial statements is qualified in two respects.  First, in regard to the recognition of some of the future pension funding receivable from the state and second, in relation to the non-consolidation of the UCC trust fund into the accounts of the university.</p><p>On future pension funding, the university has been in dispute with the Department of Education and Skills about one element of its pension funding.  The college agreed, for pension purposes, to award what are referred to as "professional added years" to certain staff recruited from elsewhere in the public sector.  The Department of Education and Skills has told the university that it will not meet that liability in its funding of the university.  Following the settlement of a legal case taken against the college by one retired staff member, the cost of the professional added years for transferred-in service was fully borne by the university from its non-Exchequer funding.</p><p> At the end of the 2013 to 2014 period, UCC estimated the total future cost of the disputed pension benefits at &euro;14.3 million, and included this amount in its deferred pension funding asset.  I concluded that the recognition of the &euro;14.3 million asset is not in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  I understand that contacts are ongoing between UCC and the Department to resolve this issue.  The president will be able to update the committee on any developments in that regard.</p><p> The second aspect of my qualified audit opinion relates to the failure to consolidate the results of the UCC trust fund into the accounts of the university.  The audit concluded that consolidation was required on the basis of evidence gathered of the university&rsquo;s ability to control the financial and operating polices of the trust fund.  The accumulated reserves of the trust fund stood at &euro;12 million on 30 September 2014.  The university has now indicated its intention to consolidate the results of the trust fund in its 2015 to 2016 accounts.</p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to the non-consolidation of the results of Cork University Foundation Limited on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  The foundation&rsquo;s main purpose is to provide financial and other support to assist the university in delivering on its strategic goals.  It had accumulated reserves of &euro;5.5 million at 30 September 2014.  The foundation is identified as a related party in the university&rsquo;s accounts and some information is provided in note 28 on transactions between the university and the foundation.</p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to disclosures in the university&rsquo;s accounts regarding specific instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The audit identified payments totalling &euro;616,000 made to eight suppliers during the year in respect of goods and services that had not been subject to competitive public procurement.</p><p> My recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector indicates that UCC was one of four universities that had not completed their financial reporting for 2013 to 2014 by the end of 2015.  UCC was the last of these audits to be certified, in December 2016, which was almost 27 months after the end of the period of account.  I am glad to report that some progress has been made with the 2014 to 2015 financial statements and I have just signed off on that audit.  The financial statements will now need to be finalised by UCC&rsquo;s audit committee and governing body, and I expect that the process will be completed by the end of April this year.</p></speech>

I have recently returned from 37 years in the United States, working most recently at the University of Maryland.  Though just returned, I am fully aware of the financial constraints Irish higher education sector has been operating under for the past decade, and I think the people of Ireland and the Government are to be congratulated for their accomplishment and forbearance during this difficult time.<br/><br/>UCC has risen to these challenges with increasing student participation, increased graduate output, lower staff numbers and growth in income diversification to offset the reduction in State support.  While the university has provided briefing papers to the members on the areas the committee wishes to examine in detail, I will make the following comments on the overall financial performance during the period 2013 to 2014, while my colleagues will be in a position to provider greater detail to members during the session.<br/><br/>Income from operations was &euro;285.4 million and shows a decline of &euro;5.2 million, or 1.8% from the previous year, primarily due to the reductions in Exchequer funding in support of all teaching, learning and research activities.  While academic fee income has increased year on year, it did not increase to a level to keep pace with the Exchequer decline.  Research income recorded a welcome increase of &euro;1 million to &euro;79.4 million.  To offset the decline in income, expenditure at &euro;290.3 million is lower by &euro;4.7 million as the university reduced pay by &euro;1 million and operating costs by &euro;1.5 million, despite rising student numbers.  Depreciation is also lower by &euro;2.6 million, given the continued reduction in Exchequer grant support for the university&rsquo;s estate.  Overall earnings before depreciation, interest, tax and amortisation result in a surplus of &euro;4.4 million.  However, when adjusting for depreciation and amortisation, the net out-turn for the year on the income and expenditure showed a deficit of &euro;4.9 million, primarily due to a greater level of depreciation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>amortisation due to asset revaluation.  There was a delay in 2014 of total resolution of funding issues for the dental school and hospital, and there was the overall decline in State funding for higher education.  Reserves on the balance sheet following the performance in the year have declined to a surplus of &euro;138.1 million, comprising revenue reserves now of &euro;3.9 million and revaluation reserves of &euro;134.2 million.<br/><br/>In the longer term, the decline in capital support for the sector remains a major concern.  The existing recurrent funding model assumes continued Exchequer support for ongoing refurbishment, maintenance and infrastructural capacity needs.  The absence of same will seriously impact the quality of higher education and further increase the financial pressure on already reduced operational funding.  On funding policy, the sector urgently requires the ambition we all have for our young adults to be matched by implementation of one of the recommendations of the expert group on future funding for higher education, currently being considered by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  In saying this, I acknowledge that legislators must make difficult choices with competing demands for limited resource allocation.  As pointed out by the chair of the group, Mr. Cassells, doing nothing for funding of higher education is no longer an option.  The changing geopolitical landscape presents some real opportunities for higher education.  There is a great opportunity for higher education to contribute strongly to the overall economic recovery.<br/><br/>I myself am committed to ensuring accomplishment, transparency and accountability for all taxpayer resources that flow to the institution.  I want to build trust between public, legislators and the university.  I want to increase the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity of our student population.  I am a strong supporter of what I call &ldquo;needs blind admission&rdquo;, which is that those who can pay should and those who cannot pay should be provided with necessary financial support to realise their potential.  I support the application of knowledge we create at the university for the benefit of the community, society and economy.  I am committed to increasing philanthropic funding for the university to leverage the contribution the State already makes to the university.  My own overriding goal and ambition for my tenure is that after my stewardship at UCC, we will be seen as a great modern metropolitan model of a research university that is dedicated to discovery and understanding of knowledge, its dissemination through education, and to application of that knowledge for the good for all people.</p></speech>

It is already reflected in our accounts in a disclosure in note 31 and the interaction between the trust fund and the university is already on the body of the accounts themselves.  As such, when the trust fund that is there to support students, scholarly activity, access and so forth provides income to pay for that, the income arrives into the university and is included in the university's overall banking position and accounts.  The expenditure as a result of that income is also included in the university's accounts.  What is not consolidated is the balance of the fund that is invested.  That will be invested post the 2015-2016 accounts.  FRS 102 allows us, in the construct of that reporting standard, to be a bit more expansive on the face of the balance sheet between reserves that are restricted and those which are unrestricted.  Arguably, up until now, we would not have had that level of it.  In the prescribed accounts we have today, unrestricted reserves would not be as visible in the accounts that are there post-FRS 102 consolidation.  Our position is that once we have 2015 and 2016, which is up and running today, we will consolidate.  It is not as if we have not reflected the trust funds today in the accounts.  They are in note 31, which is a disclosure note showing the balance in the trust fund and the interactions themselves.  The income and expenditure is in the accounts in any event.</p></speech>

I am only asking.  It does not matter what the answer is.  What is important is that Mr. Collins answers the question.  As such, UCC is changing this.

These funds are restricted for the use of students.  To have included them on the balance sheet to date, whereby they would have been in the overall university balance sheet position, would have given the impression that the university had greater reserves available to it.  In reality, these reserves are restricted for the use of students.  When we consolidate under FRS 102, our reserves will split between general, or unrestricted, reserves and restricted reserves.  These funds will be included in restricted reserves.  The overall financial health of the university itself as we know it today will not change when we consolidate these amounts of money because they are for students and their support.</p></speech>

Up to 2010, the university had its own pension fund which was professionally managed.  In 2009-10, five of the universities with pension assets transferred that money to the State.  There was a transfer to the Exchequer in 2010.  Following that transfer, the asset moved into the Exchequer on the basis that future pension liabilities would be made good by the State.  Up to then, pension lump sums, retirees and ongoing pension payments were funded by the university pension asset.  Post-transfer, we gave away the &euro;318 million and it went into the Exchequer.  It was on the basis that future pension lumps sums and payments would be funded by the State.</p></speech>

The remainder of that recognised asset relates to staff who were in the model scheme, for which there was never a pension fund.  They are like everybody else in the public sector who are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.  They were the two main elements that make that up.  The closed scheme, which had a fund and was closed in 2004, had a pension asset transferred into the Exchequer.  Other staff recruited after that are in the standard public sector model scheme, which is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.  We never had a pension asset for those.  The liability on the balance sheet reflects all of our staff discounted for interest rates, yields and an actuarial assessment of what that future liability would be.  We recognise a full asset, given the commitment when we transferred our funding to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

In the Minister's interpretation, that transfer in service is no longer recognised when it comes to the totality of pension entitlement, so we have a disconnect.</p></speech>

He was of the view that it would not be a conflict of interest.  In fact, he said he would see no difficulty with it.  It was put to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills that a former vice president of an institute, the head of research and innovation at an institute and a current president of an institute had a shareholding and had been a director of multiple spin-out companies in an institute.  That person had responsibility for oversight and governance and also had a shareholding in one institute and that institute was under review.  Dr. Love said yesterday that he had no difficulty with this.  Perhaps he might clarify his position today.  Professor O'Shea has told me today that in the case of UCC he would have a problem if the head of research was to approach him about establishing a spin-out company of which he or she was to be a shareholder.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Love saying he would say it would be inappropriate and that the person should leave his or her space as head of research and then by all means enter the innovation space, or is he now saying that as long as the person was to absent himself or herself from decision-making solely on that company, he or she could remain as head of research and innovation?

What I am asking specifically is if a head of research was considering establishing one or more spin-out companies and that he or she had responsibility for oversight and governance, in Dr. Love's view, should he or she remove himself or herself from the position of head of research and then concentrate on the innovation and spin-out companies?</p></speech>

What has to be manifest is that there is a separation of influence in the person in question executing decisions as a university manager and as a key entity in a spin-out company.</p></speech>

Professor O'Shea has said that if the head of research was to put that proposition to him, he would immediately see a conflict of interest.  I am assuming that what he is saying is that despite the person having a management and governance role, if he or she wants to get into the innovation space and set up spin-out companies, he or she can do so.  Would Professor O'Shea have a difficulty with that person staying on as head of research?</p></speech>

I concur with some of what Dr. Love said.  It would depend on the particulars of the case.  The head of research would certainly have to recuse himself or herself from all involvement in and oversight of the area at the university.  There would then have to be a discussion on whether it would be possible.  It might not be.</p></speech>

It turns on the question of control.  It would be beneficial to consolidate the trust and the foundation, but the college is permitted, under accounting standards, not to consolidate the foundation because it does not control the foundation under the tests that are set in accounting standards.  However, that did not apply when we examined the level of control that the college exercised over the trust, albeit with restrictions.  Our view is that consolidating the trust would be the appropriate route.  That is why I qualified.  I would encourage the consolidation of the foundation.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's office is asking the college to consider consolidation of the foundation.  This issue will arise with all universities.  UCC is getting public funds and providing public education, but it has a separate stream of income.  The witnesses can imagine how this committee views it as great that people are generous and giving cash, but let us see that being done in an open and accountable way.  The only way that we can see what is happening is through what is presented to us in the accounts.</p></speech>

This is similar to the trust fund.  Disclosure note No. 28 sets out how the amount that is invested by the foundation is not consolidated.  This question relates to Deputy Cullinane's point about taking on liabilities.  In any consolidation, due diligence must be done.  The foundation is a private company, with its own board and governance model, and there may be liabilities.  I am not saying that there are, but we could go hard and fast when consolidating just to be open or we could publish an expanded disclosure note or an appendix.</p></speech>

Our total student cohort for the current year under the disability programme is 1,288, under UCC plus, 769 and in our mature student stream, 1,055.</p></speech>

I have said repeatedly that inquiries would be unnecessary if institutions were open and accountable.  The witnesses are nodding in agreement.  We have the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee to keep track of matters.  Are the witnesses satisfied there are no conflicts of interest on the campus with regard to companies?  Has anything come to their attention?  In court terms, this would be called a fishing exercise but I am not intending to fish.  I am just asking for accountability.  Has anything come to their attention like what happened in Waterford and other third level institutions?  Are there conflicts of interest that have been brought to their attention or matters that are under investigation?</p></speech>

Within that, there is a conflict of interest policy that is reviewed by a number of committees across the organisation, including the finance committee and the governing body.  There are lots of checks and balances within our processes to ensure that no academics or staff members can put themselves in that position.</p></speech>

How much of the amount spent on professional fees was for legal advice and services?  There seems to be a serious issue in UCC with regard to legal advice for staff issues and cases involving staff.

That said, the amount involved is extraordinary.  It seems that a mallet is being used to crack a nut.  I agree with the professor about the importance of mediation but the volume of fees being charged is extraordinary.  It is almost the same as that spent by the other six universities all together.  What is going on?  I accept the professor's answer regarding mediation going forward and I believe he will do that but historically, why has this happened?

However, our rates are lower than the standard rates.  For example, irrespective of the size of the car engine, we only pay the mileage rate for a 1.2 litre engine.  We do not pay the standard five hour, ten hour, 12 hour or 24 hour subsistence rates.  We operate on a vouched basis.  Every expense has to be vouched before it is recouped.</p></speech>

It is important that all the universities use the same framework for reporting.  In a situation where appropriate further information or disaggregation of figures can be given, there is no difficulty with doing that.  It is always open to a college to disaggregrate a figure such as professional fees as long it is clear what the total figure is in order that comparisons can be made.  We have encouraged both universities and the institutes of technology to do that where we consider it is appropriate.</p></speech>

Mr. Collins has described the difference between the foundation and the trust and how the money can be used.  Regarding the income for both, he said that some people who donate money to both will more or less say where the money should be directed.  What proportion of the income coming into both the foundation and trust would be directed where the money should be spent?</p></speech>

The university has no discretion on how that money would be spent.  It goes for funding for the students.  Regarding money from the foundation, if we are successful in securing donor funding, in many cases, it is for a specific project for which the foundation is seeking funding.  It may be to support a capital project or it may be to support students.</p></speech>

I am referring to money that supports students.  Are there particular faculties that would be supported?  Does the source of the income that comes into the foundation have an influence on the direction of the university or the primacy of one faculty over another?  Is there any influence or how does the university maintain a balance?</p></speech>

They might support something broad such as the UCC plus programme, the objective of which is to open up avenues for socio-economic disadvantaged students and we have got funding through donors for that in the past.  It might be specific in that they want to contribute to our western gateway building, which is primarily focused on information and communications technology, ICT.  It very much depends on the donor.</p></speech>

If a donor is aligned to that, that is great, but it is not the other way around.  It is not that we are responding to a donor's needs to determine what the university does.  If the donor's way of thinking is in line with ours, that is great and we will work to get support for what we want to do.</p></speech>

The IMI spoke to a number of universities from 2009 to 2012 about it getting more formal accreditation for its programmes.  For its rankings and accreditation it needed to have more formal linkages with a university.  Following discussions with UCC, the IMI's board chose to enter into an alliance, which we had over the past number of years.  We ended up delivering a number of joint programmes between us and in 2016 as we spoke about earlier, we purchased the IMI.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the earlier part of the meeting but the Chairman had an interview on RTE.  First, I want to declare that I was guest of UCC law department recently at Hayfield Manor in Cork on the subject of women in law reform in case there is any perceived conflict of interest.</p><p>I want to ask about needs-blind admission and those who can pay and those who cannot.  Professor O'Shea mentioned there were approximately 22,000 students in UCC.  Access to education is very important, particularly for people who are disadvantaged or do not have the means.  What percentage of the 22,000 students are financially assisted by UCC?  How is the assistance means tested?  I am not suggesting that people use fraudulent means but that has to be policed in order that the bona fides of each applicant is taken into account.  </p></speech>

Our analysis is not simply based on income, there are other socioeconomic factors and we would be happy to provide the Deputy with that comprehensive information.  It is not strictly income; it is the whole family situation and other factors.</p></speech>

We have a number of internal hardship funds as well that we manage locally.  In the past five years, there has been significant growth in those applications to those funds, which are there to assist with the ongoing costs of going to third level, as opposed to the fees themselves.</p></speech>

Other universities do it and other jurisdictions.  Education is for life.

All the institutions get some funding through that.  There is a mechanism locally for how we organise and assess the applications.  The students' union is also involved in the process of reviewing the applications because its welfare officer is very clued-in to the sort of issues which are being raised with the union by students.

The financial statements before the committee in this session relate to Dundalk Institute of Technology's financial year ending on 31 August 2015.  I draw the committee's attention to the fact that the universities' end of year is end September.  The institutes all have an end of year of 31 August.  Dundalk Institute of Technology's total income for the year amounted to &euro;47.4 million.  State grant funding totalled &euro;16.3 million, which was approximately one third of the total.  Tuition fee income of &euro;18.7 million included fees paid by the State totalling &euro;3.6 million and student contribution income of &euro;10.1 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;48.7 million.  Of this, just under 70% was accounted for by staff costs.  A detailed analysis of expenditure is given in note 12 of the accounts.  The income and expenditure account indicates that the institute incurred an operating deficit in the year totalling &euro;1.3 million.  I point out in my audit report that this is the third successive year in which the institute has incurred a deficit, leaving it with an accumulated deficit at the year end of &euro;3.2 million.  The governing body addressed the question of its recurring deficits in note 26 and concluded that it remained appropriate at the date of signing to prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis.  I also point out in my audit report that there was procurement by the institute totalling &euro;1.18 million worth of goods and services under arrangements that had not complied with standard competitive procurement procedures.</p></speech>

We have submitted detailed information to the committee in advance of this meeting on the matters for consideration.  Therefore, in my opening statement I will summarise the key points.</p> <p>  To put the accumulated deficit in context, it is important to note the severe cuts in funding to higher education as a result of the recession.  At DkIT, HEA funding was reduced by 34% between 2007 and 2012.  The institute managed to maintain a break-even financial position until 2012-2013, when an operating deficit of &euro;711,000 occurred.  From that point onwards, DkIT was no longer attracting sufficient income to meet its obligations.  Funding for apprenticeship blocks, for example, declined by &euro;2.5 million, and funding for nursing education reduced by &euro;1.4 million over the period.  Given that staff and support facilities were effectively fixed costs, it was unavoidable that financial challenges would arise.  A plan agreed with the HEA in May 2014 to address an underlying deficit from the previous year and return the institute to a balanced budget did not meet its objectives in that period for the reasons outlined in our written submission.  However, this plan did provide a foundation for savings in 2015-2016.  The institute recorded a net operating deficit in 2014-2015 of &euro;1.314 million, bringing the accumulated deficit to &euro;3.24 million.  A new three-year financial plan agreed with the HEA in January 2016 identified savings of &euro;2.074 million over a three-year period from 2015 to 2018 to bring the institute to a balanced budget.  The institute is pleased to report its draft accounts show an operating surplus of &euro;127,000 for 2015-16, and current estimates indicate the institute will again break even in 2016-2017.</p> <p>  The institute endeavours to ensure full compliance with procurement procedures and guidelines and is actively working with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to ensure that all procurement is in accordance with its model.  The general principle is that a competitive process should be carried out for all public contracts.  However, urgent and exceptional circumstances may arise which are unforeseen and have not arisen due to any action or inaction on the part of the contractor.  Regarding the procurement with supplier B in 2014-2015, such exceptional circumstances did apply, as set out in our written submission.  Regarding the other more significant items of non-compliance, DkIT considers that supplier C should not be included in the list of non-compliance as this refers to a student recruitment agency based in Beijing, and given both the nature of the service and the location, a tender process could not be run.  Regarding supplier D, the OGP had no framework in place for the service in question.  DkIT discussed the matter with the OGP and on its advice extended the contract.  The contract with supplier A was extended to provide additional necessary security at short notice, pending the procurement of a new contract.</p> <p>  Over the years, DkIT has delivered learning and teaching, research and engagement within budget and in good value-for-money terms for the State.  The institute's accumulated deficit, which arose as a result of deep cuts to its budget, represents 2% of its annual income.  As previously outlined, the institute achieved a small surplus in 2015-2016 and forecasts a balanced budget for 31 August of this year.  Such savings are achieved at a considerable cost, but the institute is resolute in its determination to return to sustainability so that it can continue to serve its learners and the region.</p></speech>

As a Deputy representing a Meath constituency, I am acutely aware of the role of DkIT as an institute of technology, its importance to the wider north-east region as an educational campus and its wider importance to the economy, not just of Dundalk, but more widely.  Denis Cummins came to Meath County Council when I was a councillor and spoke extensively to our economics department, and there was a liaison between Meath and Louth in that respect.  My brother graduated from DkIT this year, so I am acutely aware of the 5,500 students on its campus and the critical role the institute plays and hope its future is bright and very prosperous.</p> <p>  However, ensuring there is a future for DkIT is at the heart of what we are discussing, following on from the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  Note 26 of the audit calls into question the going concern status of the institute in the medium term by virtue of a depletion of the reserves in line with those suffered during the period 2013-2015.</p><p>That would be alarming for the students in Dundalk, Drogheda and Navan - I know that 18% of DkIT's student base is in Meath - and their parents.  Ms Campbell noted that a plan had been put in place with the HEA, whose representatives are before us this morning, to stop the haemorrhage.  I want to go through those measures and their impact on the college but before we do so, can we address the accumulated deficit?  Despite the surplus for 2015-2016 that Ms Campbell referred to, and breaking even for the follow-on period up to the summer of this year, there will still be an accumulated deficit of &euro;3 million come August.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.607" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Campbell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#T00200"><p>That is true.  We have not been able to reduce the accumulated deficit since these accounts were published.  The accumulated deficit still stands.  Our priority under the plan agreed with the HEA was to return to a balanced budget by 31 August 2018.  We have been successful in achieving that.  In fact, in the last academic year we had a modest surplus of just over &euro;100,000.  I think it was &euro;120,000.  Our forecast suggests that we will at least break even this year.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's earlier remarks on the importance of ensuring the future of the industry, I could not agree more.  We have to return to sustainability.  That has to be done in steps.  The first step is to ensure that we operate on a break-even basis and that we grow student numbers through measures that will hopefully at some stage include increased State funding, but also through measures for which we have to be responsible ourselves.  In our new strategic plan we are particularly targeting growth in the provision of life-long learning, growth in online provision and ensuring that international student recruitment continues to bring in money for the institute and to grow that area if possible.</p></speech>

I am sure Ms Campbell is looking at that simultaneously so that there is no overhanging debt there.  How is it planned to deal with that?</p></speech>

There is no other way to do it.  The income has to grow, we have to come back to surplus and we have to hope that over the intermediate term, if not over the short term, we will be able to address that.  Increased income is the only way to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#T00700"><p>Let us look at that.  In terms of how costs are cut to try to break even, and to reflect on the impact of the loss of these services provided by the college, as Ms Campbell said, between 2007 and 2012, HEA funding to Dundalk was cut by 34%.  The students picked up the tab through increased contribution fees.  That is an immediate impact.  Then we see the strategy of not replacing identified retiring staff.  I think the staff complement is 500.  Will Ms Campbell indicate the number of staff shed in recent years?  One of the key points identified by the expert working group on higher education was that there cannot be a continuing policy of cutting staff numbers to meet this funding deficit.  If anything, it identified the need for the staff complement to increase by many thousands over the next five to six years.  That is why I am interested in probing this area and determining where DkIT stands.  Will Ms Campbell address, first, the reduction in staff complement over that period of time, and second, the plans to try to increase numbers while simultaneously needing to increase income?</p></speech>

One of the reasons it takes time to address a deficit is that we can only save on staff costs through retirements.  In the current three-year plan, we identified certain posts - not all posts - that we would not replace.  These were primarily within areas where there had been a decline in student demand, for example, the number of our students studying engineering has dropped considerably because of the recession.  The majority of staff who have not been replaced were in those areas.  We have very careful planning in respect of where we can and cannot replace a staff member.</p></speech>

Many secondary school students would have naturally gone to DkIT for that reason.  It would be a worrying trend if cuts were to be made to something which has always been regarded as very high quality in the college.  That would be extremely worrying.  There are other areas of the college where cuts have been implemented.  Will Ms Campbell go through some of the other areas where cuts have been made, and which were identified in the report, such as the nursing programmes and so forth?</p></speech>

We addressed it from the student point of view.  We had fewer students.  In nursing a cap was placed by the HSE on the number of places available.  That really affected our income and there were no staff replacements there.  In that particular area we were able to offer continuous professional development, CPD, courses to the HSE in areas where we had a surplus of staff.</p></speech>

We are fortunate that the apprenticeship blocks are climbing again.  This year, for September 2018, we will have 28 blocks, if memory serves, and we foresee that growing over the next number of years because the construction industry is back on its feet again.  We have the capacity to deliver on that and we look forward to doing so.<br/><br/>Additionally, the demand for life-long learning provision in engineering has not been strong in the region but we think that there are opportunities to grow that.  That is one of the things that we are doing in the strategic plan for the school of engineering.  We previously offered level seven programmes in engineering with an optional add-on degree for those students who wished to have an honours degree.  We are now reviewing that because the demand from students seems to be to go directly to a level eight degree.  We will, this September, be offering level eight degrees in engineering as <i>ab initio</i>degrees for the first time.</p></speech>

One is that we have the very successful North East Further and Higher Education Alliance.  We work in partnership with the further education providers within the counties of Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  We have regular meetings throughout the academic year to plan how we might facilitate access to our institute from further education providers.  We have also, I am pleased to say, been delivering programmes at the Monaghan institute and at the Cavan institute to facilitate students in those areas who cannot travel in the last two years.  We are also delivering an online programme in early childhood studies through our partners in Cavan.</p></speech>

That is obviously a concern.  It has been a concern identified in the wider reports as well for campuses.  I am <i>au fait</i>with the campus in Dundalk.  I would appreciate it if Ms Campbell could elaborate, first, on the constraints that she sees and, second, on the ambitious plan by the college, in conjunction with Louth county board of An Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, to build a 12,000-seat stadium.</p><p>As we know, that plan fell through.  Did Dundalk Institute of Technology make a financial investment made in planning for the stadium, architectural designs and so forth?  The overall cost was to be approximately &euro;6 million, of which DkIT was to provide an outlay of &euro;3 million?</p></speech>

However, through the facility that we were able to acquire for a fraction of its value in 2013, we have really good sports facilities for our students, which are shared by the local community as well.  In terms of sports facilities, we are fine.</p> <p> Going back to the Deputy's question on facilities in the classrooms, which is an important question, we were not able to make any improvement in those facilities in 2014-15.  However, I am very happy to report that we received a devolved grant from the Higher Education Authority in the autumn which we were able to put in full into updating facilities and, in particular, information technology facilities.  There are, however, ongoing issues, particularly in relation to the age of the north block, which is the original 1970s building.  There are problems with the fabric of that building.  That is a major project which is on the capital prioritisation list.  At the moment, unless we get Government funding for that, there is no possibility of renewing that block.  That would be for us the priority that really needs addressing.</p></speech>

It has recruited international students since the mid-2000s for DkIT.  It would be very difficult logistically to find an agent in China through public procurement.  One of the reasons for that is that business relationships in China are built very much on trust and getting to know people.  We have been recruiting in China since 2002.  When we went out to that market the first time, we were very unfamiliar with the market.  We met a lot of agents that we gave temporary or short-term contracts to and they simply did not deliver students in the numbers that we need them to deliver on.  We were very fortunate to meet this company around 2002-03 and we formed very good relations with it.  It now recruits students for us.  It is our-----</p></speech>

Many of the colleges are recruiting students internationally.  The question that arises is how one knows if one has had a relationship for 15 years that one is getting the service at the best value.  It is normally done by some form of competitive procurement, or at least even if one cannot do that, one can benchmark.  We still need to see that there is evidence that this is a good value way of doing it, whether it be in terms of the cost per student recruited or whatever.  It needs something to provide assurance.</p></speech>

We are aware, because of our work in the market over the years, of what the going rate is, if one likes.  Generally speaking, the agents charge between 20% and 25% for students recruited into first year.  They have different arrangements with different providers all over the world.  In some countries, they may also pay a fee for students going into second year.  We have been able to hold it at a fee for the first year.  Our strategy is that we get students who will stay for the entire degree and the only outlay is in the commission paid to the agent for the students in the first year.</p></speech>

In the case of a student in Armagh, his or her teacher or parents have not studied in the South.  That was one of the unexpected barriers identified by Dr. Pollak in that study as well as unfamiliarity with the systems.</p></speech>

In my submission supplier B was the successful bidder for the lease of the sports equipment to DkIT Sport Limited.  However, during the final weeks prior to the commissioning of the equipment, the supplier informed us that he was no longer able to meet his obligations.  We wanted to rent the equipment from the supplier, but the supplier wanted to lease the equipment to us as in a hire purchase arrangement.  As an institute, we cannot borrow.  The problem was that this happened just weeks before the opening.  We had a contract with the operator by whom 30 people had been employed to run the facility.  As the students had already paid their levy, we had a very short timeframe and had to make a decision because of the imminent planned opening and the undertakings given to the students and the operator to purchase instead of renting part of the equipment.  The operator purchased some of the equipment and we purchased the rest.</p></speech>

The service made certain proposals relating to how it might be done differently.

However, it is saying that sometimes people do not apply because there is a process where the outgoing person applies again and leads the field.  The PAS goes to the market to advertise and so forth but in the end many people withdraw because it is known that the person who is doing a good job and so forth is probably going to come through the interview process again.</p><p>It is to iron out some of the difficulties around that to see if there is a better way of not using their time and not building false hope among people who applied.  </p></speech>

The service has a Vote so it is within the remit of the committee.  The Deputy asked a question around the correspondence to find out what the net points that arise are.  I am aware that there are resource constraints on the Public Appointments Service.  We have to queue up to get in with the competition.  The Public Appointments Service has the option of issuing a licence to a public body to allow it to run its own competition but it must be done through a scheme that is determined by the Public Appointments Service.  Obviously, the focus of that is that no undue influence or preferential treatment is given to anybody.  It must be an open and fair competition.</p></speech>

When we got to the bottom of the cycle, we really had a problem and we would not like to face that again.

I believe what I said yesterday is that all of the institutions have in place a set of functions - in some cases, separate offices -  but certainly functions and committees to implement the national intellectual property policy in the institutes of technology and universities.  There is a set of procedures that is engaged to make sure that if an individual researcher has a potential conflict of interest, they step out and are managed.  Those processes, committees and in some cases, separate technology transfer functions are in place in higher education institutions.</p><p>What I did pick up yesterday and I would like to say here in the interests of fairness on this is that while we are aware those policies are in place, as yet we are not in a position to assure they are all being implemented exactly according to the way they are specified on that.  We have taken that on board as something we should look at.</p></speech>

There is no point in asking them to withdraw.</p> <p>  On this morning&rsquo;s meeting, I want to clarify an issue raised.  I mentioned an issue relating to the Minister for Finance, NAMA and officials in the House.  I wish to make clear that the two other external groups dealt with the potential for external legal challenges.  The issue relating to the House is quite different, but significant.</p><p>I ask people to bear with me on this as it may be news to them.  Senior people in the House made it very clear to me, as Chairman, that if they were not happy with the wording in the report, they would prevent it being issued and take it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to be approved by it.  That is what was said this morning.  This is not intended to imply that any official had attempted to interfere with the work of the committee, as has been reported in the media.<br/><br/>I want to outline the factual position.  In recognition of the fact that the decisions or actions of the committee can have legal and financial consequences, a protocol was adopted by the CPP and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in November 2014.  That protocol, which is lengthy and will be circulated, includes the following, and I quote selectively for the purposes of clarity:</p><blockquote>Where the committee, the clerk to the committee or the relevant principal officer considers it necessary, procedural advice may be supplemented with legal advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.  [We understand that].  Where a committee proposes to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, it shall stand referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which shall consider the matter.  In such circumstances, the committee concerned shall take no further action until the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has reported on the matter and the House has considered that report.</blockquote><p>Standing Order 107(1)(<i>g</i>) requires that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considers any report on a matter so referred to it.<br/><br/>I wish to make clear that given the sensitive nature of the report, officials were not only entitled, but obliged to bring to my attention the risk that the referral of our draft report to the CPP might be an outcome and to suggest that the draft report should be reviewed by the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.  I wish to make it clear also that the advice given to me was provided to be of assistance, having regard to the content of the draft report among other matters and how those potentially affected might respond to publication.<br/><br/>The draft report, as I said earlier, was presented with my approval and I did not feel any pressure to make any changes to that or any veto.  However, members will be aware that consistent with the protocol and officials' advice, the committee had the benefit of the views of members of staff of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor in the course of a number of the meetings at which the draft report I brought forward was considered.  Members will agree that this was appropriate assistance and in no way interfered with the work of the committee.I hope members will agree this explains the situation.  I accept that my linking that particular inhouse Standing Order with the issues involving the Minister and NAMA may have given the impression that there was a legal threat internally in the House when what officials were saying to me was to draw my attention to a Standing Order of which many members may not be aware.  That Standing Order states clearly that where a committee proposes to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, it shall be referred to the CPP.We would not have been aware that essentially had the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor not been happy with our report , in layman&rsquo;s English, the report would have been taken from us and given to the CPP for it to decide what action to take.  Under procedures in the House and the protocol agreed between the commission and the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, we would not have been in a position to complete or publish our report.  That was news to me; officials were bringing it to my attention not in any threatening manner, just to alert me to the fact that if it looked like causing a problem with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, this would be the likely outcome.  Members may not have been aware of that protocol and its implications.  Is that clear?</p></speech>

As shown In the figure now on screen, academic fees account for around one-third of the income.  Of the total &euro;86 million in fee income, almost &euro;29 million was received directly from the HEA.  In addition, recurrent State grant funding from the HEA totalled &euro;34 million; and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;35 million was recognised.  Research grants totalled &euro;35 million while other operating income derived from a variety of sources, including rental income from student residences and income from sports facilities.  The university's total expenditure in 2014-2015 was nearly &euro;239 million, of which pay and pension costs accounted for &euro;156 million.</p> <p>  My audit opinion in respect of the financial statements was unqualified, but I highlighted a number of issues in the report.  These include a standard note on the reasoning behind recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which I outlined yesterday.  The results of the UL Foundation have not been consolidated with those of the university group, on the basis that the university does not control the foundation, and notwithstanding that the main purpose of the foundation is to support education and research carried out by the university and other bodies associated with the university.  I draw attention in the audit report to the fact that at 31 August 2015, the foundation had net assets of &euro;15.1 million.  I also draw attention in the audit report to the disclosure in the university&rsquo;s statement on governance of a number of instances where goods and services were procured without the standard required competitive tendering, and the circumstances in which this arose.</p></speech>

At this session, I hope to provide them with further detail on UL's financial statements ending 30 September 2015 and to address any further questions they may have.</p> <p>  As I approach the end of my term as president of UL, I wish to provide a brief overview of the university which it has been such a tremendous privilege and honour for me to lead over the last ten years.  UL is a large centre of academic activity and student life and is home to more than 14,000 students, a full-time staff of approximately 1,400 and a range of high profile thriving centres of research, learning, cultural and sporting excellence.</p><p> Employability has always been at the core of our teaching mission and it continues to be a central tenet of our distinctive approach to higher education in Ireland.  We pride ourselves on our reputation for delivering research that delivers impacts for industry, society and the wider community.  As a university, we are committed to continually raising the level of ambition of our staff and students.  We have worked through the difficult decade of funding constraints Irish higher education has experienced and remain in relatively good financial health mainly because of our efforts to build new income streams to sustain the university.</p><p> To deal with the matters at hand, I have provided a detailed statement to the committee in advance of today's meeting which addresses the matters highlighted in the invitation to attend, namely, the relationship with the UL Foundation, non-compliance with procurement guidelines and the HEA investigation into allegations regarding financial irregularities and HR practices.  I hope to provide reassurance to the members that in respect of the matters raised and in the context of the recommendations made by the HEA-commissioned Mazars report, UL has applied progressive systems changes that have further enhanced financial governance and HR practice in the university.</p><p> The committee has indicated that it wishes to examine the relationship between the University of Limerick and the UL Foundation.  Specifically, the question arises as to whether it is appropriate to continue to exclude the foundation from the consolidated financial statements of the university.  The University of Limerick does not have formal control, exercise control or have a dominant influence over the UL Foundation in accordance with the provisions set out in FRS 2 and the statement of recommended practice.  Following a review by the university, which is detailed within the briefing paper,  and a 2012 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the university considers it appropriate to continue to not include the UL Foundation in the consolidated financial statements of the university.  However, we recognise that philanthropic funding is an important resource in helping to widen the funding base of the university and we will continue to consider this issue annually when finalising the financial statements of the university.</p><p> As with all universities in Ireland, procurement within the University of Limerick is subject to legislative requirements in EU procurement directives which are enforceable under Irish law.  Systems improvements introduced by the university in 2014 have enabled us to do a full, 100% review of all our transactions in 2014-2015.  This review identified a number of issues, which in total amount to approximately a 2% of recurrent, research and capital expenditure.  In 2014-2015, the university procured 98% of spend on recurrent, research and capital costs in line with procurement guidelines and regulations.  As president, I am confident that the university has strong controls and systems in place and continues to introduce process improvements.</p><p> I turn to the HEA-commissioned Mazars report.  In the briefing paper circulated to members, I endeavoured to compile and provide a timeline of the objective elements, events and processes pursued by the university in advance of the commissioning by the HEA of the Mazars report.  As indicated in the paper, this has been a lengthy, complex and multifaceted process.  As such, the background to the process is not a matter I intend to repeat to the committee in this opening statement.  However, I assure the members that the University of Limerick is committed to an ethos of continuing improvement and it is in this context that we welcome the Mazars review and, in consultation with personnel and trade unions, that we have applied the lessons learned, implemented 12 of the 15 recommendations and are in the process of implementing the remaining three.</p><p> We remain mindful of the need to review our processes and procedures continuously in order to ensure that they adhere to best governance practice, both nationally and internationally.  As a key education stakeholder in Ireland and receiver of public funds, we are always cognisant of the need to be accountable for our actions and to operate in a transparent and fair manner.  We recognise fully that the expenditure of public funds must always adhere to the highest standard of governance.  We remain open to new learnings and to taking on board perspectives as to how we can continue to ensure the confidence of all our stakeholders.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to come before the members.  I hope I can provide any further clarity required and look forward to any questions.</p></speech>

I put it to the professor directly that these allegations were extremely serious and represented, at best, a systems failure or confusion and at worst corruption within the system in the university.</p></speech>

It is correct to say that in the course of her work in the expenses section, person A identified improvements which could be made to the process of claiming expenses, particularly in the context of sign-off authority and clarity regarding what was an allowable expense and what was not.</p></speech>

As I understand it, and please correct me if I am wrong, hard as they tried person A found it almost impossible to get management to take responsibility or to sign off on what person A regarded as fraudulent expense claims.  The detail of it is really quite astonishing; an allegation that mileage expenses were repeatedly misused to pay for the work done in the university; allegations around massive payments for academic staff to go as far away as Sydney; an attempt by staff to charge to the university and to the taxpayer expenses for their spouses; use of expense accounts to perhaps bypass procurement rules and guidelines in the purchase of PC equipment.  I could go on.  All the while, person A, exercising due diligence and operating in accordance with their responsibilities, hit a brick wall when dealing with management.  I put it to Professor Barry that this is much more the experience of person A than simply finding systems deficiencies or areas where improvements were necessary.  I put it to the witness that person A stumbled across a system that was arbitrary, a system that displayed favouritism and a system that went completely against the grain and broke the University of Limerick's rules, according to the status of the person making the claim.</p></speech>

She was not ignored or blanked.  She was a key member of the drive by the university to improve its systems.</p></speech>

He actually referred to person A in his own briefing document so he was quite at liberty to discuss this case and it is important that he does.  It is my understanding that person A stumbled across the abuse of the expenses system repeatedly.  Professor Barry referred to seven instances that were subsequently examined in the university and in the Mazars report.  It is also my understanding that person A identified many other breaches and that she was stonewalled and leaned on by management in the university for having the temerity to come forward and insist that the rules be followed.  I understand that person A got sick directly as a consequence of this and that when she was on leave the HR function of the university did not cover itself in glory.  Far from it.  In other words, I put it to Professor Barry that not alone was there fiddling of the system for selected individuals but that the very person and people who brought this to the attention of the university were punished.  In the case of person A the punishment meant that the person no longer works for the university.  That is my summation of what happened.  Later in this meeting we shall get to the control changes that were made, if Professor Barry wishes but it is very important that we understand exactly what happened in this turn of events and why a person, who Professor Barry has said was critical to the changes made in 2010, was kicked to the kerb and no longer works for the university.</p></speech>

With regard to the way sabbaticals worked in the period between 2008 and 2012, which was the period covered by the submission we made to the Revenue, when individuals were approved to go on sabbatical leave, an amount of expenses to be paid to them would be agreed as part of that.</p></speech>

It is referred to by Person A as allegation B.  The first expense claim is the one the Deputy has outlined regarding flights to Sydney, and that expense claim was rejected at the time.  The person was going on sabbatical and in line with all the other people who went on sabbatical at that time, as I mentioned already, the calculation of the expenses payable, which were round sum amounts, we calculated and paid to the individual as part of the second claim.  When we reviewed the second claim in 2012 as part of the review of the allegations, we found that it was appropriately approved and the evidence was available on the claim that it had been appropriately approved.</p></speech>

I put that to the HEA representative but also to the university witnesses.  I would have been much happier if an independent outside agency had been given the entire job to do, not just the process by which the university reviewed matters, but to go in and examine the allegations.  That would have been a far more credible approach to take because I read with some concern in the Mazars report that it was not making a finding or a conclusion and that it did not take a view on the allegations themselves but simply went in to look at the process.  I find that a very unsatisfactory approach.  The university, for reasons that are evident, will seek to manage and minimise these matters as they emerge, and I say that with the greatest of respect to the witnesses.  That is what bureaucracies and systems do.  A series of allegations were brought forward, not just by Person A - we will get to Persons B and C later in the questioning -  that raise very serious concerns and I am not convinced that they had the kind of outside rigorous examination that would be required, certainly to reassure me.  Person A is now banished and no longer works for the university.  I believe Persons B and C are on leave.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Obviously, any employee can make an expense claim.  In terms of policy, each employee of the university is obliged to follow our travel and subsistence policy in the making of a claim.  The first step in the making of a claim is that an employee, having incurred expenses in the course of his or her duties, will prepare a claim.  The process then is his or her supervisor signs off on that claim - the supervisor would be aware that he or she would be travelling or whatever.  The claim, once approved by the supervisor, flows into finance then.  Within finance, the first port of call is the expenses administrator.  That was the post which was held previously by person A.  The expenses administrator will check the claim has been approved and is in accordance with policy.  Then, within our finance department, we have a structure, depending on where the claim originates, such as whether it is related to research or the recurrent budget or whether it is over a certain value.  That will determine who signs off on it within finance.</p></speech>

I understand that from the person who makes the claim right up, ultimately, it would be Mr. Field, as the director of finance, but would the financial controller also have role in ensuring that there are proper financial controls in place.</p></speech>

There are two aspects, I suppose, to the role.

They can be identified in different ways.  There are people responsible for the implementation of controls.  As I outlined, the expenses administrator is responsible for ensuring the controls are followed and if that person identifies a breach in controls, he or she would refer it appropriately.</p> <p>  There are also instances that might be identified through an audit where something was identified that this control did not operate in this instance.

This is my final question on this issue, and I will come back to the second issue.  I raised the issue of a separate internal review into a different issue in another institute when other institutes were present in previous sittings.  Given what has been outlined, would Dr. Love be satisfied that having internal reviews in institutes is the best way to examine issues which are brought to the attention of the HEA about allegations of bad practice in institutes by whistleblowers or such?  Given what we have seen here and in other instances, would he not now see that it would not be wise to have internal reviews in the first instance?</p></speech>

It would warrant it in some cases and it would not in other cases.  In some cases, internal processes that are handled well that remove people from direct responsibility but invoke external parties to do some of the validation and investigation would be appropriate.  A full external review is required in other cases.</p></speech>

The way in which a spin-out company develops itself as a company is to seek investment by venture funds in return for share capital, so that, over a relatively short time, if the spin-out company is showing any signs of success, the initial shareholding is considerably diluted by the addition of external funds which are necessary to develop the company beyond-----</p></speech>

I am asking for specific reasons.  I am hearing that the average is 15%.  While it can be diluted if the venture funds require it, on average, it would be about 15%.

The public body would have to satisfy the Public Appointments Service that it will run the competition to the same standards of independence and assurance.  There would have to be an independent panel to carry out the recruitment exercise.  The Public Appointments Service would have to be satisfied that the panel carrying out the interviews would not be interfered with.  The recruitment agency would then do the advertising, perhaps source the interviewers and run any aptitude tests or whatever might be required.  That would be the professional skill set that we would expect to get from the Public Appointments Service in any event.

I do not think it is my role to be identifying people here although they are easily identifiable in respect of the complaints that have been made and so on.  The report by Mazars cost &euro;69,000, and it was commissioned following complaints about procedures and a D&aacute;il question or topical issue matter, to which Professor Barry referred in the briefing document.  I think Deputy Collins raised it.</p> <p>  Would it be fair to say that various people made complaints, including these three persons who have been identified?  Were there other complaints from other people?  I will deal with the three first and then come back to that.  The three made complaints, the matter was raised in the D&aacute;il, there was a feeling of discomfort about it not being dealt with and finally, after the internal investigation, came the report by Mazars for &euro;69,000.

It is stated that the person was forced into the arrangement, but that is for another day.  For me this is about the processes.

The B and C case is going on so long because, at the request of the HEA, we suspended our own processes for the duration of the Mazars review.  At the request of the HEA, we then agreed to continue to suspend the disciplinary process while Jane Williams was doing her work.  B and C have exercised their right to take a claim against the university for penalisation to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  It is my belief that, as president of the university, I should continue to suspend the disciplinary process in recognition of the statutory role of the WRC and await its view on the claim made by B and C.  Our processes basically have been suspended since September 2015.</p></speech>

As with University College Cork, there was a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Am I right or am I wrong?  Is the Comptroller and Attorney General letting this one go, that is, that there is no control?  At this point I am getting exotic.</p></speech>

It is not required by accounting standards to consolidate.  They are two separate entities.  In that situation, it is still important to note that there are significant resources which would be expected to be available for the benefit of the university at some point in the future.  The idea that was suggested by the Chairman yesterday of an information memorandum being added to the financial statements would give good disclosure around the resources being raised through philanthropic donations and so on.</p></speech>

I refer to expenses claimed by an employee while on sabbatical.  How can a person claim expenses while on sabbatical?  A person cannot claim expenses when he or she is on leave in his or house or wherever and not working.</p></speech>

This person was travelling to Australia to carry out business that had a positive impact on the university.  Being on sabbatical and being on holidays are two quite different things.  The issue that arose in respect of sabbaticals is that we a had policy on them, which was wrong.</p></speech>

Academics go on sabbatical leave to other universities to build collaborations with people in those universities that can lead to an enhancement of the research performance of UL.  They do not go sunning themselves on the Bahamas and describe themselves as being on sabbatical.</p></speech>

My understanding is when people take a sabbatical they are no longer employed by that company but they can return to their job.  They are taking a break but they are not representing the business then.  Professor Barry said this person went to Australia.  Why would the person get expenses when taking a sabbatical?  The person took the sabbatical for a year or two and yet could claim expenses.  Of course, the job is there when the person returns.</p></speech>

We still have a sabbatical policy and the amendments to the policy we brought in were primarily directed at compliance with taxation laws.  Sabbatical outside of the university sector has a slightly different meaning.  It is a professional development leave.  People are working but they are furthering their research in different fields and they are not necessarily teaching.  They are still employees and they are on university business.  The expenses are incurred conducting their job and, therefore, they are a claimable expense.  We have staff on sabbatical at this time and still claiming expenses.</p></speech>

This is standard practice in the higher education industry across the world.  It is a classic opportunity for a given academic staff member to, for example, go to a foreign laboratory and build relationships and acquire techniques.  The idea is to bring it back home and improve his or her teaching and research in their original institution.</p></speech>

In accordance with the processes of the university, the first step is to carry out an investigation of the claim, which we immediately did when we received the complaint.  The investigation was carried out by an independent external party.  The report of the investigator was that there was no evidence of any physical threat by their colleague and that in the investigator's opinion the complaint made was malicious.  As is their right, persons B and C appealed the finding of the investigation and the university appointed a barrister to hear the appeal.  The barrister upheld the finding of the investigator.  This meant that we moved from a complaint about B and C being physically threatened by a colleague to B and C having allegedly made complaints against their colleague with malicious intent, which was another very serious matter.  We began the disciplinary process to deal with that finding, but it never got off the ground.</p></speech>

I know that cases have to be dealt with, but no private company would agree to pay the wages of four people in two positions.  No business could survive in that way, yet because the taxpayer is picking up the tab, this is being allowed to continue.  There is no incentive on any side to bring the matter to a conclusion.

I am only making a general observation about the general principle involved.  I am sure there are other cases across the public service where people have been suspended while matters are being addressed.  No private company could afford to run a business in that way.  It is easy to pay people when it is not one's own money that is being used.  Would Dr. Love like to comment?</p></speech>

As the committee has heard, all sides have become entrenched.  We are also trying to afford fair treatment.

In the course of this afternoon's meeting, we have discussed persons A, B and C.  That is three people.  That is quite a high percentage.  It is almost 10% of the staffing levels of the department.  I am concerned because what I am hearing from the witnesses is that in the case of person A, the person was unwell.  In the case of persons B and C, they were, the witnesses allege, malicious.  I am left with that sinking feeling that all is not or was not well in the witness's department.  To have three people fall foul of the system and for the witness to say the fault is not on the side of the university is to me quite extraordinary.  I would need a lot of convincing that what happened here was simply somebody who was key but became unwell, but everything was hunky-dory otherwise, and that persons B and C were simply malicious.  There is more to this than meets the eye.  I do not think we have the scope in the course of this meeting to get into it, but I want it recorded that for three people to find themselves in - let us be diplomatic - this level of controversy with the university from a staffing level of 38 is a very high percentage.  Is it not?</p></speech>

The dispute and the use of the word "entrenched" particularly bother me.  My function is to implement the process that we have agreed with our staff and governing authority to resolve disputes amongst staff.  There is another person the Deputy has not mentioned at all, who is the person who was accused of engaging in physically threatening behaviour towards persons B and C.  We are not alleging that persons B and C are malicious.  What I have told the committee is that an external investigation upheld by an external appeal has come to that conclusion.

I made that distinction.  I have no difficulty in acknowledging that Mazars acknowledged that process.  That is for sure.  However, that does not solve the problem for me.  I see a cultural problem that screams out at me of people perhaps being leaned on, not being supported and possibly getting sick as a result of the stress of it.  I do not accept that the net point here is that person A was ill and the other two were malicious in all of their intent.  I think that is a wrong depiction of what happened.  The difficulty is that we do not have a single in-depth analysis of each of these allegations to establish if the rot went wider or deeper than what we have had a glance of.  That bothers me.  I do not want to think badly of the professor, much less of the university, but I would be misleading if I said anything other than the fact that situation to me is extremely troubling.</p> <p>  Do retired persons return to the university to act in a consultancy basis?</p></speech>

The process that we had in place was that round sum payments were paid monthly.  The revised process that we agreed was that we would have regard to the Department of Finance circular on <i>per diem</i>rates for foreign countries and work out the period of time during which the person is in the country.  We went back and looked at every sabbatical and worked out the length of time that people had spent outside of the country.  We recalculated the amount of expenses that they would have received in accordance with the new methodology that we had agreed, which we had confirmed with Revenue was compliant with taxation rules.  We went back and looked at four years of sabbaticals.</p><p>We identified cases where the level of expenses we had paid would have worked out differently under the revised methodology, so we treated the difference as pay and deducted tax on that as though it was salary rather than expenses.  It did not relate to benefit-in-kind or travel expenses for spouses etc.  Salaries were reduced when people went on a sabbatical and the effect of this was to bring their salary up a little bit.  We then treated a portion of what we had paid them as a round sum amount as salary, rather than expenses.</p></speech>

There are many reasons that can happen, including a lack of awareness of the rules about what are and are not allowable expenses.  Among the improvements we made to the expenses regime, for want of a better term, in 2010 was to make it crystal clear what claims were allowable and what claims were not.</p></speech>

What I am hearing from him is that he does not believe there was any abuse of the system, nor any intentional wrongdoing by anybody.  If there was any wrongdoing it was because people did not understand the processes relating to the rules.  Certainly he would not agree that there was any level of corruption with a small "c" or fiddling of expenses.

It is a very simple question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.1442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Field" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017033000002#WW03100"><p>We aspire at all times to do things in accordance with best practice.  We have made our best efforts to give assurances to the committee on this, and in fairness to Deputy McDonald, she has expressed concern about assurance.  We have tried to outline in our briefing paper that we have implemented robust processes and procedures and they are followed.  I am satisfied on the evidence available to me that they are followed.  I do not believe there is a pattern or culture that indicates otherwise.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy McDonald's earlier question, the allegations made by persons B and C were made in general sense and there were not specifics.  In the absence of specifics, we conducted a general review of travel and subsistence policy and its implementation within the university.  We brought in Deloitte to audit, and we made available to it all of our expense claims from March 2014 to August 2015, which we felt covered the period of the allegations.  Deloitte did not identify any issue.  I wish to give that assurance that it was an independent review and the company was given access to every expense claim it went through in that period.  Subsequent to the review being completed, in January 2016 persons B and C identified 69 specific transactions about which they raised concerns.  We reviewed all those transactions.  They were all ones which had been paid.  They differed from person A's allegations in that they were paid rather than unpaid.  They also differed in that persons B and C did not raise issues about having difficulty in getting them signed off, because as we have outlined, we changed the approval process so that it was an entirely online process.  The expense claim must be approved online or it does not progress to the next step and will not get paid.</p></speech>

I accept what he says and thank him for his clarity, but we got a straightforward answer from Professor Barry who accepted some responsibility for the failures.  I am asking the same question of Mr. Field.  Rather than giving me again a long-winded response, I ask him to be quite short and succinct about whether he accepts any personal responsibility for the control lapses that happened?</p></speech>

To be clear, for the period between August 2009, when I joined, and October 2010, there were approximately 10,000 or 11,000 expense transactions and what has been identified is that perhaps two or three of those were control lapses.

It goes back to what I asked about the cost of reports and facilitators.  Presumably, Professor Barry will come back with the cost and number of facilitators.  It is 5 o'clock so it is okay if Professor Barry does not have that figure.  I would like it because I have seen a reference to at least two.  There are all of the legal costs as well as a result of the human resource issues.  I would like to know the number of facilitators.</p> <p>  It took a report to get the university to implement the recommendations.  I ask this of every institution, how come the university's internal controls did not result in alarm bells ringing?  Why did it take a &euro;70,000 report, which is just one specific item, to tell the university to implement these recommendations?  They highlighted lots of things and the university accepted them.  It has implemented all of the recommendations with the exception of two.  The university has accepted that there were failings.  Why did it take such an effort?  I will not go into the people who have contacted us but considering the toll on the institution, the toll in terms of the taxpayer and the toll on the people, why did it take so much to rectify something?</p></speech>

I will take the opportunity of saying quite clearly to the committee that John Field was appointed as director of finance in August 2009 and has introduced a major review of the processes in place in the finance part of the organisation.  He has introduced and enhanced practically every single process we have.  To give some level of assurance to the committee, there was a full Revenue audit of the university in 2013 which looked at all our pay and expenses.  No serious issues were raised in the course of that audit.  Every time there is an audit there are recommendations for how things can be done a little bit better.</p><p>We welcome those recommendations from audit and any suggestion that we are so perfectly brilliant that there should be no possibility of improving the processes within the university is a wish that no private or public sector organisation could fulfil.  We are not going to sit here and be pilloried as if we were useless until someone came along and told us what to do.  We have always operated to the highest possible standards and we have accepted recommendations from external audits and reports and are determined to implement them. </p></speech>

There are very few of them.  The majority of disputes that arise between staff in the university are settled informally without ever going outside their departments.  Occasionally, however, as one would expect in any large organisation, some disputes prove intractable.  The ones highlighted in the Mazars report and in our financial statements dealing with that aspect of our business are the few that have led to disciplinary processes that in some cases have ended with negotiated settlements.</p></speech>

In that way, a person reading the financial statements at the end of the year would at least get a picture of the foundation.</p></speech>

As the members of the press are taking their seats, I reiterate that they should please ensure mobile phones are switched off.  No apologies have been received this morning.  Today's public session is a discussion with the Garda Commissioner on issues of public concern that have been the subject of media coverage in recent days, including fixed charge notices and how it is that 14,700 wrongful convictions were secured as a result of Garda error; and breath test data that revealed 937,000 breath tests were falsely recorded on the PULSE system.</p> <p>  I welcome the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is joined by Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, Deputy Commissioner John Twomey, Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn and Mr. Joe Nugent, who is chief administrative officer with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are joined in the Gallery by Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications; Superintendent Marie Broderick from the Garda Commissioner's office; and Superintendent Paul Murray, the press officer.  On behalf of the committee I thank them for their attendance today and accepting our invitation in order to discuss these important matters.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question and answer session.  Before inviting the Garda Commissioner to begin, I must provide the normal caution relating to privilege.  I draw the attention of all witnesses to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask all members to conduct their questioning without recourse to inappropriate language or charge.</p> <p>  I remind members the committee does not have the power to make findings of fact or expressions of opinion adverse to the good name or reputation of a citizen not a Member of these Houses.  I also remind members to confine questioning to the matters directly before us for address today.  The Garda Commissioner will address those now in her opening statement.</p></speech>

As Garda Commissioner and on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I sincerely apologise for the grave mistakes and wrongdoing during the last decade that have led to the two controversies we are here today to discuss.  Those mistakes and wrongdoings are unacceptable in policing terms, unacceptable in ethical terms, unacceptable in terms of public trust, and, most critically, unacceptable to the advocacy and support groups involved in road safety and to those who were wrongly brought before the courts.  They have raised serious issues about how at all levels the service was managed, how certain garda&iacute; operated on the ground and the supervision applied.  Given the scale of these issues, they cannot simply be blamed on one individual or one area.  It is a collective failure from top down and bottom up.  We all take responsibility for this and for ensuring we establish how this happened and that it cannot happen again.  The committee has been provided with a detailed timeline of events for both matters.  As these are two separate issues, I will deal with each one separately.</p> <p>  I will start with the issue of summonses for fixed charge notices, FCNs, being wrongly issued.  In February 2016, a garda contacted our call centre, known as the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC, in Castlebar and alerted them that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was issuing summonses for not having a valid national car test, NCT, certificate when it should have been a fine.  GISC put checks in place to stop this happening but some summonses had been previously issued and were still in the system.  Discovering the issue was nationwide; we took two actions.  The first was to put an information technology fix in place to prevent it happening it again.  An instruction that all proceedings incorrectly instituted be withdrawn was also issued.</p> <p>  We immediately initiated a look-back, which demonstrated that a number of cases had already been incorrectly referred to the courts and dealt with by way of summons rather than FCN, and this had to be rectified.  In each and every case an offence had been committed, but an incorrect procedure had been employed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Courts Service about how to address cases where a penalty point has been imposed.  A dedicated team has been set up and we are liaising with the Courts Service to expedite this process.  We will be writing to all the people affected from 3 April 3 2017 on the foot of the advice we sought from the DPP.  We will explain what happened and how we propose to rectify the matter.  Any fines imposed will be reimbursed and all records involved will be corrected.  Anyone who believes they have been affected by this matter will be able to contact a helpline from 3 April 2017.</p> <p>  I will deal now with the separate issue of breath tests.  Correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to the Minister responsible for transport was brought to our notice in 2014, where the issue of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints and other matters were raised.  The fact that the original complaint was anonymous hindered our ability to investigate the matter fully.</p><p>However, I issued an instruction to deputy commissioner of operations who subsequently directed all regional assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents to ensure effective mechanisms were in place to monitor the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing, MAT, checkpoints within their respective divisions and districts.  The Department of Justice and Equality was also advised of this.  In addition, we set up a working group to review the recording of traffic equipment and PULSE related data.  The outcome of this working group indicated significant discrepancies in data in one region.  Following this, a nationwide review of all breath test data commenced in June 2016.  We then notified the Department of Justice and Equality of this review and put a note on our website saying our breath test figures were subject to review.  The review was unable to reconcile the PULSE data and the paper-based breath test data, primarily due to significant gaps in the manually recorded breath test data.  To validate the data, we asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to provide us with  the data from its breath test screening devices.  In terms of the scale of difference between its data and ours from 2011 and 2016, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na PULSE data was 1,995,369 and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety data was 1,058,157.</p><p> In November 2016, new electronic procedures were installed on the Garda PULSE system.  This meant personnel had to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test, plus the meter reading, before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint and it indicates that our figures match with those of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for 2016-17.  The breath testing and FCPN issues are being resolved and this will be externally validated.  However, the fact is that we now know some garda&iacute; recorded exaggerated numbers.  At worst, this was deception.  At best, this was incompetence.  Either way, it was individually and organisationally shameful, and will be seen to be shameful by the public and the thousands of garda&iacute; around the country who operate every day to the highest ethical standards.  It also raises serious questions of supervision and management.  My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data.  I will ensure that the people responsible at all levels will be held to account.</p></speech>

What I am apologising for is the failures that have happened over the last ten years, not only in regard to breath testing.  Since 2014, we have been on a major programme of reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are trying to put things right and trying to ensure that we serve the public in an open, professional, transparent and ethical manner and to the standards that would be expected of a modern, professional policing service.  In doing that, we are turning over a lot of stones.  We do not leave a stone unturned.  The turning of one of those stones involved a review of issues that were raised with us around the conduct of MAT checkpoints and the breath testing issue that arose in that regard.</p> <p>  Last March, assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael Finn, identified massive discrepancies between the recorded breath tests on PULSE and the records held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  Last Friday, I appointed an assistant commissioner to investigate how this happened.  What we do know at this point is that these discrepancies occurred individually.  In other words, individual members entered numbers on the system that do not match or correspond with the numbers recorded on the system of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</p></speech>

Therefore, the assistant commissioner has to establish how this was done.  In other words, was the information entered erroneously and so on.  As I said in my opening statement this is either deception, in so far as somebody picked a number and entered into the system, or it was an error or miscount of numbers.</p></speech>

Clearly, somebody inputting information inaccurately or inadvertently would constitute a mistake.  However, the Commissioner has also apologised for the wrongdoing.  What I am asking is, does she agree that one of the examples of wrongdoing for which she is apologising is the input by members of the force of information about breath tests which they knew to be false?  It is a simple question.</p></speech>

I am not in asking that question seeking the names of individuals.  When garda&iacute; return to a station following a checkpoint and say that they carried out 40 breath tests when they only did 20, who in the station is responsible for inputting the information into the system?  Is that the function of the traffic inspector or the garda involved in carrying out the checkpoint?</p></speech>

If there was no sergeant involved it would be the responsibility of the senior garda involved to input the information.</p></speech>

Our focus was always on saving lives on the road, arresting people for drink driving and carrying out checkpoints, which reassure the public and the law abiding motorist that we are enforcing the law.  I can honestly say there was never a competition between regions or chief superintendents in terms of the number of breath tests recorded.</p></speech>

In the wider area of road safety, we were taking a number of actions, a number of which were focused on enforcement and identifying and bringing to court those people who were misbehaving on the roads.  A number of other actions were taken in the area of prevention and preventative actions.  We should see this in the context of trying to save lives on the roads and make them much safer.  If memory serves, in 2005, when a restructuring and reorganisation of traffic functions took place across the organisation, almost 400 people were killed on the roads.  There has been a considerable improvement in that regard.  I say this to provide context.  As enforcement improved, the focus was on behaviour, prevention and compliance.  Mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints and breath tests focus on compliance.  They were included in policing plans and used from a prevention perspective.</p></speech>

The initial action was taken when the results of the audit were identified.  It was a partial audit or examination within the organisation, as opposed to a full audit, as it is known in legal terms.  It was an examination of the data.  The initial action taken was to address and fix the problem.  In April 2016 new measures were brought in to ensure the problem could not recur.  The effectiveness of the new practices and procedures was closely monitored to see how they were working.  When we were satisfied they were doing what we had set out for them to do, the national audit was conducted.</p></speech>

On 28 February I went to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and met its statisticians and analysts.  I could see from what they were able to show me on the day that they had some very useful data.

On 10 March I received a comprehensive database from the bureau which I gave to my analysts in order that they could start reviewing and analysing what we had.</p></speech>

In November 2015, when the partial audit was reviewed, it became apparent at that stage that there was an issue.  Its scale was what we did not know.  The immediate action taken at that stage was to put in new procedures to ensure it would not continue.  It was at that stage that we began to conduct a national audit.  We wrote to the Department of Justice and Equality outlining to it that we had a problem but that we did not know what it was.  We put a note on our website.

The material is being provided.  As the assistant commissioner stated, it is still being gathered as such.  As it is being gathered, it is being provided and regular updates have been provided by both the deputy and assistant commissioners.

We agree with many of the points made in the Commissioner's statement, including that what happened is unacceptable, raises serious issues about how the service is managed, is a collective failure and that people at all levels should be held to account.  There is a contradiction between this and the Commissioner's other public statement in that she is the only person who will not be held to account.  She has stated that, regardless of what the Oireachtas thinks and presumably what the Policing Authority thinks, she will not take responsibility and will not review her position.</p></speech>

I have never said I will not take responsibility.  I am taking responsibility.  From the time I became aware in 2014 that an issue had been raised, albeit in anonymous correspondence, I took responsibility for making sure instructions were issued to address the issues contained in the correspondence.  That is what has led us to this place.  We went and turned over the stones to see what exactly we were dealing with.  The fact is that the corrective actions we have taken since 2014 make it a better service and ensure we will deliver a better service to the community.  I have never said I will not take responsibility.</p><p>When we turn over stones, we will find things that are wrong.  Our commitment is to ensure we identify them and put them right.</p></speech>

She was also informed of this situation by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The Minister told us the other night that in detailed correspondence to her, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na told her that the Commissioner was satisfied that the correct procedures were in place.

They are two separate issues.  We looked at all of the issues that were raised in the correspondence and identified all the procedures involved.  We were satisfied that the issues raised in the specific areas in the correspondence were okay, but that did not stop the then deputy commissioner going along on my instruction and making sure whether there was anything else we did not know.  We looked at all the procedures.  This is what led to the audit or the review on the breath tests and the breath tests that were taking place.  We did that.  We take responsibility for making sure that we put corrections in place all of the time.</p></speech>

I spoke to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in relation to this aspect.  The bureau's audit in the middle of 2015 was in relation to an audit of their equipment.

Professor Cusack was on the airwaves the other morning and he made it very clear that it is quite simple to monitor these devices.  Before the Garda goes out, a record of the number is taken and the same is done when he comes back.  The Garda introduced that system, that paper audit, in April 2016.  Why did the Garda not do it in 2014 when the Garda knew about this?  Why did the Garda wait until March 2017, after <i>The Irish Times</i>article, to ask the Medical Bureau of Road Safety about it when the bureau had this information all along?  The Garda did not need to have an internal audits.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety had the information.</p></speech>

I know it was in November.  The point I want answered is why it took until April 2016, six months later, and a full year from the time the Garda were told for the second time by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety of the discrepancies that the Garda decided to implement a paper account of the situation.

In November 2015, as Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn has already stated, the Garda had the information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety audit.  I know that.  The question is why did the Garda wait until April 2016 even to put in place a paper audit, where the person would be checked going in and going out?  The second question is why the Garda waited for another full year, as in last week, to ask the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for that information, when it had it all along?  The reason I am asking these questions comes back to what the Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn said earlier about data.  Mr. Finn has apologised for data.  Can he understand how difficult it is for us to accept any data from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given what we have heard?  Will the Garda team answer those two questions?  I have a further question relating to data, but I am conscious of time.  The team need to try to answer the question asked.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure our data is 100% accurate today.  We have given a commitment that the data will be externally verified.  What we were endeavouring to do was to try to reconcile our own figures.  There are in excess of 373,000 checkpoints.  The 1.9 million breath tests come from those checkpoints.  We are grappling with huge numbers on a paper-based system.</p></speech>

On the question of data, which is of major significance, I noted at the press conference, Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael Finn spoke about checkpoints.  He told us there was a figure of 400,000 checkpoints carried out during the period.  How can we believe that figure, that 400,000 was actually the number of checkpoints conducted?</p></speech>

How can we take solace from that?  Will Mr. Finn comment on the fact that a former Garda made internal reports that suggested that it was an instruction by management.  There is a difference, as the assistant commissioner knows, when a checkpoint is set up, management instruct and set a target for each station as to how many checkpoints should be carried out by that station and that district.  Obviously events happen unexpectedly and the target cannot be the scheduled checkpoints, and checkpoints are often cancelled.</p><p>We are led to believe that management issued an instruction to say that the number of checkpoints scheduled, rather than the number of checkpoints actually carried out, should be recorded.</p></speech>

The Commissioner's opening remarks were very brief.  I suppose the timelines we were given constituted half-information in some ways, without being derogatory about it.  The Commissioner spoke about fixed charge notices for NCTs.  They accounted for just 6% of the incorrect summonses that were issued.  Are the witnesses saying that the communication to the Department of Justice and Equality and to the Policing Authority related to the NCT fixed charge notices only?</p></speech>

We initially wrote to the Department in June of that year in respect of the NCT offence.  We had to review all of our data back to 2016 after we learned that an offence that should have been dealt with by fixed charge notice had been dealt with by summons.  The person had an offence to answer to but the procedure used was incorrect.  We knew from looking at that data or we certainly questioned whether this could have applied to other issues, given that it had applied to NCT data.  All other offences shifted from summonses to fixed charge notices over a number of years from 2006 up to the current date.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste told the Seanad that errors cannot be repeated because "a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place".  How confident is the Garda that this is the case?  How confident can we be that this is the case?  I am thinking of the public, in particular.</p></speech>

I know it is a fact because I have received a few fixed charge notices before.  I know what they look like.  If I had received one in this instance, I would have known.  Coincidentally, on receipt of a fixed charge notice in October of last year, I was in Naas court and I met some people who were there precisely because they had not received fixed charge notices and had been summonsed to court.  They spent a day in that court.  The judge adjourned because they were pleading not guilty.  They had to come back on another day.  That was in October and December of last year.</p></speech>

I am saying that where a fixed charge should have been issued in every case, it is our view and belief here today that that is the case.  That is why I have said I would like to see the detail.  A fixed charge notice should issue in every single incident where a fixed charge notice applies.  That is not to deny that some people may not have received their fixed charge notices for various reasons and were therefore unaware of the position.

It is causing a lot of confusion around the country.  Any of the offences linked to the GoSafe vans that are parked on the side of the road or the vehicles we use to detect non-intercept types of offences are not linked in any way to the fixed charge notice issue we are discussing here.

The point here is that because of the reality which has been posed in front of the public, its members cannot trust information coming from senior Garda management.  The Commissioner's opening speech suggested that much more can be expected.  We heard on the radio this morning that domestic violence figures might be all over the place.  The witnesses cannot really reassure me in terms of the checkpoint figures.  I have given them my own direct personal experience, and the personal experience of other people I met in court on a different day, which belies the narrative the witnesses have put forward, which is that the problems in the system have been corrected.

I acknowledge the apology she has given regarding the specific incidents we are talking about here and the questions that have arisen.</p><p>I would like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks she should apologise for the manner and the way in which she and her senior management team have conducted themselves and the investigation or audit into this process.  Before the Commissioner answers me, I want to put a couple of questions and points to her.  Yes, we are talking quite big numbers, it is a discrepancy of approximately 1 million and we are talking about a lot of mandatory tests, but she commands a force, and by her own statements, she has been conducting her own investigation that started approximately in 2014.  She has come in today, and she has said that the Garda management has still not completed the audit.  Does she think that is acceptable?  </p><p> I would be very interested to know if the Commissioner could give me a logistical breakdown on how many people have been deployed to carry out this work, from the initial audit in the southern region to date.  That speaks volumes to how seriously she is taking this.  If she does not want to apologise for it, can she explain to any reasonable person why, when it came to her attention in 2014, she is still not able to give complete information to us here today at the end of March 2017?</p></speech>

This issue was raised in April 2014.  I want to preface this statement by saying that this is not an excuse, these are just facts.  The facts were that the former Commissioner had retired.  I was acting in an interim capacity only, performing the functions of the Commissioner, both deputy commissioners - Deputy Commissioner Operations and Deputy Commissioner Strategy and Change Management - so I was the single person in the executive.  I had the most seriously reduced management team ever in the history of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The assistant commissioner who was given this responsibility to do was carrying portfolios, three very significant portfolios.  These are not excuses but the facts were that the layers of management below that were depleted.  To link in with Deputy Daly's question - the committee members will understand but I say this for the benefit of the public - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has devolved functions.  There is the Commissioner, there are deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and they form the nucleus of the management team.  At that stage, we were dealing with such a depleted management team that I was almost single-handed, with a team of five assistant commissioners, trying to run what was then a 14,500 person organisation.  To be fair to the individual who was given this task, he had to do it with a myriad of other responsibilities.  I do not have a logistical breakdown of the people who applied but I would be very happy to provide it to the committee.</p> <p>  The chief superintendent, who was in the traffic bureau at the time, was also carrying multiple portfolios, as was the superintendent.  We had come through a very significant recession and the Garda were no different from anywhere else in the public or private sector but some of the legacy issues that we are dealing with now arise from the deficit and depletion of the supervisory and management capacity.  It is worth remembering that I spent nine months in that position as interim Acting-Commissioner.  I was appointed in November of that year.  It took a further 11 months to have two deputy commissioners appointed and it is only in January of this year that we eventually got the appointment of a full executive, that is the people you see here.  We very much welcome the transition of senior Garda appointments to the Policing Authority and thankfully, last week, along with the Policing Authority, we eventually got a panel of assistant commissioners -----  </p></speech>

She has said she is not making excuses but she then delivered a complete set of excuses as to why she did not do something.</p> <p>  I asked how many people were deployed to the audit.  She does not know.  That is incredible.  There are two aspects of this that are very important.  First, the Garda conducted the initial audit in the southern region.  Whatever about the time lag between the Garda management deciding to change processes afterwards, the initial audit was conducted in the southern region and something obviously registered with the Garda that there was a problem, regardless of how many people were not there to make decisions.  Did the Commissioner not think that problem was so serious that she should inform the Policing Authority properly?  I put it to the Commissioner that not only did she not think that the problem was serious enough at that stage to inform the Policing Authority, but that in some of the answers which she and her colleagues gave to the Policing Authority, they went out of their way not to make it obvious that they were dealing with something very serious.  The Commissioner knew it was serious enough that processes were going to have to be changed.  She knew it was serious enough that she would have to trigger a national audit, even if she took forever to do it, but the knew it was serious enough.  She did not think it was serious enough to go out of her way to forthrightly bring it to the attention of the Policing Authority, or to anyone else, to say there was a belief there was a very serious problem.  Maybe more was done in private in which case the Commissioner might tell us, but in public answers to the Policing Authority a minimum amount of information was given.  </p> <p>  The reason I asked the Commissioners to apologise for how she has conducted the investigation is that Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management has a method of answering questions which involves not supplying information unless we absolutely get to the heart of it.  It deeply upsets me and is unacceptable in our time.  Again, I ask, how many people were involved in the audit?  Does she have any indication as to whether it was one person writing letters?  Does she have any indication as to whether a team was established?  Does she have any indication as to whether, if that team was established, there were, say, ten people on it or 15?  She is in here and says that it is not completed.  How many people are currently working on the audit?  What level of priority is given to it?</p></speech>

Deputy Commissioner, John Twomey, was there for the initial part of the audit and it has continued.  I do not have the logistical breakdown of the individuals but we are happy to provide it.  The Deputy makes a very interesting point about the old culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of waiting until we get to the heart of the answers.  That is the way we do things.  We have been brought up as policemen and women and we like to establish the facts before we come out publicly.  Part of the commitment to openness and transparency which we committed to in our modernisation and renewal programme, and that we committed to and I committed to as part of the Government reform programme, was exactly what we saw happen in this case.  We do not have all the answers.  The assistant commissioner has outlined how it was of such significant proportions that we made a decision and the assistant commissioner raised this with the public.   In June 2016, when we became aware that there was an issue with the fixed charge notices, we put a notice on our website to tell people.  On the breath tests, we put a qualifier on the website to say that this data is subject to review.</p> <p>  For the record, as the committee knows, the Policing Authority was constituted on 1 January 2016.  The authority was not there in November 2015.  I will ask the deputy commissioner to deal with the informal briefings that were given to the authority.  It is a matter of regret that when the Policing Authority was constituted, it was not informed of this fact.  We have apologised for that and have said that it was an oversight.</p></speech>

Was it an oversight because the Commissioner thought it was not important enough to tell the Policing Authority?  Was it an oversight because the Policing Authority is new and the Garda did not understand that it had to tell them?  Was it an oversight because the Garda management decided it was just not going to tell these people?  Why was it an oversight?</p></speech>

It was an oversight because there is a transition arrangement.  We have explained this from the outset and even in the preamble to the establishment of the Policing Authority.  There is a perception that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a very data-rich organisation, has systems which at a press of a button can produce and present data.  We cannot.  In this case, both of my colleagues sitting to my right and left, can explain how this would mean a trawl through volumes, mountains of paper records to try to match them with the PULSE system which the Garda inspectorate quite rightly pointed out is outdated and archaic.  We have now secured Government funds to make improvements to it and we are doing the upgrades and improvements.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned process.  A process must be gone through to ensure we establish the facts without, as the assistant commissioner stated, applying fixes or information that is wrong or distorted.  We are trying to do that.  I used a metaphor the other day - we are trying to keep the lights on while rewiring the house.  It is important that people understand this.  We are dealing with an old system of paper records that are mountains high.  Some of them are in basements of Garda stations, others are in station attics and others are in desk drawers in stations.  They must be taken out and gone through.  Yes, it took-----</p></speech>

When they considered the examination of the southern region, between six and eight people were involved at the outset.  Six people were directly tasked with it and they brought in others to support them.</p> <p>  I will repeat what the Commissioner is trying to outline about the scale, the number and the complexity involved.  It is difficult to defend before the committee what is the indefensible.  The Commissioner has outlined that what happened was unacceptable behaviour.  Not for one second are we making excuses to the committee or covering up in any shape or form.  Rather, we are trying to provide members and others who are watching the answers they are seeking.

It started out as a review of all of our data, PULSE systems and how we managed traffic data.  The working group just happened to pick the southern region as an example.  Roll on to where we are today and we are undertaking the national audit because we discovered discrepancies.  The working group highlighted that there was a problem.  In the middle of June last year, we decided that we needed to examine the issue across the organisation to determine how large its scale was.  The traffic section, which is where I am, sent out a series of questions on all of that-----</p></speech>

Mr. Finn is telling me that, initially, six people or so set up a team to undertake an examination of the southern region and a national audit is now being conducted, but a dedicated team is not working on that audit even though it is trying to pilot the information back into the organisation so that the witnesses would not have needed to attend this meeting and say that it is not complete.</p></speech>

Staff in the respective divisional and traffic offices are trying to compile it.  It was out of sheer frustration when we could not get the data - we were looking for paper records from as far back as 2009 to try to reconcile our data - that I went to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and asked for data that it was prepared to share with us and that I could use to validate ours.  When I got those data, I gave it to my analysts.  Two are working for me.  They do a great deal of other work besides this, but I got them to work-----</p></speech>

As late as yesterday, every chief superintendent in the country came to Garda headquarters.  We can get the breakdown of which officers are working on this per division for the Deputy.  We do not have that information with us, but we would be happy to provide the Deputy with the logistical breakdown of how many people are working on it.  It has been made clear to all of our managers that this is a priority.  It must be finalised as soon as possible.  As the assistant commissioner said, there are two analysts in the Garda traffic bureau.  Recently, we secured a commitment from the Government, working closely with the Policing Authority and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to recruit civilians with the proper skills and qualifications.  It has taken us a very long time to do that.  As we discussed yesterday at our meeting with the chief superintendents, we have identified the positions required to put in place divisional business units so that, if we need to do something again, it can be done more speedily and efficiently and with systems that enable us to have the data.  However, it is a work in progress.  We do not have it as yet.  We are doing with the old system-----</p></speech>

It stems from her opening statement and the extensive coverage that one part of her statement yesterday received after it became public knowledge.  She stated: "My fear, and my real fear, is that this falsification is not confined to traffic data."  Is any investigation audit process under way in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is examining data on a problem that is similar to these two matters, in respect of which the Garda has established an audit, and about which the Garda has not informed the public or the Policing Authority?  If so, what is the specific area of investigation?</p></speech>

In my opening statement, I said that I had a fear.  At a time when we are going through such a radical organisational and administrative overhaul, we are rooting out issues to ensure they are right.  We are not leaving any stone unturned.  As one overturns a stone, one finds something.</p> <p>  Additionally, we are benchmarking ourselves against best practice.  As we bring in different people and perspectives, we are looking at things.  When we identify issues, we will do precisely what we have done in this case.  We will deal with them and put them right.  We will be open and transparent about that.  A number of reviews are under way.  I can allow the deputy commissioner to talk about them.  Everyone in this committee room is familiar with the Garda Inspectorate's report, particularly as regards data quality, crime classification and crime recording.  We are working closely with the CSO.  We continue to review all of our processes.  We are introducing something that we never had before, namely, standard operating procedures, overhauling the roads policing unit and introducing new measures to ensure we have consistent-----</p></speech>

The answers are not simple.  To put it as simply as I can, I chair a group that is tasked with examining our data quality.  We specifically consider the issues that were raised in the inspectorate's report, namely, crime classification, crime reclassification and incidents mark detected.  More recently, we have examined our approach to domestic violence and what is being done in that regard, which Deputy Daly referenced.</p> <p>  Is there something that we are not mentioning?  Absolutely not.  I cannot tell the committee that everything is perfect within the organisation or that we will not find something down the road.  What is more, I cannot tell it that we will not make mistakes.  We will make mistakes.  Everyone does, but I am giving the committee a clear commitment that we are doing everything to address those issues in respect of which we are being asked to change.</p><p>I would like to get more time at a later stage to explain what we are doing in the context of our data quality.  We have done considerable work in what we call our centre of excellence with the Garda information services centre, GISC, which is a recommendation from the inspectorate.  That commences next Monday in the northern region and it is only happening as a consequence of staffing being provided in the past couple of weeks.  I would like the opportunity to expand in more detail because I think it will address the question-----</p></speech>

My first question is on the part of their statement where they mention that the past decade was one of wrongdoing.  They refer to the fixed charge notice period from 2006 onwards, but they talk about figures from 2009 onwards for breath-testing, with PULSE and Dr&auml;ger breathalyser data.

For background, every checkpoint is authorised in law.  Following the introduction of revised legislation on mandatory alcohol tests, random breath-testing was enabled, prior to which it was on the basis of reasonable suspicion.  There is authorisation for every mandatory alcohol checkpoint that has been conducted.  An inspector or above must authorise it in law.  That evidence is subsequently produced in court for any prosecution.  That evidence was initially in a paper-based system and, at a later stage, it became part of our PULSE system.</p></speech>

The issues that were raised were raised by Garda Reserve, so I want to be clear that it was not about identifying the person who had written the correspondence.  Even though this was anonymous, it was suggested that it was from a Garda Reserve member.  A number of seminars were held around the country with the Garda Reserve to address the issues, to address inclusivity for the Garda reservists in order to ensure that they were valued, and to give a forum where reservists could raise the issues they wanted to.  The correspondence indicated that this individual had written to the Road Safety Authority because that person felt there was not a forum to express issues.  We put that in place as well.  That was the purpose of addressing that.  Separately, the deputy commissioner was dealing with addressing the general issues raised in the correspondence.</p></speech>

We ask Garda members to record the specific number of people breathalysed, the number who tested positive, the number who tested negative and the members who operated and supervised the checkpoint.  One of our difficulties was that we did not always record the data at the time.  In many cases, data were recorded on a busy Friday night.  Anyone who tried to get through to our call centre in Castlebar would have been waiting.  Therefore, it would often have been the following day before a member would have had an opportunity to input information on a MAT checkpoint, or it could have been a few days later if he or she happened to be resting for the few days following a shift.  I think this compounded our problems as to why the data were inaccurate.</p></speech>

Outside facts, I will offer a hypothesis.  As the deputy commissioner mentioned, MAT checkpoints are a preventive measure.  They are actually not designed to detect and catch people but to encourage compliant behaviour.  One of the significant changes we have made in our culture is making sure we put prevention first and at the heart of everything we do.  The following is a hypothesis - I want to be very careful - that perhaps the preventive nature of MAT checkpoints was not valued or viewed as being as important as detections.  I do not wish in any way to detract from what I said in my opening remarks about the very good, diligent, professional and ethical work done by the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na every single day, but one hypothesis is that because of this, recording accurate numbers, be it 24 or 48 hours after a very busy period - that does not lessen or diminish the actions involved - was not seen as important as being accurate in the detection of offences.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-30a.1843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017033000002#J03300"><p>I have a few more questions to ask, but perhaps I might get to them later.  There must have been a cultural trigger for these actions and the representatives must provide some idea for the committee as to why they happened.  It is not acceptable simply to wait for a factual understanding.  They should give us, as senior members of the Garda, as the ones who accept responsibility collectively, as they stated, some idea as to why this happened.</p> <p>  I want to track back.  Again, I am interested in the period from 2006 to 2009.  There are a number of reasons one could have had a cultural trigger.  One was there would have been an incentive.  There can be an incentive for a member of any organisation to do better or perhaps gain credit within the system in terms of promotion.  That is one question.  Do the representatives believe any Garda member anywhere tried to manipulate data to drive potential promotional opportunities?  </p> <p>  I refer to the bonus-related payments system in place from 2006 until 2010.  We know that senior officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service were paid bonuses based on particular outcomes driven by human resource management within the context of whatever system in which they were operating.  We know that a bonus system was in place for members of the force from assistant commissioner level up.  What were the performance-related targets at the time when bonuses were paid and could this have been the trigger for driving data upwards in the force?  Was that the trigger that drove a cultural norm within the force to maximise data outcomes?  We know that bonuses were paid to most senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the time the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, criticised the bonus culture across the senior sections of the Civil Service and the wider public service, but we know that senior officers in the Garda also received bonuses.  What I want to know specifically is whether data for traffic, alcohol testing and checkpoints were potentially linked with bonuses?  In a particular division if one Garda member had a better outcome in the data submitted as against his or her colleagues, was there a difference in the bonuses paid?  Were there performance-related targets linked with bonuses which we know were paid to senior officers in the force at the time.  Could this have been the cultural trigger?</p></speech>

Would that be true?  Mr. Finn accepts some responsibility for the fact that things went haywire around the fixed charge notices.  Mr. Finn will have noticed that yesterday I raised in the D&aacute;il the issue of a female garda who is stationed in Bray.  I have the result of an internal disciplinary inquiry here and both Mr. Finn and the Commissioner signed it.  Dismissal is being recommended on five grounds, one of which was failure to put a criminal complaint on PULSE.  A second ground was failure to safeguard a statement.  This is a station where the GPSU report found that 30% of the files could not even be found in the station such was the anarchy prevailing in it.  Given that Mr. Finn accepts responsibility for over 13,000 mistakes, how, in God's name, can he recommend dismissal to a female garda for these two incidents?</p></speech>

I must be careful.  We will not speak about any specific case.  Sometimes, by putting information into the public domain, particularly if there is a sequence of events, it can lead to the identification of an individual and to be fair to individuals, we cannot do that.  However, what I will say is that where any individual is identified as engaging in some type of wrongdoing, a process is undertaken which is a disciplinary process.  In some instances, cases end up as criminal investigations and persons are charged before the courts.  That is a very different thing from what we are talking about now.  What we are talking about now, as Deputy Jack Chambers said, is a systemic-wide issue.  The assistant commissioner, as the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing, ook responsibility and apologised for those systemic widespread issues.</p><p>That is a very different scenario from somebody being identified and accused of wrongdoing.</p></speech>

Let me move on.  My next question is for Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn.  We know that breath test figures were dramatically inflated.

We will have to investigate to find out exactly.  The data I was able to verify I have verified, and I went off externally to do that.  I am happy, given the source of that, which is the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, to stand over 100% the figures I have corrected in terms of what was on our PULSE system.</p></speech>

Deputy Commissioner Twomey has apologised for not contacting the Policing Authority last year, last month or at any time about this issue.  There would not necessarily have been a need for a formal structure to make contact with it.  It could have been through an e-mail or a phone call, and I am sure Deputy Commissioner Twomey meets people from the Policing Authority the odd time.  Is there a level of distrust between the two bodies that this information could not be relayed?</p></speech>

There is one with regard to the fixed charge notices and one with regard to the breath tests.  With regard to the fixed charge notices, the Policing Authority was given a full briefing from June 2016 all the way up.  On a monthly basis, it was made aware of it.  I want to be clear on this point.  With regard to the excesses in fixed charge notices, it was given all of the information we had.  It is only since 10 March this year, following further consultation with other agencies involved, that we have been able to narrow down the numbers.  As soon as we had the numbers, they were given to the Policing Authority in advance of the press conference.  With regard to the fixed charge notices, it was briefed on it from June last year.  That is clear.</p> <p>  With regard to the breath tests what happened was letters were issued, including a letter issued to the Department, and a note was put on the website.  This was the context.  The issue with regard to the original numbers came to notice in November 2015, and that was in advance of the establishment of the Policing Authority.  I have spoken on a number of occasions to the Policing Authority and we have outlined the position on what happened.  We had written externally.  We had put a note on our website on the fixed charge notice.  We informed the Policing Authority and briefed it.  We meet every month and we answer all the questions on this.  All along the way every effort has been made, and as late as last night further correspondence was provided to the Policing Authority to keep it up to date.</p></speech>

Cathal Mac Coille stated the bureau knew enough in 2014 to ask the question, to which Professor Cusack replied the numbers simply did not add up.  Cathal Mac Coille asked whether Professor Cusack had a meeting with the Garda, to which he replied he had regular meetings with it and he was told the Garda did not need any more mouthpieces.  Professor Cusack stated the bureau does not in any way become involved in Garda operational matters and it took it at face value.  Professor Cusack went on to say that in August 2015 the bureau carried out a survey of 200 of the 1,200 devices and it found, with regard to the estimation of the average use of those 200 devices, that it appeared there were not 400,000 plus tests being done on the devices but closer to 200,000 and the Garda was informed of this.  This was in August to September 2015.  How in God's name did that not ring alarm bells?  That was a year and a half ago.</p></speech>

We have a chain of command.  This job was given to the deputy commissioner, who gave it to the assistant commissioner in traffic.  In the roads policing bureau as it is now, which was the traffic bureau then, there are various people who and structures that deal with various issues.  As the assistant commissioner outlined earlier, we understand the issues raised by Professor Cusack related to the procurement of mouthpieces for the Drager units.  I can ask Assistant Commissioner Finn to deal with it in more detail again.  It was dealt with by the traffic policy bureau department.  Professor Cusack did not correspond with me or communicate with me.  He and his staff communicated with people in the traffic policy bureau.</p></speech>

It goes without saying at this stage that there have been so many investigations and reports.  Things are not really running awfully smoothly.  Surely the buck stops with the Commissioner.  The last Garda Inspectorate report in 2015 stated that no one had made the change happen.  The Commissioner was almost two years in the gig at that stage.  If the Chief Inspector was to do another report now, he would find that things have not improved since.  With regard to implementing his recommendations, the Commissioner put a guy - I will not name him here today as people get upset about names - in charge of implementing that in Garda headquarters in the park.  He is the subject of three protected disclosures.  I do not understand how the Commissioner can expect things to change if she is going to put the fox in charge of the chickens.</p></speech>

Again, I will not speak about any individuals but I want to be very clear about something.  This is a statement of facts.  When I took over as acting interim Commissioner and applied for the job of Garda Commissioner in 2014, the job description included delivering on the Government reform programme that was necessary for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but no one told us what that reform consisted of.  Let me be crystal clear about the demonstrable track record that is there to prove what we did, albeit with, as I say, a very depleted management team.  We took not only the 11 Garda Inspectorate reports but the 43 reports that were completed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the previous ten years.  I was asked about those ten years.  The 43 reports contained no less than 1,400 recommendations and a significant number of those were from the Garda Inspectorate.  For the first time ever in the history of the State and the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we set about developing a comprehensive and coherent reform programme and last June we launched the programme.  The last time I attended the committee, we shared that document with it.  However, we did not just launch a glossy document.  We set out a roadmap of precisely what we were going to do over the next five to seven years.  In that intervening period, we set about ensuring we influenced Government and got its commitment in terms of people and human resources, technology and funding needed to make it happen.  We started making that happen but what really made a difference to communities throughout the country were victim service offices, our protective services bureau, Operation Thor-----</p></speech>

I would like to begin by summing up these issues and events as sloppy, appalling and an unprofessional catastrophe.  I think this will have long lasting effects on Garda morale and public trust.  I have listened carefully to the Commissioner's remarks on a number of specific questions and am minded to recall her summing up of Deputy Chambers's examples of his views and others on this matter with the term "unprofessional".  She used that term herself.  Notwithstanding the direction of the Chairman, in terms of morale and public faith in the management team or individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or both at this point, my first question is whether the Commissioner accepts that the public and Members of these Houses are greatly concerned about the current direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, notwithstanding the document that is under her left elbow.   I recall going through that document with the committee.  Would she accept that point?</p></speech>

As I stated, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also concerned.  This is not just a document under my left elbow.  This is a programme that we have been working on for three years.  We have delivered tangible results that are making a difference to communities and individual citizens of the State throughout the country.  Otherwise, we would not be doing it.  I am not in this just to produce a glossy document to talk about here or, indeed, to hide behind.  I am ensuring that we are improving and professionalising the service that we deliver to every citizen of the State.  I will continue to do that.</p></speech>

As Assistant Commissioner Finn has said, the press conference was being dealt with by the chairman and CEO of the Policing Authority.  Separately, the deputy commissioner had communications with the Department, and we can give date for that - prior to that happening.  There is a distinction to be made in that we were not aware, at that time, of the figures.  We did not have the figures when the communication was communicated to the Department.</p></speech>

While the press conference as ongoing, and while Assistant Commissioner Finn was outlining the information, the executive, the Garda Commissioner, myself and the others were actually in a meeting with the Policing Authority at that time giving them a full briefing.  They had been given the documentation and we were giving them a briefing on that same day.</p></speech>

As the former assistant commissioner for change management, does the Garda Commissioner not recognise the forthright breakdown in communication and information to the oversight bodies responsible for the Garda and that we absolutely need frontloaded honesty here at all times? I appreciate the mentality she outlines, and that she has said "We have been brought up as policemen and women ...", which I understand.  Does the Garda Commissioner not understand that sometimes the provision of a small amount of information, perhaps not the overall figure, is an absolute requirement when it comes to the purpose of this committee?  In the last D&aacute;il this committee painstakingly went through a process, including a visit to Northern Ireland and Scotland, to provide the Department of Justice and Equality with examples of what the implementation of a new policing authority would look like.  Does the Garda Commissioner not recognise that this is needed? While it might be privileged information to a small group at least the information is then in the hands of a responsible authority which then can make a determination for itself in a professional way as to whether parts of the information should be made public.  Does the Garda Commissioner realise that she has a responsibility as part of that process?</p></speech>

We are doing our very best to ensure that the provision of information becomes much smoother, not just to the Policing Authority, also to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  Now that we have secured the commitment to allow us to employ some civilian members it will be very helpful as it will allow us to put the administrative structures in place to ensure that smooth transition of information.  Some of that administration, to be frank, is complete work overload and we are expecting people to do a lot of things.  There is an importance to that work and a seriousness in actually providing information.  In between our authority meetings there are a number of committee meetings each of which the people at this table attends.  There is a two-way flow of information.  Reference was made earlier to not just waiting to write and those interactions and meetings are very useful.</p></speech>

Deputy Commissioner Twomey put a rough figure on it.  I want to extrapolate this a little bit.  I appreciate that he does not have the exact figure and that he will come back to the committee on that.  Could we put into brackets the numbers of individuals across the State who are working on this?  The deputy commissioner mentions between five or six and ten people, with additional personnel being brought in to support.  Would he estimate that it is fewer than 20 or more than 20 individuals; are they all sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or are they also professionals within the force?</p></speech>

It is both sworn members and civilian members.  There are skilled analysts providing the number crunching.  At the moment there are a number of people in every Garda division doing the exact same work.  We are talking about closer to 80 to 100 people now.  Every Garda division has a number of people working on it, both sworn and civilian members, supported by analysts in all of those cases.  It is complex.  It starts in 560 Garda stations and is cascades up to 103 Garda divisions where the superintendents compile the numbers.  Then it cascades again up into the 28 Garda divisions.  There are people everywhere and that is the region of the number we are talking about at the moment.</p></speech>

The witness said earlier that sergeants were responsible for inputting the records of breath tests, either at the time or a couple of days afterwards depending on shifts and workload.  Is that only done by sergeants or is it the individual member who was in charge of the checkpoint?</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Brophy's query earlier, Mr. Finn spoke of personnel who were deployed on the street and who did the breath testing and inputted the figures into the system, either entirely accurately or entirely inaccurately.  Could the witness explain if any of the fact-finding personnel under Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan are the same individuals who would have been out on the street or their senior personnel?  Has the Garda Commissioner ensured that the personnel involved are not, and never have been, those who stood at computer terminals punching in the numbers?</p></speech>

I have adequately outlined how important it is to provide information even if it is not a full picture, in order to give that information across.  The Garda Commissioner was fairly blunt in her opening statement, which I appreciate, but the matter that came to my attention yesterday on the publication of the internal audit was alarming to say the least.  The sheer timescale of that report and previous reports, with partial implementation and then slip-back, was appalling.  </p> <p>  One issue is most stark in all of this.</p><p>I will use the term misappropriation while others might use stronger terminology.  When it came to the leasing of a farm that had been earmarked for certain facility upgrades to Templemore College, which was then leased to a farmer with the proceeds ending up, I understand, in the canteen and shop account that amounted to hundreds of thousands of euro.  I do not have the report in front of me so I am guesstimating.  Those moneys were then expended on whatever was deemed appropriate.  There is a word that I would attribute to such activity.  I shall parse myself carefully to say it would appear to be embezzlement because, when one thinks about the matter, it is receiving moneys that were not rightfully one's own and putting them into, effectively, one's own account and then using the moneys for personal reasons.  </p></speech>

Again, presumably for uses for the personal benefit of the individuals who had access to the account or perhaps those within Templemore College but I am not sure.  I wish to refer to the alarming responses by the auditing service within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, indeed, the previous financial director's report from 2008.</p> <p>  Can the Commissioner any the following questions?  Are the individuals who were in charge of Templemore College up to 2008 still serving within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Clearly, I do not need to hear their names as I do not wish to identify individuals.  Are the people in management positions?  Are they no longer present in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Does the Commissioner accept the seriousness of the interim report?  Does she accept the nature of the investigations that are now required by, presumably, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and-or others?

The Deputy asked whether we understood the seriousness of this matter.  We absolutely do.  So much so that when I received the interim audit report, containing the recommendations, I immediately tasked the deputy commissioner and the chief administrative officer with putting in place structures to implement the recommendations, even pending waiting for the final report.  I can get the chief administrative officer, if the Chairman wishes, to give a very high level overview of what we are doing.</p></speech>

It is important to send that message to the public that the trust in the college and the financial controls that are necessary to run a modern institution are resolved and will be in place by the middle of this year.</p> <p>  As the Commissioner has said, the Commissioner directed that the interim recommendations in the report - and if I can, Chairman, I shall make a brief sidebar on this piece - were implemented before the finalisation of that audit report.  I will explain the timeline on that in a moment.  What does that mean?  It means that the report arrived formally at the audit committee last week.  In the intervening period when the draft had been prepared work had commenced on resolving the issues.  We absolutely take them most seriously.  There is a dedicated team in place to resolve these issues.  They report directly to me and will report directly to me until such time as the recommendations are finalised.  I commit to the Commissioner that that will be done by the middle of this year.  </p> <p>  I will explain the timeline between the two pieces because I think it has been a matter of public comment.  A draft report was presented to the Commissioner in or around the end of August last year.  The normal process associated with those audits is that individuals who have an interest in this matter have the opportunity to make comments.  Given the number of people involved that meant the report could not be finalised until relatively recently. </p> <p>  Deputy Farrell has raised some very serious questions.  I am conscious of other issues that are on.  I am more than happy to brief the committee, individually or collectively, around this issue.  We can get more information on that at a later date, if that would help.  </p></speech>

The Commissioner, in her statement to the committee this morning, mentioned the anonymous nature of the complaint made by a person who claimed to be a Reservist in 2014, which was sent to the Road Safety Authority, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the then Minister for Justice and Equality and the Commissioner herself.  She mentioned in her remarks that the fact the source of the document was unidentified was a hindrance.  Can she clarify why unidentified information was a hindrance to the investigation that ensued?</p></speech>

At the outset it is only fair that we put on the public record the good work that is being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the thousands of men and women who risk their lives for us on a daily basis.  We should always take cognisance of that fact in our deliberations.</p> <p>  I will make one comment on Templemore College.  It is quite remarkable that Templemore College is where the fraud squad is trained and now we have learned what has gone on.  Perhaps the matter is for discussion on another day.</p> <p>  In terms of the inflated figures for breath tests, how many individuals from the time that a garda on duty inputs his or her information do the figures go past before they are published?    </p></speech>

I will make a broad statement.</p> <p>  In relation to the audit report, I want to make the following very clear to the committee, and obviously the report has been examined in detail.  There has not been any criminal aspect identified at this time.  I just wanted to be clear on that.</p> <p>  As well as doing traffic enforcement and preventive measures, all of the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must deal with very serious threats from crime, organised crime and, indeed, from terrorism.  We have to take that in context. </p> <p>  I call on Assistant Commissioner Finn to answer the questions on sequencing.  </p></speech>

He or she fills out an authorisation to say, "You have to do ten checkpoints over the next period," or whatever.  They get put on our PULSE as an incident that needs to be done.  It is recorded on a PULSE system.  After the checkpoint is completed the member would come back.  He or she may very well ring our call centre in Castlebar from the scene, as happens in cases, and he or she can update that.  As I explained earlier on, if it was a Friday night or a very busy occasion, he or she may be unable to do that on the day so it could be the following day before it happens.</p> <p>  If there are a number of people at the checkpoint, and there might be a sergeant in charge, but if the sergeant is out there with a number of people, and sometimes we conduct super checkpoints on the motorways, it is a big grouping-----    </p></speech>

It is technically possible and that will be part of what my colleague, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan, will be doing to see is there any evidence of that.  If there was, we are confident that we could find that out because every record that is created is on our PULSE system and if there is any amendment to a record, we can track down who entered it, who changed it, when and where.

Did she not think that this was serious enough that an outside body should have conducted the audit for the Garda?  Given that the problem arose within the force, did she not think it would have been more appropriate for an outside body to have carried out this audit?  It took the Cabinet last Tuesday to decide to carry out an outside investigation.  Did she not think that this was serious enough that it warranted bringing in independent external expert to carry the audit out?</p></speech>

I had written to the Policing Authority asked them in their deliberations and consideration of the matter would they consider perhaps handing the matter over to the Garda Inspectorate or some other competent body to look at it.  The purpose of bringing in the internal audit - that was on the advice of our own audit committee - is to look at the audit that has been done and just to check the methodology and the processes, etc., that we used for that.  Our audit committee has raised the question of whether this was an audit within the meaning of an auditor's audit or whether this was an examination.  It was probably more of an examination and a review as opposed to a technical audit but, nevertheless, Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; C&uacute;al&aacute;in, instructed the head of internal audit to come in and have a look at the process that had been employed.  It was always our preference to have somebody independently look at it and that is why I wrote to the Policing Authority.</p></speech>

My concern is that, as part of their job, they have given evidence in court and people have been convicted on the basis of their evidence.  There are people in jail as a result of the evidence given by individuals who inflated figures relating to breath testing.  To bring this to its logical conclusion, if they were prepared to input figures on paper or into a computer that were incorrect, they could have given evidence in court that is incorrect and, potentially, people have been convicted of crimes and are serving sentences on the word of these members, which has to be questioned.  Is that a fair, logical conclusion?</p></speech>

The hypotheses is that people did not consider it.  We are talking about preventative checkpoints that had been done and then as the Assistant Commissioner outlined, a day or two days or after a shift or two shift later, somebody was asked to enter a figure on behalf of the team that did the checkpoint.  I absolutely accept it was administratively sloppy, as Deputy Farrell said.  Hypothetically, did somebody not remember the number and make up a number?  We have evidence to prove that there are reviews, checks and balance in respect of detections, arrests and prosecution under Operation Thor.  The rigour applied to that is a different type of rigour and the rigour that applies across the broader spectrum of policing is what I have tasked the assistant commissioner with in the context of the overhaul and review of traffic and roads policy that we are doing because that rigour may not have been applied in the same way as would be applied to other policing activities, particularly around criminal enforcement and investigations.</p></speech>

If somebody is prepared to falsify information at a lower level, then they are capable of falsifying information at a more senior level and for more serious offences.  This is extremely serious as well but if they are prepared and happy to be sloppy in the recording of information, it is possible that they will be sloppy in giving evidence in court.</p></speech>

We have to improve our IT system and we have to ensure the record data fields to capture that information.  If we go back ten years to the start of this process and I was designing an IT system, with hindsight, I would have changed it to make sure checks and balances were in place and to make sure what happened could not happen.  We are here today.  We have put the checks in place and that is a lesson learned for us.</p></speech>

She drew an analogy about turning a rock over and finding stuff under it.  In making that statement on Monday, she must know something else is coming down the line.  She is aware of the Templemore scenario, which she got into the public domain quickly enough, but I would like to give her the opportunity now to give us a heads up regarding other issues of serious concern that she has identified or that she suspects are there.</p></speech>

When we started looking at how victims were being treated, we looked at areas of good practice.  We were able to pick them out and implement them nationally but putting a standard operating procedure in that supports that practice to make sure we have consistency nationally.  We looked at our protective services bureau, for example, and we will be able to roll those out in the next few weeks.</p> <p>  I do not know what is coming down the tracks but we have systems, and we are putting structures in place, that make sure we identify issues, deal with them and put them right.  If we identify them, we will do what we did in this case and make everybody aware of it, including the Department, the Policing Authority, the audit committee, this committee and the public.  A positive thing always comes out of a negative.  One of the positive things that has come out of this discovery relates to young members around the country whom the Senator mentioned.  In January this year, we launched a code of ethics with the Policing Authority and it is important that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understands and realises that ethics is about doing the right thing when no one is watching.  If I am the garda who has to enter the figures, I have to understand their importance to traffic enforcement and to the reputation and credibility not just of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but, most important, to the trust and confidence every member of the public has in the force.  Since I became Commissioner, I have said trust and confidence is built one encounter at a time no matter who you are in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is an opportunity for us to drive that home to every member.  We spoke to our chief superintendents yesterday who said that since last Thursday, we have been inundated by individual garda&iacute; coming forward and saying, "We realise the importance of this".   There is a huge lesson in this for everybody.</p> <p>  There is no question we will deal with how this happened and that is what Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan is doing but this helps us hugely in shifting the culture.</p></speech>

We were asked about the gravity with which we take this audit.  Mr. Michael O'Sullivan was only recently appointed assistant commissioner by the Policing Authority.  Such is the gravity that I take this situation with, I have not assigned him any responsibility other than sole responsibility for dealing with this matter.  He has given a commitment that he will provide a report within three months.  He will provide a report within one month to the authority.  For the information of the committee, there was an independent review or examination announced by Government.  We will very much welcome that.  As part of the work that Mr. O'Sullivan will do, he and his team will be there to support whatever that investigation is.</p></speech>

Has the witness received any correspondence lately of an anonymous nature or otherwise outlining other bad practices within the force not necessarily similar to what we are dealing with today?  Has the witness received any correspondence in the last six months outlining bad practices that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now investigating?</p></speech>

We will have to check and see if there is anything specific.  I can certainly come back on that.  Anything we do receive, we deal with.  It can come in at different layers of the organisation as well.</p></speech>

It does not give me any pleasure to say this, but at this stage the dogs in the street do not have confidence in the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not know how it is going to repair that.  At what point would the witness consider her position and those of her senior management team to become untenable in terms of the future of the force?</p></speech>

We are quite prepared to go out there and have courage, because it does take courage and it is not easy.  The push-back we get is immense, both internally and externally.  It takes courage, determination and drive, particularly at times of crisis.  Deputy Wallace was asking earlier about the period since 2014.  The fact is that since 2014 we have been dealing with a lot of historic reports and issues that only came to the fore at that point.  We are not afraid and we have the courage to deal with those.  We have the determination.  The Senator asks a very important question about public confidence.  What is needed is strong and visible leadership, internally and externally.  That is why we make ourselves available both internally and externally.  We are not just the policing service, we are the security service as well.  At a time when we are dealing with a threat from organised crime, a threat from the volume of crime throughout the country and a threat from international terrorism, we have to be there to show strong, visible leadership and be in a prepared state to be able to respond, which we have done to the organised crime threat and which we will continue to do.</p></speech>

Yesterday afternoon, we met all of the assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and civilian support staff from all around the country.  There was a very clear determination from everybody in that room that whatever action needs to be taken throughout the country will be taken to rebuild whatever damage is done to the trust and confidence and to which the Senator quite rightly referred.  The errors of today, which the Commissioner and members of the committee have described in many different words, will become strengths as we move on.  The strength of the organisation is built on what has happened in the past.  There is a very clear and palpable determination from the people to reach out to every member in every corner of the country to address the very issue the Senator asked about.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that the witnesses themselves are not so easily in a position to vacate their seats.  Perhaps after the next couple of speakers, if the witnesses would like, we could take a ten minute break to allow use of the facilities.  We are extending the sitting with the witnesses' co-operation, if that is in order, to allow each member an individual contribution of five minutes, which includes not just their questions but also the response to those questions.  I need the members' total co-operation on that.  We will go into private session immediately following that.  That is the order in which I intend to conduct the remainder of the meeting.  At this point, I call Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  After the next contribution, a break for ten minutes might be appropriate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I thank the Commissioner and her team for attending.  A number of colleagues have tried to tease out with limited success through no fault of their own the mechanics and timelines around the disastrous controversies that the Commissioner has outlined.  I want to home in primarily but not exclusively on the rather short statement the Commissioner made to the committee this morning.  While I concede that I do not have the legal experience or prowess of some of my colleagues, I did note the Commissioner's very careful use of language in her opening lines.  Even at this stage, I wonder why this disastrous controversy is regarded as either "grave mistakes" or "wrongdoing", especially as she later went on to concede in her oral contribution that we may be dealing with a situation in which garda&iacute; knowingly submitted false information.  The other scenario she offered up was that they did this somehow in error or through ignorance.  I was always told and directed that ignorance of the law was no defence.  Either way, I am curious to know why this is not a much more serious issue than simply a mistake or a wrongdoing.</p> <p>  In terms of the witness's own remarks and her contributions to the press over the last couple of days, I wonder whether she specifically informed the Minister for Justice and Equality before she or her organisation spoke to the press.  When did she make the Minister aware of the scale of this controversy and of the falsified breath tests?  What was the level of information that she offered to the Minister in that regard?</p> <p>  I understand we are under time pressure, but I wish to make a point that deeply troubles me and should cause this committee and the public great concern.  It relates to the second last line of the witness's opening remarks today, in which she said, "My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data."  I think the Commissioner does us and the public a terrible disservice by raising a red flag like that without expanding upon it.  She raised that red flag and then told us she has no specific evidence.  Has she limited evidence?  Has she an idea?  Has she had any kind of confidential disclosure?  For example, has she had any detail around whether this data relates to the recovery of drugs, weapons and firearms, domestic violence statistics as referred to earlier today, or the arrest and registration of sex offenders?  Where exactly are her concerns on this?  The witness has spoken about leadership and I agree with her.  At times of crisis in particular, there needs to be very strong leadership indicated.  I do not think that coming in here and raising that red flag is showing leadership.</p><p>I think it is bordering on showing contempt for this committee and indeed the public.  I would hate to think it was, worse again, in some way a red flag to try to distract from the controversies referred to today.</p><p> The Commissioner said if you overturn a stone you find something.  I noted that Senator Conway referred to it and I was glad that other members were aware of what she said.  One does not always find something when a stone is overturned.  Sometimes one finds only grass or sand or the ground.  It is a really insightful comment from the Commissioner about the scale of the cultural problems within her organisation.  That is why public confidence is at rock bottom.</p></speech>

We came in here to try to be open, frank and honest.  I would not like anyone to believe we are being contemptuous in any way whatsoever, quite the opposite.</p> <p>  As the Senator says, sometimes when one turns over a stone one finds nothing and that is very good but sometimes one finds a little pearl.  We have found good practice.  The Deputy Commissioner has outlined precisely what he is doing in respect of the reviews that are ongoing on the data quality committee.  I was not raising a red flag but saying, not in a contemptuous way at all, that the reality is that as we go through the type of really deep organisational, administrative overhaul we are going through we might find something.  Have I anything at the moment?  No I do not.  We will continue and when we do find something we will identify, address it and make it known to the people who need to know, such as the Policing Authority, the Department, this committee and the public.  That is what we will continue to do because that is important to us. </p> <p>  We can go through the detail of the sequencing of the correspondence with the Department again.  The Deputy Commissioner can go through the dates and what we did and told, and the Assistant Commissioner can give the dates of when we discovered this precisely.  We are happy to go through that with the committee. </p></speech>

She is accountable to the Minister.  Would she not have thought it was far more appropriate to engage the Minister and indeed the D&aacute;il, and even this committee, dare I say it, before this was released into the public domain?  What steps did she take over the past couple of days and weeks in respect of this controversy and her engagement with the Minister?</p></speech>

The Assistant Commissioner Mr. Finn, the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Twomey, and I had a meeting with the Minister in her Department on the Monday morning.  At that stage we had the detail that was outlined and we shared that with the Minister and the Department.</p></speech>

They relate to the broad brush of our data and our data retention.  It identified specifically crime classification, reclassification, attention and complaints.  It recommended that there were too many people involved in that entire process up along the chain and there was no strict rigidity in how we dealt with it.</p> <p>  On Monday, in our information centre in Castlebar, we made the decision that it will become the centre of excellence for the country.  All decisions on classification, reclassification and detection will be made in that centre.  In the work over the past year we have been considering the processes and procedures.  We had to get two things into place, one was additional staff and one was additional information technology, IT, facilities to do that.  The staff have now been provided.  With effect from next Monday all stations in the northern region of the country will enter into this process.  In essence what will happen now is that a crime will be classified by Castlebar, by the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  The quality assurance will be provided by the same centre.  Any decision about reclassification will be made by those particular people.  They will assure the quality of all the data that comes in.  That will cascade around the country and will take control of it.  That is a clear recommendation from the Garda Inspectorate.  It goes a step further in that it takes out an individual layer the inspectorate suggested should be there.  On reviewing it we took that out.  </p> <p>  We will review the crime classification, the reclassification and the detections, for example, a new domestic violence policy is coming out.  The Commissioner spoke about the protective service bureau that has been established in the centre.  It quality reviews incidents daily.  The divisional protective service units will be in place next month, May, in three divisions around the country and that will continue to roll out.  The domestic violence policy will ensure that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trained in doing a risk assessment in advance of the incident; doing a risk assessment while at the incident and in the interaction that will take place with the various non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that work in this area.  There is a great deal of work coming through in that specific area.  Our most vulnerable victims will have access to fully trained, fully resourced investigators, interviewers and people who can deal with these dreadful issues that they encounter.  That will start from next month.  That is the process and that is the work this committee has done.  It is an ongoing process.  It takes time from a resourcing perspective and a research perspective.  That work will continue.  It starts on Monday and we expect that it will be completed by the end of the year.</p> <p>  The committee is aware from previous presentations that we are unable to properly record our call data.  There is an interim IT fix coming in.  It has started and we expect it to be everywhere throughout the country by the end of June, and by the end of the year there will be a form of integration with police using leading systems effectively, PULSE.  We are dealing with very old technology and we are trying to bring that up to modern standards.  We are putting a fix into something that is 25 years old.  That is where we are coming from.  We have repeated on several occasions that where there are issues of wrongdoing or matters of concern that we need to tell people we will do that.  That is what we are doing in this instance.  It is unfortunate that we do not have all the answers everybody requires because we took the unprecedented step of putting the information into the public domain when we felt it was the right thing to do from a cultural perspective.</p></speech>

The Commissioner might elaborate on the protocol in terms of what is currently happening, not just in terms of investigation but where problems, wrongdoing and negligence has been identified, the next steps that will be taken.  Also, to go back to Deputy Clare Daly's point, will the Commissioner accept that she, too, has a responsibility and that ultimately, as Commissioner, the buck will stop with her?  Given the scale of this problem, there is a great degree of lack of public confidence in her and in her organisation, as well as among the membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does she concede and accept that she is as liable to be held responsible for her actions?</p></speech>

Would Senator Frances Black and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee mind if, following that, we then had the toilet break for ten minutes following which we will resume?  By way of clarification for members, it was always my intention that we would break for ten minutes, which will bring us up to about 12 noon.  When we resume, Senator Black and Senator Clifford-Lee will be the first speakers.  I will then offer members the opportunity, and it is not obligatory that they take it - in fact, it would be great if some did not - to have a further five-minute bite, so to speak.  I will call members in exactly the order in which they contributed in the first sequence as they indicated, and as I have personally noted them.  That is how we will do our business.  Members should remember that the five minutes will have to be strictly applied.  It will be for the question and also the reply, following which we will thank our visitors and go into private session.</p></speech>

Assistant Commissioner Finn has clarified for the committee that the 14,700 cases brought before the court and from which convictions arose were issues where summons were issued without them being given an opportunity to pay a fixed charge notice.  That is what he said in his press release on 27 March.  My question is on the review, which identified 1,130 cases where summons had been issued for offences where the fixed charge notice had already been paid.  This is an additional number of persons who have been convicted before our courts; I presume some of them were convicted.</p></speech>

We are trying to find out the detail of each case.  There will need to be liaison with other agencies and, because of the numbers involved, I do not want to complicate the matter.

The Garda Information Services Centre stopped this procedure but outside the centre and across the system, such as in individual districts, it was still possible for people to issue summonses by generating them on the computer.

The Garda  had become aware of this on 6 February.  Why did it take until 16 May to issue an instruction that all summonses would be withdrawn?  Why did the Garda leave it that long?  The reason I ask these questions is that I want to try to understand the disjointed nature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is management which has responsibility for supervising and ensuring all pieces of information.  These are citizens who were being prosecuted falsely.  As such, why did it take the Garda three months to issue an instruction that summonses should be withdrawn?  It seems that there was a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to the fact that the Garda knew three months earlier that it was prosecuting people unlawfully.</p></speech>

Summonses are created centrally in the GISC, but they are also created at local level because it is not an automated system.  It was only in April 2016 that a specific case came before a court.  At that stage, it was evident that we had a bigger problem than we had thought originally - the NCT as a specific, sole issue.  It was evaluated and examined and only at that stage was there was an awareness that it could apply to other offences where it had changed from a summons to an FCN over the course from 2006 on.  There was a fix and an instruction was issued to withdraw summonses.</p></speech>

A garda rang the GISC call centre to ask if it was still issuing summonses and said it should not be doing so because it was now covered by an FCN.  It had come in on 1 January 2014 and we began an investigation to look at the NCT because we thought that was where the problem was.

She said the letter contained information that the Director of Public Prosecutions had indicated that a review should be extended to include cases before 2014.  This letter was issued to the Minister in 2017, but the Garda had become aware that this was a wider issue a full year before that.  Within ten days of issuing the Minister the letter setting out the 1,781 figure, the Garda provided figures of 14,700 at a press conference.  There is still a serious question over the attitude within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the false prosecution of citizens of the State and the efforts it has made to identify each and every individual in the first place.

I presume it is a criminal offence for any garda to falsify the data of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps the Commissioner might confirm that it is.

She has referred to the statutory role of holding the Commissioner to account.  As somebody who has the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at heart, she will know more than most that there comes a time when garda&iacute; rely on the confidence of the public, which is sacrosanct.  There must be the confidence of the public for rank and file garda&iacute; and also for senior management.  It is clear that support is ebbing and that, in terms of management and her own position, it is gone.  The majority of Members of the D&aacute;il do not support or cannot express confidence in her.  Does she believe there is a responsibility at a certain point for senior management, regardless of the legal provisions to hold the Commissioner to account, to do something in the best interests of the force to restore confidence?</p></speech>

Why has all of this happened?  What was the thinking behind it?  It is awful that the number of breathalyser tests was overstated by 1 million.  Has this been used as a justification for Garda overtime?  I know we spoke about bonuses earlier.  Were garda&iacute; getting overtime for this and, if so, can we put a value on it?  What was their thinking in doing so many breath tests?  That is really the only question I have.  I could ask many other questions, but I am conscious of our time constraints.  My question relates to an aspect of this matter that jumps out for me.</p></speech>

The reality of the culture, in which there are several sub-cultures, is that traditionally we have always been focused on waiting for a crime to happen and then investigating it.  We do a pretty good job of that.  We are good at crisis management and operational decisions.  We have changed, with this shift in culture, to ensure a focus on prevention.  This is in everything from road traffic all the way through to the likes of the Garda national protective services bureau and the domestic violence assessment tool that we spoke about.</p> <p>  We are trying to shift to that culture.  We are trying to make it valued in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that our job, in the first place, is to prevent crime from happening.  When it does happen we are there, we investigate the crime professionally and see it all the way through the courts system.</p></speech>

It is very difficult for us to believe any of the information the witnesses have given us.  They have said that in their attempt to clear up incorrect data, they found out that there were one million breath tests carried out, despite the fact that they had previously said two million had been carried out.  In the same breath they expect us to believe, and have stated repeatedly, that there were 400,000 checkpoints carried out during that time.</p> <p>  I put the question to the assistant commissioner, how in God's name could that be possible?  That would mean, in effect, that every checkpoint tested approximately two and half people, when the witnesses know that the guideline is that a minimum of five should be carried out to make it worthwhile even to set up the checkpoint in the first place.  Is it not more credible that, instead of having carried out 400,000 checkpoints, in actual fact it was probably the case that there were only 200,000 checkpoints carried out?</p><p>If that is the case, as the figures seem to indicate, is it not the case that our entire road safety policy and everything that everybody who uses the roads believes the Garda is doing has been turned on its head?</p></speech>

That will actually help Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan in his job because that mining, if one likes, has been done.  The data are available - not completed yet but nearing completion.  That will assist the assistant commissioner in his investigation and the speed of his investigation.

If the Commissioner cannot answer this question today I ask her to reply to the committee secretariat.

Were there any linkages with traffic data?</p> <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn said that the assistant commissioners set the targets themselves.  Does he want to qualify those remarks?  Did the assistant commissioners set their own targets to get bonuses from the State in that period or what was the system of bonus allocation at that time?</p></speech>

This sergeant prepared a report for his district officer before retiring last year in which he pointed out that the official figures for checkpoints completed could be up to twice the number actually performed.  He stated that the reply he got dismissed his concerns and criticised him.  Were the targets for checkpoints between 2011 and 2016 unrealistic, given the Garda resources on the ground?  Who set the targets for checkpoints?  Were there any penalties for not meeting the targets?  Were any garda&iacute; promoted on the basis of fraudulently claiming to meet these targets?</p><p>The Commissioner spoke earlier about the lack of resources, which may have played a role in underachieving in certain areas.  She is the boss.  Given that she has only recently put together an expensive team of individuals of her choosing to deal with the Charleton inquiry, she clearly has the wherewithal to determine where resources are used.  If I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality how resources were allocated, she would tell me it was an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does the Commissioner think she could use the resources at her disposal more effectively?</p></speech>

In the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is personnel.  The Commissioner is no doubt aware, as are all Members of both Houses, that information provided to the Garda at a local level is extremely important in terms of the public perception or interpretation of the performance of the Garda in terms of detection rates and so on.  We have had issues with the statistics, as the Commissioner is aware.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is standing over the statistics and publishing them.  I am happy that more recent reports indicate at the bottom that they are produced by the CSO.  However, the CSO assesses and produces information for joint policing committees, JPCs, and for this House based on core information provided to it by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the Commissioner's opening statement, she has called into question whether statistics from PULSE and elsewhere are valid.  The figures being produced on behalf of the Garda by the CSO are, therefore, potentially flawed.  We earlier talked about the flaws in the cultural approach of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which have led to this.  Can we believe the figures that are being produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

Gurchand Singh, the head of the Garda analysis service, works very closely with the CSO in this regard.  He sits on a working group with the CSO.</p> <p>  We are extremely anxious.  As the Deputy rightly said, the Garda is engaged in evidence-based and intelligence-led policing so the statistics it produces need to be accurate.  This matter is very important.  I have tasked the deputy commissioner in charge of operations with ensuring that we review all data we have produced.   I hope the involvement of the CSO gives some confidence to the public.  However, we do not take that for granted.  We must ensure that the reliability and validity of our data is flawless.</p></speech>

During my 13 years in politics, there have always been questions about the figures produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda is the source of the data.  If there is an issue with the production of the information, it makes no difference how trustworthy the CSO is, it will not be able to interpret the data accurately.  I accept the Commissioner's point and I understand the basis upon which she makes it.  I am sure that Deputy Commissioner Twomey is doing his best.  However, the bottom line is, if the information is tainted, how can we trust it?</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate's report was to employ a data quality manger.  That step alone will not fix the issues.  We do need new skill sets in the Garda to help us address these issues.  We are currently pursuing that with the Policing Authority and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Deputies are being called to the D&aacute;il for an imminent vote.</p> <p>  As I have been saying for a number of years, the amount of controlled drugs that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is holding is bizarre.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has asked the Commissioner for a report on this.  The most recent figures I have are for the period 2010 to 2014.  They show that of the &euro;529 million worth of controlled substances held by the Garda, only &euro;35 million worth has been destroyed.  That does not take account of the previous amount of drugs.  Can the Commissioner reassure me that the information that has been provided to me is accurate and that in the last five years the Garda does hold over &euro;500 million worth of controlled substances?</p></speech>

I do not accept the Commissioner's contention that it is highly unlikely and most improbable that figures were not redacted when they were sent to senior management.  It would be worthwhile to reflect on that.  It is possible that this is being orchestrated by a smaller group rather than being systematic.</p> <p>  Does the Commissioner have any concern that statistics for complaints made by members of the public against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been altered or changed in any way to make the force look better and that there are fewer complaints recorded than have actually been lodged?</p> <p>  When did the Commissioner engage with the DPP on the fixed charge notices?</p> <p>  I hope the Commissioner can regain public confidence.

I am always very keen to parse that.  The Commissioner referred to "mistakes and wrongdoings".  To my mind, "wrongdoings" constitute immoral or illegal acts.  There is no other way of interpreting the word.  It might sound less dramatic than words like "immoral" and "illegal", but there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that we are certainly talking about wrongdoings that equal immoral or illegal acts.  Without question, there is a public sense - not just a political sense - that all this must have consequences.  Some members of the committee have reflected the fear in this regard.  The Commissioner said earlier that "we all take responsibility".  She is well aware of the adage that when we all take responsibility, nobody takes responsibility.  Nobody is responsible.  I am not putting the Commissioner in a difficult position when I say, as Chairman of this committee and as an elected representative of my constituency and my community over many years, that I believe there is a critically important need to address this matter in a substantive and forensic manner.  There must be a clear understanding that wrongdoing is an immoral or illegal act and must have consequences.</p><p> I ask the Commissioner to respond as she deems appropriate to a final comment.  In the closing part of her opening statement, she summed up what has taken place by saying "at worst, this was deception".  Again, this is a question of language.  I do not know whether the word "deception" is a sufficiently strong portrayal of what has taken place here.  Our understanding of the word "deception" is that it means the act of deceiving.  It involves a person having someone else believe something that he or she patently knows to be false, or setting out quite purposely to have somebody else believe something he or she knows to be false.  It is a very serious matter.  This is important because words like "wrongdoings" and "deception" do not quite hit the pitch in what we are discussing here.  Some key questions arise in this context.  Who were those responsible seeking to deceive?  That question has not been asked.  Were they seeking to deceive An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, senior Garda management or the public?  The Commissioner's very interesting hypothesis may very well be the case, but it is important that in the production of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report, there is clarity as to the purpose, intent or motivation, or all three, of those involved.  Motivation is an area of clear interest.  What was behind their action?  What was their purpose?  Was there a return or reward for acting as they did?  It is important for the answers to these questions to be established properly and placed in the public arena.  I hope this exercise will be as comprehensive as the Commissioner has assured the committee this morning it will be.  I invite her to respond to the issues I have highlighted and to make any other closing remarks she would like to make.</p></speech>

We will not be able to identify anything other than that until Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan and those involved in the external investigation carry out their work.  We had a deep and robust discussions on these matters when we were crafting the statement.  As I said, what we have at the moment is "at worst....deception".  We concur with the full description of deception as set out by the Chairman just now.  That, at worst, is what we have at the moment.  At best, what we have at the moment is incompetence.  That will remain the position until Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan carries out his work and the external investigation concludes.  Beyond that, we do not know.  I will conclude by giving the committee an assurance, as I did at the end of my opening statement, that we will identify those who are responsible and accountable for this and we will hold them to account.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the committee for their attendance.  There has been a full attendance, which is a surprise.  I would like to see that every day.  I think the detailed and incisive exchange we have had has been very useful.  I offer a sincere "go raibh maith agat" to everyone who has contributed.  Before I adjourn the meeting, I would like to notify members that it had been planned to continue this meeting in private session, but that is no longer the intention.  I will notify members through the secretariat of the plan to reconvene the joint committee next Tuesday, 4 April, to address the issues that have been highlighted here today.  At that meeting, members will have an opportunity to express their views, consider any collective action we may wish to take as a committee and decide whether we wish to enter into any correspondence.  Committee Room 3 is available on Tuesday between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.  We will endeavour to establish the appropriate time.  We will notify members to that effect before the day is out.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
