Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  The committee needs to dispose of Vote 20 and Chapter 26 which were the subject of last week's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since the meeting of Thursday, 16 May.  Item No. 3A is correspondence received from Accounting Officers.  Item No 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 15 May 2013, from Mr. Aidan Dunning, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, providing additional information requested at our meeting on 18 April.  The correspondence is to be noted and published. </p><p>  Item No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 22 May 2013, from Ms Josephine Feehily, chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, providing additional information requested at our meeting on 9 May 2013.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  It relates to the rate of corporation tax, an issue members may want to consider.  </p><p>  Item 3B is individual correspondence.  Item No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 13 May 2013, from Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, on the cost of VEC legal services and procurement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p> <p>This correspondence raises a number of issues about the procurement without competitive tender of legal services by VECs and the broad issue can be raised today with the National Procurement Service.  </p><p> No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 13 May 2013 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, re information previously requested regarding apprenticeship training provision in the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown.  That is to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Brady, the original complainant. </p><p> No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 16 May 2013 from Ms Clare McGrath, chairperson of the Office of Public Works.  It provided information previously requested regarding the cost of the provision of a suite of offices for a Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2007.

I will only have an opportunity to look at them now for the first time.  I am trying to recall what we agreed we would do with them when we requested it.  Will there be a meeting to discuss it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B00250"><p>No, we agreed at a previous meeting that we would ask for the information.  It relates to an expenditure in 2007 and 2008.  It was dealt with by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee at that stage.  Due to the fact that the matter was dealt with, I suggested we ask for the appropriate papers on the cost.  Those papers have now been forwarded to us by the two Departments and it is up to members to raise the issue if they wish with the OPW.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B00300"><p>We now have all the appropriate papers.  They will be published.</p></speech>

Is this the meeting at which the matter will be discussed?</p></speech>

I looked at the report of the recent meeting.  The Chairman correctly said that once we garnered all information members could make a decision about what they wanted to do with it, including the possibility of calling in the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Can we proceed with the meeting today on all issues relating to the OPW, including this correspondence, and, arising from that, see if we need the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to answer any additional questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B00800"><p>That is agreed.  </p><p>  No. 3B.6 is correspondence dated 22 May 2013 from Professor Niamh Brennan, former chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, re the examination of special report No. 77 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the DDDA.  That is to be noted and published.  Professor Brennan has suggested her evidence should be taken after the committee takes evidence from those centrally involved in the acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle site.  This is an acceptable way to conduct our examination and I suggest we agree to her request.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B00900"><p>On that point, have we received responses from the other witnesses we contacted in regard to this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01000"><p>Mr. Bradshaw has agreed to attend the meeting.  We will agree that date with him.  He has asked that we share our papers with him, and I think we should agree to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01100"><p>Absolutely.</p></speech>

Likewise, Professor Brennan has agreed to a meeting.  It is just a matter of sequencing meetings and ensuring everyone is prepared.  We will set the date in accordance with our work programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01400"><p>On the letter, I am interested in a comment made by Professor Brennan.  We should acknowledge she has said she will appear before the committee, which is to be welcomed.  She said it may well also be that the committee may well wish to consider whether it wishes to hear from other persons holding executive or board positions in addition to Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Moloney on those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01500"><p>We have invited others to attend.  Mr. Bradshaw was the only person to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01600"><p>Okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01700"><p>The Deputy may remember that at a previous meeting he named the individuals he would like to come before us.  We then wrote to them and Mr. Bradshaw was the only one who responded.  We are awaiting a response from the others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01800"><p>I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B01900"><p>I am reminded that in our last discussion on this matter we named some individuals who we would like to come before the committee.  Perhaps we should write to the full board.  That means no one would be singled out and the board itself would be asked to come before us.  That may change people's views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B02000"><p>I should make the point, given that I was one of those who made the request, that the only reason I named the individuals concerned was because they arose in the course of our questioning in previous committee meetings.  It is a fair point to state that we should invite in all of those who had the ability to be involved.  We are trying to be fair to all involved so that everybody has the opportunity to contribute to their understanding of events.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300003#B02100"><p>If we can formally agree that now, the clerk can write to those who have not been written to, and maybe inform those who have been written to that all of the board is being invited to come before the committee.  That is probably the best way of dealing with the matter.  Is it agreed that the clerk do that?  Agreed.  </p><p>  Is No. 3B.6 in regard to how we sequence the meetings relevant to Professor Brennan's request agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  No. 3B.7 is correspondence dated 22 May 2013 from Ms Clare McGrath, chairperson of the OPW, about information previously requested regarding cost of the provision of a suite of offices for a Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in 2007.  That is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  We have documents relating to today's committee meeting.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence dated 22 May 2013 from Ms Clare McGrath, chairperson of the OPW, briefing papers and matters to be considered at the meeting on 23 May 2013.  That is to be noted and published. </p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received on 22 May 2013 from Miss Clare McGrath, chairperson of the OPW, opening statement.  That is to be noted and published. </p><p>  The next item is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting of 16 May.  Number 4.1 is the National Library of Ireland annual report 2011, clean audit opinion. </p><p>  No. 5 is our work programme. It is now on the screen.  It was agreed to schedule the Financial Regulator on 13 June, as discussed last week.  This will mean that we will reschedule the Department of Social Protection to 11 July. </p><p>  We will now meet Mr. Bradshaw, former chairperson of the DDDA on Wednesday, 26 June at 3 p.m.  On that issue, the committee received correspondence from the DDDA yesterday evening and this will be circulated today.  This correspondence will also be circulated to Mr. Bradshaw in connection with his forthcoming appearance, given his request which was agreed last week.  That refers to our papers and we will make them available to Mr. Bradshaw.  I ask members to note the date is Wednesday at 3 p.m.  Will we meet on Thursday of that week?</p></speech>

The meeting was already scheduled but Mr. Bradshaw was not able to come in on that date.</p></speech>

We will deal with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>  Do members have any other business in regard to No. 6?  We have to agree our agenda for Thursday, 6 June 2013 at 10 a.m.  We will meet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The agenda for the meeting will consist of the 2011 appropriation accounts and annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Vote 7 - superannuation retired allowances, Vote 42 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Chapter 6 - financial commitments under public private partnerships, Chapter 12 - vote accounting and Chapter 13 - procurement without a competitive process.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  We will now ask the witnesses to attend.</p></speech>

The OPW manages a large property portfolio, consisting of State-owned property with a book value of around &euro;3 billion, and substantial leased property.  The OPW&rsquo;s appropriation account records spending of around &euro;400 million in 2011, divided between three programmes: estate portfolio management, flood risk management and the national procurement service.  The major expenditure from the Vote in 2011 included rent and rates on leased properties amounting to &euro;118 million; purchases of sites and building, new works, alterations and additions at a cost of &euro;56 million; payment of &euro;54 million in respect of the National Convention Centre public private partnership project; flood risk management and drainage maintenance at a cost of &euro;51 million; property maintenance works and supplies costing &euro;36 million; spending of &euro;37 million on upkeep and visitor services at heritage properties.  In addition to its spending on Vote 10, the OPW manages works reimbursed from other Votes.  The expenditure in 2011 in that regard is estimated at &euro;68 million, and is mainly property related.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has estimated that the procurement of goods and services by public bodies amounted to &euro;8.6 billion in 2011, with a further &euro;4.5 billion spent on capital works.  A procurement capacity review commissioned by the Department and completed in August 2012 highlighted that significant savings would be possible through the implementation of changes in public procurement practices.  One of the functions of the OPW&rsquo;s national procurement service, which was set up in 2009, is to establish national framework agreements which aim to help public sector bodies to obtain better value for money when they are procuring commonly used goods and services.  A framework is an agreement with one or more suppliers setting out the terms that will govern contracts awarded to those suppliers during the term of the agreement.  The aim is to reduce tendering costs for suppliers and allow public bodies to purchase without the need for multiple tendering procedures.</p><p>  Chapter 14 reviews the extent to which centrally-agreed procurement framework agreements have been established in the public sector.  At the end of 2011, there were 43 such agreements in place.  Annual expenditure by public bodies under those frameworks was estimated by the national procurement service at &euro;180 million.  Energy purchases, in the form of electricity, natural gas and fuel for vehicles, account for 87% of that spend.  In the past, public bodies could avail of framework arrangements but were not obliged to do so.  Since September 2012, public bodies are required to use the central framework agreements for specified goods and services, or to have value-for-money justifications for failing to do so.</p><p>  The report also examines the methodologies used by the OPW to calculate the savings achieved from procurement initiatives, including use of frameworks.  The national procurement service reported estimated savings of &euro;46.5 million in 2011 and projected that 2012 savings would be &euro;78 million.  Various approaches were taken to calculating those savings.  The audit examined the methodologies used in four areas, and concluded that the savings estimates were not reliable.  For example, estimated savings in 2011 on the cost of energy procurement included potential cost reductions of &euro;4.2 million related to tariff changes and potential reduction of &euro;8 million if public bodies paid energy prices notionally achievable by large private sector purchasers.  However, insufficient evidence was available to the audit team about the extent to which the potential savings had been achieved.  All contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more must be advertised on e-Tenders.  Estimated savings of almost &euro;12 million on newspaper advertising spend were based on the assumption that there would be a specific level of newspaper advertising in the absence of e-Tenders.  While that assumption may have been realistic for high value contracts, the assumed level of advertising was unlikely to be incurred for many low value contracts.  Estimated savings of &euro;7.3 million in the cost of administering motor fuel purchases worth &euro;11 million using purchase cards were found to have been based on a 1998 UK costing model which the UK National Audit Office subsequently concluded does not reflect current standard payment processing procedures.  This suggests that the claimed saving is significantly overstated.</p><p>  Overall, the examination found that there was a need for clearer definition and more consistent application of saving calculation methodologies.  In response, the Accounting Officer stated that a more robust system of performance measurement is being put in place and that a working group had been established to develop a common approach to the measurement and reporting of procurement savings.  The Accounting Officer will update the committee on the work of that group and on developments in savings estimation methodologies.  </p><p>  Chapter 14 also outlines the circumstances surrounding the extension by the national procurement service of a contract with an energy procurement advisor.  Following an advertised invitation to service providers, a three-year contract for energy procurement advice was awarded in 2009 at an estimated cost of &euro;20,000 a year.  Due to very significant expansion in the scope of the work, a total of just over &euro;1 million was paid to the service provider.  Public procurement rules require that major extensions to contracts should be subject to tender but this was not done when the energy advisor&rsquo;s role was extended.  The work was re-tendered at the end of 2011 and a new contract with an estimated value of &euro;2 million plus VAT over three years, was awarded to the same service provider.  The level of expenditure incurred on that service underscores the importance of ensuring that the costs involved in undertaking procurement initiatives are factored in to any process of estimation of procurement savings achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013052300005#D00100"><p>I am pleased to be here today to present the appropriation account for the Office of Public Works for 2011 and to answer any questions members may have.</p><p>  The first item on today's agenda is chapter 14 of the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Measuring Procurement Performance.  The National Procurement Service, NPS, which was established within the Office of Public Works in March 2009, is tasked with centralising public sector procurement arrangements for common goods and services, which include office equipment, stationery and office supplies, electricity, fuel, printing, uniforms and transport.  By identifying key markets and analysing procurement trends, the service continues to develop a more integrated approach to procurement across the public sector, utilising procurement tools such as aggregation and framework agreements.  The service also facilitates collaboration with clients in markets where savings can be achieved through the aggregation of requirements.  These strategic approaches have achieved and will continue to achieve real savings and value for money.</p><p>  During the course of 2011, expenditure under the NPS contracts amounted to an overall value of approximately &euro;180 million.  These contracts covered areas of procurement as diverse as stationery, energy, ICT consumables and paper.  While the primary concern of the NPS on its establishment was to save money on goods and services for the State, a constant challenge is how best to calculate any savings or efficiencies that arise as a result of this procurement effort.  This becomes an even greater challenge when one considers that the NPS is not actually purchasing on its own behalf.  Rather, it is putting in place arrangements whereby public bodies throughout the system can procure goods and services from their own funds in a legally compliant and economical manner.  The actual savings derived are reflected within those individual Votes.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report calls attention to the many different approaches taken to the calculation of these savings or efficiencies.  The reality is that the nature of the commodity or the particular market will usually dictate the approach taken to calculating the level of efficiency arising.  For example, the procurement of energy in a rising market requires a different approach to calculating savings and efficiencies to the procurement of paper in a falling market.  The situation is compounded by the general lack of easily accessible data on purchasing trends across the whole of the public service.  Since the 2011 audit, however, the NPS, in association with its clients across the public service, has done considerable work to bring a level of reliability and consistency to these methodologies.  That effort is ongoing.</p><p>  A particularly active part of the business programme in 2011 involved the procurement of some &euro;146 million worth of energy contracts.  This area of procurement required the retention of expert external services to assist the NPS in its task.  In 2011 the rapid expansion in demand for the services of the NPS in the procurement of energy resulted in an escalation in the associated cost of the external service providers of energy consultancy.  When this development was identified, the service made arrangements to have the contract re-tendered through an EU competitive process.  Given the particularly complex nature of this area of procurement, it is anticipated that the NPS will continue to require services of this nature for the foreseeable future.</p><p>  The Government agreed in September 2012 to reform the central procurement function under a new Office of Government Procurement at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, as part of that process, appointed a Chief Procurement Officer, Mr. Paul Quinn.  A further Government decision of April 2013 agreed the outline plan for the development of a significantly expanded central procurement function.</p><p>  I will now take the opportunity to refer to other important aspects of the work that was funded through the 2011 Appropriation Account and provide members with an update on the current position in several areas.  Following on from the pilot Estimates introduced in the Revised Estimates for 2011, the Appropriation Account is structured under three main programmes of OPW activity, namely, the National Procurement Service, flood risk management and estate portfolio management.</p><p>  The OPW is the lead agency for the management of flood risk in Ireland.  Although there has been an overall drop in capital funding for the office since 2008, the committee can be assured of the Government's commitment to this critical area of investment, as clearly demonstrated by the maintenance of capital funding for flood relief and the catchment flood risk management plans in the OPW Vote.  In 2011, the accounting period being examined today, works under this programme included the completion of first-phase major flood relief schemes in Waterford, Carlow and Clonmel west.  Other schemes that progressed included works at Clonmel north and east, Mallow south and west, and Claregalway.  In order to facilitate the comprehensive delivery of relief schemes throughout the country, &euro;5.2 million was also provided to local authorities under the minor floods and coastal protection programmes.  We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure there is sufficient capacity to undertake flood mitigation measures in their administrative areas as promptly as possible.  Since 2009, more than 400 schemes have been approved for funding through the Vote of the Office of Public Works to local authorities.</p><p>  The estate portfolio management programme involves the management, maintenance and development of the State's property portfolio, including the care, protection and presentation of national monuments and historic properties.  The programme comprises a wide variety of services, including professional services such as architecture, engineering, valuation, quantity surveying and project management.  The primary constituent parts of the programme, which, in funding terms, were the largest in 2011, include: property management functions, primarily rents; heritage services, involving the care of 750 national monuments and 26 national historic properties with a combined provision of 69 visitor centres; the provision of building and maintenance works at OPW managed buildings; and the management of unitary payments relating to the Convention Centre in Dublin.  The programme also administers certain grant payments on behalf of the Government.  In 2011 grants were made to Dublin Zoo and Glasnevin Cemetery, two very important visitor attractions in the capital city.  Since 2007 considerable work has taken place at that cemetery, where the most recent ongoing development is the opening of a link between it and the neighbouring National Botanic Gardens, providing an opportunity for mutual enhancement for both national institutions.</p><p>  As part of its property management role, the Office of Public Works continues to pursue opportunities to rationalise office accommodation through the surrender and renegotiation of more expensive leases with a<i></i>view to achieving significant rental savings.  The office has made significant progress in this area, with departmental rents falling from &euro;131 million to &euro;107 million in the period from 2008 to 2012.  In 2011, the year of account, expenditure on rents amounted to &euro;118 million, a significant reduction on the &euro;128 million in rents paid on behalf of the State in 2010.  We have also released 88 million sq. m of rented accommodation recent years.  The latter is a considerable achievement, but work remains to be done.</p><p>  The office rationalisation programme is just one part of the broader reform of the State's property management function, in respect of which I am currently chairing a steering group of the State's key property holders.  This year the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has also made the OPW responsible for the funding of building maintenance on State property.  The essential maintenance will now be provided on a shared-service basis to Departments, which has necessitated a transfer of funds from other departmental Votes to the OPW.  The reformed service will produce savings both directly through the OPW prioritising the operation of planned and preventative maintenance and indirectly through the centralisation of the professional expertise in this area and the administration of maintenance for all Departments.</p><p>  In the area of energy conservation, the OPW continues to be actively involved and has been allocated further responsibility in this area by Government.  Significant savings have been achieved through the Optimising Power at Work programme in recent years - an initiative under the OPW in which all Departments participated - amounting to some 18% per annum on energy consumption in all our large buildings.  Given the success of this programme, we have been asked to roll it out to the wider public service.  The office has received an allocation of &euro;9 million to this end for the coming thee years.</p><p>  While the OPW is clearly focused on the core functions of the organisation, there are often occasions where we have to show flexibility in responding to the needs of Government.  In the heritage area, for instance, with very short notice, the office undertook a task of particular significance in 2011 in successfully hosting State visits by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, and the President of the United States.  In a similar vein, Ireland is currently hosting the EU Presidency from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2013.</p> <p>The Government, in order to ensure a cost-effective Presidency, decided that events would be centralised primarily around OPW managed properties such as Dublin Castle, Farmleigh House, Castletown House, the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and the Botanic Gardens.  In excess of 280 events will take place during the term of the Presidency and the feedback on the facilities provided to date has been very positive.</p><p> I wish to remind the committee that many of the services managed by OPW are not directly funded from its Vote but they have absorbed administrative resources presented in the 2011 account.  Although the gross 2011 outturn for the appropriation account amounted to &euro;402 million, this does not reflect the full range of activities of the office.  The OPW continues to act as an agent for and incurs expenditure in facilitating other Departments and agencies in delivering on their remits.  In 2011, these services exceeded &euro;68 million in value.  That figure is money we managed on their behalf but it does not include instances where they paid directly.  In the context of the latter point, I refer to the &euro;180 million of expenditure relating to contracts managed by the NPS.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I will be pleased to answer any questions they may wish to pose in respect of the appropriation account or any other matter.</p></speech>

In the first instance, I wish to raise a matter which is not necessarily germane to the appropriation account for 2011.  In that context, I want to focus on the correspondence received from the Office of Public Works, dated 16 May, in respect of the cost of the provision of a suite of offices for the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and current Chairman of this committee, Deputy McGuinness.  I thank Ms McGrath for her subsequent correspondence clarifying the correspondence from 16 May.  At this point the Chairman may wish to consider whether it is appropriate for him to remain <i>in situ</i> for this part of the meeting.</p></speech>

If other members also wish to address this issue, then I ask that someone from the Government side volunteer to chair this part of proceedings.  As the Vice Chairman is not present, perhaps Deputy Donohoe might agree to do so.  I will vacate the Chair while the committee is dealing with this matter and thereafter we can return to the main agenda.</p></speech>

In 2007 Bertie Ahern appointed a certain Deputy as one of three Ministers of State in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  On taking up his appointment, the Deputy in question discovered that he had nowhere to locate himself for what turned out to be a short stay in the Department.  Will Ms McGrath indicate what process is followed when a new Minister of State is appointed when there is no accommodation available within the Department to which he or she is appointed?  Would he or she have any role whatsoever in identifying adequate facilities for himself or herself and his or her staff?  Would he or she be brought around various suites of offices in order to evaluate the accommodation on offer?</p></speech>

In this instance, it was a new post and there was no accommodation available.  The OPW did not, as such, initiate the process of providing accommodation.  The Department requested that we should provide accommodation appropriate to a Minister of State.</p></speech>

Point No. 9 in the letter dated 16 May states that all existing suites in the relevant building were occupied.  Will Ms McGrath indicate whether any civil servants who may have occupied rooms 118A and 119A were obliged to move in order to accommodate the then Minister of State and his staff?  For what was that particular suite of offices used at the time?</p></speech>

I understand this is fairly standard practice within the Office of Public Works when accommodating Ministers or Ministers of State.  It has been well reported in recent weeks - as a result of replies to freedom of information requests - that a very lavish and extremely comfortable bathroom facility was also put in place in the suite of offices.  It seems no expense was spared in fitting out the suite.  If we compare the expenditure relating to it with that for the only comparable we can locate for the same year - this relates to the provision of offices for a Minister of State in the then Department of Health and Children's headquarters at Hawkins House - in the amount of approximately &euro;70,000.  For the record, will Ms McGrath inform the committee as to the entire amount of money expended on the new office suite at the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on Kildare Street?</p></speech>

In respect of Kildare Street, I indicated that the overall cost, excluding VAT, was &euro;206,000.  The provision of accommodation in this instance - as derived from a brief - is commensurate with the accommodation that would be provided for Ministers.</p></speech>

At the same time, for an amount which would pay for three semi-detached houses in Drogheda, a very lavish office that would be more suited to Wall Street was put in place on Kildare Street.  The building in which what has now become the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is housed on Kildare Street is a protected structure.  I accept that and it is a point which must be respected.  How was there such a huge variance between the requirements of a Minister of State located in Hawkins House and those of one who was headquartered on Kildare Street?</p></speech>

I was able to provide a figure because the final account specifically distinguished the accommodation of the Minister of State.  However, it was a much larger job.</p></speech>

The relevant Department then indicated what was to be the brief and as additional staff were assigned to the Minister of State - which would not be unusual - the brief changed.

It would be one thing if it is the case that the people in the Department did not like the standard issue toilet tissue and that they had to buy something else but this was centrally acquired by the Department for this particular facility.  I find that extraordinary.  If someone does not like a brand of toilet roll, surely he or she could buy something else themselves.

In this part of the meeting I will focus on the issue raised by Deputy Nash.  Reference was made to comparable work.  I accept the difficulty in finding a figure.  It might be the case that the figure from Hawkins House is not comparable in the way Ms McGrath described given the difference in the buildings and fit-out in the specific cases.  Was there any comparable work since 2007?  Was there any requirement for a new ministerial office?</p></speech>

No, there was not.  There are instances where we carried out refurbishment work.  The Office of Public Works has care of a considerable number of buildings.  The Deputy will note that we referred to 2013.  We now have funding for maintenance works.  We do not get many opportunities to step into Departments and ask that the work would be paused because we want to carry out important maintenance work.  When a Department has a fit-out requirement due to a change in function or a reorganisation of the Department we take the opportunity to carry out essential, proactive maintenance rather than addressing a problem at a later stage.  When there are operational issues within Departments that they wish to have addressed, we take opportunities to undertake maintenance work as well.  We will perhaps carry out work in ministerial areas but it is not specifically to provide ministerial accommodation.</p></speech>

I might speak separately on that in terms of my role in property asset management reform.  As I said in my response previously, the accommodation would be of that order.  I have two assistant secretaries sitting beside me and they are in open plan accommodation.  That is the type of issue we are examining in terms of property asset management reform for the wider public service but the specific accommodation in question would have been reflective of assistant secretary office accommodation.</p></speech>

Office accommodation has largely been linked to grade, whereas what we are saying in future is that we should seek to provide space linked to function.  We would largely be looking to have open-plan accommodation as it provides for increased densities and it is more flexible, which means that if one has to do a subsequent fit-out it does not require the removal of walls, for example.  Such a system is much more flexible.</p></speech>

I am the chair of a working group on property asset management reform.  The group is representative of all public sector property holders.  We are examining how we can best use the office accommodation within the State because the footprint is reducing according as numbers reduce.  We are looking at how we can share the space.  I might have said 88 million sq. m, but I should correct myself.  We released 88,000 sq. m, which is 1 million sq. ft.  All Departments have been very supportive.  Since 2009 Departments have been moving up in space.  We have been moving into the owned estate and we surrender leases where we can.  That has meant people are now occupying less space.  As a public sector reform steering group we are asking what that will mean for the future.</p> <p>How should we measure office accommodation for the future?  How should we allocate space?  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier with regard to savings on the procurement service, much of this is about gathering data and information on our existing estate and asking how we can best use it.  I would like to prioritise funding for the future by spending money on retrofitting space so that we can increase densities and surrender other space.  I hope that is reflective of what we are planning but in regard to this, it would have been what were the norms at the time.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening address responsibility for the maintenance of accommodation.  It is an unusual circumstance in that maintenance of accommodation, while undertaken by the Office of Public Works, is funded by Departments.  That is the ongoing maintenance of the space they occupy.  Since one of 13, we are now responsible for undertaking the maintenance and the funding, so there has been a transfer of funds through the Estimates process from the Votes of other Government Departments to the Office of Public Works.  That will allow us to undertake planned interventions on the maintenance side rather than reactive and waiting.  We would be surveying properties in a more programmed way and determining planned maintenance interventions, which is to protect the lifetime of the building because otherwise we are shoring up problems a number of years out if we do not undertake planned maintenance.  While still having demands from Departments in relation to, say, leaks or other problems, and we would respond and fund that, we will now be able to undertake more planned interventions in relation to maintenance.</p></speech>

A particular type of accommodation may come up later where we undertake works that are unique to us.  With flood risk management there are not necessarily private sector comparators because we probably are the main ones in relation to those.  How do we develop norms for that?  We would have internal norms for cells in Garda stations.  There are not private industry standards for those.  We use private contractors for all of the work, and then continue looking at how we can drive more efficiencies around that but in ordinary course in relation to office accommodation, there is no industry norm for such fit-outs in protected structures.  They talk about executive fit-outs but not in protected structures, which is an added layer within this project that would not necessarily have been the case when one considers the Bruce Shaw figures.  They are now revised again for 2013.  We always have an eye to those.  We always start a job with a brief - what is being asked, where am I to give effect to that?</p></speech>

Ms McGrath has told Deputy Eoghan Murphy that there is no budget so to speak, in the sense there is no maximum or minimum, but the OPW keeps to industry norms.  Obviously, however, as the money must come out of the office's budget somewhere, from where does the OPW find that money?</p></speech>

When the OPW is contacted by a Department, in this instance by the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, does it simply take the Department at its word that it does not have adequate accommodation space or does the OPW link in with it?  Does the OPW try to establish whether it can save money?  I have to hand many drawings and could be confused but one drawing from the Department shows an assistant secretary's office and I note assistant secretaries also have a shower room and it looks like a perfectly good ministerial office.  In fact, it looks relatively similar to the ministerial office that was devised.  Is there ever a conversation between the OPW and a Department on whether the latter could undertake a reshuffle of its personnel to make space within its existing structure?</p></speech>

Does the OPW have any role in scrutinising the brief?  Ms McGrath has stated the Department sends the brief to the OPW but what precisely does the office do with it?  Does it go through it and check it is in line with everything the office is meant to provide?  Does the OPW check for what people might view as being extravagance?  What does the OPW do when it gets the brief?</p></speech>

Moreover, it is an iterative process because questions must be teased out between the OPW and the Department in respect of what is being provided.  Again, I refer back to the benchmark and the norms and whether that would be within it and this was the case.  Maybe in 2007 in general, there may be certain things in respect of standards of finishes - not particular to this job - where we might not be doing things the same way today.  However, overall, in respect of this job, it is what it is because it was within a protected structure.  It was 113 sq. m and there were a lot of interventions.  There also are many interventions when one seeks to retain certain features and it is not a case of taking out everything.  When one makes an intervention in existing structures, it is more complex.  Furthermore, it is more complex within a protected structure than in a new build.  That was a huge part in respect of this job.</p></speech>

I appreciate the difficulty Ms McGrath has had in this regard but in her letter to the committee of 16 May, Ms McGrath referred to the nearest comparator, which already has been referenced, namely, the ministerial office in Hawkins House.  While it was referred to as being the nearest comparator, how near is it in comparison?  Ms McGrath should talk me through it because it is referred to in her correspondence as being the nearest comparator and that the ministerial element of the project cost approximately &euro;70,000, excluding VAT.  Having sent in that example, is Ms McGrath still satisfied that it is the nearest comparator and how near is it?</p></speech>

I was anxious to establish, for the purpose of the committee, whether I could get something.  Many staff were working on how we could source this information across all the projects that were carried out in buildings that are occupied by Ministers.  We found it very hard to extract that element because it depends on how it was presented in the account.  Consequently, this one happened to have such a reference.  As I indicated in my letter, it may not be a fair comparison, for want of a better word, because it was work undertaken as part of a bigger project.  As a result, the overheads and preliminaries apply to a much bigger area than taking one job on its own.  It is not a clear comparator but it was one in which the final account referred to the ministerial suite, that is, to a series of offices.  I think it was in the order of approximately 90 sq. m and was in fact a smaller space but that is-----</p></speech>

Ms McGrath obviously has provided the committee with the cost of the office in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at approximately &euro;205,000.  How much of that cost does Ms McGrath think was attributable to the fact the building was a protected structure?  While I appreciate the difficulty Ms McGrath has in making comparisons, members must also try to make comparisons.  How much of the bill for the provision of that ministerial suite of offices is Ms McGrath able to attribute to additional works or efforts to which the OPW was obliged to go because it is a protected structure?</p></speech>

However, I imagine that were the OPW to examine the associated bills, there would be a way of establishing that some of them were attributable to work it was obliged to do in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which it was not obliged to do in Hawkins House because the former is a protected structure and that this work cost X amount.

This is a Minister of State's office in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which is also an executive suite, that comes in at a substantially higher amount.  I and many others want to know why that cost so much more.  With due respect to industry norms and benchmarks, why was that one so much more expensive?  There is credibility in what Ms McGrath states about the protected structure aspect, but if we could have detail on that I would be very grateful.</p></speech>

It has been quite informative, from toilet rolls to refurbishment.  I hope it will help those outside of the debate to understand what went on in this project.</p><p>  I can ask some questions on this matter because we are now dealing with the OPW, not the Department.  I can feel free to ask those questions.</p><p>  First, I want to place on public record the fact that the OPW has responded to me and has informed me that at no stage, through either written correspondence or meetings, telephone calls or e-mails, did I have anything whatsoever to do with this project.  The OPW took full responsibility for the project.</p><p>  My questions are simple enough in a way because I did not have an involvement in it.  However, I am curious about the process and how the OPW gets to spend that kind of money.</p><p>  The OPW received an e-mail request on 5 July 2007 on the provision of this office.  Who, in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, was that from?</p></speech>

The date was 5 July.</p><p>  The brief was prepared, as I understand it, in line with Civil Service norms - Ms McGrath states that in her letter also - and it was not something that was concocted out of the blue.  In terms of the planning, it adhered to Civil Service norms.  What Ms McGrath is saying in that particular comment is that Ministers' offices generally are the same and there is a norm for them, the position for junior Ministers is likewise, and, apparently, it goes down to Secretary General, assistant secretary and whatever the levels underneath that, so that most of the offices, in terms of square footage and accommodation, are constructed in exactly the same way.  Would that be correct?</p></speech>

In terms of the cost, which is critical, I worked in that office and if one told me on the day I entered the office that it cost that much, I certainly would not have believed you.  If I had known then what I know now, I probably would have added a further chapter to my book merely to compile it all and make it as an easy reference, but I did not.</p><p>  In terms of the cost, was the OPW's only comparison, by way of tenders it received, the Bruce Shaw handbook, which sets out costs and other aspects?</p></speech>

On that date, a message was sent to the OPW in the standard format to say that a decision had been taken by the other Department that the office was required.  It went from that Department to planning and other stages.  Prior to 11 July, notice was given that the office was for five civil servants and various survey drawings were submitted.  I wish to record these matters which arise from correspondence that is in the public domain.  On 11 July, plans had not been finalised and were being described as "draft" in the various e-mails I have seen.  I must address the following as I was the Minister of State in question.  It was suggested that I generally agreed the plans on 13 July.  In those plans, no offices were provided for civil servants.  In other words, they were still draft plans and works in progress.  It was not the final draft.  It may have been referred to by Deputy Harris.  In fact, on 16 July, architects confirmed that they were still developing the plans and options.  Therefore, to suggest that these were final plans is not correct.  These plans were reproduced in a daily newspaper and they were not the plans I had seen.  On 18 July, the project drawings were described as working projects.  On 27 July, the project went to tender and there was no reference to the Minister in relation to the matter.  It was not my job to sign off on those plans.  I am not an architect, engineer or clerk of works and, therefore, I am not qualified to sign off.  It was done elsewhere in the Department and, as was the case in relation to the tendering process, it could have been stopped at any stage when the tender documents were returned with a price if that price were found to be excessive by the OPW.  That did not happen either.</p><p>  The minutes of the various meetings, which are available, show no involvement whatsoever by me - none.  I say this because the PAC is the committee of audit and public accountability and I take my role in this seriously.  I would leave no stone unturned to do my job professionally and well.  This has caused me some concern, which I have not been able to address up to now in the way that I would like.  The letter of 16 May demonstrates clearly that the project was managed and delivered by the OPW out of funding from the OPW itself.  At that time, it was part of the Department of Finance.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In late 2006 two sites were purchased in Drogheda at a cost of &euro;11.81 million.  The site in the area of Murdoch's car park and the Abbey Centre car park was purchased by the OPW from the local authority for a decentralisation project involving the Department of Social Protection and other State agencies.  Of the &euro;11.81 million, &euro;7.75 involved a local authority initiative to acquire a hardware premises on Narrow West Street in Drogheda and a rear car park to develop a multi-storey car park.

On Garda station closures, 137 stations have been closed to date.  I understand 20 will be put on the market soon.  What is the process as to how the decision is taken to put stations on the market?  Is there any interaction with local authorities, other public agencies or the local community as to how to put those particular stations to the best possible use, considering the majority of the stations in question are located in rural areas where a local community may take some benefit from access to those particular facilities?  When will these 20 stations be put on the market?  What stations are involved?</p></speech>

This has arisen in the past - although it may not be under the present programme - with Finglas and Whitehall where there were other State uses.  We would then pursue that with a public body.  That would be the initial decision regarding a station closure.</p><p>  The second course of action - although it is a very depressed market - is if there was a market, we would consider whether a site may be suitable for disposal.  The Deputy referred to 20 stations.  We have yet to decide how we will bring them to the market but we will be examining it over the summer.</p><p>  In other cases where we would not see the first two actions happening, we have asked, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, if there are community uses for this site.  We would require that there would be a legal entity that we could engage with for the purposes of licensing the use of the station for such activity.  The entity would have to be in a position to take that licence, maintain the property, insure it and be able to undertake planning permission, if required.  That is the policy around the stations that are being closed.</p><p>  I will have to come back to the committee about the stations we have identified for disposal.</p></speech>

This has possibly had an impact on visitor numbers.  There is an increase in local tourism with people within the jurisdiction attending heritage sites.  Much of the counting is done on sites where we have guide services.  We have much more sites where there is no service, so the numbers are probably higher.  I am glad to acknowledge the work of the organisation in managing the sites.  We would wish to do more in the promoting of sites.</p><p>  The busiest sites are Kilmainham Gaol, Newgrange-Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, Dublin Castle, the Phoenix Park and Kilkenny Castle.</p></speech>

Clearly, Newgrange-Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne is a world heritage site and that in itself attracts significant numbers of international visitors.  We have a site next door, namely the Oldbridge site, which is managed very well.  It is a huge addition to the tourism and heritage offering of this country, North and South.  How could there be greater interaction between the two sites to ensure a better apportioning of visitor numbers in that area?</p></speech>

We are looking at how we can market the sites and best achieve greater numbers or intensify visitor numbers.  We also work under the auspices of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to see if there are initiatives upon which we should be engaged.  For example, we would see how we could maximise the tourist potential around particular visitors who are disposed to particular types of tourism such as gardens and military sites.  We work with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in this regard too.</p><p>  We are very conscious our sites are in communities and how best we can engage with them.  The communities initiative has been running for several years.  With it we work with local communities to see how we can extend the tourism season, opening hours or have greater use for local communities of a site.  This also brings added benefits to the site.  We are also working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on driving routes.  Wherever we can help, or others can help us, we are very anxious to be in that space.</p></speech>

If one turns to the penultimate page of the Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2011 on page 194, paragraph 14.39 states that based on the four areas of procurement reviewed, the savings identified by the National Procurement Service are not reliable and are not suitable for use as a performance measure.

My colleague from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might talk about that for the future.  When the National Procurement Service was set up in 2009, our priority was to leverage the State's covenant to maximise savings and to get contracts in place.  The estimation of the savings predicted was to an extent based on estimates of what we think the use of the contracts would be, with the actual figures for the consumption of the products for which we were placing contracts to come afterwards.  We were doing estimations without the actual data.  We are now taking real figures about what is happening and real comparitors.  We set up a group at the end of 2012 to take the guidelines on how we decide and determine savings.  That working group has taken on board what has been raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is reporting to the National Procurement Service with a view to how we do this in the future.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that to go from an estimated annual procurement expenditure by sector of &euro;9.3 billion in 2009 to &euro;8.6 billion in 2011 is a phenomenal change in respect of the totality of procurement by State bodies.

I am the newly appointed chief procurement officer and I joined the Civil Service at the end of January.  I am responsible for putting in place the new office for government procurement.  What Ms McGrath has articulated is fairly typical to both Government and private procurement in respect of the challenge of measuring benefits.  This reflects a natural evolution in the approaches and methodologies used for measurement.  It does not discredit previous measurements but recognises that as better processes and systems are put in place, the accuracy with which one can measure savings will improve.  We are currently dealing with a significant number of contracting entities which have put in place and implemented the various frameworks.  They may implement these frameworks at different times, however, leading to a degree of uncertainty as to when those savings will arise.  We will standardise the methodologies and build on the work undertaken by the NPS under the umbrella of the OPW in improving those measures and moving towards a more robust methodology for making savings.  As we roll out the new office towards the end of this year we will improve the methodologies for capturing those savings, but we have to be clear that while our systems capabilities remain poor and will require investment in the coming years, it is only when those systems are put in place that we will significantly improve the accuracy of our measurements.  To some degree we will continue to rely on estimates.  In terms of the benefits, these estimates will be produced in a clearly defined and auditable manner that will lend credibility to them but there will be a journey in improving our reporting.</p></speech>

We will then issue guidance to all procuring entities so that we can collectively report in a standardised way against a documented methodology.

In regard to the use of central frameworks, there are international benchmarks of &euro;36,000 for centralised procurement of individual contracts and &euro;6,000 for decentralised contracts.  When a framework is put in place for 200 bodies, the saving is 200 times &euro;6,000 as distinct from &euro;36,000 for central procurement.  That is factored into the avoidance of costs.  For example, the measurement of savings in the e-tenders contracts is based on the fact that we do not need to advertise.  It is a cost avoided because advertising on e-tenders means one does not need to pay for advertisements.  We have measured that based on taking out a number of advertisements.</p></speech>

Reviews of 12,000 meters identified <i>potential</i> savings of &euro;2.1 million.

We are advising that, based on our looking at meters and usage, people are on the wrong tariffs.  We advise them that they could be on lower tariffs, but they are their contracts with the suppliers so they have to follow up on that.  We have had difficulty getting that information.  Based on what we had, and our expertise, our analysis was that it was in that order.  Was it realised?  That was dependent, and I would have presumed all of them were exercised to get that saving, to give effect to changing the tariff.  It is not done centrally because these are 24,000 individual meters.</p></speech>

Through InterTradeIreland we have had workshops and meet-the-buyer events.  We have engaged with approximately 4,500 SMEs, providing them with information on what it means to do business with the State and trying to help them with the documentation and the necessary compliance procedures and legal considerations, explaining how they can engage.  It is constant work in the NPS to get more people actively tendering.  Registering with eTenders alerts SMEs to competitions that may be of interest to them so they do not have to be constantly watching for it.</p></speech>

In 2011, 6,120 contracts were advertised on the site and there was an estimated annual saving of &euro;11.8 million due to the use of the site.  That is calculated on the basis that each of those contracts would have been advertised in three newspapers.  That is the saving we achieved.  Would each of those contracts have been advertised in three newspapers?  Do we do that for every single contract regardless of the amount?</p></speech>

He said maybe we are being generous on that.  Many advertisements are in local newspapers as well.  They are in national and local newspapers, depending on the contract, and this is very much the case for local authorities.  They do both.  So we have said it is not unreasonable for us to base it on advertising in three newspapers.</p></speech>

If one saves something once, one typically takes on that saving forever.  From a budgetary perspective, when money comes out of the budget it generally does not go in the following year to come back out again.  While the benefit persists, one takes it into account from a budgetary perspective only once.  Returning to the standardisation of the methodology, we are going to examine how we measure those savings and over what period of time.</p></speech>

I may be generalising, but most people say framework agreements are the way to go because they enable us to achieve efficiencies of scale and leverage the State covenant, as Ms McGrath stated.

This is the reason the Government has made the decision to drive centralisation.  We need to increase the spend that is looked at centrally and pull in the common items from the various other Departments and agencies.  The amount under negotiation centrally and frameworks will increase from approximately &euro;220 million to more than &euro;4 billion out of the total.

It is not that they were not complying with the directives or the rules.  However, the right hand was not seeing what the left hand was doing and they were not doing what the office of government procurement will do, which is looking at the bigger picture versus looking internally at what each sector is doing.  There are a significant number of independent operations.  While they are fully compliant, they are not looking at expenditure from the point of view that there are major savings to be gained through aggregation, looking at how the market is operating and applying the market intelligence to get better deals and talking to the market in advance before going to it, which is what we are now doing and will do in the future.</p><p>  There is a further significant saving, as our chairman adverted to, in administration.  Instead of 200 or 300 public bodies operating independently in procuring common goods, doing this centrally through one or two offerings to the market may in aggregate cost &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 - that is the accepted figure - but we will save up to &euro;1.5 million on administration costs across the public sector before one starts to talk about the savings aggregation will deliver and that the market will deliver by putting bigger offerings to it.</p></speech>

Of the expenditure that is not covered by framework agreements, of course, it would still have to be cognisant of procurement policies within the organisation and EU competition law.  I was not suggesting there was a kind of "wild west" of procurement.  We have had this big discussion about framework agreements but they only cover 3% of the total amount spent.</p></speech>

From that perspective, it is not one approach to each category.  It is different approaches depending on how the market is operating.  We would talk to the market in advance of going out and look at it from a lotting perspective or whether it should be a single framework or a multi-supplier framework.  So there are different approaches to different categories and we try to give best approach to facilitate best return from the market.</p></speech>

I already made a point to Mr. Quinn on the nature of the framework models to which we are seeking to evolve.  If we are in an environment with many buyers and suppliers, that is clearly inefficiency.  I would argue there is also inefficiency in a model where there are many buyers and only a single supplier.  We have talked about this previously in terms of the SME community.  If we end up with only a single supplier of a good nationwide even for a country of our size, that is as inefficient as a model with thousands of buyers and thousands of suppliers.</p></speech>

We will again look at the market dynamics and try to structure our offerings and our tender structures, particularly how we lot out various different services for potentially some degree of local delivery where possible and that should enable SMEs to compete.  In the context of my appointment and the new office I am setting up, we are meeting various different industry representative associations.  For example we met Chambers Ireland yesterday and we are meeting the Small Firms Association and the CIF next week to discuss how Government procurement is changing and what changes need to happen and need to be facilitated within the SME sector for them to compete.  As we encourage them to collaborate more and work together, they will be able to compete increasingly for business, not only from the Irish Government, but potentially abroad as well.  It is something on which we are working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland to promote within the community.</p></speech>

It comes back to understanding how the market is structured and how many players there are in the market.  Obviously it is in the long-term interest for the procurement function to maintain a competitive marketplace.  So we will be very conscious about how the market is structured, who is out there and just how much of the pie one player might be getting if they were to be awarded the overall business.  Again it is something we are increasingly conscious of.</p></speech>

This will take time.</p> <p>A number still have occupied married quarters and we need to resolve this issue with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As some are very old former RIC stations, the legal process to prepare them for disposal takes time, but a programme is under way.  There is no outer limit on community engagement, but when we reach this stage, it will be a bit more involved than many communities realise.  The transaction with a community must be through a legal entity with which we can have a formal enforceable agreement.  Health and safety issues must also be considered.  A building which was a small Garda station is not a community centre and severe modifications may be required to comply with fire and disabled access regulations if large numbers of people are to use it.  This is expensive and generally beyond the reach of many community groups.  It is not as easy as dealing directly and coming up with a solution, but we will work through it.  That said, we have received very good proposals from a wide variety of groups which will in due course have merit and be worth pursuing.  The organisation and the Minister are very anxious to go through the cycles.  Another State body using a building would be good because it would save us buying alternative properties.  Some of the buildings are very valuable and will make much needed revenue.  Beyond this, the optimum way is to give benefit to communities, but we must be sure they have the wherewithal to make a go of it.  In certain circumstances we will take back a building in a far worse state than we gave it.  This will work for everyone, but we are going through a system.  To answer the original question, there is no limit.</p></speech>

I will give the example of arts supplies for schools.  I understand the basic idea is to save as much as we can, but at what point in the process is a value for money report or analysis undertaken?  One can tell schools one knows where they can get supplies much cheaper, but this may remove small and medium enterprises from the market and lead to job losses.  Is a value for money report compiled and is this taken into consideration?</p></speech>

It is not possible to consider one business against another in this regard.  People bid and are successful based on transparent principles and processes to ensure probity, as we would expect in public procurement.  The bidding process and evaluation criteria take into account price and quality.  It is important to note that the Government has set out significant targets and savings to be achieved in public procurement.  We are driving people towards looking at the markets more holistically and on an aggregated basis.  That said, we will break down offerings into lots to enable small and medium enterprises to participate, but they need to participate and be competitive.  That is the core principle.</p></speech>

Is it the case from day one in the process that this simply cannot happen?  A large company can drop its prices and if the Government wants to save money, it can go to it and small and medium enterprises will be blown out of the water.</p></speech>

As my colleagues have indicated, many small and medium enterprises are registered and aware of the competitions.  We work with Enterprise Ireland and various industry bodies to ensure small and medium enterprises recognise this is a challenge and that being competitive in a marketplace in which the Government is looking more holistically for value means they must change how they operate to deliver such value for the State.  I am confident that small and medium enterprises can do this.  Many small and medium enterprises operate with lower overheads and are more nimble than larger organisations.  There are balances which enable small and medium enterprises to participate, but they need to recognise the frameworks, how little is centralised and to where we are trying to get.  The industry must change in response to this.  That is what we are communicating to industry.</p></speech>

People have contacted me because business was conducted in a particular way for many years and now the emphasis has changed and they feel they have been sidetracked by the process.  We might obtain better value for money for several years, but it will not be good if a company which has supplied a school for 20 years goes out of business.  I understand this is not within the OPW's remit, but while small and medium enterprises must understand the process and that they must be competitive, if a bigger player undercuts everyone else, why would the Government not give it the contract?  My point concerns the damage this does.</p></speech>

As part of our new process of professionalising procurement across the board and improving knowledge and understanding of procurement, we will examine how the markets are structured and where local delivery is possible.  We will structure and break down the offerings in order that they are not all huge.  We recognise that services may be locally or regionally delivered.  This is where small and medium enterprises can step in and compete.  The communications process is kicking in and we are engaging considerably with industry representative associations in order that they understand this process and work it through their networks in Chambers Ireland and the Small Firms Association.</p></speech>

If one buys the cheapest product, one may find it fails very quickly.  If a cheap boiler is installed in a building, it may fail very quickly, which is not an economy or saving.  We must consider the quality of the products and services we procure.  A key part of the new operating model is that Departments and agencies will be key in assessing quality and it will not simply be presented to them as a <i>fait accompli</i> by a faceless central procurement function.  A key element will be that Departments and agencies will work with the new office of government procurement in determining the standards and signing off on the requirements and assessing the tenders for this quality aspect.</p></speech>

I have been following this very closely and know negotiations took place between the OPW and the Mount Congreve estate and that a conclusion was to be reached in August or September last year.  However, this did not happen and tours of the estate were cancelled.  Issues have been raised about the 12 members of staff, particularly the gardeners, who looked after the estate and were responsible for its maintenance.  The annual cost of upkeep of the estate is &euro;400,000.  It is a significant estate and I would have thought the OPW would have dealt with the matter as quickly as possible to take it in charge in order that it would not run into maintenance issues or that the condition of the garden would not worsen.</p> <p>This year, the cancellation of the public liability insurance has caused 17 tours of the estate to be cancelled.  For what reason did the 2012 negotiations not materialise in an agreement?  Is there a basis for an agreement?  Is an agreement close that might rescue the situation and deal with the staff who are in limbo?</p></speech>

I can discuss them separately if there is no time pressure.  The factual situation is that the Commissioners of Public Works comprise one third of three trusts that have ownership over Mount Congreve house and gardens.  The staff caring for the gardens are in the employ of the Congreve Foundation, not the trust.  I understand that the foundation wishes to withdraw from operations in Waterford, including the trust.  The negotiations have to do with willing partners and driving value, given the original basis on which this structure was set up in the 1970s.  Matters had progressed, but then needed to be addressed again.  We are willing to sit down and talk and there is a basis for an agreement, but we need the other side to engage.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Chairman's comments, which we will pass on to the people on the ground who are running the castle.  Upgrades are constantly under way, as is the work on conserving the contents, including artwork, frames, etc.  The education programme is ongoing.  Outsourced heating for the tea rooms was completed this year.  Work is under way with the St. Patrick's Day committee as part of a year-long programme to attract visitors from home and abroad.  A Kilkenny Castle day was held on 11 March in 2012.</p><p>  As with other facilities that we manage with a view to using them for events and presentations, Castletown House being another example, we are constantly engaging with the local community, the local authority and local and regional tourism boards as to how to promote it.

That encourages people to take ownership of it and to feel part of it.  We could include the office across the way also.  There is great public interest in it after today and we could charge for entry.  On a serious note, the marketing of these locations is hugely positive for the country and has a local impact.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned one in his own constituency.  In my constituency, I have the Phoenix Park, including Farmleigh House, the Botanic Gardens and many other sites dotted across the city.  The OPW staff at those sites do a tremendous job.  I want to recognise that they are very open to the properties being used in different ways.  We see art exhibitions, outdoor sculpture in the Botanic Gardens, and different types of community events at Farmleigh, which is a very different use from the one originally conceived for the building.  The superintendent of the Phoenix Park and his staff are always extremely accommodating to any community event.  Like the Chairman, I want to recognise that.  There is a genuine openness among the people the OPW has running its properties and sites to try things out and do things differently.  We should not let the meeting conclude without commending that and asking the witnesses to pass the message on.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegation from the European affairs committee of the Bavarian Parliament.  The delegation is led by Professor Ursula M&auml;nnle and I thank its members for attending.  I also welcome our colleagues from the German Embassy.</p><p>  The delegation is on a short visit to Ireland in the context of Ireland's EU Presidency.  One of the priorities of the delegation is to have the opportunity to engage with parliamentarians across Europe.  Bavaria is the second largest of the 16 German states.  We always hear with great interest the results of different elections in the German <i>L&auml;nder</i>.  We understand the importance of the Parliament within that system.  Many of the issues we are all interested in are known to us in respect of the future of the eurozone, fiscal union, banking union and, most importantly, the challenge of high levels of unemployment, which many of us face, and what we can do to respond to it.</p><p>  We will first hear from Professor Ursula M&auml;nnle before hearing from members of the committee and then other members of the delegation.</p></speech>

We are delegation from the Bavarian State Parliament and five parties are represented in the Parliament.  All five parties are represented within to the delegation visiting today.</p><p>  It is probably fair to say that there is broad consensus among the members of the delegation on European affairs.  We might differ significantly on other policy issues but, when it comes to European affairs, there is shared consensus among members of the delegation.</p> <p>I will briefly introduce the members of the delegation and refer to the parties they represent in order that when they make a contribution, committee members will have some idea of the position from which they are speaking.  Mr. Linus Forster is a member of the Social Democratic Party and also a speaker on youth issues in the parliament.  Mr. Alexander Radwan is a member of the majority  party, the CSU, Christian Social Union, party, and has been a Member of the European Parliament for ten years.  Mr. Konrad Kobler is also a member of the Christian Social Union party and has been a member of the federal state parliament for 30 years.  He is the speaker on social affairs within the parliament.  Mr. Joachim Hansich is a member of the Free Electors' Group, a group of independents, and represents that part of the political spectrum.  He has worked for many years as lord mayor of a significant local community.  Ms Anne Franke is a member of the Green Party and specifically interested in agricultural policies and consumer protection.  Mr. Thomas Dechant is a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party.  This is his first term in the parliament and he works on the agricultural committee.  Ms Renate Dodell is not a member of our committee, but she is vice chair of the CSU parliamentary party in the federal state parliament.  She has a keen interest in European affairs and we have invited her to join us and observe the discussion and exchanges.  I am the chair of the European committee and also a member of the government party, the CSU.  Mr. Dechant is vice chair of our committee. </p><p> The Vice Chairman has alluded to the fact that our visit to Ireland coincides with the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  Members of our European committee traditionally visit countries that hold the EU Presidency to see what political priorities they are pursuing.  Beyond this, we are also very interested in finding out what efforts are being made - we have seen that Ireland has made significant efforts in this regard - to emerge from the crisis that has been evident in this country and what efforts have been made to understand the political context for Ireland in emerging from the crisis.</p><p> Before entering the more substantive discussion on current political developments, I would like to ask about the role of the Irish Parliament in the context of European policy.  Members of the joint committee will be aware that the Lisbon treaty has placed greater significance on the contribution of national parliaments in how decisions are taken and carried through within the European context.  The committee might also be aware that in the Federal Republic of Germany there has been a court ruling by the country's highest court, the Constitutional Court, supporting a request of the parliament for sufficient information to make a contribution to political decisions.  That court ruling found against the government of the day.  The ruling, as well as the Lisbon treaty provisions, strengthen the role of national parliaments and, for that matter, federal state parliaments within the European policy context.  To what extent is the Irish Parliament at the table when it comes to policy decisions taken in the European Union and political decisions taken in Ireland within a European context?  Does it believe it is heard before such decisions are taken?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052300004#C00200"><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I will respond to that question.  I acknowledge the fact that all of my colleagues who are from different parties could have different answers to Professor M&auml;nnle's question.  I will, therefore, make three points that may be helpful to the visiting committee.</p><p>  The first point, as Professor M&auml;nnle said, is that under the Lisbon treaty, new powers were conferred on parliaments.  The way it has worked within this parliament is that these powers sit with sectoral committees rather than the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  If there is an issue about transport policy, for example, under the Lisbon treaty the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications has capacity rather than the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</p> <p>It would be a concern of all members that the national parliament maintain a pre-eminent role in European affairs.  Our Parliament and this committee, through COSAC, the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, have put forward suggestions regarding how that could be maintained in European affairs and economic policy.</p><p> Within this Parliament, this committee does not have a formal role in the setting of government policy before decisions are made.  Our role is one of influence and opinion rather than of formal sanction.  For example, the committee has pre- and post-Council meetings.</p></speech>

So, in the State Diet of Bavaria, it is the committee for European and federal affairs which discusses affairs of subsidiarity and deals with them.</p></speech>

Is there a mechanism whereby local authorities are supported in their efforts to deal with the crises in unemployment and with their own financial budgets?</p></speech>

Wages and salaries have been cut, in some cases by up to 40%.  Working time has been increased while holidays have been reduced.  Effectively and essentially, a wide range of economic measures have been applied through each Department to their subsidiary sectors to achieve the targets laid down in the troika agreement.  The Government&rsquo;s policy has been to try to encourage employment and minimise tax on working to encourage the regeneration of employment while ensuring at the same time that budgetary targets are met.  We are set to achieve all of our targets in the economic recovery plan arising from the troika agreement and will be on target to move out into the financial markets on time.</p> <p> Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is a problem in respect of which specific policies are being pursued at the present time in line with European policy on the same issue.  At the same time, selective capital projects are being considered as a means of alleviating some unemployment and generating economic growth.  Our target is to achieve economic growth as a means of galvanising economic recovery such as an economic growth rate of about 2% in 18 months time or thereabouts.  We expect that anything in excess of that will have a dramatic result.  We need to achieve 2% growth in the not too distant future as quickly as possible.  </p><p> We are proceeding cautiously with regard to trying to achieve our targets as we proceed.  We are trying to review our position as we go along.  We have moved away from the notion that previously applied for the 15 year period prior to this whereby economic targets were assumed.  We have now adopted a policy of checking economic progress on a regular basis in line with European policy.  I wish to emphasise that we have not found it easy.  This has been difficult.  We have had social unrest and unease on a constant basis.  The two parties in government have had to adopt a very firm stance.  It is a difficult situation to find ourselves in but the two parties in government are committed to those targets and will continue.  With regard to the issues presented by the delegation at the beginning, each EU member state, without exception, needs to play its role at the present time.  Nobody can opt out or presume that somebody else will carry them.  We know that and are fully committed to our own recovery.  I should mention that I am the old guy in this bunch.  </p></speech>

Mr. Beuster is my neighbour as well so it is not the first time we have been in this setting.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and have this exchange.  I will add a few words to what Deputy Durkan said about local government and then put one or two questions to the person in charge of youth affairs and the agricultural speakers.</p><p>  The delegation asked about local government.  Traditionally, local government would be funded through business rates and a local government fund.  That would pay for local services.  For a Government under stress, continuing to put the same amount of money into local government presents a huge challenge.  As part of our reform package, we are bringing in a new property tax, which is currently due.  I guess it widens the tax base so that not all of our taxes are on income but it will be a critical tax to fund local government as 65% of that tax will remain within the local authority area.  We have about 30 local authorities, 26 counties and four cities.  </p><p>  It is great to have the opportunity to meet the delegation so that we can learn more about how people in Germany live and what their priorities are.  We know Germany plays a predominant role within the EU and it is not unusual to be told that we need to learn how to be good Germans, which does not always go down very well in Ireland.  I am keen to learn more about some of the challenges Germany faces.  </p><p>  Our youth unemployment is very high.  About one in three of our young people under 30 would be unemployed.  Could the delegation talk about the German figures?  It is a massive challenge because around 65% of our young people attend third level education.  </p> <p>For that body of young people to come into the market without opportunities can be soul destroying.  Nevertheless, we believe it is the way we should be going.  What is the rate of unemployment among those aged under 30 years in Germany and what are young people doing at third level?  Where is the thrust in terms of Government policy?  Is it towards information technology, maths and sciences, that is, the knowledge economy?  Germany has a great tradition in the artisan area.  I ask the witnesses to speak further about this.  What is the starting income level for graduates of sciences and artisan areas?  Our wages were traditionally high, which is the reason we lost competitiveness but growth could be promoted in the European Union if Germans were paid more and had more money to spend.</p></speech>

It is great to meet them in Ireland and I hope they have an enjoyable stay and a productive exchange of views in Dublin and elsewhere.  We are anxious to maintain strong links with our German counterparts.  We have strong links in culture, trade and tourism.</p><p>  As Senator Healy Eames noted, we have recently introduced a property tax for local government.  The tax was born out of our economic difficulties but one of its happy results will be a strengthening of local government, contrary to popular conception.  For the first time, local politicians will set the level of the tax, control expenditure and be accountable to the people for the money.  We never had proper local government previously.  It is an ironic advantage arising from the recession.</p><p>  Unemployment, specifically youth unemployment, is the great challenge facing all countries in Europe.  For this reason I would be happy to hear that the witnesses support the continuation of stimulus measures, the youth guarantee and other direct supports for European economies to create employment.  Governments need to be actively involved, apart from the private sector, in creating jobs.  A stimulus package is needed in this respect and I hope for a positive response.</p><p>  I am interested in what the witnesses have to say about energy policy in their state given that nuclear energy has been ruled out at government level.  How are alternative energies being progressed, has there been much success in this regard and how are the economics working out?  </p></speech>

I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have had to deal with Tibet and China this morning and have just left a very fine meal, with some accompanying German wine, because of the presence of a delegation from South Korea.  I think the wine was from the Mosel region.  I have not had a chance to read my briefing notes so I will direct three questions to the delegation.</p><p>  Our Taoiseach is in Greece conveying a very important message to the Greeks about what we in this country are doing about extracting ourselves from the bailout.  As we were one of the first countries to receive a bailout, it was extremely difficult for us to absorb the banking debt as part of the sovereign responsibility.  Do the delegates support the agreement at the July meeting of the Heads of State to separate banking debts from sovereign debts?</p><p>  The delegates are aware of Ireland's absolute commitment to the European project, unlike our neighbours in England.  Germany has a population of 82 million; we have a population of 4.5 million.  Does the delegation appreciate that we are a coalition Government - analogous to that between Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, which is similar to our Labour Party - and that our obligation to implement the programme of austerity, particularly as social democrats, has been extraordinarily difficult?  Do they think Germany will recognise that while the previous Government made disastrous policy decisions, we are now carrying a very heavy political burden?  Will Germany join with us in sharing the burden?</p></speech>

First, regarding the statistics the committee asked for, we are in the very fortunate situation in Germany that we have in the former Federal Republic of Germany a youth unemployment rate of 7% and in Bavaria a youth unemployment rate of less than 3%, which is a very fortunate and pleasant situation to be in.  These numbers do not include young people who are either in training programmes for further education or specific support programmes for school leavers who might not yet be able to enter the labour market.  We have introduced programmes such as a fit-for-job programme.  Anybody who is involved and supported by such programmes is not part of this statistic.</p><p>  The youth unemployment problems, such as they are, are probably more focused on people leaving school who are insufficiently qualified to enter the labour market.  For people having left third-level education, luckily, there is not a significant unemployment issue.</p> <p>There are some specific demands and shortages, which are governed by whatever branch of industry might be concerned.  For instance, with regard to the IT sector, engineering and manufacturing, we have a shortage of qualified people.  On the other hand, there are academic fields where people leaving third level education might find it a little more difficult to find something specific to their background and their education.</p><p> With regard to the question on entry wage levels for people leaving academic training or with other qualifications, the committee might find that the response I will give might differ somewhat from the response members of other parties might give.  There is a breadth in the political spectrum and there was a debate about where this is.  As members of the Social Democratic Party - and the Green Party might share this view - we are of the opinion that people entering the labour market are not always paid appropriately and there should, perhaps, be an increase in the levels of pay.  I am particularly concerned about developments regarding internships or other precarious employment situations which should, given the current economic situation in Germany, be more secure and better rewarded than they are currently.  I will invite colleagues to speak for other parties on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Renate Dodell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052300009#H00200"><p>Germany has been repeatedly criticised, not least by the OECD, for the relatively low number of young people who go through third level education but this may be the reason for the fact that we have such low levels of youth unemployment.  Within the federal republic, the political responsibility for education rests with each state.  Within Bavaria, we have a schooling system which allows young people to go through a schooling programme of nine, ten or 12 years.  When they leave the programme at whatever duration they have chosen, they then have the opportunity to progress and move up from the level at which they have left the schooling system.  Those who do not choose to enter a third level university to study, typically start a vocational training programme.  The latter is carried out in Germany under the dual system, which comprises training supplied by the company for which they work and schooling for which they typically attend a school two and a half days a week throughout the training period.  This lasts from two and a half to three years.  Those who emerge from the training programme are well respected and sought after by industry.  As a result, this leads to a situation where many people who have completed the programme will find acceptable jobs and they are well respected within those jobs.</p><p>  We have recently introduced a new initiative whereby those who have gone through the vocational training programme to the level of master in whatever trade they are trained in, automatically have a right to enter university and to continue their education at that level following this practical training.  Most of those who then decide to study are inclined to study the human sciences rather than natural sciences.  Perhaps a correction is needed more towards natural sciences and the IT sector rather than having people study languages, education and so on because this is where the jobs are and where we are looking for future careers.  We have introduced programmes co-sponsored by schools and businesses where young people, particularly young women, are introduced to science in practice.</p><p>  I refer to the entry wage levels for people completing third level education.  I have three sons who have completed third level education and it is my experience that the entry wage levels for the jobs they might take are determined by the industry, the job profile and the demand for those specific jobs at any given time.</p><p>  Perhaps I will hand over to my colleagues on the question on agricultural policy.</p></speech>

It has traditionally been the position in Germany to decouple production from these support payments which are made available through this European programme.  So the traditional political position would clearly have been to have this land-ownership-based.  However, there is now a discussion over whether this is really the best policy to pursue and there is a rethinking of that policy based on the understanding and also some scientific support for the position that if public moneys are spent, they should be spent on something that makes a contribution to society and it should not just be based on ownership of land.  So currently the German position within the Common Agricultural Policy discussions and negotiations is still the decoupled position based on land ownership, but there is a shift in the political thinking on that issue that we observe.  Bavaria, in particular, strongly supports holders of small farms and family farms.</p></speech>

With regard to the structure of farm holdings within the Federal Republic of Germany, there are quite significant differences.  For historical reasons, the structure of farm holdings in the former East German federal states is very different from that in Bavaria, where we tend to have very small family-farm holdings.  So there is a political debate over how we can address the reality of a significant structural difference in the agricultural sector.  Bavaria in particular pursues a policy of front-loading and of supporting in particular small holdings of between 20 ha and 30 ha.</p><p>  There are a number of other policy measures in place to support small farm holdings and family businesses.  In particular, we support people making additional income outside the farm on which they work.  We support initiatives to make a contribution to local tourism, farm tourism and different aspects of the cultural landscape and fabric of society which are being supported.  We also support initiatives for producers to market their own products.  There is a range of policy strategies in place to support family businesses and small farms.</p><p>  I was asked about renewable energy.  Within the agricultural sector there is scope for renewable energy to be used very successfully, not least because of the roof areas on big farmhouses, which are being used for photovoltaic solar systems, which feed into the grid.  Larger farms are also introducing biogas systems.  This is creating extra income for small farms and it works at that level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alexander Radwan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052300010#J00400"><p>I thank the members for their questions.  I wish to focus on the questions on the economic and monetary union.  I will start with the question of youth unemployment.  The figures quoted for youth employment are figures that have been achieved at the end of the implementation of a ten-year reform programme.  For a significant period of time wealth creation in Germany has been modest, facilitated by acceptance by the unions of such modest growth of wealth.  While these figures are very positive, they are on the basis of a ten-year reform programme.</p> <p>With regard to the separation of banking and sovereign debt, there is certainly a need for greater unity at European level when it comes to the banking sector with regard to monitoring mechanisms, facilities to manage the banking sector, regulation and the issue of a financial transaction tax.  We need to speak with one voice and come to a common position on these issues and others such as the highly speculative transactions which to date have not been regulated in Europe.  It is necessary and important to realise that if guaranteeing banking debt comes into effect at European level, it will be as the final step rather than the first step of the process.</p><p> In the first instance it is the responsibility of each member state to secure its own banking sector, and if this and other steps fail then such banking debt can be guaranteed at EU level.  In Germany we very clearly recognise that a number of member states must make big asks of their people.  We make a great effort to promote the idea that the German taxpayer must make a contribution to the situation.  For this reason we are in the process of sharing the burden, which was mentioned at the beginning.  It is necessary for us to address the issues and the mistakes made over the past decade, and this concerns all member states; I do not want to single out any one member state of the European Union.  We must draw conclusions, learn lessons and ensure such a situation does not arise again.</p><p> The Irish Presidency has concrete experience of how difficult it is to go beyond fixing on paper something such as the six pack or two pack and new regulations, and implement them and ensure such regulations are observed and respected.  For this very reason we are heartened to see a combination of austerity measures and budget consolidation in Ireland.  This process, which is so successful in Ireland, will be seen as a model for future developments with regard to how a country can emerge from such a situation.  We must learn from the mistakes made in the past and not repeat them.</p></speech>

At present, we cannot fill positions and must seek people to do the work.  We recruit from elsewhere, we have extended the length of working life and introduced new training models to allow people change career.  A White Paper has been published on the duration of working life and pension policies in member states, and a number of member states fall below the retirement age threshold of 65 or 67 which is foreseen in the White Paper.</p><p>  With regard to youth unemployment and the dual vocational training programme we mentioned, it is our view and experience that the benefit of this training programme is that highly-qualified people are trained specifically for the jobs in the market.  They are trained in companies where the work takes place.  It is not schooling which takes place outside of the real world; it is very specific and tailor made.  Those who emerge from the programme are very well qualified and respected, and have no problem finding their place in the workforce.  We hold great store by the fact this significantly contributes to our low youth unemployment rates.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, and together with my senior officials we will provide as much information and clarification as possible.  I welcome Dr. Fergal Lynch, the deputy Secretary General at the Department, and Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general-designate at the HSE.</p><p>  At the outset, I thank the Chairman and committee for their hard work, dedication and commitment to progressing the protection of life during pregnancy Bill 2013.  The committee has just completed its oral hearings and will now submit its report to the Government on the content of the Bill.  This new legislation takes account of our obligations under the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, with due regard to our Constitution and to the Supreme Court ruling in the X case.  It is still the hope of the Government that the protection of life during pregnancy Bill 2013 will be enacted before the D&aacute;il rises for the summer.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to update the committee on significant developments in the health services since I last attended in November 2012.  Members may recall that I briefed the committee on the publication of Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Health Reform 2012-2015, which sets out the major health care reforms that will be introduced by 2015 as the key building blocks for the launch of universal health insurance in 2016.  The new structures are already being established and the actions being delivered in 2013 involve governance changes, the establishment of hospital groups, reforms of the private health insurance market, establishment of a health and well-being framework and the development of a money-follows-the-patient funding model.  Newly enacted legislation underpins a permanent risk equalisation scheme which commenced from 1 January 2013.  The scheme protects our system of community rating, whereby older and sicker people can buy health insurance for the same price as younger and healthier customers.</p><p>  Despite significant challenges, especially in scheduled care - primarily, the extended flu season, leading to increased admissions - the implementation of programmes by the special delivery unit resulted in significant progress in improving hospital access targets.  By December 2012 there were 20,352 fewer patients on trolleys, with a reduction of 23.6% since 2011; 3,620 fewer adults waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day surgery, a reduction of 98% since 2011; 1,670 fewer children waiting over 20 weeks, a reduction of 95% since 2011; and 4,554 fewer patients waiting over 13 weeks for routine endoscopy procedures, a reduction of 99% since 2011.  There has been some rebound because of the extraordinary and prolonged winter.  That has seen not so much an increase in attendance at accident and emergency departments but rather an increase in admission rates, up to 17% among the older person demographic.  These people were really sick, as intensive care units were full, with all ventilators in use.  This was not an experience that was unique to the Republic of Ireland, as it was also evident in the North and in Manchester in the north of England.  In order to address this, an allocation of &euro;18 million has been approved by the Department and the HSE to create an intervention fund to aid hospitals in reaching Government targets in scheduled and unscheduled care.  The priority is to unblock access and improve the flow of patients through the health system.  The Department of Health is preparing a White Paper on universal health insurance, UHI, which will set out details of the UHI model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.  A preliminary document on UHI was published last February, setting out progress to date and the major tasks and projects that stand to be addressed throughout 2013 and beyond.</p><p>  A hospital financing sub-group, established under the auspices of the UHI implementation group, has developed policy proposals on the money-follows-the-patient model.  Stakeholder consultation will now be undertaken, followed by the implementation of money-follows-the-patient shadow funding during 2013 in advance of phased implementation of the new arrangements from 2014.  The objectives of the new funding model are to achieve a fairer system of resource allocation, drive efficiency in the provision of high-quality hospital services, increase transparency in the provision of hospital services, and ultimately support the move to an equitable single-tier system.</p><p>  Earlier this month I announced a reorganisation of public hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups that will deliver improved outcomes for patients.  This Government decision was informed by two reports, The Establishment of Hospital Groups as a Transition to Independent Hospital Trusts, or the Higgins report, and The Framework for Development - Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals.  The establishment of hospital groups signals a fundamental modernisation of our health system organisation in line with best international practice.</p> <p>The new hospital groups, each with its own governance and management, have been designed to provide the optimum configuration for hospitals to deliver high quality, safe patient care which is cost effective and guarantees better outcomes for patients.  I take this opportunity to thank Professor John Higgins again for all the work he did.  I also thank the group that supported him.  The framework for hospitals outlines the need for smaller and larger hospitals to operate together, which is intrinsically linked to the formation of sustainable groups.  Better co-operation between hospitals will help to maximise the amount of care delivered locally.  Hospital groups will secure the future of our smaller hospitals.  When the new groups are established, services can be exchanged between sites.  This will result in the maintenance of activity in smaller hospitals and will allow them to focus on the provision of care that is safe and appropriate.</p><p> Work on the roll-out of hospital groups will begin immediately and will be overseen by a national strategic advisory group and driven by the HSE.  Following a rigorous evaluation of each group to ensure it is fit for purpose to function as a hospital trust, legislation will be put in place in 2015 to enable independent hospital trusts to be established, taking account of any changes to groups which may emerge from the review process.</p><p> I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and he will expand on this, has successfully put the drug reference pricing legislation through the D&aacute;il.  It completed its passage yesterday.</p><p> Equally, I wish to mention the Croke Park II agreement.  I will not speak in great detail but it is obviously important that a ballot by health care workers is to take place regarding new arrangements that will yield real savings and, we hope, more services for patients.  Mr. Barry O'Brien is present and he will address that in a fuller fashion.  However, I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Barry O'Brien, Frances Spillane and Fergal Goodman, who were the health team that attended those negotiations on our behalf, on doing such a good job.</p><p> Turning to legislation, the legislation to abolish the HSE is complex but will be done sequentially.  As a transitional measure, the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 abolishes the current board and chief executive officer structure and provides for the establishment of a new governance structure.  The Bill is intended to bring greater focus on service delivery and ensure more accountability to the Minister for Health.  The national directors will be responsible at national level for the delivery of services in their relevant service areas, such as hospitals, primary care, mental health, social care and health and well-being.  They will lead the development of national service plans associated with their sector, manage performance and, in time, develop strategic commissioning frameworks for their areas, as appropriate.  The chief financial officer will be accountable for the financial management and performance and for ensuring that the HSE operates within its annual allocation as well as achieving the stipulated income targets.  Indeed, due to calendar scheduling, we were due to take that Bill today but could not because this committee was meeting.  It has been put back to later in June.</p><p> The preparations are proceeding for the development of the new national children's hospital on the campus of St. James's Hospital.  New governance arrangements have been put in place to advance the new phase of the project.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has been restructured to focus on the core functions of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  A strategic advisory group is being established to provide external advice and expertise to the project.  This project will be progressed as speedily as possible, recognising the urgency and priority attached to it together with its scale and complexity.</p><p> It is important to reflect on certain key trends within the health sector.  Given the continuing severe economic constraints facing the country, increasing numbers of the population are eligible for medical cards and decreasing numbers are opting for private health insurance.  Key challenges will be to continue to ensure that resources secured are carefully and appropriately targeted to deliver more efficient and effective ways of providing services.  This can be seen in the acute hospital sector where a gradual decline in inpatient admissions is being more than offset by a rapid rise in day cases.  Further improved treatment models are leading to better outcomes, as evidenced by continuing improvements in cancer survival.  In the case of stroke, the new stroke programme has resulted in saving one life every week and pre-empting the need for three people per week to go into long-term care.</p><p> Over the last decade Ireland has achieved a rapid improvement in life expectancy, increasing from nearly one year below the EU average to just above it.  Much of this increase is due to significant reductions in major causes of death, such as circulatory system disease.  The number of people in older age groups is beginning to increase significantly.  Approximately 20,000 more people are being added to the over 65 year old age group each year.  The numbers will double in the next 25 years to over 1 million people, with the largest proportional increase in the over 85 year old category.  This is good news.  However, it will have implications for our health service.</p><p> In the area of health determinants, lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, obesity and lack of exercise continue to be issues which have the potential to jeopardise many of the health gains achieved in recent years.  The type and volume of services that must be delivered by the HSE across all health areas and through a variety of demand-led schemes and preventative services will increase in cost and complexity in tandem with the factors that affect the health of the population and the performance of the health system.</p><p> Healthy Ireland, a new Government framework for action to improve the health and well-being of people living in Ireland over the coming generation, was launched in March 2013.  This framework sets out a broad range of actions that will be undertaken by Government Departments, public sector organisations, businesses, communities and individuals to improve health and well-being and reduce the risks posed to future generations.  Healthy Ireland has been developed in response to rising levels of chronic illness, lifestyle trends that threaten health and persistent health inequalities.  The framework is based on evidence and experience from around the world which shows that in order to create positive change in population health and well-being a whole of government approach and the involvement of local communities as well as all of society are required.  The Department of Health will be leading across the Government on this national agenda.</p><p> I will bring regular progress reports to the Cabinet committee on social policy and I will also keep the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children fully informed.  The Cabinet committee on social policy will oversee progress on Healthy Ireland and provide leadership and accountability for its implementation.  Implementation of the framework's 64 actions will be subject to rigorous planning, reporting and evaluation.  Healthy Ireland is designed to bring about real, measurable change and is based on an understanding of the determinants of health and well-being in a person's life - economic status, education, housing, transport and their physical environment.  It is about each individual sector helping to improve health and well-being, multiplying all efforts and delivering better results.  It will result in people living in Ireland being supported to make healthier choices in their daily lives in health promotion and sustainable environments.</p><p> The core of everything we are doing is evidence-based to improve outcomes for patients.  As long as that remains to the fore of our minds in all we do I believe we will do right by patients.  If we veer from that, we will lose our way.  I and my ministerial colleagues will be happy to answer the committee's questions on these and other issues.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister's officials for their courtesy to our committee.  We have received apologies from Deputies Mary Mitchell O'Connor, Regina Doherty, Ciara Conway and Peter Fitzpatrick.  I invite the Ministers of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch and Deputy Alex White, to feel free to intervene and make a contribution should they wish.</p><p>  On the scheduling issue, I apologise to the Minister and to the Opposition spokespeople.  It is unfortunate there is a scheduling clash between our committee meetings and the Department of Health's Bills in the D&aacute;il on a Thursday.  I propose that we write to the Chief Whip again to inform him that on a Thursday morning this committee deals with health and children issues at 9.30 a.m. and that any scheduling of Bills dealing with health and children should be for a Tuesday and a Wednesday.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I call Dr. Tony O'Brien, director general designate of the HSE.  I thank his staff and officials for their courtesy to all Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and I thank the staff who work on the front line for their tremendous work in challenging times.  It is important to put that in context when one hears unfair criticism of people who work in the health sector.  The people who work in our hospitals, in the front-line services and, indeed, people who work in back offices and are not seen, are working in challenging times.  I thank them for that.  I also thank those who engaged in the labour relations process last week.  I thank Mr. Barry O'Brien and the unions for engaging and for putting our health system at the core of what we are doing.  I call Dr. Tony O'Brien.</p></speech>

The committee requested information and replies on a number of specific issues prior to the meeting and it will have received a written response to these issues from the HSE and the Department of Health together with briefing material on the HSE March performance management report, the April Vote return, medical cards and NCHDs.</p><p>  I would like to update the committee on a number of key issues, the first being service plan activity.  At the end of March, there were 100,740 emergency admissions in the acute system which is 3,518, or 3.6%, higher compared to the equivalent period in 2012.  Some 62.6% of all attendances at emergency departments were discharged or admitted within six hours and 77.5% within nine hours.  Up the end of March, 41,050 elective inpatients admissions and 202,425 day case procedures were provided - a total of 243,475 compared with 247,682 for the same period in 2012 which represents a 1.7% downward variance.  </p><p>  Some 90.7% of all adults on the elective waiting lists are waiting less than eight months and it is intended that no adult would be waiting for more than eight months for an elective procedure by the end of this year.  Some 85.1% of all children on the elective waiting list are waiting less than 20 weeks.  Again, it is intended that no child will wait more than 20 weeks for an elective procedure by year end.  </p><p>  The number of people covered by medical cards by the end of March was 1,864,320, an increase of 6% on the same time last year.  The number with GP visit cards was 128,589, an increase of 1.7% on the same time last year.  Some 96% of properly and fully completed medical card applications have been processed within the 15-day turnaround time, which is ahead of the service plan target of 90%.</p><p>  Turning to finance, the HSE is reporting a year to date gross deficit of &euro;26.7 million to the end of March 2013.  In Vote terms, the largely cash based Government accounting basis, to the end of April, there was a &euro;5 million surplus on net current Vote expenditure which obviously is quite a different picture to this time last year.  Based on the first quarter data, the HSE is not flagging any new concerns or risks beyond those which were clearly set out in the national service plan for this year, as approved by the Minister on 9 January, and within the regional and hospital group service plans, which were published in February.  These risks remain and principally include the overall scale of savings required in PCRS at &euro;353 million.  First quarter performance against cost saving plans in this area has been very positive but there will be a need for us to be vigilant on this and to develop contingency measures in the event that they are needed to address potential shortfalls which would otherwise occur.  These contingencies are currently being scoped.  </p><p>  We have discussed the Croke Park agreement before and we have a reliance on Croke Park II for &euro;150 million.  The need for validation of the budget reduction assigned to the HSE once there is a definitive outcome to the Croke Park II process to which it relates remains.  It is also important to note that anything which would jeopardise the current flexibility which is available under Croke Park I would create risks across most of the areas of cost saving set out in the service plan.</p><p>  In terms of private health insurance income, both the &euro;104 million accelerated income and the &euro;60 million assigned in the service plan against new legislation, the plan references the need for us to work closely with our colleagues in the Department to ensure the accelerated income does not reverse in 2013 coupled with ensuring that the new private income legislation is enacted by July.  The HSE's plan addressed &euro;20 million of accelerated income <i>via</i> improvements in our collection performance and that is being progressed.  There is current ongoing engagement at senior level in regard to the proposed legislation and the balance of the accelerated income.  </p><p>  The general scale of the overall challenge within the remainder of our community and, in particular, hospital services is also an issue.  The rebalancing of hospital budgets in 2013 has ensured that hospitals have been given budgets which are related more closely to their costs in 2012.  However, as indicated in the plan, it has not been possible to provide for the full amount of 2012 costs and hospitals are, therefore, required to safely deliver cost savings of an average 3.5% in addition to further cost savings to offset any emerging or additional cost pressures in 2013 and that is being closely monitored.  </p><p>  However, it is clear that the end of March deficit of &euro;27 million, in the absence of significant delivery on our cost containment measures and the expected additional control activities, could give rise to a significant level of deficit to year end.  The message is that while things are improving, we need to remain constantly vigilant.</p><p>  Initial control actions in regard to the risks outlined above have been commenced.  On the scale of the risk and challenge in achieving financial break even by year end remains significant and will increase in the unlikely event there is an absence of continued and improved flexibility under the Croke Park agreement. </p><p>  In terms of the fair deal scheme during the months of March and April, the hospital system experienced increased wait times and congestion in emergency departments, mainly due to a significant increase respiratory illness among older patients and an extended outbreak of influenza which came later in the season than would be typical.  In the interest of patient safety and quality of care, we took a decision in March to release an additional 400 fair deal beds to assist with the hospital pressures.  Usually, 120 long-term care beds are released on a weekly basis for the whole country.  </p><p>  Sunday counts of emergency department trolleys provide a strong indication of the pressures in emergency care likely to be experienced the following week and, therefore, are used as a point in time sentinel, as it were, to make intervention decisions.  On Sunday, 14 April, the number of patients awaiting admission in our emergency departments at the 8 p.m. count was so high at 243 that there was significant concern for the safety and quality of care of our patients in emergency departments.  Given this situation, it was deemed necessary to immediately move to temporarily pause the normal chronological fair deal placement process and to direct the prioritisation of long-term care beds for qualifying patients in the six Dublin academic teaching hospitals and Cork University Hospital, the hospitals which had the highest number of patients waiting for long-term care at that point.  With effect from 9 May, we have reverted to the normal chronological placement in respect of 100 of the 120 fair deals beds released on a weekly basis and full chronological placement will resume on 30 May - in other words relating to the full 120 on a weekly basis.</p><p>  I will turn briefly to the ambulance service.  Members will be aware of the recent tragic death of Vakaris Martinaitis in Midleton, County Cork.  On behalf of the HSE, I would like to reiterate and extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Vakaris on their very sad loss.  On Friday, 10 May, following a preliminary examination of the facts surrounding this tragic accident, the medical director of the national ambulance service, in line with the HSE incident management policy, commissioned a formal incident review into the manner in which the 999 call received from Midleton, County Cork, at 2 p.m. on Monday, 6 May was managed.  The make-up of the review team includes experts in pre-hospital emergency care and primary care from both Ireland and the UK, namely, Mr. David McManus, medical director of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, who is the chairperson, Ms Tracey Barron, clinical studies officer at the International Academy of Emergency Dispatch in the UK, Mr. Pat Mooney, the control manager of the national ambulance service in north Leinster, Dr. Mel Bates, medical director, GP out-of-hours service, north Dublin, and Ms Deirdre O'Keeffe, quality and safety directorate, who will support the investigation process.</p><p>  The review team and the terms of reference have been agreed and NAS representative will liaise with the family on behalf of the review team to keep them informed of progress and ensure they are provided with ongoing support.  This formal review, which will be concluded as expeditiously as possible, will fully establish all the facts surrounding the management of this emergency call, including why an available emergency ambulance was initially assigned to the call and then stood down as well as the level of information available to ambulance control about the patient's injuries.</p><p>  Turning to the medicines management programme recently established by the HSE as a first step to increasing quality access and value in medicines management, the programme has identified preferred drugs for prescribers when prescribing proton pump inhibitors, PPIs, and statins, cholesterol lowering medication for patients.  This is the first time the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimate &euro;15 million for the taxpayer this year.  PPIs and statins account for up to 20% of the HSE's drugs budget.</p> <p>By switching existing patients to the preferred drug, and by prescribing these drugs for new patients, significant savings can be achieved.  Although the initiative was launched only in mid-April, there was positive feedback from prescribers.</p><p> The Public Appointments Service, on behalf of the HSE, has recently concluded a recruitment process to complete the new HSE directorate and leadership team.  The process leads to a revised HSE management structure, planned in conjunction with a new governance arrangement provided for in the Health Service Executive Governance Bill 2012.  Five new posts have been established following a confined Public Appointments Service competition which commenced earlier this year.  The following senior health managers have been appointed to the five posts: Mr. Ian Carter, acute hospitals; Mr. John Hennessy, primary care; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, director of finance to mental health; Mr. Pat Healy, social care; and Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, health and well-being.  They will take up the new posts when the Government's legislation is enacted.  The five directors are now directors designate and will participate in the process of designing new structures prior to taking up the posts.  In addition, Mr. Thomas Byrne will join the senior management team as chief finance officer, following an open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  He takes up his post on Monday, 27 May.  The current director of integrated services, Ms Laverne McGuinness, takes up the post of chief operating officer and will assist in safely managing our system through this period of transition.  Mr. Liam Woods has taken up the post of national director of shared services.  These changes are an important step in the reshaping of the health service and an important part of the journey towards the post HSE era.  The make-up of the new team is indicative of the importance of clinical pathways, patient and client care and outcomes to the process of reform in the health service.  I and my colleagues are very happy to respond to any questions.</p></speech>

On behalf of committee members, I extend our sympathy to the Martinaitis family on the tragic death of Vakaris and we hope the family will receive answers to its questions.</p><p>  I congratulate the five senior managers on their appointments.  I congratulate Mr. Stephen Mulvany in particular as it is very good that mental health is included.  The committee has always made that point and I commend Mr. O'Brien on that.  I ask Mr. Barry O'Brien and Ms Laverne McGuinness to make some remarks on the NCHD report briefing document.  This was a major issue we discussed at the committee and we were concerned about it.</p></speech>

It highlights the fact that the HSE recruits approximately 15% of the NCHDs, with all others part of the training programmes.  As of 14 May, the vast majority of NCHD posts - more than 90% - are filled normally.  We are satisfied that where staffing issues exist, there remain sufficient numbers of agency staff to meet the service needs.  In the context of training posts being filled, in the main, service posts that remain unfilled will be met by doctors provided by an agency.  We are involved with the postgraduate training bodies and we manage the central recruitment of applications.  We advise local hospitals that they can proceed.  The committee has previously raised the issue, particularly Senator Colm Burke, with regard to local capacity to recruit.  Local recruitment fills approximately 70% of service posts, so that capacity continues to exist.  A number of initiatives are ongoing to ensure we have the required number of NCHDs.  The specific question of Senator Colm Burke is answered in respect of contractual arrangements.  I reassure the committee that we are taking the necessary steps.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300006#F00500"><p>I welcome the presentations.  At the outset, I congratulate the people who have been appointed to the positions of directors, even though in my contribution during the debate on legislation I said it should have been an open competition.  I am definite the successful candidates would have come through the process anyway.  I wish them well in their positions, which will be quite challenging.</p><p>  The following point struck me when Mr. Tony O'Brien was speaking about patient safety on 14 April.  We know that seasonal factors cause pressures and pinches in accident and emergency units and admissions to hospitals.  It is very alarming when another process must kick into gear because of patient safety to address difficulties in getting people to hospital.  I refer to the change in the designation of beds under the Fair Deal scheme.  There are major concerns that the Fair Deal system and the provision of beds for people in long-stay facilities is under major pressure and stress.  It must be dealt with in the short term and the medium term.  Looking at the demographic profile and the ageing population, it will be a major challenge in the years ahead.  We are now in a delicate position in which accident and emergency units are dependent on another section giving up its bed designations, which are for vulnerable people, elderly people and those in the later stages of life.  They are being shifted sideways for a period until the pressure is off the accident and emergency unit.</p><p>  Comparing the profile of waiting lists by month and year makes the reduction seem successful.  However, looking at December to April, it is clear that the pressure is significant in terms of admissions and treating patients in hospitals.  It is a worrying development and the trends are not improving.  From December 2012 to April 2013, in every single category, there was an increase in waiting lists.  We can take account of seasonal factors such as influenza, but the bottom line is that the trend is beginning to go the wrong way.  Major advances were made last year, which I am not disputing, but the alarm bells should be ringing in the HSE and the Department of Health in dealing with this worrying and continuing trend.  I know &euro;80 million extra has been put into the special delivery unit to try to deal with it but the fundamentals are very worrying.  Perhaps this point can be discussed and elaborated on with regard to what can be done at this early stage of the year to address it.</p><p>  With regard to the broader debate on the health service and funding, we have had the changes in the development of hospital groupings and the transition to trusts.  We talk about free GP care, on which the Minister of State, Deputy White, will bring forward proposals in the next couple of weeks.  We are still waiting to discuss how to fund this.  While the universal health insurance model will be adopted, we are still waiting more than two years for the White Paper.  There is increasing concern that the private health insurance market in the country is in a state of collapse.  That will be an underpinning factor in any universal health insurance model.  Mr. Colm McCarthy recently published a report on the pressures on private health insurance and we have also been raising the point consistently.  There seems to be a view in the Department of Health that the VHI is dictating Government policy on private health insurance.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong.  The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, has made recommendations that have been either summarily dismissed or ignored and certainly not implemented.  How long more can we sustain talking about hospital groups, hospital trusts, funding reform and governance structure changes when the basic fundamental that will underpin all of this is universal health insurance?  The universal health insurance model proposed by the Minister is based on private health insurance companies providing a suite of care for citizens and competing with hospital trusts to do so.  There is no point in beating around the bush; it is in crisis.  We need the publication of the White Paper and a mature debate on the private health insurance market and how we will fund the system we are all talking about.</p> <p>In the D&aacute;il many other Members and I call for more medical cards, swifter action in accident and emergency departments and so forth.  However, the one fundamental issue not being discussed, because we have no White Paper, is universal health insurance and how it will be funded.  This issue is of particular concern because of the fact that the private health insurance market is in crisis and it is not only me who is saying this.  It is a simple fact.  The statistics and figures show this clearly in terms of the numbers reducing their premium payments and cover and the numbers who have left the private health insurance market entirely.  That profile is increasing, as opposed to decreasing.  We talk about stabilisation in the economy and the unemployment figures, but there is no stabilisation in the numbers leaving the private health insurance market.  That will have an enormous impact in placing further pressure on the public hospital system prior to implementation of any universal health insurance model.</p><p> On the issue of VHI, a recent report states the more the cost of private health insurance cover increases, the bigger the hole in the company's balance sheet and because of the capital and solvency ratio requirements, that hole will have to be filled by the taxpayer at some stage in the near future.  This issue must be addressed as soon as possible.  As premiums go up, the balance sheet of VHI deteriorates and it will be up to the taxpayer to invest in the company, regardless of what model of universal health insurance is eventually adopted.</p></speech>

The issue in east Cork is a very emotive one and I do not want to add to anyone's anguish, as I also know an investigation is ongoing.  However, there is genuine concern in communities all over the country about ambulance cover.  There is no point in not saying this and I am not just raising the issue because of the tragedies in east Cork where there have been two tragedies and there is concern about the despatching of ambulances.  In the context of hospital trusts or groupings, the issue of ambulance cover will have to be examined.  People will need to be given comfort because 24 hour cover is being taken away from some hospitals.  There is genuine concern in communities, particularly in peripheral and rural areas, about ambulance cover and I ask the HSE to take it on board.</p><p>  On the issue of medical cards, there was an announcement in the budget that 40,000 cards would be withdrawn from circulation.  I must draw attention to the fact that the facility for people to qualify for a medical card on medical grounds is being rapidly withdrawn.  There is almost no one qualifying for a medical card on such grounds.  I am meeting people who find themselves in this situation on a daily basis and I am sure other Members can say the same.  The stated policy, statistics and figures are not reflecting what is happening.  Let me give two examples.  I met a woman recently who had had a double mastectomy and had been refused a medical card on medical grounds.  I also met a person with colon cancer who had been refused on the same grounds.  There is a problem in this regard which the Minister must address.  I understand the country is under financial pressure, but it is now almost impossible for people to qualify for a medical card on medical grounds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300007#G00700"><p>I will table supplementary questions on the three priority issues I raised, namely, questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 in the pack, dealing with dental, mental health and audiology services.  I also wish to make reference to the non-consultant hospital doctor recruitment process.</p><p>  Regarding question No.7 and what I believe to be a crisis in dental treatment services, it is very disappointing that in the reply I received to the aforementioned question there is not a single word of acknowledgment that there is any difficulty in dental treatment services, let alone a crisis.  It must be acknowledged that we saw advances in dental health and dental treatment services in the early 2000s when there was a marked improvement in services.  However, these improvements have been steadily eroded by cutbacks.  The Irish Dental Association reports a rapid reversal.  I cite from its recent commentary in this regard: &quot;We do not believe the cuts to dental care make sense and will ultimately cost the State more in the long term&quot;.  How does the Minister respond to the position taken by the Irish Dental Association?  We are told that primary care is crucial and cost effective.  If so, will the Minister restore the dental treatments previously available to PRSI patients and medical card holders?  When one looks at the range of services previously available to these groups, it is alarming to see what has actually been cut.  </p><p>  On mental health services, I refer to an article published in <i>The Irish Times </i>last Friday in which the mental health reform group stated that in 2013 mental health services were still staffed at 24% below the level recommended in A Vision for Change.  That is very alarming.  I commend the group for its work.  </p><p>  In the context of the commitment to an investment of &euro;35 million last year and this year, I have no hesitation in acknowledging progress in the filling of the promised 414 additional posts.  It is very welcome.  However, these posts were promised in 2012, with further posts promised to be filled this year.  What is the net position in this regard?  The reply from the Minister contains a tabular outline of the recruitment of the promised 414 additional staff.  However, in the same period, staff have left the service through retirement and for other reasons.  I want to know what is the net position, taking into account those who have left the service.  According to the HSE's health service personnel census in December 2012, mental health service staffing levels dropped by 12.1% between 2009 and 2012.  I welcome the appointment of a new national director of mental health and wish Mr. Stephen Mulvany well in his new role.</p><p>  Regarding audiology services, I wish to focus on the bilateral cochlear implant service which we still do not enjoy in this jurisdiction.  I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, yesterday met representatives of parents coping with children with severe hearing challenges.  The introduction at Beaumont Hospital of the bilateral cochlear implant programme is absolutely essential.  When is it expected that the expert report, sought from Professor Gerry O'Donoghue of the University of Nottingham, will be available?  When will the Department be in a position to agree to the business plan?  Will the Minister commit today to the provision of the required funding?  I know that initially it will cost a little more because there will be a backlog to address in terms of those who will require sequential introduction of their entitlement to a second implant.  Of course, we will then want to see work commencing on the bilateral approach in terms of the introduction of both implants at the same time.  There is an estimated additional initial outlay of some &euro;7 million.  Will the Minister indicate that it is his intention to introduce the programme in the context of the budgetary provision for 2014?  I appeal to him to do this.  I have met many of the parents and some of the children affected and it is tragic that their lives are being impaired because their hearing issues are not being fulled addressed, something children in other jurisdictions enjoy.</p><p>  On the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors, I have heard the reply from Mr. O'Brien, but I wish to know what the position will be in July.  I raised this issue at the committee some months ago, at which point I was reflecting concerns already expressed by a number of hospitals.</p> <p>Is he in a position to tell us what the shortfall will be?  How will this affect patient care?  I was concerned that the five-page report that we received in addition to the replies did not mention patient care once across the five pages.  There are hospitals in which the predicted deficit of NCHD manpower for July will be in the region of 20% to 40%, not 2% as indicated in the response.  Maintenance of services in the worst-affected hospitals will be extremely difficult and there is a real and genuine fear among management and lead clinicians in some hospital sites that some services will be impossible to sustain and will, at least for a period, cease.</p><p> The HSE centralised applications process does not have the confidence of all hospitals across this jurisdiction.  This is a simple fact.  The late indiction that local recruitment could get under way, something that had been forbidden up to sometime in the middle of last month, April 2013, was much too late.  Remember the doctors who were recruited from India and Pakistan in 2011, when we introduced the emergency legislation; the great majority were not in a position to take up their posts until the month of December, some five months after the shortfall presented.  We could be looking at a similar situation, although perhaps not as catastrophic in terms of scale and numbers, but most certainly a number of hospitals, particularly those that do not enjoy the allocation of trainees, experience traditional recruitment challenges.  Hospitals such as those in Drogheda and Letterkenny are excluded from the allocation of trainees by the training bodies, which is leaving them at a distinct disadvantage.</p><p> Will the Minister address the scandalous issue of the training posts in private hospitals?  Will he ensure that large regional hospitals receive a minimum?  The regional designation is not a necessity.  They are performing the role of a major general facility and have a minimum of 50% trainees, given that 80% of all NCHDs in the country are now said to be in training programmes.</p><p> Will the Minister undertake to publish the service level agreements so there is an opportunity for public scrutiny?  The members of this committee will have sight of them and will have a understanding of what is involved.</p></speech>

I welcome also the publication of the hospital group's report last week and I wish to raise a number of questions on it.  What is the timescale for the appointment of the chairman of the board in each case?  Does the Minister have the dates for the appointment of board members?  Will he ensure there is geographical as well as specialist representation on the boards of these groupings?  It will be vital to create trust for the boards to operate across the geographical areas of these hospital groups.  It would be possible for geographical and specialist representation to dovetail and I hope the Minister will confirm that he will bear this in mind and make appointments on that basis.</p><p>  The Minister gave a briefing last Tuesday week, but after he left, unfortunately, Professor Higgins was very strong on the question of consultation with stakeholders on this process, including consultation with local communities.  This will play an important role in the success of these hospital groups and trusts.  Will the Minister outline his position on consultation? </p><p>  I acknowledge the significant pressures on the fair deal scheme.  Mr. O'Brien referred to the recent difficulties.  There is a perception of geographical discrimination against applicants outside Dublin and Cork, who are effectively denied access to this scheme for some time.  I request an assurance that the scheme is run on a fair basis across the country and that applicants outside Dublin and Cork are not disadvantaged.</p><p>  The issue of outpatient waiting lists was not covered in any of the presentations, but this is an area that is giving rise to major difficulties, particularly in orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat specialties.  There are really long waiting lists for outpatient clinics in regional hospitals, particularly for the initial outpatient appointment.  Will the Minister outline the current position and the proposals to deal with the difficulties?</p><p>  There are 350 children with one cochlear implant who require a second implant.  It is hoped that all newborns will get simultaneous implants.  Will the Minister confirm that he will make &euro;7 million available to Beaumont Hospital to deal with the backlog in this area?  It is very upsetting for parents and the children involved.</p><p>  Will the Minister give an update on the proposed new children's hospital?  Are there indicative construction, commencement and completion dates?</p><p>  I agree with the point made by Deputy Kelleher on medical cards.  I am sure that all Deputies and Senators are aware of the difficulties in respect of medical cards being granted on medical grounds.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to have a medical card granted on medical grounds.  This seems to be feeding into the current large number of reviews to be carried out.  It is indicated in the review covering letter that the review is by random selection, but it appears to me that those in the 65 to 69 age group are being targeted.  This is a group of whom many are marginally over the income limit because of occupational pensions, in some cases very small occupational pensions, but who were granted medical cards on medical grounds for long periods.  Many hold cards that are in date up to 2020.</p><p>  I have had numerous inquiries of late from people who have been requested to provide transport for their relatives.</p> <p>The relatives of patients who are normally transferred by ambulance, and who actually require ambulance transportation, are now being asked to transfer those patients to regional and Dublin-based hospitals, in particular.</p></speech>

Is there any chance we could get a list of who they are and what kind of expertise they have?  Do they have any plans to meet local public representatives, including Deputies and councillors?  The only briefing we have received on the hospital so far was from the CEO of St. James's Hospital, who has met us twice.  I would like to make the Minister aware that last night, I received a political newsletter through my door that featured a photograph of the CEO of the hospital with public representatives from a certain party.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300009#J00900"><p>I am not going to name them.  A footnote mentioned that the assistance of the public representatives in question in the hospital's submission for the national paediatric and maternity hospital was much appreciated.  The person who circulated the newsletter claims to have made the case for St. James's Hospital to decision makers, Ministers and the media.  My understanding was that there was to be no lobbying from any representatives regarding the development of the national paediatric hospital.  I would like an answer in this regard.  It is very offensive that a political party has hijacked the hospital.</p><p>  The committee has been told today that it is hoped to secure planning permission for the hospital by 2014.  Does that mean we have a commencement date?  We will be finished by 2018 or before then?  Has a budget been agreed for bringing the project to the planning stage?</p><p>  I would also like to ask about the Hollybrook long-term care unit in Inchicore.  I feel like I am on a rollercoaster in a theme park at this stage.  I received replies regarding this matter in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  According to the most recent reply I received, on 23 April last, a consultation process will last six months up to the end of November 2013.  Hollybrook is a beautiful place, but it is still sitting there and nobody is able to avail of it.  Most of the people who were on my list three years ago have since died.  They have all passed away, God love them.  Can the Minister confirm that Hollybrook will be run by a public private partnership?  It is now rumoured that it will be used as a transition place for patients from the local national hospital who are waiting for long-term care under the fair deal.  I have to say I would be concerned about that.  These beds were not supposed to be transition beds.  They were supposed to be new beds for people in the community.  Some 18% of them were to be given to local people.  I do not believe this facility was developed to provide transition beds.  I would like to know whether any agency staff will be employed if that happens.</p><p>  I will move on to my last question.</p></speech>

I understand there are 16 general ICU beds, four HDU beds and three new HDU beds in St. James's Hospital.  In line with the hospital's complement, it should have another four ICU beds.  If I have counted correctly, there would be 27 beds in total.  How does our national hospital compare with hospitals in Northern Ireland and England when it comes to ICU and HDU beds?  I am constantly being lobbied by people regarding the intensive care and high dependency facilities in that hospital.  I have been told of operations that could not be done because no ICU beds were available.  I would like an answer to the question I asked about the individual in the hospital who has over-stepped the mark by allowing his or her photograph to be put on a political leaflet.</p></speech>

I will touch on the questions that are appropriate to me and pass the other questions on.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about the temporary suspension of the fair deal scheme.  Mr. Tony O'Brien went into that in some detail, in fairness.  I would like to comment on it in the overall context of the Deputy's concern that the trend is going in the wrong direction and his comments about the pressure on our emergency departments from December to April.  The special delivery unit, which has received tremendous co-operation from the clinical programmes, has been successful.  I am pleased that Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, who is leading those programmes, is here today.  There have been tremendous savings in bed days.  Over 120,000 bed days have been saved since we started.  Substantial moneys have been saved.  I reiterate that the money we save in the primary care reimbursement service, elsewhere in the hospital system or in any other part of the health service, goes back to making sure more patients are seen more quickly.</p><p>  I would like to touch on what was said about increased pressure in December.  The special delivery unit, the clinical programmes and the front-line staff have managed to create a new flexibility within the health service that allows us to deal with the surges and the waxing and waning of demand that we know is there.  When we are under pressure in our emergency departments, of course elective surgery slows down to allow for the admissions that need to come in.  These are the most acutely ill people in our society and they need urgent care.  As the director general designate, Mr. Tony O'Brien, has said, it was reaching the stage where we felt patient safety was being compromised.  As I said at the outset, outcomes for patients and patient safety are our absolute priority.  We are very keen to stay within our budget, but we will always put patient safety first.</p><p>  I will address some particular aspects of this issue.  The suspension of the normal chronological order allowed for people who were in the delayed discharge category to be moved to long-term care from the hospitals.  It is not just a question of the patient in the community waiting on a bed and the patient in the hospital waiting on a bed.  There is a third patient involved here, namely, the critically ill patient, often an older person, who is lying on a trolley in the emergency department.  We know that the outcomes for patients who are left in that scenario are far worse than the outcomes for patients on hospital beds in wards, even if there are more people in those wards than would normally be the case.  That is why this flexibility was used to suspend some elective surgery.  It allowed for acute admissions to take place and it enabled a greater emphasis to be put on outpatients.  We will catch up on our elective surgery as the year progresses.  The demand is easing.  It can be seen that trolley counts are much lower than they were earlier in the year.  We always get a rebound in January, February and March after the hyperactivity associated with the end of the year.  We plan for that.  I am quite happy that we have the wherewithal and the resources within the intervention fund to deal with those targets and waiting times in a focused fashion.  The numbers of people who are waiting for forms of surgery and procedures that would make huge difference to their quality of life are not targets.  I think I have covered what the Deputy said about the trend going in the wrong direction.  It is coming back now and we are heading in the other direction.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher also spoke about how to fund universal health insurance.  Dr. Fergal Lynch will speak about that in more detail.  The Deputy argued that we are basing our approach to universal health insurance on private health insurance.  That is not the case.  It is made clear in the programme for Government that the VHI will be kept as a public option.  There is no doubt that more people have opted out of private health insurance.  Part of that might relate to increased premiums.  Much of is relates to the fact that 450,000 people are unemployed and the country is in the state it is in.  I do not intend to trade political brickbats with the Deputy about why that is the case.  We know the reasons.  The high level of unemployment is one of the reasons for the increase in the number of people on medical cards.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, will deal with the issues raised around medical card eligibility.  The bottom line and the inescapable fact is that there are more people with medical cards now than at any time in the history of the State.  There will always be hard cases.</p></speech>

All of us know from our clinics and offices that people are concerned that health insurance does not seem to be coming down.  It is going up.</p> <p>There are now more health insurance plans than one has fingers and toes.  While it is necessary to find the correct plan, people are genuinely concerned about the cost and number of plans and would like them to be more user friendly, convenient and affordable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300010#K00200"><p>As I have stated on a number of occasions, it is unacceptable that the cost of private health insurance continues to increase.  It is also unacceptable that the number of health insurance claims increased by 14% in 2012, given that the number of people insured declined last year.  There is no proper audit of the sector.  For example, there is no clinical audit, in other words, treating physicians are not challenged to explain the reason procedures have been carried out.  This is a major gap, one that I have insisted VHI, as the largest insurance provider, address.  The company may have only 57% of the market, but it is responsible for 80% of the money paid out on claims.</p><p>  Another issue that must be addressed is the practice of paying the same amount for procedures that may have attracted a large fee previously because they took two hours to complete but now take 20 minutes as a result of advances in technology.  Health insurers must also shift from paying <i>per diem </i>charges to paying per procedure.  I have raised this issue in my Department as it would allow those hospitals that are efficient, perform day procedures and have reduced numbers of readmissions to thrive.  I have informed the joint committee previously of a case in which I was approached by a man whose MRI scans had cost VHI more than &euro;6,000.  He travelled from the country to Dublin on a Sunday to have an MRI scan done on the Monday, only to be told that it would be postponed until the following Wednesday because of an emergency.  He was told not to go home and remained in hospital throughout.  Such farcical practices must stop.  Much work remains to be done and I am not satisfied that progress is being made quickly enough.  I have had numerous meetings with VHI and I am putting the company under the cosh.  The Department will engage in further actions to address VHI's costs in the near future. </p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will address the issues raised concerning dentistry, while the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will address mental health services and cochlear implants.  I assure members that the budget for next year includes funding to enable Beaumont Hospital to do work on cochlear implants.  The hospital must perform a balancing act.  First, it must catch up in respect of those who received single cochlear implants and thereafter must commence a double implant service.  It is obviously cheaper to do two implants at once. </p><p>  The position on non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in Drogheda and Letterkenny will be addressed through hospital groups.  Once these are established, NCHDs will be employed by hospital groups as opposed to individual hospitals.  Mr. Barry O'Brien will provide some more detail on this issue. </p><p>  The issue of publishing service level agreements is one for the Health Service Executive.  While the agreements are large, I do not see any reason they should not be published, as they are a matter of public record. </p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked about having specialist representation on the boards of hospitals.  I presume he is not referring to medical specialists.  While the boards will have some clinical input, no members of staff will appointed to boards.  This is in line with a recommendation issued by the Health Information and Quality Authority as part of its investigation into practices at Tallaght Hospital.  We want people who have specific capabilities or competencies to be on the boards of hospitals.  These include competence in accountancy, human resources, the financial and legal fields and information technology.  We also want to ensure the regions are represented.</p></speech>

As discussed with Mr. Tony O'Brien and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, we will revert to the normal course once the pressure point has been addressed, as it has been.  Mr. O'Brien will provide further detail.  Nobody was disadvantaged because anybody who had been on the list was allocated a bed.

As I stated, we will catch up and there will be fairness and equity across the system by the end of the year.  We will also catch up with our inpatient elective procedures by the end of the year.</p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy also referred to the outpatients list.  This was an unintentional oversight.  This is the first Government that has been determined to expose this problem to the light of day.  It is astonishing that no previous Government ever counted the numbers on outpatient waiting lists.  The real scandal is not the 386,000 people on the waiting lists but the 16,000 who have been waiting for longer than four years.  We have undertaken that by the end of this year no one will have to wait longer than one year.  We will deal with this problem in the same way as we dealt with the problems of inpatient waiting times.</p></speech>

I am grateful to her for meeting yesterday with concerned parents who have formed the Happy New Ear group. </p><p>  On the national paediatric hospital, we have a project timeline to have a cleared, brownfield site ready for building to commence on 1 January 2015.  We intend to have the hospital completed in 2018, rather than 2019.  It is a massive project, the biggest undertaking in terms of capital outlay in the Government's term and probably the biggest building undertaken since the Ardnacrusha plant was built.  Even in the face of a deep recession, the Government has given commitments to compete the national paediatric hospital and the Central Mental Hospital because it has prioritised the most vulnerable, namely, those with mental health issues and newborns and children.  </p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will address in detail the issue of medical cards.  There is, however, no question that there are many more people than ever with medical cards.</p><p>  I answered some of Deputy Catherine Byrne's questions about the national paediatric hospital.  Lobbying is part of the process, but if she wishes, we can have a quiet chat about the specific issue she raised.  I can also speak to various people about the matter she highlighted because it is not appropriate.  Having said that, I assure members that an international, well run team decided, in conjunction with the Department, that St. James's Hospital was the best site for the new hospital.  I have no hesitation in saying this. </p><p>  On the nursing home in Hollybrook, I accept the Deputy's point.  There has been a back and forth discussion on this matter for some time.  Perhaps Ms Laverne McGuinness might address the issue before dealing with the Deputy's question on the number of intensive care beds and how it compares internationally.  </p><p>  Dr. Lynch will now discuss some of the points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300010#K01100"><p>The Minister referred to the private health insurance sector.  Deputies and Senators are concerned about the rising cost of premiums.  As the Minister noted, one major and obvious issue is the increase in claims costs.  The Health Insurance Authority's latest report indicates that claims costs increased by 14% last year, of which approximately 4% was for actual costs and the remaining 10% was accounted for by an increase in volume.  The critical issue to address is the volume of claims.  As the Minister stated, the number of people covered by private health insurance has decreased, whereas the number of claims has increased.  This is a critical issue which must be addressed.</p><p>  Last year the Minister appointed a consultative forum on health insurance which I chair.  The forum comprises representatives of the four health insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department.  We have been working intensively on issues related to the cost and affordability of health insurance.  While this is not an easy issue to address, we remain fully focused on doing so.  Some of the issues on which progress has been made include data sharing and, more importantly, the risk equalisation scheme.  Risk equalisation goes to the heart of the issue of the segmentation of the market and the targeting by insurers of younger people.  The Minister enacted legislation at the beginning of this year for a new risk equalisation scheme.  He has also pointed out that what we need to address the proliferation of plans - as we heard, there are more than 200 plans on the market - is a single standard plan against which everything else could be benchmarked.  We are working with the industry on this and all those involved have signed up to the concept of a single standard plan.  This would allow people to compare like with like, as every insurer would have one standard plan and costs could then be compared across the board.  Consumers would find this much easier.  This not to say there would not be other plans, but the standard plan would be the critical one against which everyone could make comparisons.</p> <p>Equally, the focus on costs could be directed towards that and we would only risk equalise to the extent of that standard plan.  That is an important set of issues which we need to deal with in this context.</p><p> We are also keen to deal with measures that would encourage greater participation of younger healthier people in the health insurance market.  The difficulty we face at the moment is that more older people are joining and more younger people are leaving.  The more we can encourage something in the opposite direction, the better.  One possible scope is lifetime community rating although that will become irrelevant when we go to universal health insurance.  Anyway, perhaps there is a case for introducing it in the meantime at a basic level because it sends a certain message.</p><p> The critical concern we have relates to agreeing measures throughout the industry to address costs.  We have to be careful about competition law as well.  There is no question of cartels or price fixing but there are things we can do at departmental level and throughout the industry to address those costs.  The Minister has stated that he is particularly concerned about the costs in VHI.  The company has submitted a plan.  We are seeking a more ambitious approach to it and I believe that will be possible in the coming while.</p></speech>

First, I will address the question of dental services and then I will say something about the medical cards issue which has been raised by several members.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of dental services and I wish to give some context to my reply.  It is worth pointing out that in the year to date, that is, to April 2013, of the 1.4 million people eligible for care, some 170,684 patients have received care, an increase of 10,000 on this time last year.  That is an important context.  Having said that, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that this area of dentistry, which includes primary care, preventive care, early checks and all these important areas of care in dentistry, is vital.</p><p>  I have met the Irish Dental Association on more than one occasion.  They are very good about this and they are dedicated professionals.  The organisation is fully engaged in this process and I am keen to engage with those involved.  Let us be straight: it is an area where we have seen the impact of the financial constraints we are under.  We have be unable to move on with initiatives as quickly as we would have wished.  However, I am seized of the importance of dentistry and of proper and well-developed dentistry services and I will continue to engage with the Irish Dental Association in this regard.</p><p>  The HSE has commissioned an independent review of the services and this has been referred to in the response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments.  The outcome of that review will give us guidance on what changes are desirable to provide the best model of care that we can provide, regrettably, I must say again to the committee, within the constraints of the resources available to us.  It is regrettable that we have been unable to do more although we have done a good deal in recent years, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has fairly acknowledged.  We want to do more and I see it as a priority area for attention once we move on from the stringent financial constraints we are currently under.  I wish to give the committee the assurance that it will be a priority because I am fully convinced of the importance of dentistry not only in terms of its direct impact but for broader health care.  It is a highly important area in health care.  There are synergies between what dentists do, what they can advise on, the way they can assist, treat and care for their patients, and other areas of primary care.  I regard this as important and I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of medical cards initially and Deputy Healy referred to it as well.  A written response to Deputy McLellan deals with the issue of medical cards being granted to people on medical grounds.  At the risk of annoying the committee or irritating people, I believe it is important to point out that our system awards medical cards on the basis of material circumstances.  That is the system we have had since 1970.  The entitlement to a medical card is based on an assessment of whether the individual can provide for his care other than with undue hardship, the phrase used in the Act.  Sometimes it sounds rather harsh when I give the response that it is all to do with material circumstances.  Naturally, there is a concern for people who become ill quickly and people who get cancer or other illnesses and there is a concern that they should be cared for and dealt with in a sensitive way.  However, the system we have awards medical cards on the basis of material circumstances and income.  That is the position.  There is, however, a discretionary medical card application system.  I wish to respectfully disagree with Deputy Kelleher, who suggested that it has ground to a halt or that it is not working.  That is not so.  There are more than 59,000 or almost 60,000 live discretionary medical cards in the system at the moment and approximately 20,000 general practitioner visit cards granted on discretionary grounds live in the system.</p><p>  It is a difficult area.  There has been some debate about this in the media in recent days.  Sometimes in the debate on this issue there is a public expectation or belief that medical cards are habitually granted on the basis of medical condition but they are not.  Perhaps there could be a debate on whether that should be so, but that is the system we have.  We have a centralised system, the primary care reimbursement service.  I am a Deputy as well as a Minister of State.  We all hear responses to particular cases, including some particular and genuine hard cases, but the fact is that the system is working well.  It has become a little more technocratic and sometimes bureaucracies appear harsh but I believe it is working rather well.</p><p>  In circumstances where there is an application for a discretionary medical card, as we indicated to Deputy McLellan in the written response, the medical officer considers the medical condition and the financial circumstances of the applicant on a case-by-base basis.  Great care is taken in these applications and I believe it is done in a sensitive way.</p><p>  Deputy Healy asked a question about where an assessment is being made for continued eligibility for a medical card and he said that people were being written to.  I support the HSE in doing this and I will explain why.  I want to ensure we maintain the resources we have for the people who need them and for the people who qualify for them, a view shared, I imagine, by everyone in this room.  We have constraints on resources.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is absolutely right.  We have extended tens of thousands more medical cards in recent years and I have no quibble with that.  People have found themselves in particular circumstances in which they need a medical card and they get a medical card, but the resources we have should be kept and preserved for when they are needed.  There are circumstances in which people qualified for a medical card for a period but then their circumstances changed.  If that is the case then-----</p></speech>

People are written to and are given three months' notice.  There are many anecdotes going around which are not true.  People are written to and given three months' notice.  They are written to again within one month.  If people engage with the service and engage genuinely with the letter they receive and answer the request being made for further information, they will not have the medical card removed willy-nilly or taken from them by a doctor, pharmacist or anyone else, as has been suggested.  That does not happen.  I appeal to people who receive a letter to respond to it.  If people continue to qualify they will be left with their medical card.</p></speech>

The problem is that it instills fear in many people who are concerned that they will lose their medical card.  I agree with the Minister of State, I support the HSE and I thank the staff in the PCRS and Mr. Paddy Burke for the work they do, but if the language used could be changed in some way it might help because it frightens people.  I know from people who come to my office that elderly people in particular are petrified of losing the medical card.</p></speech>

Discretionary medical cards on the basis of medical need are for people who find themselves in an acute situation - very often, sadly, those who are terminally ill.  This is where the discretion is shown.  If this was raised under the heading of probity I would be investigating it, because I find it weird that someone would get a medical card for seven years on a discretionary basis.</p></speech>

Is the HSE legally entitled to withdraw those cards?  These people are marginally over the limit and have medical conditions.

On other occasions we are in the room next door to this one meeting the Committee of Public Accounts, and the issue it would wish to talk about is the extent to which we do random checks to ensure that only those entitled to a medical card are in receipt of them.  While I understand the Deputy's point about someone being marginally over the limit, they are still over the limit and the discretion of the HSE to issue medical cards to people who are over the limit, unless there is a clear medical ground, does not exist.  The rules are not made by the HSE but we are obliged to enforce them.</p></speech>

We are working intensively on the publication of the White Paper.  Much of this type of work has to be done under the radar before one produces the paper because of its technical nature.  At the moment we are looking at different models for delivery of a UHI system.  The Minister has made clear that it is not simply a case of grafting the Dutch system or any other onto the Irish system.  We are examining the legal and financial implications of that at the moment.  That is the first stream of work under the White Paper.  The second is the basket of services - that is, precisely what services will be covered and at what cost - and the third is the exact approach to financing.  Someone asked if this is to be covered by universal health insurance, general taxation or a combination of both.  We are working intensively on those issues and will produce that White Paper as rapidly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

We will do our very best to produce it by then.  It is a very challenging timetable because of the nature of the work involved, but we are working intensively on it at the moment.</p><p>  To answer Deputy Byrne's questions about the current board of the national children's hospital, the Minister appointed an interim board to make sure that work continued on the project.  The current members are officials of the Department of Health and the HSE: I chair it, my colleague Bairbre Nic Aonghusa is assistant secretary general at the Department with responsibility for finance, and my other colleagues, Mr. Charlie Hardy and Ms Fionnuala Duffy, are principal officers in the acute hospital services, Mr. Jim Curran is director of estates in the HSE and Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer is a regional director of operations in the HSE.  We will be replaced by a new board with the necessary technical, financial and planning expertise shortly, when the Minister decides on that.  We are working as hard as we can to move things on as much as we possibly can.

I will deal first with the cochlear implants.  We had a very good meeting with the Happy New Ear group and the HSE staff members who are charged with putting the business plan together on how we would do this.  That business plan will be completed by the end of June.  It is a good timetable because the budgetary process will begin shortly after that.  With the roll-out of the newborn screening programme, we will pick up children's hearing impairments at an earlier stage.  I heard yesterday that these can be detected as early as three weeks.  There are approximately 60 children born each year who have a hearing difficulty - maybe not profound, but nevertheless, something that could be helped by a cochlear implant.  Those numbers will not go up; we are simply detecting them earlier.  At present this is detected at between two and four years of age.  We hope the numbers will not increase, but such conditions will be detected earlier.</p><p>  There is an emotional and practical case being made for the benefits of having two implants in respect of balance and sound sensitivity.  That was all taken on board.  It would be in our best interest to wait for the business case to be made and, as well as the children we are picking up at an earlier stage and with whom we are now dealing on an ongoing basis, there is a waiting list for the second implant.  It cannot just be for the people we are picking up now.  We need to start dealing with the backlog of people who could benefit from two implants.  Not everyone will opt for, or benefit from, it.  We need to wait for the business case that is being put together.  There may be different mechanisms to deal with the problem.  We will need additional posts if we go with it.  There may also be a mechanism to bring people in on a short-term basis.  That expertise is being considered.  We are moving on it.  The group was very happy with the meeting yesterday, which was very open and honest.  No commitments were given.  Everyone here knows I am not in the business of doing that, but we are preparing a business plan which needs to deal with the two sides of the equation - the people who have one implant and need a second, and the people we are picking up at a much earlier stage.  We will have that business plan in June and it will be well-placed for next year's budget.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the mental health posts.  We are above the recommended numbers of staff in the mental health sector - not much above, but we are above.  The difficulty is that there are deficits in some areas and not in other areas.  We are trying to deal with that and we have to take it into account too.  We have almost completed filling the 414 posts.  There are 42 posts unfilled, for a variety of reasons.  They have been accepted by candidates who are going through the clearing process, but a few posts are difficult to fill for geographical reasons.  People do not want to go to particular areas because their families are in other areas and some who are abroad want to complete the jobs they are in.  Thankfully, very few posts remain unfilled.</p><p>  In respect of the 470 posts this year, what we did about the first &euro;35 million was different and took a little bit longer.  I am very conscious of where I am saying this: we did not automatically divide it into four and send it into the regions.  We told the four regions to tell us where the gaps were and to send in their business cases for those posts and then we would employ.  That is what we have done with the 470.</p> <p>One area has not sent in its business case in regard to what the service needs.  It is not the same service.  There is a different cohort this year, including old age psychiatry, intellectual disabilities psychiatry and forensics.  </p><p> In the future where the service is delivered will be as important as who delivers it.  We are building a new central mental hospital, which is long overdue, and four regional rehabilitation units which will ensure that people who are in the Central Mental Hospital but could live closer to their homes can be accommodated.  Significant progress is being made.  More than anything else, there has been progress on attitudes and where we are delivering services.  The numbers are ahead of, rather than below, target, but not by much.  There is still more to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300013#N00200"><p>If we break the demographic profile down between immediate and longer-term issues, Deputy Kelleher was correct to say that the changing demographic profile presents a long-term challenge for the entirety of the spectrum of health and social care services.  The needs and intensity of our population will change.  The challenge of providing the right resources in the right place, in particular for the increasing cohort of older people, is enormous.  We will have to face up to it in the coming years. </p><p>  What has happened in the recent flu season is not unique to Ireland.  It is true for the whole island of Ireland, our nearest neighbour and European countries.  The relatively late onset of the flu season and its sustained nature had a particular impact on elderly people.  When flu season happens later in the year the potency of the vaccine programme is lessened.  There is, therefore, more incidence and often people are much sicker.  One of the characteristics we experienced was the substantial number of people presenting in the elderly age range, a much greater percentage of whom needed hospital admission.  Many needed intensive care and respiratory assistance, which led us, in a phased way, to step back on elective admissions, to accelerate 400 additional places in the fair deal and, ultimately, to temporarily step away from chronological management.  As the first step in the fair deal was to accelerate the number of places by 400, at no point in time did anybody who would otherwise have been in receipt of funding approval for the fair deal get one later than he or she otherwise would have done.  </p><p>  When one takes the two measures together, persons who would ordinarily have received their approval during the period when chronology was suspended had already received their approvals by virtue of the accelerated 400 places.  There is no instance of an individual having been directly disadvantaged by the temporary pause in chronology.  Interestingly, during the chronology pause periods we instituted a procedure whereby anyone in the community who was experiencing a particular need could be accelerated, which would not normally happen.  A number of persons whose personal situations were deteriorating were accelerated on medical grounds. </p><p>  On geography, the reality is that those who were treated and in need of long-term care in the six major hospitals in Dublin and Cork University Hospital, which is a major academic teaching hospital providing tertiary and quaternary services, do not come from those regions alone, rather, they come from around the country.  In the best interests of the totality of care we can provide to older persons, because many of those would otherwise have been waiting on trolleys and would have arrived into emergency departments from long-term care, it was the appropriate thing to do. </p><p>  With regard to the ambulance service, I will ask Ms McGuinness to speak to the non-emergency patient transport issue and the Hollybrook Inchicore issue.  The Deputy referred to two tragedies.  In the first case, the issue was not ambulance response times.  The newspaper that reported that it was subsequently retracted it and apologised for the story.  I recognise, however, that it gives rise to a generality of concern.  Some people saw the story but not the apology. </p><p>  To be clear, the ambulance response in that tragic situation in which a child sadly died as a result of the initial drowning incident was appropriate.  In the case of the second, we have questions and I have outlined what they are.  The review will proceed.  This year significant investment in the ambulance service is taking place, in terms of additional intermediate care vehicles and personnel, in order that emergency ambulances are freed up and reserved for that purpose.  We are also bringing our ambulance control system into line with international standards.  There will be a significant investment with a progressive centralisation of ambulance control functions that will enable the totality of our emergency ambulance fleet to be used much more effectively and in a much more controlled way.  </p><p>  I will briefly address one of the issues raised by Deputy Byrne.  She did not name an individual, but by telling us what he does and where he does it she has identified him fairly comprehensively.  It is important that I speak up on his behalf.  He is a distinguished and committed public servant.  Like many of us, we often find ourselves being photographed with delegations of various kinds from all parties and none and various groups.  Where those photographs subsequently end up is something over which we have limited control. </p><p>  While I can see from what she described that it would not seem to be the most appropriate use of his image, I suspect he had no control over it whatsoever.  I recall when I was director of BreastCheck that every time a mobile unit rolled into a place for the first time many stories would appear in the name of various local politicians, councillors or mayors, explaining in great detail the meetings they had with me and the extent to which they had lobbied me, but frankly I had never heard of them.  The rush to claim credit for various things is a particular phenomenon and I do not think the individual should or can be held accountable for it.  I understand the concern the Deputy had.</p></speech>

She is correct; it has taken a period of time to open it.  We hope it will be open in six months.  The reason it has taken time is because there is a question about whether the service will delivered by the HSE staff, which would require new staff, or through a public-private partnership initiative.  Our plan is that it is done through a public private partnership initiative. </p><p>  A specification is currently being concluded and we hope that will happen within a four week period.  Under the public service agreement we also have to engage in an extensive consultation process with unions.  That will be concluded in the next six to eight weeks.  Thereafter, we hope to open the unit within six months.  The specification has to be done because is very important to define what type of residents and patients will be treated in the unit, whether they will be complex, etc.  It will take six months for us to complete a HIQA inspection process and have the unit fitted out. </p><p>  Deputy Byrne also raised the issue of critical care and the importance of critical care beds.  This year, working with the clinical lead, Dr. Michael Power, we have identified the areas of greatest priority.  St. James's Hospital requires four critical care beds, Tallaght Hospital requires three and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital requires one, a total of eight.  St. James's Hospital has received funding of &euro;900,000 on a full-year basis and will open the critical care beds in June because it needs to recruit 11 staff, two of whom will be involved in intensive care.  I understand there was a lag of one week for cancelled operative procedures and those patients have been dealt with within that timeframe.  </p><p>  With regard to the ambulance service and non-emergency and non-urgent transport, it is correct to say that in order to improve response times and ensure that our ambulance fleet can get to emergency situations within our target of 18 minutes 59 seconds, we are very considered in terms of to what we will respond.  That is why we use intermediate care vehicles to transfer patients from one hospital to another.  We ask people at home to travel with relatives or ask somebody to bring them to hospital rather than engage in the traditional use of ambulance services.</p></speech>

In the context of our overall plan for self-sufficiency in terms of the projection for consultant numbers, general practitioners and other medical specialties, we are increasing the number of intern places year on year, with an overall increase to 740 by 2014.  The note for the committee clearly sets out the preparation that has been done to deal specifically with the July intake.  There has been a number of distinct approaches to this.  As the Minister said, the introduction of the hospital groups will bring a fundamental change in that all resources will be group resources, with the capacity of the chief executive officer and clinical director of those groups to redeploy key personnel in order to meet service needs where they arise.  This structure will afford a greater flexibility to deliver services where they are needed, including the deployment of medical personnel.  There are several areas in which issues have arisen, but we are dealing with them by way of a number of recruitment initiatives.  The hospital groups will bring a changed dynamic in terms of how we use our manpower resources in meeting service needs.</p></speech>

However, in the context of the short timeframe that presents between now and the July date, does Mr. O'Brien accept that particular hospital sites have a more acute problem in regard to the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors to cover their needs as and from the second half of this year?  What can and will be done in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.718" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300014#O00700"><p>If I may, Chairman, I would like, before Mr. O'Brien responds to Deputy  &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, to make a point in regard to the work that has been going on at St. James's Hospital.  As we have said, a project team in the hospital is looking after the decanting project, with a clear plan set out to deliver a brownfield site.  I commend the hospital's chief executive officer on the meetings he has held with staff, public representatives and local residents to keep them informed.  By communicating with people on an ongoing basis, we can avoid many problems that might otherwise arise, such as concerns about how the building work could interfere with individuals' day-to-day life, the running of their businesses and so on.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to make two quick points which I omitted to cover earlier.  Deputy Seamus Healy asked about consultation in regard to the roll-out of hospital groups.  There will be further consultation beginning on 31 May in this regard, which follows the more than 70 official meetings and 50 or 60 unofficial meetings that have already taken place.  In all, therefore, well over 100 meetings have taken place with staff and others in the various hospitals throughout the country.</p><p>  My final point, which deserves to be made repeatedly, relates to the tendency in nursing homes in the past to refer patients who are dying to hospital emergency departments.  Speaking for myself, I would prefer to die at home, as did both my parents, rather than in hospital.  For long-term nursing home residents, the facility in which they have been cared for, sometimes for many years, is in every sense their home.  The tendency to transfer gravely ill residents to emergency departments seems to arise out of concerns and perhaps a lack of confidence in dealing with the terminally ill patient.  It is a dreadful tragedy and affliction for such people that the last hours of their life are spent in unfamiliar surroundings.  It is utterly inappropriate.  To address that issue, the Health Service Executive has begun, through its clinical programmes, sending specialist gerontologists out to nursing homes to support them in dealing with these situations, which are emotionally difficult for all concerned.  It is not in the interest of patients who are coming to the end of their days to have to spend those last days and hours in an emergency department.  They should be allowed to see out their time in the facilities that have become their homes while receiving all the proper care and attention they require.</p></speech>

In fact, a number of them are taking the necessary steps to transfer their medical registration requirement from the supervised to the general division.  That is an ongoing process.  In addition, we have undertaken a specific recruitment initiative with the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Pakistan as well as another recruitment initiative in South Africa.  We will be able to assign those people as they come on stream to areas which, on an annual basis, have a difficulty in filling all their posts.</p></speech>

The shortage of junior doctors is an issue I have been dealing with for the past two years.  In the question I submitted for this morning's meeting, I referred to the fact that more than 4,000 junior doctors are on six-month contracts only.  In 2011, we had a major crisis in regard to junior doctors.  Two years later, however, we are still dealing with the same type of structure in terms of the contracts we offer while, at the same time, we are prepared to offer two-year contracts to individuals from Pakistan.  That does not make sense when we are spending some &euro;75 million per year in producing 600 medical graduates.  A survey I undertook last year shows that two thirds of these graduates will leave the county after completing their intern year.  Again, that does not make sense.</p><p>  This is not a criticism of anybody here but I am concerned about the structures that are in place.  The delegates referred to the Revenue Commissioners and the issue of termination of contracts.  If we can go to Pakistan and South Africa to recruit personnel, surely we can tease out these issues with the training bodies and Revenue in order to offer contracts that are structured so that people are not in a state of uncertainty from one half of the year to the next.  Graduates can go to the United Kingdom and obtain a two or three-year contract, but we are not prepared to review the process.  No progress has been made in this regard in the past two years and it is time now to sort it out.  Am I correct in saying there are 2,000 individuals on six-month contracts only?  Will action be taken to extend these to 12 months, even if it requires the operation of rotas between hospitals?  I accept that the new regional programme being rolled out offers a way forward in this regard but, in the interim, we must at least begin to put the structures in place for dealing with the situation whereby individuals in whose training a great deal has been invested are leaving the country in large numbers.</p><p>  Reference was made to difficulties that have arisen in regard to the quality of applicants for positions in smaller hospitals in terms of training or experience.  That is a major problem.  We have a situation in smaller hospitals where medical consultants are on one in two or one in three rotas and under extreme pressure because of the quality of the junior doctors available to them.  This matter must be given urgent priority so that we are not coming back in 12 months time facing the same issues.</p><p>    In regard to the fair deal scheme, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation has been in contact with me on several occasions to point out that there is no forum in which all of the people involved in elderly care can sit down together.  This is an issue I have raised on the Adjournment debate in the Seanad.  As it stands, the Department is meeting people individually, but the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation is seeking a more coherent approach.</p> <p>It is seeking the establishment of a forum involving people from within its ranks, those who provide home care packages, the HSE, the Department, HIQA, community nurses and home helps which could tease out all of the issues in order that we might put in place a better, more structured programme in dealing with the provision of elderly care.  From one week to the next, the organisation is not sure about its requirements in providing nursing home care and in the context of the changes expected of it by the Department, the HSE or HIQA.  It is seeking the establishment of such a forum and I request that one be put in place.</p></speech>

It is now far more difficult to obtain such a card than was previously the case.  Part of the problem is that there is a standardised system in place.  For example, people who are diagnosed with cancer are treated in the same way, regardless of whether they live in Dublin or Roscommon.  A person who lives in Roscommon will have additional transport costs and he or she will usually be obliged to bring someone with him or her when travelling for treatment.  That individual will be obliged to take a day off work.  These considerations are not taken into account in the overall assessment.</p><p>  My first question relates to disability services.  I welcome the commitment that people will be communicated with before the end of the school year.  I acknowledge this significant step forward.  However, has an assessment been carried out of the financial requirements in providing for those 700 school leavers and the progression cases?  What is the amount involved?  The difficulty with the additional sum of &euro;4 million is that it is being distributed on the basis of demography.  This means that approximately &euro;280,000 will be distributed to counties Roscommon and Galway.  We need double that amount to deal with school leavers and progression cases.  There are a number of complex cases involved and the relevant families are going to be obliged to fight for basic services once again.  Allocations based on demographics do not take account of the fact that the area in which I live is extremely rural and we do not have public transport services.  Much of the funding not spent on direct services for clients is, therefore, spent in the provision of transport.  This would not be the case in Dublin or some of the regional centres.</p><p>  On ambulance services, we are aware of the tragic case in east Cork.  The ambulance service in the west has consistently failed to reach target times.  The service in my area has the poorest response times in the western region.  The national figures in the performance reports were available up to the end of 2012, but they have been erased from the 2013 performance reports.  In addition, the HIQA target for response rates is now 85%.  However, the target set in the report under discussion is 70%.  Instead of improving targets, there has been a 20% reduction in the objective which must be achieved in 2013 in comparison with what has been set down by the HSE.  Sadly, this is leading to the loss of life and placing further lives at risk.  Why is it not possible to obtain a regional breakdown of response times?  I asked the Minister this question in the D&aacute;il on 20 March, but I did not receive a reply.  I specifically requested a regional breakdown and it was not supplied.  Why is it not possible to provide such a breakdown?  Has progress been made in respect of the public service agreement in the provision of staff for the Tuam base, the west Roscommon bases and other ambulance bases throughout the country?</p><p>  My final point relates to stroke services.  People who have a stroke cannot go to the 22 stroke units at 4 a.m. because they cannot be thrombolysed.  At Portiuncula Hospital there is only one consultant who specialises in stroke medicine.  At other hospitals CAT scan machines are not available on a 24-7 basis.  How many of these units provide thrombolysis on a 24-7 basis?  What steps are being taken to deliver rehabilitation services for people who suffer a stroke?</p></speech>

However, he will be in a position to indicate whether he is aware that the meeting in question took place and whether he advised his political colleagues not to proceed with it.  The meeting in question may be in breach of the 2004 directive regarding transparency in lobbying by the tobacco industry.  Apparently, the main item on the agenda for the meeting was smuggling, but the discussion then took in matters such as plans to ban roll-your-own and menthol cigarettes and introduce plain packaging.  Apparently, these are issues on which the industry has lobbied.</p></speech>

I will return to my prepared questions.  </p><p>  I am tremendously concerned about developments in the matter of oversight of ethical committees.  For reasons I do not have time to discuss today, I have had a long involvement in this area and encountered the extraordinary dysfunction and pathology of the way these committees worked in the past.  In some cases they were under wholly inappropriate and illegal extrajudicial levels of scrutiny by imposed committees of religious compliance which were acting in several of our larger hospitals and preventing access to cancer drugs because research protocols specified the need for contraception, interestingly by some people who have been loudest in calling themselves "pro-life" in the past few weeks.  Under proposed European directives, there is a need to regulate the ethical research committee sector.  There is a colossal amount of misinformation, misapprehension and, possibly, disinformation.  I know he is busy, but I would like the Minister's attention on this issue.</p><p>  I am very troubled by the fact that it is continually stated the approvals process for clinical trials in Ireland is slow.  That is not the case.  We have a blisteringly rapid and appropriate process.  It is one of the few things which works effectively and efficiently in our entire dysfunctional health service.  It has given us a colossal competitive advantage compared to the neighbouring jurisdiction, the United Kingdom, to which many companies and research charities just do not bring their trials anymore because the approvals process is so slow.  We are about to engage in a process which will impose a solution that is not needed to a problem that is not there.  Not only is this one of those irritating little bureaucratic things which happens from time to time, it could cause real problems.  The plan, under phase 2 of the current proposals, to allow HIQA to become the agency which regulates access to drugs and which regulates ethics committees is inappropriate.  HIQA is an inspectorate and it should not be running anything.  It is slowly being turned into the black ops or military wing of the HSE.  This must be stopped and HIQA refocus on its function, which is inspection.</p></speech>

I also welcome the long awaited appointment of Mr. Stephen Mulvany in the area of mental health.  I hope we will now see great developments.</p><p>  I add my voice to those of Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Healy on the issue of cochlear implants.  I was also part of the all-party group which met the representatives in question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, referred to the business plan and the budgetary process.  Does this mean that 2014 will be the earliest date for the consideration of funding?  I am very conscious of comments on the likelihood of second implants working only before children reach a certain age.  There are children who are borderline in this regard.  Time does not stand still when the Government makes policy decisions.  I am very concerned by the fact that a decision will not be made on this matter for six or seven months.  As an all-party grouping, I have no doubt we will follow up on this matter.</p><p>  In the context of the questions I posed and in addition to Deputy Denis Naughten's query on stroke services, I welcome what is stated about outpatient services in the reply to question No. 23.  I am very concerned about this issue which is very close to my heart.  One out of every five people in Ireland will suffer a stroke at some point.  In that context, the Irish Heart Foundation is holding its awareness week events from 10 to 14 June next.</p> <p> I wish to raise the matter of the response given to question No. 32.  As a Senator I do not get to ask parliamentary questions.  I get to ask three questions at the quarterly meetings here.  I go through the material and try to make sure that I have a question.  When I get a stock reply similar to that which has been given to parliamentary questions on several occasions, I must note my disappointment. That is exactly what we got to question No. 32.  We got a cut-and-paste reply.  The last person who got such a response was Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne on 25 April.  The reply states that an implementation plan beyond the overall operational planned commitments would not be beneficial.  That contradicts the foreword by the Minster of State, Deputy Lynch, in the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011- 2015, which states: "I look forward to receiving, at a very early stage, a comprehensive implementation plan from the HSE."  The policy is unequivocal about the need for a three-year implementation plan to address those key actions that can be initiated and implemented within a short timeframe and on a cost-neutral basis while working towards the achievement of a longer-term vision.  The reply I got goes on to state that the rehabilitation medicine programme has been working in collaboration with the national disability unit as part of the expert working group planning for the implementation of the report.  My understanding is that this is not entirely accurate.  I have been advised by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which is a member of the existing working group in this area under the rehabilitation medicine programme, that the initial clinical lead, Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, clearly defined the working group's role as being limited to medical rehabilitation and, therefore, it is not concerned with overall implementation.  It is of great concern to me that halfway through this implementation period it has been suddenly decided that we no longer need an implementation plan and only a partial implementation plan could be achieved.  I am really concerned about this issue.  Promises were made and now there is the question of whether we actually need the plan.  </p><p> On question No. 34 on the children's palliative care programme, I am pleased to hear that the candidates for outreach nurses have been chosen, but when will they be in their posts?  I have asked this question at previous quarterly meetings.  Where will the palliative care fit in the reform of the health services?  There have been many initiatives and developments, including staff training in palliative and end-of-life care, many of which are currently funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  Can the Minister and the HSE outline the plans they have to fund these projects in order that they will continue?  The Irish Hospice Foundation contributed &euro;5.7 million this year.  </p><p> In the area of palliative care for children, doctors are sometimes loth to say to parents and to write down that their child has a terminal illness.  This is a big issue the Irish Hospice Foundation faces in regard to medical cards for  children with terminal illnesses.  The parents only get a medical card for their child when the child is at the end of life.  Can the issue of medical cards for terminally ill children be addressed?</p></speech>

The idea that people are on six-month contracts is something I have discussed already with the Department.  We are looking at giving people a three-year contract when they have done their intern years.  In that way we would have them for two more years as SHOs, and that would also give them some certainty.  Equally, when people join the SPR scheme, it costs &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 to train a medical student - we have had this conversation previously - but it costs &euro;1 million to create a consultant.  If we are looking for value for money and trying to retain people, surely the people we need to hold onto are the people coming off the specialist registrar scheme.  We should not be letting three out of four of them go because we have not organised our manpower issues in the manner in which we need to organise them.   I want to knock something on the head here.  One of the reasons for this situation is unaffordability, because of what we pay consultants. The contract for new entrants is &euro;116,000 to &euro;121,000 per annum.  The starting pay for a consultant in the UK and the North of Ireland, which I discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Poots, who was down here for the eHealth conference last week - he and I travel up and down and talk quite frequently - is &pound;80,000 sterling.  Naturally, people like to compare what they can make in America and the wealthiest countries in the world, but let us consider other places.  We are often accused, when talking about drug costs, of looking at a basket of countries whose prices are lower than those in the basket of countries we are in.  The same applies here.  I believe consultants should be paid well because they do an extremely important job, save people's lives and spend a long time training.  I do not know of any other area in which the amount of training they undertake is done.  They deserve to be rewarded for that and for the commitment they show to their patients.  Without them and without the excellent people on the front line - our NCHDs, all our nursing staff and nursing officers - we would not have been able to maintain a safe service, and in fact to have improved it, in the past few years with the challenges we face.</p><p>  In terms of the hospital groups and the European working time directive, we are committing to addressing that.  The hospital groups are hugely important in allowing and enabling us to do that.  Equally, some of the proposals made during the talks with the unions will perhaps allow for a lot of work being done by NCHDs to be done by nurses.  There is an understanding that there can be a much greater and much more rewarding role for nurses.  </p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised the issue of medical cards, which the Minister of State, Deputy White, will address.  I ask that Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, who is here, have an opportunity to address the issue of strokes, raised by Deputy Naughten.  Mr. Tony O'Brien can address the question about the national ambulance service.</p><p>  The issue Senator Crown raised is one that is very close to my heart.  I have declared war on the tobacco industry in the Seanad.  I know of no other legal industry whose product causes one out of every two people who use it to die, and that is the reality.  Some 700,000 Europeans die from tobacco-related illnesses every year, of whom 5,200 are Irish men and women.  Was I aware of this meeting?  I was.  Would I go to it?  No, I would not.  I was trying to access a line in the directive on my iPhone, but what I remember from the directive is that it does not recommend that people meet with the tobacco industry except in the area of smuggling, and that was the purpose of that meeting.  </p><p>  I was in Geneva at the World Health Assembly for the WHO last week and I took the opportunity to talk about the tobacco control framework of the WHO and to talk to several other Ministers about the tobacco directive in Europe, of which I am strongly supportive.  We have led the campaign in ensuring that this directive makes as much progress as possible.  It is our highest priority.  Clinical trials are also a high priority.  It is an issue for Europe that we are losing funding for research, which is going to other jurisdictions because of the difficulty with bureaucracy that many people experience in Europe.  I accept Senator Crown, who I know is involved in research, is up to speed in this area.  There is much more we can do to improve this.  I take the opportunity again, as I always do, to encourage people to become involved in clinical trials, because not only will they get access to cutting-edge medicine, they will also get a level of supervision they would not normally get as a matter of routine.</p><p>  Senator Crown mentioned black ops in regard to HIQA.  I am going to ignore that, but I will talk about black ops in a different way, and this might be news to some people here because the media do not seem to have taken up this story in a big way.  There was a break-in at the EU offices in Brussels last year.  The intruders abseiled down from the roof to the seventh floor of the building, cut holes in the plate-glass window, disabled the alarms and got into the offices.  There were a number of offices and they  went straight to the Office of Tobacco Control and removed all the hard discs from the computers.  Who could afford to launch such an operation?</p></speech>

It must replace 5,200 Irish people and 700,000 Europeans every year with new clients and those clients are children.  A total of 78% of smokers surveyed in this country said they started smoking when they were under the age of 18 and several surveys done across the EU have shown more than 70% in all instances had started smoking under the age of 18.  The industry is targeting the most vulnerable in society.  Far from being a nanny state, we have a duty of care to minors.  One could ask what choice one has once one turns 18 if one is already addicted.  One's choice is gone.</p><p> I take the area of tobacco control extremely seriously and I know I will have Government backing when I go to Cabinet with a memo on plain packaging for cigarette products in this country.  We will be the first country in Europe and the first one in the world after Australia to do that.  Australia has faced challenge after challenge, by every conceivable mechanism, including the courts and the World Trade Organization, among others.  We will support Australia in every way we can to resist the challenges.  I assure Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly that we will follow the lead of Australia and go further.  I will support their Bill.  We are progressing legislation to ban smoking in cars where children are present.</p><p> On the issues raised by Senator van Turnhout, Dr. Carroll will deal with strokes and neuro-rehabilitation, the Minister of State, Deputy White, will deal with medical cards, while the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will deal with cochlear implants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.740" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052300017#R00200"><p>Two issues were raised on medical cards.  Deputy Naughten inquired about a differential approach to medical cards.  First, I thought he was saying there should not be a differential approach but in fact he was saying the opposite, that the approach taken should have regard to region-specific issues such as access to services in one part of the country that are not available in another area.  I am told that such considerations are taken into account and that even though the system has been centralised, the medical needs assessment is carried out on a regional basis in terms of whether a person is entitled to a discretionary medical card.</p><p>  In response to Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s question on terminally ill children and the views of the Irish Hospice Foundation,  I would be happy to get clarification on the point made.  However, it must be reiterated that in the case of terminally ill persons, no means test applies to the application for a medical card and a card is provided within 24 hours of application.  If that is not happening, I want to know about it.</p></speech>

It is a fact that such time is required.  We made that clear yesterday.  The process is that one must budget for certain provisions and if it was not budgeted for last year then it must be a matter for discussion in next year&rsquo;s budget.  People did not expect to walk out from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting with a cheque for &euro;7 million in their pocket.</p></speech>

People who are campaigning, who have a good argument, understood very well the explanation of the process in place.  Their point is that at least they now know what the process is and that it has begun.  It is also important to acknowledge the people who have been operating under considerable constraints.  One lady referred to getting a couple of bob here and a couple of bob there for the past 19 years.  People need to have certainty about their position.  That is important.</p><p>  The four palliative care nurses have already been chosen but the normal vetting procedure must take place.  We are all conscious of the fact that we are dealing with vulnerable people and such clearance is important.  In recent months I have spoken to several people involved in the hospice movement &ndash; the focus has now moved to palliative care &ndash; and as well as the standard hospice care, the emphasis is now moving towards home-based and community-delivered palliative care.  In particular when it comes to children with life-limiting conditions, it is important that the emphasis is not on care in an institution, but in the home and in their community.  That is a good development.</p></speech>

In addition to my current role, my day job is a specialist in neurological rehabilitation.  I am a brain injury rehabilitation consultant and most of my patients, unfortunately, are young adults with stroke.  It is not an exaggeration to say that stroke care in this country has literally been transformed in recent years with the work of my multidisciplinary colleagues in the stroke programme, but also the work of the Irish Heart Foundation stroke council.  Stroke provision has dramatically changed and thrombolysis rates have gone from being among the worst in Europe to one of the best.  The rate has changed from approximately 2% to in excess of 9% in two years, which is an extraordinary achievement.  I applaud the work of my colleagues in doing that.  The stroke programme has been doing much work on getting access in a safe manner to thrombolysis but also to specialist rehabilitation and specialist acute care for stroke patients.  The programme is on target.  Our hope is that the stroke unit in Cork will be open by the end of June.  Access to 24-7 thrombolysis is improving and with the development of telemedicine that will be increased again.  We are very happy and the citizens of this country have now got access to high quality stroke care.</p><p>  With regard to neurological rehabilitation, I can comment on the clinical programme as I was the clinical lead of the rehabilitation medicine programme before I took up my current role.  It is correct to say that the clinical programme is examining the strategic delivery of neurological rehabilitation but it is very likely that with the developments in the programme that it will meet a lot of the recommendations that came out of the strategy.  The deliverables for 2013 from the rehabilitation medicine programme include the model of care, which is entering its final stages.  My colleague, Dr. Jacinta Morgan, has recently been appointed clinical lead of the rehabilitation medicine programme and she will lead it for the next couple of years.  We are looking to develop four regional inpatient rehabilitation units and outpatient rehabilitation units.  Five additional consultant appointments are currently going through the recruitment process.  That is a 70% increase in the number of consultants in rehabilitation medicine.</p><p>  In terms of community rehabilitation, through the clinical programmes there will be a cross-progamme initiative to look at the management of long-term conditions.  Part of the work will be to look at the provision of rehabilitation services not just for neurological conditions, but for all long-term conditions.  We hope to see a group being brought together in the next few months.  A key part of the work of the clinical programmes is looking at the issues of unscheduled care but also long-term conditions.</p></speech>

For instance, policy must be an issue for both Government and the Health Service Executive but if it is about the way people are managed once they are in the system that would be a worthwhile platform in terms of considering the stage at which people need to go to an acute unit and so on.  I do not believe that would be a problem but we would have to have clear lines in terms of the issues on which it could decide and the outcomes.</p></speech>

I have spoken to members of the Irish Medical Organisation who were involved in the NCHD sub-committee and they are concerned.</p></speech>

I have met with Commissioner Andor on a number of occasions.  I have given him a commitment that we will be within the working time directive in the next 24 months, that we have a time schedule laid out and timelines that must be met about different areas.  That is why the hospital groups aspect is so important because it will allow for reduced hours for non-consultant hospital doctors.</p><p>  Equally, the Labour Relations Commission arrangements we entered into with consultants before Christmas are very important.  Many people thought the any five days out of seven issue was a big thing, and it is, but what is more important is that we now have clinical directors who are appointed rather than elected and who have authority and responsibility.  They can dictate who is and is not on duty and the number of NCHDs that should be on.  It is now no longer down to the individual consultant insisting that his or her team has to be on duty at all times when that is not clinically indicated.</p></speech>

I do not want to put Mr. O'Brien on the spot in terms of the deal done on career path this week with the Labour Relations Commission but one of the major points from that meeting was the need for a clear career path for our own Irish-educated and trained professionals to stay here rather than going abroad to work, which I accept the Minister mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

It is bizarre that we are spending large sums of money training our own graduates, some of whom make the best doctors in the world.  We know that because when they go abroad they excel.  We educate and train them to go abroad to work and we go to Third World countries and recruit their doctors.  That does not make any sense.  The issue around a clear career path is critical, and we are exploring how to progress that and make it happen.  I do not want to leave this office without having resolved that issue.</p></speech>

That money has not been allocated yet to each region but it will be available at the end of May in terms of the number of places and the amount of money required.  The money is being held centrally to ensure it is equitable and allocated to the most appropriate places.  We have a standards guidance document which will assist with that.  Last year, we had a 99% success rate with those day places and we hope to have the same outcome this year.</p><p>  The Deputy asked a number of questions related to the ambulance service.  In our new format performance monitoring report we have a number of pages at the front with about 12 high-level key messages but all the other information is in the supplementary report, and the ambulance information is in that supplementary report which is published on the web.  Unfortunately, due to a glitch the Deputy did not get the regional breakdowns.  I have them here.  I will give him my hard copy.  I will also e-mail them to the Deputy.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked the reason we are using targets that are different from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, targets.  HIQA was using targets of 85% in terms of its DELTA calls.  We set targets this year of 70% and 68% because other jurisdictions have been using these indicators for years.  We are still at an early stage of that but we believe that is what we should strive towards.  Already, we are achieving 73% on our ECHO calls but that is not throughout each of the regions.  As the Deputy is aware, the west is not performing appropriately.  </p><p>  There is a full 57 point action plan in place in terms of the way we improve our response times.  There are critical dependencies in that.  We have invested heavily in our ambulance service this year, with &euro;12.2 million in revenue going into it.  That is to do with adult retrieval, but particularly regarding our intermediate care vehicles, to which Mr. O'Brien referred.  That will make more ambulances available to respond to emergencies.  Some 25 new vehicles are on order from June onwards and 80 staff will come in to give effect to that.  That will significantly improve our response times.</p><p>  The other element which will significantly improve response times is a &euro;23 million investment since 2010.  We will have a brand new control centre and system whereby we will be able to see every ambulance throughout the country and to where they are being dispatched.  That will ensure they are going to the most efficient location.  We will also be able to see the length of time they may be delayed, and link that in with the hospitals.  That means more effective and timely dispatch, thereby ensuring we will have more appropriate responses.  We have approval for that system to go in place.  Already, we are moving our control centres to one centre over two sites.  We hope all that will be operational by the first quarter of next year, with much of it to be in place by the end of this year.  Two sites have been moved already.  Cork and Kerry moved last week to Townsend Street, and Navan will move in June-July.</p></speech>

With regard to question 29, the plans to increase the numbers of school dentists in Cork, the reply stated that 48 dentists are currently employed in the school dental service of Cork ICA and that in the past two years, four to five dentists have left the dental service.  Have those dentists been replaced and, if not, when will they be replaced?</p><p>  Prior to those dentists leaving, a problem arose in Youghal where children were not being seen until they were in secondary school.  That gap must be addressed.  It was identified recently as a problem by this committee.  Do the witnesses have plans in place to rectify that?</p><p>  Regarding medical cards issued on discretionary grounds, my question related to cancer patients.  Aside from the costs of medication, cancer patients are constantly cold.  The heating must be on 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  When people fill in the income and means section of a form, they do not know how much time their partner who is on that income will have to take off in the course of a year to provide assistance to their partner in the home or bring them to hospital appointments.  They have to take off a good deal of time for which they are not paid.</p> <p>There also are travel costs to and from hospital appointments and if there are young children in the equation, they sometimes must be taken out of the home environment, thereby entailing additional child care costs.  If someone is very ill in the home, no account is taken of the need to buy in ready-made meals sometimes, because people are too ill to cope with cooking.  This is the human cost and no box on any form will take that into account.  In itself, this provides undue hardship and I believe people do not take into account this side of it.  I will conclude my comments on cancer services by noting that, as a parent who lost a child to cancer stated on radio yesterday, the medical card is the most important thing to the parents of a child with cancer.  We owe it to the children of the country to protect them.</p><p> Finally, I refer to the ambulance service in Cork.  As the witnesses are aware, two tragedies occurred in Midleton within a short time.  In common with everyone else, I wish to extend my deep sympathies to the families.  However, I wish to point out that just 12 hours before the death of Vakaris Martinaitis on the bank holiday weekend, there had been an incident in Youghal in which a man was assaulted in an unprovoked attack.  He was left seriously injured and lying in a pool of blood on the street, but the ambulance did not come for 53 minutes.  I have been informed that two rapid response vehicles were on duty at the time but neither attended.  I do not know where they were.</p></speech>

The local garda&iacute; were obliged to call on the fire brigade to provide assistance.  It was on call - not on duty - and came to the scene and provided assistance.  However, my point is these are not merely isolated incidents.  As people in east Cork have no confidence in the ambulance service at present, does the Minister intend to conduct a review of the reconfiguration of that service there?  Ms Laverne McGuinness mentioned that &euro;23 million is being invested in a control system, which is most welcome, and money is being invested in more ambulances.  However, will any of them be deployed in the east Cork area?  I welcome the HSE's commissioning of a formal review into the manner in which the 999 call was received in Midleton and that a liaison officer has been provided for the family, but these are not merely isolated instances.  There have been other instances in the east Cork area and that is the reason people there have no confidence in the service at present,</p></speech>

At present, the number of such implantations stands at 90 patients per year and the annual budget in Beaumont Hospital for this service, inclusive of implants, is more than &euro;4 million.  Last year, 48 adults and 42 children received implants and more than 700 patients are in the ongoing support programme for rehabilitation.  The cost of a single implant is between &euro;18,000 and &euro;20,000 and the Happy New Ear campaign stated yesterday that one could perform a simultaneous implant for approximately the same price.  There is no delegated programme for simultaneous implants to be carried out in Ireland.  I acknowledge the HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to further plans for both simultaneous and bilateral implantations.  At present, approximately 200 children in Ireland may be suitable for a second implant.  A small number of them have received bilateral implants due to medical conditions such as meningitis and blindness.  The Minister should note that 22 centres in the United Kingdom carry out these implants at a cost of &euro;30,000 per family.  While families are trying to gather together this money to travel to the United Kingdom to have this operation performed, they are worried about the after-care service.  Yesterday, they wanted to know whether, were they to travel to the United Kingdom to have these operations done, Beaumont Hospital would provide an after-care service for them.  All parents want is for their children to be given a chance to have a normal life.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, met the group yesterday but were the Minister to meet these people in the  near future, I would appreciate it.  This would give them the opportunity at first hand to express their concerns.  The Minister is a family man like me and I know he will make himself available.</p></speech>

It stated that a realistic budget for 2013 was based on the level of activity in 2012.  Was this based on the level of activity in 2012 that saw accident and emergency services and medical discharges increase by 7%?  If so, why was the budget then reduced by &euro;1.5 million?  In the reply to the question, the HSE was unable to indicate what would be Mullingar hospital's future role in the context of the hospital groupings.  This leads me to ask when the answers to these questions were drawn up, because that information was published last week.  I note the aforementioned hospital will be in a grouping with Navan hospital and that the removal of 24-hour accident and emergency services from the latter will result in an increase in patient activity in Mullingar hospital.  Will this increase be matched with additional funding?  As the Minister's mantra is the money will always follow the patient, given that activity in Mullingar hospital has increased, I would like to think that financial support also will increase there.  The Minister might answer me in this regard.</p><p>  As for the mental health budget, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be aware that I raised this issue on four separate occasions last year through Topical Issue debates.  While everyone agrees the service must be delivered where it is needed, one should be honest: the &euro;35 million was not spent last year because it was eaten up in the big black hole in the HSE's budget.  It is now halfway through 2013 and the 2012 targets still have not been met.   When will the 2012 targets be met fully?  When will the roll-out of the 2013 targets begin?  Will the &euro;35 million that has been ring-fenced for 2013 be spent this year?  Given the rates of suicide and deliberate self-harm, it is imperative that this receives priority.</p><p>  On the transfer of staff from the HSE to the new child and family support agency-----</p></speech>

In respect of the Happy New Ear campaign group, what exactly will be taken into account in the business plan?  For example, will the provision of special needs assistants in classrooms, who potentially would be required for people who did not receive such implants, be taken into account?  Similarly, does it take into account how, as one parent told me, the school was obliged to buy additional audio equipment?  Does it take into account every financial impact?  How does the Minister of State think the Happy New Ear group will react to the fact it now appears as though nothing really will happen until the new year?</p> <p>Is that the case?  The business plan is due for completion in June.  How will it take six months between the report being published and something being done about it?  As has already been pointed out, time is of the essence.  The longer some of these children must wait, the less successful the implants will be.  When I first heard about this, it was amazing news that this invention even existed.  It is really good news.  It would be a shame that some children would be denied the right to get the best use of this invention.</p><p> I have another question which I do not know whether the Chairman will allow.  I do not see this issue being dealt with at all.  I refer to the &euro;3.7 billion bill that the State faces every year due to alcohol abuse.  There was a report published by former junior Minister, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, which got a massive amount of media coverage.</p></speech>

I wonder what is happening about this.  Is there something being done about the price of and ease of access to alcohol?  Is anything happening?  I attended all of the meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the ban on alcohol advertising.  Given the scarity of resources and that it costs the State &euro;3.7 billion a year, I wonder what is happening with it.  I am a little disappointed with the way the matter is proceeding.</p><p>  I also am disappointed that, among many of the members of the committee who spoke on the issue of alcohol abuse, it seems unpopular to do anything about this.

When the question was submitted over three weeks ago, four beds in Carndonagh Community Hospital had been closed, we were told, on a temporary basis by the HSE.  Since then, those four beds have not reopened.  In fact, two more have been closed, reducing the amount of beds open in the community hospital, from 30 to 24.</p><p>  The Minister's response today is quite worrying in that it does not indicate these beds will reopen.  I note the Minister indicated in his response that the overall bed capacity in the hospital is 36.  I would point out to him that, in fact, it should be 46 because the capacity in the community hospital is 30 beds, of which only 24 are currently operating, and the capacity in the state-of-the-art dementia unit in the hospital, Ard Aoibhinn, is 16, of which only 12 have been operating in the past while.  My question to the Minister is will beds reopen and will the Minister address the situation which is leading to these beds being closed, that is, the recruitment embargo and the failure to replace staff as they retire or where they are off for long-term reasons?  Hospitals such as Carndonagh provide the capacity to operate beds which provide step-down from general hospitals, assessment which prevents having to admit to more acute hospitals and respite to the community, and such beds are being closed.  Since I submitted this question, ten beds have also closed in Dungloe Community Hospital in Donegal for the same reason.  The recruitment embargo is getting to a stage where it is long past the tipping point.  Will these beds reopen and will the Minister and the deputy CEO of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien, ensure that the Government addresses the recruitment embargo which is driving hospitals to the position where they are closing beds?</p></speech>

It would be worthwhile, at a mimimum, conducting a review of local GPs to see what is their experience of the ambulance service and to quantify whether there is a problem, and that would not be overly difficult to achieve.  On the terrible tragedies, like others, I again express my sympathy to the families concerned.  There will be an investigation.  The committee will note from the membership of that investigation that there is nobody from HSE south involved and we have sought expertise from both the North of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the cochlear implants.  We had a good discussion on that already.  He asked if I would meet the parents.  I would be more than happy to do so.  Given the schedule I have had over the past number of weeks, with the EU Presidency, WHO, e-Health conference, etc., that has not been possible.  I am pleased that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was able to meet them yesterday.  I am pleased to be able to say that the funding has been put aside for next year to allow for the simultaneous bilateral implantations to take place but, as I stated earlier, there is a business plan to be put in place.  There will be recruitment issues as well.  I compliment the consultant who does this work, Ms Laura Viani.  She is a wonderful person.  She has been doing it for years and she works only in the public sector.</p><p>  There are questions about Mullingar hospital and the removal of the emergency department in Navan.  We made clear that there will be no change in Navan emergency department until such time as there is capacity in the system to allow that to happen, and that is not any time soon that I see.  For me to preclude what will and will not happen, however, would be to defeat the very purpose of the hospital groups, which is, to devolve as much authority and autonomy locally as possible, and allow them control over their own staff recruitment, over their own budgets and over procurement in so far as it is possible, and that they communicate with us centrally to ensure that the deals they are getting are the best deals available and that we are aware of the best deals available to transpose across the system.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien can answer more comprehensively on the budget issue.</p><p>  Mention was made of mental health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will deal with that.</p><p>  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan mentioned the issue of alcohol.  I have had many discussions with my Cabinet colleagues on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and I met only yesterday on progressing this to a memorandum to Government.  There is obviously a degree of tension in certain areas between certain Departments, but we in the Department of Health are clear.  We acknowledge the significant damage that abuse of alcohol does.  I reiterate my commitment to protecting children and in my view, it is inappropriate to have advertising earlier than a certain hour or watershed at night.  Sporting events are critically important to the well-being of children in that we are trying to get them to take more physical exercise and be involved in sport and community and major sporting events are part of that continuum, and I do not believe it is appropriate that these sporting events should be sponsored by alcohol companies.</p></speech>

There has been much negotiation.  In fairness, we must allow the sporting organisations to replace their current advertisers and sponsors with others.  They stated the same about tobacco advertising when it was removed and, sadly, there is still 29% prevalence of tobacco smoking in the country.  Happily, I am able to say there has been an 8% reduction in the number of those aged 12 smoking, which is good news because, like I say, the advertising is focused on children.  It is the same with alcohol.  However, alcohol is very different from tobacco.  No consumption of tobacco is at a safe level.  Every cigarette harms you and one out of two smokers will die earlier.  However, alcohol can be a normal part of life, in terms of sensible drinking as a social lubricant, etc.  The issue is its abuse and young people starting to drink alcohol too young and developing bad habits.  Minimum pricing is a significant issue for us.  I note the Scottish Government has got it through.</p> <p>We are examining its legislation.  We want to promote that also.  We have had very good conversations with Minister Poots in the North and we want to move on these issues simultaneously as one so there will be no cross-Border activity being promoted that would be counter-productive from a public health perspective.</p><p> I have already covered the issue of the cochlear implants.  Deputy Lynch will talk more about it.  She will also deal with care for the elderly in Cardonagh but I must make two points about it, however.  I acknowledge we have not had an overly political conversation here but the reality-----</p></speech>

It is a bit rich to talk about the country's finances when we all know the cause of the problem and that we are struggling.  Despite taking &euro;3 billion out of health services and losing over 10,000 staff, we have not only maintained a safe health service but have also improved it, as evidenced by the figures I gave on inpatient treatment times, the number who must endure long waits on trolleys and in our commitment to deal with outpatient appointments, which no previous Government would even consider.  The approach of former Minister, Deputy Martin, was to sweep it under the carpet or throw money at it and hope it would go away.</p><p>  We have had a good meeting.  I will not be overly political about this matter but believe we have made considerable strides.  I thank all the staff working in the health service, particularly those on the front line and the management who have stepped up to the plate, are embracing reform and changing outcomes for the better for our people.  That is what it is all about.</p></speech>

Right across the board, there has been an incredible sense of dedication and commitment to what needs to be done.  It is worth stating that, at a time of enormous financial pressure and retrenchment, we still have managed to maintain a very strong health care infrastructure, even in circumstances in which we are under such enormous pressure.  My point applies to the primary care system right across the board.  Some 38% or 40% of people are on medical cards.  I am not seeking praise or thanks but simply saying that we have managed to keep the infrastructure in place, even in circumstances of enormous pressure.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan is right that in circumstances of family illness, particularly where a child is concerned, the last thing anyone wants to have to struggle with is applications, form filling or box ticking.  The humanity of the circumstances is clear to us.  We do not want to see people struggling when they are under such pressure already. </p><p>  We have never had a system in which people got medical cards on the basis of having a particular illness.  People have outlined their views on the medical card system on the radio.  The system does not distribute medical cards to people on the basis of a particular illness.  That sounds like a harsh statement but I am simply repeating it.  It is not how cards are allocated but we do have a discretionary system for allocating medical cards to people who have various conditions, such as cancer.  However, we must put in place a system such that this can occur.  I want it to be done sensitively and do not want it to be a box-ticking exercise.  I want us to be aware of the kinds of issues that the Deputy raised.  One's income may change over a period of months and may be affected by the illness itself or the circumstances of one's partner.  I want the system to take that into account as best it can.<font color="#0000FF">  </font>If the system can be improved, let us try to achieve that.  The system is not such that a person can be automatically given a medical card on the basis of an illness.  We must have a way of dealing with that.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Flanagan for his support on the issue of alcohol.  I am aware that he gave very strong support to the public health dimension at a different committee meeting, when he was, perhaps, in a minority.  I thank him, other members and particularly the members of this committee, who have a public health perspective.  Others have different perspectives, and that is fine also.  Our perspective, as stated very well by the Minister, is that alcohol presents a public health issue, particularly in respect of children and young adults.  I have no doubt that advertising and sponsorship have an impact on the conduct and behaviour of children and young adults, in particular.  I am told by others, including colleagues in the Government, that there is no evidence for this, but there is evidence.  There is no direct behavioural link such that someone who sees a billboard will go straight for a drink because the process is far more subtle, but the close association of alcohol with major sporting events is totally inappropriate and should and will be addressed.  What I have been trying to do in recent months is maximise agreement across all Departments and Ministers.  As with many tasks, this has taken longer than I would have hoped for.  We have been doing what I describe with a view to bringing to the Government the memorandum that would have the maximum agreement associated with it.  What the Minister, Deputy Reilly, said is absolutely correct.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has led the charge and I am 100% behind him.  I have had meetings with senior Cabinet colleagues on the matter in order to seek agreement.  As with the Minister of State, I am hopeful that the memorandum will be signed off this week.</p><p>  Let me make one point that I got distracted from making on the power of advertising.  I thank Deputy Flanagan for his support in regard to it.  In a survey carried out on 12-year-olds, they were not able to name one brand of tobacco but could name five brands of alcohol.  That shows the power of advertising.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised this issue several times.  On having seen a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme recently, it struck me that if one says something often enough, it is taken as the truth.  It is sometimes not the truth.  We spent the &euro;35 million last year and did so by putting in place 339 additional mental health posts.  There are 42 on offer as we speak.  The others are not filled because it is a question of geography.  People do not want to go to certain areas.  It is also a question of people living or working abroad.  We must stop saying things that are clearly not true.</p><p>  What I have said is the truth, a fact.  The evidence is that in every community people have found the mental health service has improved dramatically.  I have a list to hand of very large institutions in which, until recently, over 1,000 people were living.  These institutions have now closed.  They have closed because the service has moved to a different space and because it has changed dramatically.  There was an allocation of &euro;35 million this year, and with that we are doing exactly what we did last year.  We want each region to send us its business case on where it believes there is a gap in its service in regard to old age psychiatry, intellectual disability psychiatry, forensics, etc.  The national counselling service is also being rolled out.  Circumstances are changing.  Some nights ago on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, people whom one would expect to know better trotted out the old line that we did not spend the &euro;35 million.  I do not know who is paying these people their wages.  Someone is doing so; they are not working for nothing.<br /><font color="#0000FF">  </font>The Happy New Ear campaign was alluded to by Deputies Flanagan and Fitzpatrick.  Deputy Flanagan should note the business case will involve a very narrow process.  It is a case of determining what personnel we need to deliver the service if it is in Beaumont or if it moves eventually to the new paediatric hospital.  That is in the future.  We must ask what we need to deliver the service.  I understand the point that if one does not address this, it will cost more downstream, but that is not what this is about.</p> <p>This is a very clear plan on how we can deliver it.  When that business case is made, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and myself will examine it to see where we go from there.  I assume it will not be done for nothing, so in order to get the money and deliver this service we will have to include it in the budgetary process and negotiate it, as we did with mental health services.  We simply have to argue the point about this additional service.  </p><p> The people I met yesterday are happy that there is now a process and they know where it is going.  I did not make any commitment to them yesterday.  I said we would have to go into the budgetary process in the same way as everyone else, but their case will be clearly made.  I think they are reasonably happy with that.  If it could be done tomorrow or the day after, of course, everyone would be thrilled but that is not how it works.  They know what is going to happen and they are happy about that. </p><p> I dealt with the issue of community nursing homes in the Seanad recently.  These beds are being closed because HIQA says there are not sufficient staff to deliver a safe level of care.  We need to be careful about that because HIQA is our safeguard, both for the Government and those in receipt of care.  That is the case even if a member of my family was in a nursing unit where they were getting exceptional care.</p></speech>

I have heard some of the stuff from the "Liveline" programme this week, as well.  It is important to make clear that even where a person does not qualify for a medical card or a GP-visit card, there is no circumstance in which - as was suggested on that programme yesterday - a person could be left with a monthly bill of &euro;1,000 for drugs because the drugs payment scheme threshold is &euro;144 per family per month.  There are aspects of the debate that will sometimes cause fear and alarm through a lack of complete information, notwithstanding the significance of the underlying issues that are raised by people who call in to that programme.</p><p>  In a similar vein, we are hearing for the first time about an alleged incident in Youghal, which was 12 hours earlier than the incident we know about.  Those alleged facts are now on the record here.  They have not been fact-checked or we would know about them.  Public confidence is a very important issue.  Putting that out in a situation where we are not able to respond with any kind of balancing information is clearly a difficulty for us.</p></speech>

There were specific items which, when distributed, do result in a reduction in the budget in Mullingar.  However, they do not result in as large a reduction as might otherwise have been the case.  There are various issues which, when translated through Croke Park II, will deal to a large extent with those.  However, this is balanced by the fact that the hospital is to receive funding in the context of the opening of eight new beds, which are the result of an assessment of its bed capacity requirement.  It is impossible to take out that type of funding - some &euro;3.5 billion in recent years - without individual locations suffering budget reductions.  It is simply not feasible.  </p><p>  Similarly, as regards an overall reduction of nearly 11,000 staff at this stage from the health service, with more to go this year, that will have an impact on situations such as we are seeing in Carndonagh where the level of staff when assessed by HIQA led to the reduction in the number of beds temporarily, while the local health office makes alternative arrangements to bring staffing up to the necessary levels.</p><p>  While there is a general moratorium on recruitment it is not so inflexible as to prevent us from responding to particular situations, and the local health office is seeking to do that in Donegal at the moment. </p></speech>

It is of massive benefit to the alcohol industry to refer to alcohol and then refer to drugs as something separate.  Alcohol is a drug, no matter how difficult that might be for people to hear.  It is a mind-altering substance.  How one deals with it and regulates the substance does not make it something else.  We need to keep saying that alcohol is a drug.  It is a bit like talking about baguettes and bread, because baguettes are bread.  I never heard anyone putting them in a separate category, unless of course it is the baguette marketing company.</p></speech>

It will give us many more hours of nursing to enable us to provide more care and services.  We can look forward to exciting times of real change in our health service, which will improve conditions and outcomes for patients.  There will be new opportunities for those working in the health service as we explore new ways of doing things and delivering more care.</p><p> I thank everyone who works in the health service for staying with us.  It has been difficult for them but they have done a super job.  Given that we have some of the best doctors, nurses and managers in the world, we must ask why do we not have the best health service.  It is because the service was allowed to evolve in a chaotic fashion.  We are putting order on it and everybody who works in the health service has had an input into that.  I want them to continue to have that input and I thank them for it.  I thank my colleagues on the committee and the officials from the Department and the HSE for attending today.  I include those who did not get an opportunity to speak but who were here and ready to inform us should specialist information have been required.</p></speech>

I hope the witnesses will not mind if I do not name everybody and single out Mr. Larry Reilly and Mr. Paul Howard of the Department of Health and Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE for their assistance in co-ordinating the meetings.  In the malaise and negativity in the media, it is forgotten that we have excellent people working in the health service who have delivered changed work practices and work schedules and greater efficiency.  It is a tribute to everybody.  I pay tribute to all the staff working in the HSE and the Department of Health no matter who they are.  Any hospital or health service facility one walks into is fantastic.  I note to Mr. Tony O'Brien and his staff that at a time when public servants are being criticised, my experience has been that HSE staff are courteous and efficient.  If the answer is "No", they will say so, but one receives a reply.  To be fair to the PCRS staff and Mr. Burke, I thank them for the fact that they reply to Members of the Houses.  While officials may feel that we may be too aggressive in some cases in our job of holding them to account, they should know that we appreciate the work of the staff at all levels in the HSE and Department of Health.</p></speech>

First, we will meet officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to hear about COM (2013) 130, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation EC261/2004, establishing common rules for compensation and assistance for passengers in the event that there is a denial of boarding and cancellation or long delay of flights, and Regulation EC2027/97 on air carrier liability in the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air.</p><p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Ethna Brogan, Ms Niamh O'Brien and Mr. Austin Cunningham.  I draw attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Ms Brogan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethna Brogan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300002#A00600"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting us to attend.  Together with my colleagues from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Austin Cunningham and Ms Niamh O'Brien, I hope to set out for the information of members of the joint committee the main elements of the legislative proposal - the reference is COM (2013) 130 - and the implications it may have in an Irish context.  The proposal was published by the European Commission on 13 March.  It is one of several new legislative proposals in the aviation sphere that will be presented by Commissioner Kallas to EU Transport Ministers at the next meeting of the Transport Council on 10 June which will be chaired by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in his capacity as President of the Council during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  It is for a new regulation of the European Parliament and the European Council to amend two existing EU regulations.</p> <p>It is for a new regulation of the European Parliament and the European Council to amend two existing EU regulations: first, Regulation 261/2004, a well-known regulation which established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denial of boarding and cancellation or long delay of flights; and second, Regulation 2027/1997, on the liability of air carriers in respect of the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air. </p><p> The main objective of Regulation 261/2004 was to combat practices that had arisen in some parts of the airline industry, including overbooking of passengers to ensure maximum load capacity.  The regulation established a suite of rights for passengers when travelling by air, including the right to care and assistance and even to compensation in certain circumstances when they were denied boarding or their flights were cancelled or delayed.  While it has been in effect in European law since February 2005, the importance of the regulation came into particularly sharp focus during the volcanic ash crisis in 2010, when hundreds of thousands of passengers were stranded following the closure of most European airspace for number of days due to a volcanic eruption in Iceland.  Under the regulation, each member state was required to appoint a body which would have responsibility at national level for enforcing the provisions of the regulation.  In Ireland, the Commission for Aviation Regulation has been given that function.  The main objective of the new proposal published by the Commission is to clarify some of the legal grey areas which have become evident in the implementation of Regulation 261/2004 and to take account of developments in case law relating to that regulation.  Consumers and airlines alike have had difficulties in interpreting some aspects of regulation 261, which has resulted in number of cases coming before the European courts in recent years.  The new proposal aims to provide clarity on issues such as passengers' right to information on delayed or cancelled flights, their right to assistance or compensation for long delays and for tarmac delays, their right to rerouting within specific timeframes and their rights in the context of missed connecting flights. </p><p> Under Regulation 261/2004, as adopted, air carriers were not required to pay compensation to passengers if they could prove that cancellations were caused by what were termed "extraordinary circumstances."  However, the term was not defined in the regulation and this has given rise to a number of disputes between airlines and passengers over the years.  The new proposal addresses this and defines the term in line with the decision of the European Court as being "Circumstances which are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier and beyond its actual control."  The proposal goes so far as to include a non-exhaustive list of such circumstances.  For example, strikes caused by air traffic controllers or natural disasters are now clearly covered as extraordinary circumstances, and air carriers will not be required to pay compensation to passengers in those circumstances.</p><p> The proposal also introduces a number of new passenger rights which are not currently covered under the regulation.  These include the right for passengers to have misspelled names corrected free of charge by airlines up to 48 hours before departure, the right to carry small musical instruments as cabin baggage and the right to more transparent information on cabin and checked baggage. </p><p> The proposal also aims to strengthen the oversight of air carriers by the enforcement bodies that have been set up at national level and by the European authorities.  It reinforces the co-ordination and exchange of information among the national enforcement bodies throughout the European Union and will oblige airlines to put in place clear complaint-handling procedures and access to dispute resolution mechanisms where disputes arise.  Finally, the new proposal aims to address the disproportionate financial burden that Regulation 261/2004 created in certain circumstances.  For example, it did not place any limits on the assistance that airlines were required to offer to passengers, even in circumstances in which the delay or cancellation was beyond the airline's control.  The current proposal aims to share out the economic burden among airlines, airports and other stakeholders.</p><p> As I outlined, the proposal will be presented to transport Ministers at the next Council meeting on 10 June, but this is just an initial presentation by the Commissioner on the proposal.  Substantive discussions are not likely to get under way in the Council until July under the Lithuanian Presidency.  Following publication of the proposal on 18 March, the Department wrote to a large number of stakeholders inviting them to submit their views on the proposal.  We have received a number of interesting submissions and are examining them in detail.  Clearly, we are also interested in hearing the views of the committee today in order that we can adopt a fully informed position in the negotiations on the proposal when they get under way in the Council in the coming months.</p></speech>

What, if any, interaction has she had with Irish-registered airlines on the document?  Would she welcome the committee's involvement?  Is she satisfied that she has received the combined wisdom of those involved in aviation?</p></speech>

We are also aware of the general views held by the international associations which represent airlines, such as the International Air Transport Association, IATA, ELFAA, which represents low-cost carriers, the Association of European Airlines, IACA and a number of other representative groups.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, recently met the director general of IATA, and it was one of the issues raised with the Minister as the organisation has some concerns about it.</p><p>  Generally, the proposal has been welcomed by the industry.  In the context of the response of the Irish airlines, in general they have welcomed the attempts to clarify the existing law under regulation 261 in many areas.  Of course, they have some concerns about how far the proposal will go in terms of rights to assistance, compensation, etc.</p></speech>

If the information is under privilege we cannot have it.  It would be open to the committee to consider inviting airlines to appear before us or communicate with us directly.</p></speech>

We can ask them if they have any objection to that.</p></speech>

To an extent, we are being asked to scrutinise proposed legislation without all the facts or information.  We will have our own views but, as is generally the case with scrutiny, it is better that we hear all views.  We will have our views as potential passengers.  It would be nice to hear the views of the airlines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.869" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300003#B00800"><p>I thank Ms Brogan for the presentation.  Everyone's worry is that the regulation will lead to extra expenses in terms of administration and enforcement bodies.  On the face of it, it ties up a lot of areas.  We have all been in a position in which we have had to sit and wait when a flight is cancelled.  It has happened many times. </p><p>  Will baggage weight be standardised?  Different airlines have different rules.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus have their own rules and sometimes one is more flexible than the other.  They charge extra fees.  Another issue is wheelchair availability.  I have often seen people struggle to get places on flights.  Will the new regulation help to ensure there is a quota, if necessary, to deal with anyone who is in a wheelchair or needs special seating?</p><p>  On passengers' rights and access to information, from what Miss Brogan said I understand the regulation will make things much clearer.  That has often been a problem.  People have been left sitting and do not know what to do.</p></speech>

In short, the regulation does not give any particular rights to individuals to carry on, say, 20 kg as opposed to 10 kg.</p></speech>

There is already a regulation in place dealing with the rights of such individuals when travelling by air.  The new regulation does not introduce any new rights in that regard, but it does include certain rights in respect of potential damage to equipment.  In addition, it obliges airlines to provide passengers with reduced mobility with a better level of information on the rights they have at airports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Brien" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300004#C00400"><p>The regulation does not go into any detail regarding standardisation of baggage weights.  It merely sets out that passengers must be informed of the restrictions both at the booking process stage and at time of check-in.  As regards weights and dimensions, that is a matter individual to each carrier and there is no specific regulation which establishes a minimum.  There are some operations and regulations in regard to the assessment of weights for passengers and baggage for the safe operation of an aircraft, but the differences exist primarily due to the configuration of each aircraft.  Even within certain carriers' fleets there may be different aircraft types and thus different configurations.  The regulation will merely ensure that passengers are informed of these matters when booking.  The Commission's impact assessment did not go any further in regard to the issue of checked baggage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.875" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethna Brogan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300004#C00600"><p>This regulation relates to air travel only.  There are separate regulations covering other modes of transport.  Regulation 261 of 2004, which is the original regulation dealing with air transport, was the first passenger rights provision introduced by the European Union.  Separate regulations have since been introduced dealing with the other forms of transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.876" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1021" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kenny" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300004#C00700"><p>My second question relates to overbooking.  I recall flying out of an airport in New York some time ago and hearing an announcement over the public address system that passengers willing to forgo a particular flight would be awarded with free hotel accommodation in Paris.  Is that type of inducement strictly legal?  It is putting somebody in a very awkward situation where an airline has overbooked a flight and nobody is willing to forgo their seat.  Is it illegal for carriers to overbook a flight?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-23a.877" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethna Brogan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052300004#C00800"><p>It is not illegal to overbook a flight, which is something that had become fairly widespread practice in the industry in the past.  The original regulation from 2004 set out to address this issue, but there are still instances where airlines, for various reasons, might overbook a flight.  Where a passenger is denied boarding, Article 4 of the new regulations sets out the obligations on the carrier in terms of what that passenger is offered.  The airline must, for example, seek volunteers to forgo their seat but if no volunteer is forthcoming, a suite of rights then comes into play in respect of the passenger who is denied a seat.  He or she must be offered an alternative flight, rerouting and so on.  This issue is dealt with specifically in the regulation, but it is not illegal to overbook a flight.  Overbooking can happen for a number of reasons.</p></speech>

In other words, can the proposals be changed?  Ms Brogan mentioned that they will be brought before the Council in June, which seems very imminent.</p></speech>

In other words, they will be discussed by both Parliament and Council.  The regulation was published only a few months ago and has not yet been introduced for discussion at the Council.  That will happen on 10 June and I expect the discussions will take place over a period of several months, probably spanning the remainder of the year.</p></speech>

Will this allowance be in place of or in addition to the existing on-board conditions which both Ryanair and Aer Lingus operate in this country?  Both carriers, in common with many low-cost airlines, are attempting to dissuade passengers from taking anything at all on board.  So many restrictions are now in place in respect of checked in baggage that it is becoming financially prohibitive for passengers to check in anything.   Most carriers now have a system at each airport where passengers must check whether their item of luggage conforms to particular dimension requirements before they are permitted to take it on board.  Will Ms Brogan clarify whether this proposal means that passengers can take small musical instruments in addition to the standard personal baggage limit and not instead of it?</p></speech>

However, carriers may determine that a musical instrument forms part of a passenger's hand luggage.</p></speech>

Where will passengers put the rest of their personal baggage, the carry-on item or items that usually go into the overhead bins, if they substitute a musical instrument, such as a banjo, guitar, fiddle or lute?  This will generally apply to travelling musicians, for instance, who are performing across Europe.  Many musicians treat their instruments like children and I can understand the origins of this proposals, which probably arises as a consequence of sustained pressure.  However, it will be of no advantage whatsoever if airlines continue to operate their own internal restrictions whereby a passenger can take an instrument but nothing else.</p><p>  My final question relates to the apparent lack of transparency in regard to how fare structures are arrived at by airlines.</p> <p>Consumer groups state that if one goes online between midnight on Saturday night and 1 a.m. on Sunday, one is more likely to obtain cheaper fares than at any other time.  There is no transparency on the part of the airlines with regard to how they have arrive at their fare structures.  Consumers are in the dark as to the point at which it is cheaper to book flights.  Is there anything in the proposals before us which addresses that issue?</p><p> Reference was made to a number of organisations and I accept this might have been in response to a specific question.  Have any of the user groups across Europe or have any of the consumer groups in Ireland submitted proposals?  Is Ms Brogan in a position to indicate the type of matters that are of concern to those groups from the point of view of consumers?</p></speech>

In some cases where a cancellation or delay is caused by another body in the chain - for example, if an airport authority fails to clear snow from a runway and flights cannot take off at their scheduled times - the proposal before the committee will allow airlines to pass on the costs involved to that body.  In reality, the costs of compliance relating to airlines probably are passed on within their fare structures.  They are not borne by the consumer.  The proposal is giving rights to the consumer to compensation in certain instances.  The airlines must pay the costs to which I refer.  Whether they absorb them or pass them on through their fare structures is a commercial matter for them.</p></speech>

In the Irish context, we wrote to the National Consumer Agency, the European Consumer Centre and a number of other consumer bodies.  We received a couple of responses in which the proposal is generally welcomed.  In a general sense, the view of those bodies to which I refer is that the proposal is an improvement on Regulation (EC) 261/2004.  The latter contains many ambiguities and has been the subject of a large number of cases before the European courts.  In such circumstances, the bodies to which we wrote welcomed the clarifications provided in the new proposal and the new additional rights which will be introduced if it is approved.</p></speech>

Airlines should be able to carry musical instruments as checked-in baggage for free.  Difficulties are going to arise in the context of the practical workings of this.  The trend among airlines is towards minimising the amount of material passengers may take on board and they have already introduced severe financial restrictions in place in respect of checked-in luggage.  If the proposal goes through, people will be informed that they can take their musical instruments on board - it will count as carry-on baggage - but they will not be able to take anything else.  There must be clarity on that matter.</p></speech>

On paper, this appears to be an excellent initiative because difficulties with baggage are the bane of people's lives.  I do not just refer to professional musicians in this regard but also to families whose children may be carrying small musical instruments with them as they go on holiday.  All sorts of restrictions have been introduced in this area.  The proposal before us seems to go some way towards addressing the problem but unless clear criteria are set down, the airlines will get around what is proposed.  There is no doubt about that.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to formally propose that representatives from the two major airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, in this country be invited to come before the committee for a debate on this proposal.  Aer Arann could also be included but I am not sure whether it considers itself a subsidiary of Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

At this time we remain within the standstill period required by the treaty to allow national parliaments to consider the issue of the subsidiarity before the paper is placed on the agenda for consideration in detail within Council and with the Commission.  The following comments on the draft text are therefore restricted to a departmental interpretation of the current proposal without the benefit of having consulted with other member states or the Commission in particular detail.  The proposal is consistent with current Government policy, as set out in the national broadband plan, Delivering a Connected Society, which was published by the Minister in August 2012.</p><p>  I propose to speak briefly on the Commission proposal under a number of headings, including a brief background to the introduction of the current Commission proposal in the context of its contribution or its ability to assist us in delivering the Government's national broadband plan, a summary of the obligations arising from the Commission proposal, the qualified nature of the access rights proposed by the Commission, some more detail but nevertheless brief comments on the structure of the proposal and the rights and obligations arising and concluding with the Department's initial views on the Commission's proposal.</p><p>  The narrow objective of the proposed regulation is to reduce the costs and enhance the efficiency of deploying new high speed electronic communications infrastructure by scaling up existing best practices across the EU with a view assisting in the delivery of EU targets to make ubiquitous access to fast or super fast broadband available at fixed locations across the EU by 2020.   The Commission estimates that this initiative will require a significant capital investment across the EU which it estimates will be up &euro;63 billion.  It is widely agreed that civil engineering works - that is taking the cable into the ground or overhead, civil works as we call them in the trade - constitute the dominant part in overall next generation broadband network deployment costs, irrespective of the technology.  Even if one was using wireless technology or digging a trench for the cable, the figure would be in the same ballpark.  The total estimated cost is &euro;63 billion across the EU.  The EU Commission estimates that if these proposals are adopted, costs could be reduced by between 20% to 30%.</p><p>  Following research and consultations by the Commission, the proposal identifies and addresses four main problem areas in delivering next generation broadband access.  The areas identified by the Commission are issues, inefficiencies or bottlenecks concerning the use of existing physical infrastructure such as, for example, ducts, conduits, cabinets and other infrastructure used in the provision of other utility services such as electricity, gas, transport and water.  Bottlenecks relate to co-deployment, inefficiencies regarding administrative permit granting and bottlenecks concerning deployment within buildings.  The buildings would be multi-occupancy units rather than residential single dwellings.  </p><p>  In summary, the regulation, if adopted, would require member states to withdraw any legal text which prohibits other utility infrastructure providers in the electricity, gas, transport and water markets from concluding agreements with next generation network investors to access their networks.  It would require the alternative infrastructure providers to make information under existing and planned infrastructure available if requested.  Such network providers would be required to meet all reasonable requests for access to the networks unless there is good reason not to permit that access.  It would require greater harmonisation in the granting of statutory authorisations to permit construction.  Co-ordination in Ireland would be across local authorities whereas in federal states it would be across the different regions or cantons.  It would also require that new build multi-occupancy development units or any major refurbishment of existing multi-occupancy units, which require planning permission, would make provision for ducting to allow subsequent broadband connections possible.  In other words, the ducts would be installed at the time of construction rather retrofitted and it would require member states to establish administrative dispute resolution processes to provide fast and inexpensive dispute solutions.  </p><p>  These are the main effects of the Commission's proposal.  The access rights to networks of other utilities it is proposed to establish - which are possibly the most controversial - are not absolute rights, rather they are conditional and qualified.  The obligation to allow high-speed broadband providers to access other networks is subject to a number of exemptions, for example, in the case where an alternative network operator already offers a telecommunications product to the market, the competing telecommunications service provider must purchase that product rather than demand a right to lay its own cable, if an alternative operator can demonstrate, on reasonable grounds, the physical infrastructure to which access has been requested is not suitable, if there is a lack of space to host the proposed facilities, if there is a risk to the integrity or security of the network already deployed or if there is a risk of serious interference from the planned electronic infrastructure with the provision of other services.</p> <p>That might arise with the gas market, for example.</p><p> There are a number of exceptions which seem reasonable on the face of it.  The text of the proposal is relatively short.  I will summarise its content as follows on an article-by-article basis if that is of assistance.</p><p> Articles 1 and 2 are procedural in nature, setting out the scope and definitions.  Article 3 establishes the general right of network operators in the electricity, gas, transport and water markets to offer access to their physical infrastructure and imposes an obligation on network operators to meet reasonable requests for access under fair terms and conditions, but subject to the permitted exemptions I have mentioned.  This article also provides for a dispute settlement body to review any refusal to permit access or any unresolved dispute regarding terms and conditions of access.  As is the case throughout the Commission proposal, the role of the dispute resolution body is to provide a fast and inexpensive process which is explicitly without prejudice to the rights of the parties to make applications to the courts.</p><p> Article 4 generates a right of third parties to access a prescribed minimum set of information concerning existing physical infrastructure as well as planned civil works.  It also obligates those network operators to meet reasonable requests for in-site surveys of specific elements of networks to see whether they can assist the telecommunications sector, again, subject to the exemptions to which I referred.</p><p> Article 5 contains an obligation and right to negotiate co-ordination of planned civil works - future planned works - on transparent and non-discriminatory terms.  Article 6 establishes a right of access using electronic means to information regarding statutory obligations which vary across the EU 27.  In administrative terms we are talking about road opening access rights and way leaves.  Provision must be made to allow application for the permission to be made to one contact point within each member state.</p><p> Article 7 establishes an obligation to equip new or renovated multi-occupancy buildings with in-building physical infrastructure or ducts to permit the completion of connections to individual units via a hub located outside the building.  Article 8 allows electronic communications network providers to terminate their network outside the building at the hub to facilitate connections to individual units.  Articles 9 to 11 concern additional procedural provisions regarding the designation of competent bodies and other procedural matters on which I will not dwell.</p><p> We are currently in the stand-still period on this proposal and have not therefore engaged in any detail within Council or with the Commission.  Subject to that proviso, the Department&rsquo;s initial response is to welcome the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  The requirement to allow other network providers to negotiate with telecommunications networks investors is consistent with Government policy set out in the national broadband plan, in so far as it encourages all commercial and non-commercial State bodies to enter into such agreements where that can be done on a commercial basis beneficial to a landowner or infrastructure.  The exemptions permitted in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal seem proportionate and should enable us to resolve any conflicts that might arise on a case-by-case basis.  It is also the case that the right of access is limited to access to existing or planned infrastructure.  Our concern in that regard is that a telecommunications service provider could arrive and say it needs another provider to invest additional funds to allow it to lay its cables.  There is no obligation.  The proposal concerns existing infrastructure only.</p><p> The proposals to harmonise permit granting procedures is also broadly consistent with the national broadband plan which recognises that the more efficient and cost effective the various approval systems are for the roll-out of the required next generation broadband infrastructure.</p><p> The proposed dispute resolution body, which aims to provide timely and inexpensive decisions, should be beneficial to all parties if they come to it in good faith.  In the case of disagreement by any party with a proposed solution, the Commission proposal is explicit in recognising that the dispute can then be referred to the courts.  We are, therefore, of the opinion, at this very preliminary stage of debate at Council, that the Commission proposals are consistent with established national policies on access to alternative infrastructure and on that basis our opening position is that the proposal is a welcome development but subject to detailed debate in due course.</p></speech>

It is sensible.  In the days when we had Telecom, the ESB and water services, I could never understand why a road could be dug up three or four times in a year.  This is the IT equivalent of making sure that a road opening is done once and the services are provided.</p><p>  I understand the principle of subsidiarity.  I also understand the House of Commons concerns that the Commission has failed to satisfy both limbs of the subsidiarity test.  However, I do not fully understand the potential consequences, nor do I understand why the House of Commons is concerned about the principles of subsidiarity in this regard.  I am aware the officials were not party to the debates but have they been in contact with staff in the House of Commons in order to understand their concerns?</p></speech>

I do not presume to speak for any other member state but, normally, if a member state has a particularly strong view on a proposal from the Commission one would expect it to lobby bilaterally.  In other words, it would be in touch with this country, Germany or another country, and say it has particularly strong reservations.  That has not happened.  I am aware that more private companies in the UK are engaged in utilities such as electricity and rail and they might have particular concerns, whereas our State bodies have a public good element to them.  They might be worried about the effect on their balance sheet if somebody else&rsquo;s property is going through their ducts but that is speculation on my part.  The reason we are reasonably comfortable with the proposal is that existing Government policy is consistent with it.  In other words, all the State bodies are encouraged, if it is to their benefit and on a commercial basis, to make their infrastructure available or to negotiate with telecommunications providers on a commercial basis.  I am speculating but it might be the case in Britain that because there is private or commercial ownership that those property owners would have lobbied and in the context of ownership that subsidiarity is a concern.</p></speech>

The nature of the legislation is high-level.  It is at the principal level of facilitation that the advantages can be leveraged from the use of and access to infrastructure.  It is always dependent on the terms and conditions, and that will be worked out at a lower level.  It is not envisaged that the detail of who services the individual infrastructure or the relationships, or whether third party companies will be involved, will be considered at this stage.  It will be down to the detailed negotiation the legislation proposed would take place, and it will be resolved then on a commercial basis between the relevant parties.</p></speech>

It is about rolling out infrastructure, facilitating service delivery and doing things in a quick and efficient manner.  The ultimate delivery of the cost to the consumer then falls into the competition remit.  Telecommunications is a completely liberalised market and one would expect that the competitive forces, which in Ireland are very active in the telecommunications industry, would force the prices down to normal profit levels.</p></speech>

I am aware there is a proposal for a dispute resolution body in the event of disagreement over fair costs for line owners.  Is there a level before the dispute resolution body, or will the effect be that almost every proposal will have to go before this dispute resolution body?  Is that being left to market forces?</p></speech>

In the first instance it depends on the attitude of the two parties coming to the talks.  If, say, the water network provider or the electricity provider is appearing in good faith and is willing to reach an agreement, and the telecommunications investor is willing to reach an agreement, they would do that on a commercial basis.  It is a matter for them.  If the parties cannot reach an agreement there is provision for this dispute resolution body to set in but, ultimately, if either party is dissatisfied with the decision of the dispute resolution body - I see it as a non-binding arbitration or something like the Labour Court, dare one mention the phrase - they have the right to go back to the courts.  One's property rights as they exist in Ireland can be upheld and vindicated, but in the first instance it is about the attitude of the two parties coming to the talks.  If one is an unwilling party, one could foresee going to the dispute resolution body and, if the party remains dissatisfied, going to the courts if necessary for vindication, but there is no way we can compel people to reach agreement.</p></speech>

If we look at a number of the major semi-state companies, the ESB has a great deal of infrastructure, which it shares with numerous telecommunications operators.  For years RTE has made its masts available to facilitate people in putting key infrastructure on high sites.  The mobile operators have come to sharing agreements between themselves.  Rather than building two masts, they now try to consolidate into one mast to reduce the costs.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is another example.  There has been a tradition of sharing and of operators working out these agreements together.  The proof is that the models are in place, they are working, and the industry has been better served by the co-operation agreements reached.  If anything, I would say that the level of co-operation between competing operators and infrastructural providers is increasing.  That is being driven by competitive aspects, and we see the benefit in the costs of telecommunications in our economy.</p></speech>

It is exactly what the Deputy is saying.  If we removed some of the barriers and made access to infrastructure easier they would be able to deploy services further out, particularly in the rural economies, where it is difficult.  To answer the Deputy's question, that is the hope.</p></speech>

I ask in the context of the reference made in the presentation about how there would be access to buildings, private property and so on.  As for the appeals panel, will it cost much and what will be its powers?  The witnesses have outlined to a degree how the system will work when there are contesting parties.  Another interesting point is the Commission has chosen a regulation instead of a directive in this regard, which is significant.  Do the witnesses have an opinion on the reason for this choice?  In addition, while Mr. Dillon stated this proposal complies with Ireland's policy on the expansion of broadband, would this not be better achieved at member state rather than European-wide level?  While I do not wish to go into the subject matter of that policy at present, it appears to be somewhat selective in its roll-out, in that where I come from in County Leitrim, we probably will end up being the last area to get it because of our lack of population density.  There are a number of other things but I do not wish to take up the time of the meeting.  Deputy Colreavy has covered an immense amount of issues in that regard.</p></speech>

This proposal pertains to the provision of infrastructure.

Despite Mr. Dillon's suggestion that people should welcome this proposal - on the face of it, it is akin to stating the obvious that they should welcome it - the fact that an appeals process is being enshrined in the proposal seems to suggest that someone somewhere within the Commission believes this will create difficulties.

The proposal is trying to bring together parties for a common good and a better good.  For example, one might consider an item of restrictive infrastructure, such as where an entity might have ducts going across a key bridge.  While the desire might be to go from one part of an area to another, the nature of the bridge might confine the rolling out of additional infrastructure or make it very difficult - it could be a protected infrastructure or whatever.  If that duct is in place, it is owned by a particular operator that may consider it to be a particular asset it controls and it might use it for competitive advantage, that is, to restrict.  Consequently, an operator could be reluctant to facilitate other competitors availing of that piece of infrastructure.  This proposal is that parties should be aware this infrastructure is in place and there is a way to get across from one part of a bridge to another.  The parties should be able to talk and should reach conclusions on reasonable terms that allow the infrastructure to be shared.  The term, "reasonable terms", is used quite a bit in the legislation and associated documentation.  However, pending someone's refusal to make available such infrastructure, in the greater social good the appeals panel will try to address that.  The purpose of that panel is to serve the good.  Moreover, recognising the sovereignty and subsidiarity issue, the directive is completely without prejudice to the right to go to court as being the ultimate arbiter, in the event of a complete breakdown of negotiations.</p></speech>

I have forgotten the term for it but I understand that Eircom has the line to the house and thereafter, the line goes from outside the house into the house.  Do the witnesses foresee a difficulty in this respect?  Has there been evidence that Eircom has not played ball in this regard?</p></speech>

If one takes the example of the copper wire coming into a house, back in 2001 it was recognised across Europe that not all operators could begin to start running copper wires.  Consequently, a process was put in place, the technical term for which was unbundling the local loop, in which other operators were given the opportunity, on terms.  This principle has worked and across Europe, there are instances of how other operators go as far as the exchange and then use the copper wire used by the incumbent, which has facilitated competition to a great extent.  This proposal is extending it, in that the particular regulation in question simply confined it to the copper wire between the exchange and the house.  However, this proposal pertains to the further infrastructure that is back right across the network.  It is an extension of the same principle.</p></speech>

In some cases, we may have missed the boat because at a local authority level, people have argued that, as is the case in other countries, part of one's planning permission should have made provision for all these services.  It is much easier to do it at that stage than it is to retrofit it.  As it is very expensive to do it through retrofitting, I certainly would welcome that.</p><p>  As for asset owners, railways and roads were mentioned but is there a need to include motorways and tunnels?  Mention also was made about one specific point of contact and the witnesses might explain or expand on what that might be.  In addition, does the Chairman envisage that some stakeholders will appear before this joint committee to discuss this directive or will they simply deal with the Department?</p></speech>

We are trying to catch up and use the opportunity to resolve these issues in respect of civil works that are under way at present.  For example, we have been working closely with the local authorities in respect of road opening licences, on co-ordinating and bringing together the various stakeholders that have an interest in rolling out, building and using infrastructure in order that this information will be available in some central form.  The latter need not be a single organisation or individual.  The draft regulation refers to having web-based and hyperlinked facilities through the owners.  However, the key part of it is that once the access to the information is available for the relevant parties, this will allow the right decisions and engagements to take place.</p> <p>That principle is captured well in the proposed legislation.</p></speech>

In particular, in the definitions section, in Article 2, the definition of "transport services" specifically includes railways, roads, ports and airports.</p></speech>

The principle from inception has been that it is a publicly-owned asset.  It is available to everybody on equal terms.  The maps and locations of the infrastructure were publicly available and advertised and persons were invited to come on open-access terms.  The principle delivered on in the MANs many years ago was the precursor to what is being proposed.</p></speech>
