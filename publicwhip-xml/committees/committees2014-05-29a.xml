There is no issue of holding it back.  It told us it was a process it would go through to proof it legally and so on.</p></speech>

Without qualifying my audit opinion, I have drawn attention to two notes in the financial statements.  Note 2.1 relates to the "going concern" basis of preparation of the financial statements.  It describes the position in regard to NAMA's main funding source, which is in the form of short-term borrowing with a Government guarantee - that is, the senior debt.  Note 3.1 outlines the basis for an incremental impairment charge in 2013 in respect of NAMA&rsquo;s asset portfolio, amounting to &euro;914 million.  This brings the cumulative impairment to &euro;4.1 billion, or 17% of the carrying value of the loans at end-2013.</p><p>  The Act that provided for the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency sets out the key purposes that it was designed to address over its lifetime.  These were to acquire impaired assets from certain credit institutions so as to remove uncertainty from the institutions and stabilise the financial system, to deal expeditiously with the assets, to protect or otherwise enhance their value and, insofar as possible and consistent with those purposes, to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State.  Against that statutory framework, the board of NAMA is required to set strategic objectives and targets to guide its activities.  Under section 226 of the NAMA Act, I am required to carry out periodic reviews of the extent to which NAMA has made progress in achieving its overall objectives.  The report on the findings of the first such review is before the committee today.  I propose to outline the report&rsquo;s findings in just a few key areas.</p><p>  In a statutory order made under the provisions of the NAMA Act, the Minister for Finance defined the classes of eligible assets that NAMA could acquire.  NAMA had discretion to decide whether or not to acquire an eligible asset from the five financial institutions that participated in the scheme.</p> <p>Ultimately, it acquired 90% of the identified eligible loan assets.  It had completed the bulk of the transfers by the end of 2010, based on interim payments in some cases.  All the loan valuations were finalised by March 2012 following completion of the legal due diligence, and resulted in only marginal adjustment of the prices paid.  This was a significant achievement by NAMA given the scale and uncertain nature of the loan books and the inadequate documentation and processes that it found in the banks.</p><p> In the end, NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion for loans and financial derivatives with a face value of &euro;74.4 billion.  The transfer crystallised losses in the banks amounting to &euro;42.6 billion or 57% of the amounts owed by borrowers, and so reduced the uncertainty on their balance sheets in respect of those assets.  Some residual uncertainty remains about the value to the banks of &euro;1.6 billion worth of subordinated bonds issued as part payment for the assets, and which do not have a Government guarantee.</p><p> The transfer prices of the loans are subject to assessment by the European Commission because the prices paid include an element of State aid.  By April 2014, the Commission had approved the transfers of only one third of the loans.  The Department of Finance submitted an application to the Commission in February 2014, seeking approval of the remaining loan transfers.</p><p> A key objective set by the NAMA board is that, by the time the agency is wound up, it will have generated enough cash to redeem all of the &euro;30.2 billion of senior debt issued and to cover all NAMA's costs.  It has also set intermediate targets for redemption of the debt.  By the end of 2013, NAMA had met its first intermediate debt redemption target of &euro;7.5 billion, and was holding a further &euro;4 billion in cash and liquid assets.</p><p> The targets set by the board for debt redemption and cash generation are conservative when compared to the detailed debtor cash flow projections prepared by NAMA each year, and which are NAMA's best estimate of the amount and timing of the cash it will receive from individual debtors.  This is illustrated in Figure 3.8, which indicates that NAMA generated cash in excess of its targets in both 2012 and 2013, but that this was significantly less than the cash flow amounts projected for those years.</p><p> By the end of 2013, NAMA had realised around &euro;10.5 billion in loan and property disposals.  Three quarters of the disposals were in Great Britain with the bulk of these in London.  Around 15% of the disposals related to assets in Ireland.</p><p> The proceeds from disposals up to the end of 2012 were around &euro;1 billion greater than the value of the properties when NAMA acquired the associated loans.  The surpluses were derived only from disposals in London.  Given than NAMA did not record client information centrally, it is not known to what extent NAMA had invested directly in the assets after acquisition, or if developers had retained funds for use.  As a result, the rate of return - or loss - on the disposals in each region is not known.  Within the disposals, we were able to establish that sales of loans up to the end of 2012 had yielded &euro;1.4 billion, representing 9% more than the carrying value of the loans, as indicated in Figure 5.3.</p><p> Much of the property collateral related to NAMA loan assets has the potential to yield rent and NAMA has taken steps to ensure that it benefits from such income.  By the end of 2013, it had realised around &euro;3.6 billion in non-disposal income, mainly from rents.  NAMA received around &euro;800 million in rental and other non-disposal receipts in 2013, but the value of such income has fallen year-on-year as high rent yielding assets were disposed of.</p><p> NAMA also provides funding to debtors to enhance or develop suitable properties.  It had directly advanced around &euro;1 billion to debtors by the end of 2012 and had approved debtors to retain a further &euro;0.6 billion.  NAMA has set a minimum expected return of 15% on cost before it will invest in a project.  Members may wish to note that this is an overall cash return over the project life, and not a required minimum annual rate of return.</p><p> The Act requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State in the context of acquiring, protecting, enhancing and disposing of assets.  In my view, NAMA's stated objectives to redeem at least its senior debt and to cover its costs are relevant to its performance, but such cash management targets are not an adequate measure of financial return.  The rate of return is a core standard performance measure for investments, but the board has not set an expected or target rate of return.</p><p> When the European Commission assessed the NAMA scheme on its establishment, it considered that normal market operators acquiring similar assets at that time would have required an effective rate of return of around 5% a year.  On that basis, NAMA applied a discount rate of 5% to its projected debtor cash flows to arrive at the value of the loans it took on, as at November 2009.  Since then, several factors have changed NAMA's expectations: for example, the significant decline in Irish property values after November 2009; additional lending to NAMA borrowers; the property price boom in London; and the capture of certain previously unidentified assets from debtors.  The net result of those factors has required NAMA to recognise substantial impairment charges.  Based on NAMA's end-2012 cash flow projections, we estimated that the net impact of those factors has been to reduce NAMA's prospective annual return on its assets to around 3.8%.  After taking account of debt servicing and operating costs, the projected net annual return over NAMA's lifetime would be just under 0.2%.</p><p> In view or the statutory requirement for NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return, I have recommended that the board should set an overall expected or target rate of return for its portfolio of assets, and should measure its performance against this target.  Target rates of return should also be set to inform the choice between disposal and retention of property, and investment decision-making.  These target rates of return, which could be positive or negative, should be revised annually to take account of changing conditions and revised expectations.  The committee may wish to note that the board and I have agreed to differ on these recommendations.  The board's reasoning in this regard is set out in the report.</p><p> At the end of 2012, NAMA projected that it would realise &euro;22.9 billion in disposal receipts in the period 2013 to 2016.  Disposal receipts in 2013 amounted to &euro;3.7 billion, leaving a further &euro;19.2 billion to be achieved in the three years from 2014 to 2016.  We noted that, even if those disposal forecasts are not achieved by a wide margin, NAMA will still be able to meet the intermediate debt redemption target it has set for 2016.</p><p> By the end of 2013, NAMA had disposed of over 60% of its London property.  Future sales will need to come from other markets, principally Ireland, where over 70% of the acquired portfolio is scheduled for disposal between 2014 and 2016.  Projected disposal values depend on significant recovery in Irish property values.  This level of disposal receipts may be difficult to achieve in that timeframe.  NAMA has acknowledged that challenges remain in disposing of its Irish portfolio but has pointed to a heightened level of activity in the Irish property market in late 2013 and into 2014, increased interest from investors and the favourable location of much of its Irish property as positive factors that may facilitate disposal at the projected, or even higher, prices.</p><p> NAMA has also set a number of objectives designed to contribute to a sustainable level of activity in the Irish property market, and to the social and economic development of the State.  However, it has stated that actions in these areas must be consistent with the objective of recovering all of the State's costs, and so are subordinate to the key commercial objectives.</p><p> Included in this group of activities is NAMA's offer of residential accommodation units for social housing purposes.  Up to the end of 2013, local authorities and housing associations had confirmed demand for over 2,000 units for social housing.  Our review of disposals for social housing purposes found that the units were transferred at prices equal to the current market values.  It should be borne in mind that such transfers take place with NAMA's approval, but in the context of debtors seeking to reduce their indebtedness to NAMA to the maximum extent possible.</p><p> Other matters are set out in the report which I am happy to explain should the members wish to discuss them.</p></speech>

I will first comment briefly on our results for 2013 before discussing the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s progress report.  I understand that a copy of our annual report and financial statements and a presentation summarising our 2013 results have been circulated to members and, for that reason, I do not propose to comment on them in any great detail in this statement.</p><p>  For 2013, we have reported an operating profit before impairment of &euro;1.2 billion, a 45% increase on 2012.  Taking into account an impairment charge of &euro;914 million, profit after impairment, tax and dividends was &euro;211 million, broadly in line with that of 2012.  Our 2013 results incorporate the impact of a comprehensive review of impairment provisioning, including analysis of the smaller debtor connections which are being managed on our behalf by the banks.</p><p>  Excluding cash-flows arising from the sale of IBRC assets, we generated cash of &euro;4.5 billion in 2013.  This included the proceeds of asset disposals by debtors and receivers, the proceeds of our own loan sales and non-disposal receipts, mainly rental income.  From inception to last Friday, 23 May, NAMA had generated &euro;18.6 billion in cash, including &euro;14.1 billion from asset disposals.  Some &euro;3.5 billion of this has been generated in the first five months of 2014.</p><p>  We have been very active in terms of sales in the early part of this year.  We are close to completing the sale of some &euro;5.7 billion in par debt value loans relating to our Northern Ireland portfolio, code-named Project Eagle.  We recently closed the sale of a major debtor loan portfolio with nominal loan balances of &euro;1.8 billion.  This is in addition to a number of other portfolio sales which have been concluded over recent months and some other portfolios which are currently on the market.</p><p>  Not only is there strong demand for Irish assets at the moment but purchasers are willing to pay what we consider to be fair value for them.  During the period up to the end of 2012, the period covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s progress report, demand for Irish assets was very limited and potential purchasers were generally interested only in transacting at fire sale prices.  Thankfully, market conditions are now much more positive and we are keen to take advantage of that to the greatest extent possible, subject to the proviso that we can continue to transact at prices that make commercial sense for us.</p><p>  Section 226 of the NAMA Act 2009 requires that, as soon as may be after 31 December 2012 and every three years thereafter, the Comptroller and Auditor General must assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives.  As members will be aware, the Minister for Finance is separately required, under section 227 of the Act, to assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives and the Minister has stated that he intends to be in a position to publish his findings by the end of June or in early July.</p><p>  From NAMA&rsquo;s perspective, we welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s section 226 report and we consider it to be broadly positive in its assessment of the progress that NAMA has made to date.  Understandably, perhaps, given that the report&rsquo;s focus is largely on the period from 2010 to 2012, it does not fully reflect the major progress that has been made in the 17 months since December 2012, particularly the improvement in the Irish economy and property market.</p><p>  At one stage, the taxpayer was faced with a contingent liability of over &euro;43 billion relating to NAMA and IBRC.  This comprised &euro;30 billion arising from the senior bonds that NAMA issued in 2010 and 2011 and an additional &euro;12.9 billion in senior bonds that NAMA used to purchase the IBRC floating charge from the Central Bank as part of the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013.  By the end of this year, we expect that the contingent liability associated with NAMA will have reduced from &euro;43 billion to &euro;15 billion.  Current indications are that the cash proceeds of the IBRC sales process will be sufficient to enable NAMA to redeem all of the &euro;12.9 billion in senior bonds that we issued to the Central Bank.  In addition, the stronger performance of the Irish market over the past year has enabled us to accelerate the sale of Irish assets securing our loans.  This, in turn, has meant that we have been in a position to exceed the bond redemption targets that we had initially set for 2014.  In addition to the &euro;2.75 billion redeemed in 2013 and the &euro;3 billion redeemed in March 2014, we aim to redeem another &euro;2.5 billion over the coming weeks and an additional &euro;2 billion by the end of this year.  If achieved, this would mean the redemption of 50% of the original senior bonds by the end of 2014 and would leave a residual &euro;15 billion outstanding at that stage.  Subject to market conditions, we aim to make substantial progress on further reducing this over the course of 2015 and 2016.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s progress report contains a great amount of detail about our activities, particularly during the initial phase of the agency&rsquo;s existence from 2010 to 2012.  For much of this period, we were in the process of establishing the agency, including the recruitment of staff with the expertise and experience to carry out our statutory mandate.</p><p>  Recruitment was, of necessity, an orderly process, not least because in NAMA&rsquo;s case we were in a position to offer potential recruits only specified purpose contracts which expire when our work has been completed.  With over 350 professional staff now on board, we are adequately staffed to undertake the intensive and detailed asset and loan management work required to carry out the statutory functions assigned to us, including managing our assets to extinguish the State&rsquo;s contingent liability.</p><p>  In parallel with recruitment, we also had to make the necessary arrangements to carry out a major transaction for which there was no precedent in terms of scale and complexity: the valuation and transfer of loan balances of &euro;74 billion from five financial institutions.  Sweden is often quoted as a parallel but its corresponding state asset management operation - which was called Securum - had assets of only &euro;6 billion by comparison.  The report has looked in considerable detail at the loan valuation and acquisition process and it has concluded that the property valuation, legal due diligence and loan valuation processes were adequate and complied with the regulations made by the Minister.  The section 226 report describes this as a very significant achievement by NAMA in a relatively short time, given the scale of the task as well as the inadequate documentation and processes that we found in the banks.</p><p>  Bearing in mind that the last time we appeared before this committee, in December 2013, we were faced with serious but unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing relating to the loan acquisition and valuation process, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s conclusions in respect of this major area of our work is particularly welcome and reassuring.</p><p>  We are also pleased that the report, based on analysis of NAMA&rsquo;s performance to date and of our operating cash flow estimates, has concluded that, unless there is a further significant economic downturn in the next few years, NAMA will generate sufficient cash to meet its minimum key objective of redeeming the senior debt.  Our own analysis indicates that we will repay the senior and subordinated debt.  Given that the value of Irish collateral fell by about 25% after we acquired it, we consider it to be a notable achievement that we are now talking of the possibility of at least breaking even over our lifetime.  Meeting this objective is very important for us given that the senior debt that we issued was guaranteed by the Minister and is, therefore, a contingent liability on Irish taxpayers.</p><p>  There has been some press comment over recent days to the effect that NAMA expects to make a surplus of &euro;1 billion over its lifetime.  Our current expectation, based on our most recent forecast analysis and assuming a phased and orderly disposal of assets, is that we will repay our senior and subordinated debt, and there is a possibility that we may be able to generate a surplus but we are not at this stage able to speculate as to the size of such a surplus.  Attaining a surplus is dependent on a number of economic and timing factors which are beyond NAMA&rsquo;s control but, based on current conditions, our outlook would be positive.  Needless to say, the fact that NAMA may do better than anybody expected has ramifications well beyond itself as it concerns the wider economy.</p><p>  The report expresses some doubts as to whether NAMA can achieve its Irish asset disposal targets.  I wish to make a number of comments on this opinion.  NAMA&rsquo;s exposure to Irish assets is largely urban-centric, with 92% based in Dublin, the Dublin commuter belt, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  As one will see from the presentation sent with our annual report, we have limited exposure to other regions in Ireland.  It is very important to make a distinction between the aggregation of the disposal targets that we set for individual debtors and the overall targets that need to be achieved in order to enable us to generate sufficient cash to meet the board&rsquo;s debt redemption targets.</p><p>  In line with normal commercial practice, ambitious but realistic cash targets are set for debtors in the expectation that, for various reasons, those targets are sometimes unlikely to be met in the aggregate.  Planned asset sales, for instance, may not proceed as originally scheduled in a particular year and will accordingly be rescheduled for a later period.  Given the reality that not all debtor disposal targets will be met in any given year, NAMA must set aggregate targets for debtors which are well in excess of the cash target that is set by the board in order to meet debt redemption targets.  Typically, the latter would be 60% to 70% of the former.  Hypothetically, for instance, individual disposal targets totalling &euro;5 billion would be set for debtors in the expectation that 70%, which is equivalent to &euro;3.5 billion, will be achieved.</p> <p>In each year of the existence of NAMA, so far, the board&rsquo;s annual cash target has been exceeded, thereby enabling us to meet our debt redemption targets.  It is not, therefore, in our view reasonable for a judgment on NAMA&rsquo;s prospects of achieving its Irish disposal targets to be based on the aggregate disposal target set for debtors.  This will inevitably be much higher than the minimum that will need to be achieved.</p><p> Second, we consider that the report does not give sufficient weight to the much improved conditions which have prevailed in the Irish market since the second quarter of 2013.  Up to early 2013, Irish assets could only be sold on an asset by asset basis and demand was, at best, sporadic.  In the past year investors have been willing to increase substantially their exposure to the Irish market.  This has enabled NAMA and others to sell asset and loan portfolios in sizeable volumes.</p><p> On pages 33 and 34 of the progress report we outline some of the reasons for our positive outlook.  We estimate that we will need to sell about &euro;6 billion in Irish assets from 2014 to 2016 through a combination of packaged property sales, individual property sales and loan sales.  Bearing in mind the success of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation sales process and our own success in selling assets and loans secured on Irish property in the past year, we consider an annual Irish sales target of &euro;2 billion to be achievable, assuming continuation of recent benign conditions in the Irish market.  Of course, if these benign conditions do not endure, we will be commercially sensible and adapt our strategy and targets to the changed market conditions.</p><p> Given that selling assets, mainly through our debtors and receivers, is an important element of our business, it is crucial for us that we achieve the best price available in the market in any asset sale and, for that reason, we place a major emphasis on the open marketing of assets.  Having examined a sample of 144 property disposals, the report concludes that &ldquo;overall, almost all had been sold through an open competitive process or with testing of disposal prices against market valuation&rdquo;.  The report goes on to state this provides reasonable assurance that the prices obtained by NAMA were the best on offer in the market at the time a property was sold.  In four of the 144 cases sampled the report states there was no evidence the properties had been openly marketed.  The gross disposal value in these four cases was about &euro;500,000.  We disagree with the report&rsquo;s conclusion that there was no open marketing.  We have looked in detail at the four cases and are satisfied, based on evidence available to us and that we have since provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General's team, that the assets were openly marketed.</p><p> The report includes several recommendations on how we conduct our business.  Some of the recommendations are ones we have no difficulty in accepting.  We consider them to be sensible in terms of the evolution of our business.  Several others were examined by the NAMA board but not accepted.  I will refer to two in particular.  Recommendation No. 3.1 states the board should set an overall expected or target rate of return and measure overall performance against this target.  Recommendation No. 5.1 states the board should set targets for the overall return on disposals and property held by debtors and insolvency practitioners and that performance should be measured against these targets.  The board has reviewed these recommendations and taken the view that such target rates of return would not be an appropriate metric for its business on the basis that they would act as an unnecessary constraint on its flexibility.  In taking this view we are cognisant of the need to be open to commercially sensible disposal opportunities whenever they arise.  We are also mindful of the stated view of the Minister for Finance, reiterated this week at the launch of our 2013 annual report, that NAMA&rsquo;s main focus should be on reducing the State&rsquo;s contingent liabilities as quickly as is feasible.</p><p> Moody&rsquo;s recently upgraded Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating by two notches and, when doing so, highlighted the progress made by NAMA in the disposal of the IBRC portfolio in bringing about a &ldquo;very sharp reduction&rdquo; in Government contingent liabilities.  NAMA cannot afford to ignore the wider public and national interest.  For that reason, we are acutely conscious of the contribution our deleveraging activity makes to the overall Irish economic and financial recovery.  NAMA is not a long-term investment fund which would be in a position to set target rates of return for its assets and then wait indefinitely for these targets to be achieved.  The agency was created in the midst of a crisis and its primary purpose, under section 10 of the NAMA Act, was to acquire property loans from banks so as to reduce their excessive exposure to that sector, as well as obtaining the best achievable financial return for the State on these loans.</p><p> Importantly, under section 10, we were required to conduct our work expeditiously.  The idea was that NAMA would make a major contribution to the normalisation of conditions in the financial system but that it would not be a permanent feature of the landscape thereafter.  Therefore, we never saw ourselves as having the same frame of reference as would an investment fund.  Unlike such a fund, we had little or no discretion as to which assets we acquired and no control over the prices we paid for them.  An investment fund, on the other hand, has complete discretion in its asset selection and will only invest in assets which it expects to yield a positive return, be it over a short, medium or long-term horizon.  We had no expectation that each and every asset we acquired would yield a positive return.  In the first three years after our loan acquisition, Irish property prices declined.  Despite this, our initial minimal objective of taking the positive with the negative was to break even over our lifespan.  We remain confident that we will break even, but, based on our current outlook, there is a strong possibility that we will achieve it over a shorter timespan than was initially envisaged.  Our objective is to optimise the realised value of our acquired assets, but we do not have an open-ended horizon in which to do so.  For that reason, we do not consider it would be appropriate to use performance metrics which would be relevant in the case of a discretionary long-term portfolio but not for the task we have been asked to carry out.  Unlike other public entities, the NAMA Act specifically provides that the Minister may dissolve NAMA as soon as he considers it has fulfilled its purposes.  Therefore, given that NAMA has no control over how long it stays in business, it is prudent for us to assume that we are operating to a short to medium-term timeframe and to adopt the appropriate deleveraging strategy to extinguish the contingent liability, as well as the appropriate performance metrics to match that timeframe.</p><p> We are happy to discuss these or any other issue the committee may wish to raise with us arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s progress report and our 2013 annual report.</p></speech>

NAMA is a commercial organisation.  When it was established, the European Commission put in place a stipulation that it use a discount rate of 5% for future cash flows.  In essence, it accepted a benchmark would be a 5% annual rate of return.  If NAMA gives money to developers to do work, it looks for a 15% rate of return.  Why does it not apply the same standards to itself?</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General spoke about the low rate of return on property disposals and rental yields.  The fact that the overall sum of moneys retained by debtors to develop or enhance properties is not known is not good.  It is &euro;600 million of taxpayer's money, but there is no record.  A corner shop would have better records.</p><p>  Last year NAMA provided for an impairment charge of &euro;517 million, but this year that figure has nearly doubled to &euro;914 million.  It made an operating profit last year, after impairment, of &euro;308 million.  This year the figure will be &euro;283 million, which is more or less the same.  Were NAMA&rsquo;s profits overstated last year?  Why is there such a large impairment charge this year?</p><p>  Being an accountant like my good self, Mr. McDonagh will appreciate that when one hands out moneys on behalf of the taxpayer, one looks for a rate of return.  NAMA was given &euro;32 billion on behalf of the taxpayer.  In reality, it was given &euro;74 billion as that is the gross figure for the loans it took over.</p> <p>The amount the NAMA paid with a 57% discount was &euro;32 billion so the discount was &euro;43 billion.  A total of &euro;64 billion worth of taxpayers' money went into the banks.  I do not like the fact that the return is based on the &euro;32 billion - the amount NAMA paid.  I was there when the legislation went through the D&aacute;il.  NAMA was set up to recover the maximum amount for the taxpayer, not just the amount that was paid because, ultimately, the lower the value NAMA got the assets at, the easier it was for it to make a return.  Equally, a discount of &euro;43 billion was applied.  The rate of return should not just be on what NAMA paid for the loans.  In his statement, Mr. McDonagh said that NAMA must look at section 10 of the legislation to do it expeditiously.  He is not giving the full facts there.  Section 10 states that &quot;So far as possible, NAMA shall, expeditiously and consistently with the achievement of the purposes specified in<i>subsection (1)</i>, obtain the best achievable financial return for the State&quot;.  Section 10 then speaks about the cost to the Exchequer of acquiring bank assets and dealing with acquired bank assets, NAMA's cost of capital and other costs and any other factor which NAMA considers relevant to the achievement of its purposes.<br/>I accept that it is a balancing act but the worry here is that NAMA is chasing the cash dragon rather than looking after the profit side as well.  The taxpayer is our main interest in this committee and I accept that it is a balancing act.  Could Mr. McDonagh address the rate of return and the fact that &euro;600 million of taxpayers' money has been given to developers without any records?  Does NAMA know how this money is being spent?  Could Mr. McDonagh address the fact that NAMA has no rate of return for either property or the rental yields and why it fought the Comptroller and Auditor General so hard in respect of providing a rate of return?</p></speech>

We just have a difference of opinion.  In terms of the rate of return, the issue is that section 10 requires us to get the best achievable return by reference to what we paid for the assets, any additional moneys we give out and any costs incurred.</p></speech>

The original intention was to stabilise the market and get the maximum return.  NAMA is not just about getting back the &euro;32 billion it spent.  If that is the case, it becomes nothing more than an asset recovery vehicle.  When NAMA was established in the legislation, the Minister at the time said that it was a work-out vehicle and not a liquidation vehicle and could take the longer view on borrowers and assets if it made commercial sense to do so.  There is a balancing act here.  I am nervous that NAMA is just becoming about recovering the &euro;32 billion with no other remit.  It was supposed to have a social remit.  I did not mean to cut across Mr. McDonagh but I just want to put it in context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014052900008#G00400"><p>The &euro;32 billion is just a first base in terms what to recover.  We are very cognisant as people who live in the country that there is a huge hole created by the banks.  We acquired the loans for whatever price we had to pay for them under European Commission rules.  If we can get back more than &euro;32 billion, we will do our very best to do so.  The reality is that over-lending occurred before we acquired the loans.</p><p>  In terms of the rate of return, I should highlight something in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Under the EU approved mechanism, there is a table on page 22 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that says that NAMA, in contrast to anybody else who is buying in the market, overpaid for these assets from day one by 22%.  Therefore, even though we paid &euro;32 billion for them, a private equity house would only have paid about &euro;26 billion for them.  It is at the bottom of page 22 on the right hand side.  Therefore, one is starting off with that.</p><p>  The second thing one is starting off with is the fact that the Irish property market, as we all know, had a significant decline of around 25% post-acquisition as well.  Therefore, we were starting off in a situation with a very deep economic crisis having overpaid for the assets so we were down about 35% all in very early on in the process.</p></speech>

It was not based around the traditional model of acquiring at market value at a moment in time.  It was based around long-term economic value.  Basing it purely on a market proposition does not wash.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014052900008#G00600"><p>What I have explained is that we are not the same as an investment fund, which would have paid 22% less for the assets on day one.  We have overpaid for the assets by 22% on day one.  From the very beginning, our objective has been to complete our work by 2020 and everybody was hoping that NAMA would have its work completed by 2020, which was a reasonable long-term horizon set by the board of NAMA in its first business plan.  What we are saying to the committee today is that 18 months ago, people were always saying that there was a big black hole in NAMA and that it would never even recover the &euro;32 billion.  We are saying today that we hope to at least recover the &euro;32 billion and a bit more because there has been a big improvement in the market.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman spoke about NAMA looking for a 15% return.  This relates in particular to a small part of the loan book where we are given development capital in terms of the asset management division.  The majority of the loan book basically involves trying to recover money on loans where, effectively, the margin on those loans is set by the board's pricing rate, which is 2.5% over six months LIBOR.  That is the return we are trying to get.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman said that the European Commission expects a return of 5% but that is what is happening in our financial statements.  Under International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, we are accruing income in our financial statements at 5% per annum.  Therefore, one ends up with a bottom line of &euro;200 million profit after accruing at 5% per annum taking account of all one's costs and if there is an impairment that hits one's bottom line.</p><p>  In respect of yields on individual properties, we do not own the underlying properties.  If one looks at an office portfolio, the yields on the office sector 18 months ago were probably generating 8% per annum.  They are now about 6% per annum.  Therefore, yields shift over time. Yields are driven by two things.  They are obviously driven by demand.  One can produce a high yield but one might not be able to have a very good tenant.  One wants to have a strong covenant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014052900008#G00700"><p>Mr. McDonagh is giving me an overview in terms of the market.  I am asking very straightforward questions.  NAMA is an organisation with an asset value of &euro;36 billion overall, yet it is not willing to have any benchmark in terms of return on investment in both property or interest.  I do not know any other State organisation where this would apply.  Why would NAMA not have a rate of return and then deal with the specific peculiarities of the agency?  The problem concerns how one benchmarks how NAMA is doing.  We see &euro;200 million per annum but NAMA was not set up as simply an asset recovery agency.  It was set up to work in many other dimensions, obviously within a specific timeframe.  Mr. McDonagh says it is not long-term so it is very difficult to be able to come up with the standard measure of return on investment, which I accept.  At the same time, it is necessary, particularly in terms of the taxpayer, that there is some form of benchmarking.</p><p>  I am still asking the question: "Why not?"  I accept if Mr. McDonagh feels that the traditional model is not appropriate, but why not deal with it in a hybrid way or some other way so there is a rate of return and we can look at it?  It also gives NAMA benchmarks in terms of being able to sell assets.  The question is then what criteria NAMA can even apply.  Any of the large multinationals or companies have a strict norm where they look for a return on capital before they will even consider an investment.  If it is below a certain level, they will not touch it.  The committee is asking why NAMA is making certain decisions and what benchmarking it is using.</p> <p>Will you now reconsider, based on what the Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended, the provision of a return on capital employed or on investment, or some other measure that can act as a benchmark?  This applies in most other sectors.  When NAMA invests taxpayers' money it considers the investment in terms of a return of 15%.  While I accept that it is using a particular model, it is still a form of return on investment.</p></speech>

The reality is that NAMA was a State response and an involuntary purchaser of assets because it was the only purchaser of assets.  I fully accept the point that NAMA is in a different space from most other entities.  This was not lightly passed over by the board of NAMA when it reviewed the recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General, but we have to be mindful that we operate under certain constraints in that the Government's clear position is that it wants us to extinguish the contingent liability as quickly as possible.  We are trying to do that in a way that avoids any additional costs to the taxpayer while recovering as much as possible of what was paid for the assets and, hopefully, an amount above that.  That is the board's position.  It was discussed by the board, although I am not saying it is something the board will not revisit.  However, as the Vice Chairman pointed out, it is not an easy circle to square in the context of NAMA's diverse objectives and the fact that we are not in total control of our own destiny.</p></speech>

If one takes the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the aggregate, there are benchmarks and conclusions that he has been able to reach in regard to NAMA's performance.  Probably the difference between us is in the concept of an overall rate of return.  The reality is that targets are set in all aspects of NAMA's businesses.  For example, in regard to high-level yield assessments, there is a sense check when an asset is being sold to assess the return we should be getting.  When investments are made by NAMA and they come to the board or through the executive, there is also an assessment of the return we should expect.  The difference between us is probably in the concept of setting an overall rate of return.  From our point of view, the argument against that goes back to the nature of NAMA and the type of vehicle we are, as outlined by Mr. McDonagh in his opening statement and later remarks.  I assure the committee, however, that there are plenty of benchmarks.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General reviewed 144 properties with gross proceeds of &euro;1.3 billion to ascertain how they were dealt with in respect of best practice and prices obtained.  He found that the majority of the properties were fine but he had further queries in respect of 26 properties, or 18%.  In one case, for which details were not provided, a property was sold in Ireland for &euro;27 million.  It had been marketed and a winning bidder had been selected but the bid failed to complete.  Another party competed at the same price but was not on the shortlist.  No evidence was provided to show how the purchaser was selected, and the property was not returned to the market.  Why was returning the asset to the market not considered as an option, why was the eventual purchaser not documented in a more comprehensive manner, and why were the underbidders not given the opportunity to match the price achieved?  Mr. McDonagh probably knows the specific property to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred.  What happened with this property?</p></speech>

The initial preferred bidder offered &euro;27 million and other bidders offered between &euro;16 million and &euro;23 million.  This occurred at a time when no property transactions were taking place in the Irish market in terms of office portfolios.  We went exclusive with a particular bidder, who agreed to pay &euro;27 million for the property.  On the day before the closing, the bidder told us he thought he was overpaying for the property and that he wanted to price chip us by &euro;2 million.  NAMA has a policy of not accepting price chipping because if we start the process of accepting price chipping without good reason everybody could start to go exclusive and chip us at the end.  We told the bidder that we had recently met representatives of an American fund which wanted to invest in Europe.  They had come to visit NAMA and had heard about the property but had missed out on it.  They told us if this property or a similar property came onto the market they would purchase it.  The preferred bidder did not believe us and would only offer the lower price.  We said we had another bidder, were not bluffing and would not sell it at the lower price.</p></speech>

This party had bought only one other asset in Europe, in La D&eacute;fense in Paris, and wanted the second investment to be in Ireland because this country was perceived as a good opportunity.  As the original bidder did not believe us, we gave him a final opportunity to pay &euro;27 million, but he decided he would only give us &euro;25 million.  We asked the agent asked whether the underbidders would pay us &euro;27 million but the agent's advice was that &euro;23 million would be the maximum offer.  We rang the representatives of the American fund on the Monday to tell them that we were putting the property back on the market because the bidder did not complete at &euro;27 million.

Apart from having a traditional commercial property remit when it was set originally, NAMA had a social housing remit.

They have to decide which ones they want.  Then they have to line up what they call approved housing bodies, such as Focus Ireland, Cl&uacute;id and other organisations like that, which will take the lease on these properties.  Once they tell us they will take the lease and sign it, we will commit the funding to complete the properties.  The reality is that many of these properties are probably between 60% and 70% complete and once we have a lease in place, it makes it commercial for us to put in the additional money to fix up the premises and deliver it.  That timeframe is outside our control but once we get the lease, we get on and do it.</p><p>  The good news is that by the end of this year we will deliver 1,100 of these units.  The local authorities, for various reasons, rejected 1,600 of the units we offered them.  We are in discussions with one local authority in Dublin regarding 500 of the 1,600 units which we put the money in to complete in the meantime, and they should be available in October.  The local authority, because of the housing crisis, is now looking at taking those 500 units.  If it takes them, we will have delivered 1,600 rather than 1,100 units, which is welcome in the circumstances.</p></speech>

The receiver would not take the receivership as part of the prepack receivership because of this legal threat and, therefore, the only option available at the time, which we proposed to management, was examinership.  The examinership was successful and the 700 jobs were saved.  That was very important at the end of the day.</p></speech>

If we were setting a benchmark, for example, at the beginning of 2013, with the state the market was in then and the interest in Irish property and the investment interest here, and given what happened later in 2013, I think we would have had a fairly continuous revision of that benchmark and we would have been explaining why it was overachieved or exceeded.

Do the witnesses believe there is a property bubble in Dublin?

However, the reality is that the Irish property market had dropped 25% in the first three years after acquisition.  We still have to generate cash.  Let us not forget that one of the targets set by the troika for the Government was for NAMA to redeem &euro;7.5 billion of its debt by the end of 2013.  Sometimes we had to take the decision that we needed to sell things in certain quantity to get the cash in, but on the basis that we fundamentally believed that was probably the best price one was going to get no matter what the market circumstance was.  So they are difficult decisions; they are not decisions that are taken lightly, but they stand up, and there is rationale for each of those decisions, which Comptroller and Auditor General sees.</p></speech>

The witnesses have dealt with the issue of the target rate of return in some detail.  I wish to examine it some more.

The Comptroller and Auditor General has made several recommendations in his report which we have accepted and some of which we thought were very useful.

However, from the point of view of the taxpayer and the State, it is entirely reasonable that there would be a target rate of return, notwithstanding the need to be expeditious, the variables within the market and the very onerous task NAMA has undertaken.  I am unhappy that NAMA has chosen to set aside that particular recommendation.  I do not believe it augurs well for NAMA as an agency.</p><p>  The witnesses cited the need to be expeditious and the fact that NAMA does not have an indefinite time horizon as part of its rationale for not accepting this recommendation for a target rate of return.  Deputy O'Donnell has pointed to the function of NAMA and the fact that it is not a vehicle for a mass fire sale of assets.  It has to be expeditious but it has no permission to be reckless.  Regarding NAMA's resistance to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation of a target rate of return, I believe NAMA may have taken the views of the current Minister, Deputy Noonan, which I note Mr. McDonagh echoed in his opening statement.  He told us, "We are also mindful of the stated view of the Minister for Finance - reiterated this week at the launch of our 2013 Annual Report - that NAMA&rsquo;s main focus should be on reducing the State&rsquo;s contingent liabilities [that is okay] as quickly as is feasible."</p><p>  My concern is that in whatever interaction the witnesses have had with the Minister for Finance they have picked up on a political signal to wind things up quickly - the witnesses would use the term "expeditiously".  On that basis, NAMA has given that priority over what I believe to be a very reasonable recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General and one that would be in the broader interest of the agency and the taxpayer.  What does Mr. McDonagh make of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014052900011#K02200"><p>May I make one important point on that?  I have never discussed with the Minister the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation in relation to an overall rate of return.  From my point of view, that was a consideration by the NAMA board and a conclusion independent of the NAMA board.  It has never been discussed with the Minister either during the process of the report or in our response to the report - although obviously, in our response to the report, the Minister would be aware of our conclusions.  However, he has never discussed it with me.</p><p>  In regard to the Minister's view or anybody's view about NAMA and its lifespan, I think everybody in this country has a view on NAMA's lifespan.  The Minister has on occasion emphasised the fact, which is in the Act - and I think it has been understood right from the beginning - that NAMA should act expeditiously but responsibly and in a balanced way.  I would argue that is what we have been doing.  We have had the 2.26 review by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the 2.27 review by the Minister and the Department of Finance, and I have no doubt that the degree of expeditiousness will feature quite significantly in that review.</p><p>  We have already said publicly - I have said it publicly and Mr. McDonagh has said it publicly - that having regard to the interest in Ireland, having regard to the portfolio of our assets and having regard to our capacity to generate cash and be very confident about repaying the senior debt, which is really the top priority all the time, and confident about paying the sub-debt - this year we paid a coupon on that for the first time, which was of value to the banks that hold that debt - we are well poised to finish our business before the 2020 estimate that has always been out there.  Whether it will be in 2018 or whatever, I do not know as yet.</p></speech>

I am not disputing that.  What I am disputing with Mr. Daly is the appropriateness of his setting aside a recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the rate of return.  Taking account of the variables of which we are all very well aware, that was a reasonable recommendation, made by a person who holds a constitutional office.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is not just anybody.  He and his office are those to whom we as a committee look and, by extension, the taxpayers rely on for transparency as well as expeditious operation.  As Mr. Daly did not agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General on that point, he is hardly likely to agree with me.  However, I did not want to let it go without marking the cards of the board.  I accept it has to go about its business but it should not have the luxury of cherry-picking recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is my strongly held view on it.</p><p>  On the issue of open marketing, I thank Mr. McDonagh for his explanation in respect of 26 of the 144 cases and the &euro;27 million.  Did the agency learn any lessons from the queries that arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation of these matters?  Has NAMA tightened up procedures or made any changes to address those issues?</p></speech>

Everybody can improve.  That is well accepted by us.  We started off with no systems and by doing everything in Excel and Word.  We now have in place a document management system and a portfolio management system.  Because we also use the original banks from whom we bought the loans, part of the exercise involves getting the necessary documentation from them and attaching it to each transaction dating back to the commencement of NAMA.  That exercise is well under way.  That said, in regard to whether I wish in terms of the four cases concerned we had had explanations for the Comptroller and Auditor General report, I do, but we had to go back to the original agents and get letters from them showing that they were being openly marketed.  We always believed they were openly marketed but they were small transactions done under a dedicated authority with the financial institutions.  We had to step into the process with the agents to get the information.</p></speech>

They might not be the type of product they needed in that location, or there are concentration issues.  The local authorities seem to operate to a standard whereby they only like 20% social housing in a particular area.  If we are offering units over and above that, they might well decide that they do not want them in that area.  It is purely their decision, not our decision.</p></speech>

A receiver or a debtor is trying to earn money or trying to pay back his debt.  We can tell them to hold them for three or six months until the local authority makes its decision and if it does not make a decision in that time and they want to put these properties on the market or to let them or sell them, we cannot prevent that.  We can only hold them for a certain period of time.</p></speech>

First, the approved housing bodies and local authorities were getting a capital grant from the Government to buy the units.  The Government then said it no longer had the money to give them capital grants but said it would guarantee the lease payments instead.  It took a while for them to accept the changed business model.</p><p>  The other issue was that each approved housing body operated with different leases.  There were different leases for each approved housing body, so NAMA decided that as it was going to be giving the leases to approved housing bodies it developed a standardised lease.  This standardised lease is used all the time now.  It does not change from one approved housing body to the next body.  We also set up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, that would acquire the units from the debtors or receivers and take them out of the picture as an intermediary.  We would buy the units onto the balance sheet and we would do the lease with the approved housing body on a standardised lease.  We have done everything to streamline our end of the process.  Once the lease is signed, we go on and spend the money to finish off the lease.</p></speech>

We have dealt with the figures, so we will look at the completed contracted units.  The figures for Wicklow County Council, Waterford County Council, Waterford City Council, Sligo County Council, Offaly County Council and Mayo County Council are all zero.  Does Mr. McDonagh understand what I am saying?  It is also zero for Donegal County Council.  The figure is 53 for Cork city, a big urban area.  In Dublin city it is 163.  It is lower in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Fingal and so forth.  I am not necessarily attributing responsibility for this to Mr. McDonagh or NAMA but I am conscious that, for the public, each time the Government addresses the issue of what it will do about housing and homelessness, NAMA is referenced in that regard.  If not the first, almost the second word out of the Government's mouth seems to be "NAMA".  Many people's expectations are now being pinned, by the Government, on the agency in respect of addressing these issues.  However, when one examines the figures, it is lamentable that there are only 684 completed units.  Is it not pathetic given the scale of the problem we have?</p></speech>

When does he propose to meet the Minister, Deputy Hogan, next and what does he propose to say to him?  Will he make demands of him?  The agency is now in the middle of this, as far as the public is concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014052900013#M04400"><p>We meet regularly with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am not sure when the next meeting is scheduled but I am sure it will be shortly.  We go through the figures and the bottlenecks.  All I can say on behalf of NAMA is that the figures the Deputy has been discussing are the reality of what we have available and it is the reality of what the local authorities or the housing associations are taking from us.</p><p>  As the chief executive has explained, we have put every possible internal mechanism in place to expedite the transfer of these houses from the wish list of the local authorities or the housing association to actual delivery.  To put it in context, NAMA is not the only body, in fact it is not anywhere near the main body, that is responsible for dealing with social housing in this country, but, as the Deputy says, we are now firmly part of the mix.  We will have delivered 1,100 by the end of this year and possibly a great deal more next year.  A total of 1,100 is small compared with the housing list.</p> <p>Let me put it in context.  There were only 1,300 units - houses or apartments - built in Dublin last year.  In that context, it is sizeable.</p><p> If the Deputy wants to move beyond social housing to the other debate taking place about housing, demand and bubbles, again, we have committed to funding the delivery of 4,500 units to 2016.  The Deputy may say 4,500 is not a huge number, but if she puts it in context, of the 1,300 built last year, she will see what NAMA is doing.  We have identified potential sites over which we have control or for which we have security for a further 19,500 to be delivered to, I think, 2020.  We are doing everything that we can; ours is not the only responsible body.</p></speech>

I am not stating NAMA is the primary agency or that it bears primary responsibility for dealing with the homelessness or housing crisis, far from it, entirely the contrary.

The reality is that if a debtor is trying to repay all of his or her debts - some debtors have substantial debts - he or she will try to maximise the return on his or her portfolio.  Clearly, there are downstream effects because of this.  If one is a debtor with huge debts and a lease has expired, he or she is reflecting what is happening in the private sector market.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question on their behalf.  What influence does NAMA bring to bear?  What influence can it bring to bear to have a level of moderation in rent demands?  In some cases, the demands have been made by what I amost consider to be rack-renting landlords.  Is there anything NAMA can do about this?</p></speech>

Second, rents declined by between 8% and 10% during 2010, but they are now going back up.  There is a lack of supply.  The only way to deal with a market in which there is an increase in demand is to have an additional supply.  That is what we are focusing on.  We are trying to fund developers to build additional units which will, I hope, deal with the issue.  We cannot unilaterally or single-handedly deal with the issue.  That is not our role.</p></speech>

We explained at a previous meeting that NAMA took a view that it would deal with the largest debtors first, which made up the majority of the portfolio, so the top 200 debtors made up &euro;61 billion of the &euro;74 billion it acquired.  The other 600 debtors are being managed by the banks because they had smaller exposures.  We in NAMA spent all our time up to the end of 2012 looking at the largest debtors because, as in the Pareto principle, we felt that was where the biggest risk lay, and we were making sure we knew what was happening to those portfolios.  Let me say what we have done since.  In our 2013 report we increased the impairment on the 600 smaller debtors from 12% to 23%, following our comprehensive review of debtors.  We have a final piece of work, and we have made a commitment, as part of our fulfilment of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations, that by 30 June 2014 we will have completed the work in full.  That means we will have full oversight of the 800 debtors in the NAMA book.</p></speech>

The strategic plan in 2010 was to pursue all debts owed to the greatest extent possible, but in March 2012, the plan was revised and it was no longer the strategy to pursue all the debts but only to pursue those debts whose payment was necessary for NAMA to repay its borrowings.

The reality is that the debtors who are working with NAMA are working to try to achieve the maximum possible return, but it is more than likely, having paid a salary to the person and paid the interest costs on the bonds issued by NAMA and the running costs, that NAMA will only achieve in effect the value at which it purchased the loan.  NAMA will not pursue the debtor after that, and if the person has worked with NAMA, it will release him or her.</p></speech>

To date, as part of the price for debtors of working with NAMA, we have realised &euro;800 million worth of additional assets from those debtors.  I wish they had another &euro;800 million, or assets of &euro;8 billion, but they do not.  They have made full sworn statements of affairs and we have engaged in asset searches, so we try to pursue every single asset.</p></speech>

We took a deliberate view from 2010 to 2013 that there was no point in flooding the Irish market with Irish property because it would work against NAMA.  Yields in that time had dropped from 9% to 6%, so that was absolutely the right strategy.  We decided to sell assets in the United Kingdom and we have sold some assets in London at a 3% yields.  Do I believe that a 3% yield is a good price to sell at?  I certainly do.  Does the person who buys something at a 3% yield think it will be reduced to a 2% or 1% yield?

This will give direct guidance to the board of NAMA in terms of what the Minister believes NAMA should do.  If he believes NAMA should run out to 2020, that will give us a timeline to work out the assets.  If he feels NAMA should work to 2018 or another date, that will inform the board of NAMA and definitely result in us adopting a new strategic plan to deal with that.</p></speech>

One has to look at the issue in the context of what has been achieved and investor interest in Ireland.  We have already been able to accelerate our sales and debt repayments.  One also has the IBRC liquidation.  All of these issues are in the mix.  The Deputy can be assured that the board has already discussed this matter.  When we get the outcome of the Minister's review, we will review the strategic plan.  We review it on an interim basis every quarter anyway and we have a major review every year.</p></speech>

He indicated at the press conference that he was glad to be able to say that after the liquidation of IBRC, there would be a surplus and NAMA was also heading in that direction.  He said the State's contingent liability would have been reduced from &euro;43 billion to &euro;15 billion by the end of the year and this has certainly removed that issue.</p></speech>

We have a strategic plan and while it is very important, we would never be absolutely hidebound by it if circumstances change.  The Northern Ireland portfolio, to which the Deputy referred, is a very good example of that.  It would not have been a strategy of NAMA last year to sell this portfolio in its entirety.  However, an interest was expressed and it was very appropriate to ask whether such a sale would be a good outcome for NAMA and Northern Ireland.  If such an opportunity comes, one jumps at it, examines whether it is viable and goes with it.</p></speech>

We also spoke about looking ahead at how one achieves the targets one needs to achieve to repay the bond debt.  I have expressed concerns about the ability to do this given the mix that is left.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, in his report, appears to be sceptical that NAMA will be able to achieve this target, which he appears to consider over-ambitious.</p></speech>

We are very comfortable with that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to our 2012 strategic plan.  At that stage, we planned to redeem &euro;15 billion of our debt by the end of 2015.  We will have redeemed &euro;15 billion of our debt by the end of 2014, which is two years ahead of schedule.  To hit the next target, we will probably sell a further &euro;17 billion of assets by the end of 2016.  In terms of profile, these assets will include about &euro;7 billion in assets in Ireland, close to &euro;7 billion in residual assets we have in the United Kingdom, many of which, thankfully, are in London and the south east where there is still a very high demand for assets and prices are good, and about &euro;2 billion in assets in the rest of the world.  The Northern Ireland portfolio will make up close to &euro;1 billion, which will bring us to the figure of &euro;17 billion.  We are highly confident that we will achieve that target because 92% of our assets in Ireland are in urban locations, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and the commuter belt.</p></speech>

This year the prediction is for &euro;4 billion of sales in the Irish market, which is higher than the peak in 2006.  In the first five months of this year we have sold close to &euro;1.1 billion worth of Irish assets.  Those are completed transactions.  We have other portfolios on the market for which there is huge demand.  We will probably make sales worth over &euro;2 billion in the Irish market this year.  We sold only &euro;800 million of assets between 2010 and 2012 in the Irish market but will sell three times that amount in 2014.</p></speech>

It had bought its first property in Europe in La D&eacute;fense in Paris and thought there was a good commercial opportunity to buy property in Dublin when nobody else was buying it.

We have three board members, one of whom resided in the United States at the time he was on the board, one of whom resides in the UK and is a current member of the board, and one of whom resides in Limerick.

Going back to the origins of the board, I certainly had no say in the composition of the first board, but from time to time afterwards when there are vacancies the Minister or the Department of Finance might discuss names with me and I would generally meet the individuals who were being considered, just to talk to them about NAMA and to see that they fully understood what they were getting into, and also to get some assessment of their skill set.  However, I do not have a say in the appointment.</p></speech>

That may have happened last year or the year before.  Anyone can apply.  Some names have been suggested from time to time.  Let me put it this way.  I do not think NAMA is the easiest board in the world to get people to join, and we also have issues around conflict of interest, maybe with regard to what people were involved with in the property sector in the past or in the banking or financial sectors.  These considerations restrict the pool.  It is difficult enough to get people.</p></speech>

She has a history.  She was a political appointment to the board of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>She also served on the board of Pobal and she is now on the board of Bord G&aacute;is.  The latter is also as a result of a political appointment.  This is part of a pattern, which means that it is important to examine whether appointments to boards - and, in particularly that of our guests' organisation - are being made regardless of political merit.  These are matters which the public should be entitled to assess.  It is a pity NAMA did not state that this person is extremely capable and that she is well qualified to be on the board.  It is also a pity it did not state upfront that she has a political background.  This is a political appointment of someone who was obviously a political activist in the past.</p></speech>

I have been with NAMA for four and a half years and I have never known any sort of issue to arise around political affiliation or anything of that nature.  That is what I judged the most recent appointee on and that is my experience of the others.  The individual was quite upfront about this.  The Deputy states that it should have been included in her CV.  I would differ with him in that regard.  CVs relate people's background commercial experience.</p></speech>

Nobody in NAMA is in receipt of a bonus.  However, during this meeting we have been discussing a very challenging scenario.  No matter what happens in NAMA, and regardless of whether it is the accelerated repayment of our debt and all the commensurate sales activity required in that regard or the adoption of an even more accelerated type of approach, one matter about which the board would be concerned relates to the agency's ability to attract and retain the staff needed to manage the relevant process.  I have stated previously at this committee that the last position NAMA wants to be in is to be unable to match the activities of the A-teams which operate on behalf of hedge funds, equity funds, etc., and which deal with us.  We have a problem in retaining staff at present, not least because the market has greatly improved.  It is a concern of the NAMA board that in order to, in some way or other, make it attractive for staff to remain with us for what could prove to be a very short time if the agency is wound up - effectively, they would be out of a job at that point - we need to put in place some sort of retention plan that will incentivise them to stay.  This is not an argument about whether or not NAMA staff are well paid, it is a very practical argument in respect of the fact that there are plenty of opportunities for them in the market.  If NAMA does not have the capacity to ensure that they remain in their current positions, that will prove detrimental to its objectives.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that the board will be obliged to consider whether, in the absence of some incentive, the agency will be able to retain the people it needs.  This is a matter of concern to the board and it is something which it discusses from time to time in the context of the agency's overall objectives.  Like other State bodies and the remainder of the public service, we are governed by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act.  As a result, there is no question of us paying bonuses or of us being in a position to pay them even if we had taken a decision to do so.</p></speech>

That is a rather unique mix or construct and I think we will seek to engage with the Minister in respect of it.  What the outcome of that will be, I do not know.  Everybody in NAMA, like all of those sitting around this table, is conscious of the wider issues which obtain in this country in respect of pay and bonuses.  The point I am making is that NAMA is a unique construct.  In effect, it is an agency which is seeking to cease operations within a very short number of years.  In order to do that effectively and continue to obtain the best financial return possible for the taxpayer, the right people are required.</p></speech>

This is a matter which the board of the agency is going to be obliged to discuss some more.  As a result of the fact that all NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA, there would have to be total sign-off by the remuneration committee of the latter.  There is a process of discussion in which we must engage and bring to a conclusion.  In my opinion, we need to bring it to a conclusion fairly soon because we are losing staff.  We have lost 15 staff this year and 29 overall.  We know that other staff are looking elsewhere at present.</p></speech>

It is not arguing <i>per se</i>about whether the pay levels are high, low or whatever.  It is saying that this is an issue that has come up that the board needs to consider.  I do not expect that it will be easy to get agreement on this, but the board's responsibility under the Act is to get the best financial return we can for the State.  We are saying the best way to do that is the strategic plan, the approach we have.  It is also our responsibility to identify any risks to that, and one of the risks is that we cannot get the right people.  There are other risks as well which we talked about earlier.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the area of housing.  How many housing units does NAMA have on its hands and to what extent have housing units gone out on the market?  Obviously, housing units could be apartments or any type of housing.  I ask that question because as Mr. Daly is aware, there is a housing crisis, particularly in this city.  If Mr. Daly has had talks with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, will that lead to some housing units being made available under social housing?</p></speech>

As soon as the approved housing body agrees to sign the lease with us, we will commit the funding for the final 20% to complete the construction of those units.  Many of the units will have shell and core.  It would be a matter of internal fit-out such as kitchens, bathrooms or whatever.  That is usually three or four months work, which is good for people with those trades.  Usually, that is the timeframe one is talking about.

When the liquidation of IBRC was announced and when it looked likely that a considerable amount of the IBRC portfolio could transfer to NAMA at a time when we had a vacancy on the board, it seemed appropriate to look to the then board of IBRC, particularly perhaps members who had joined more recently rather than those who were there in the long term, to ask someone to come onto the board of NAMA.  That was the rationale for Oliver Ellingham's appointment.</p><p>  However, both those individuals have wider experience that is quite relevant.</p></speech>

But certainly, the Northern Ireland property market had been even more challenged than the market here in respect of deterioration in pricing and the value of assets.  It was a very big loan sale for NAMA.</p> <p>It was one that got an awful lot of attention at the board.  I would have to say, in terms of the outcome, both in terms of the pricing and in terms of achieving that outcome in the sensitive situation where we were, in effect, selling off the portfolios of all our Northern Ireland debtors, from the board's point of view it was quite a satisfactory item.  I suppose it was about 90% of it, one might say.  What we have ended up with is that the Northern Ireland book is completely sold and the rest of our United Kingdom book is significantly de-risked by this sale, and indeed by another loan sale that has completed.  Obviously, there are the financial considerations, but in that particular case there were other considerations as well.</p></speech>

One can relate it back to the overall discount of 57% that NAMA applied right across its portfolio, but in that one, because of the challenged assets, in particular in Northern Ireland, one sees the scale.</p></speech>

We are very conscious that we are supporting debtors who employee about 15,000 people in Ireland and, as part of any assets or loan portfolios we sell, the debtor, if he is working consensually with us, would understand that.  He would sign up to that process.  The likelihood is that the majority of employees, when portfolios are re-financed or sold on, are generally kept by the new buyer.

As to what one defines as a bubble, I am not sure.  I do not know what the definition of it is.  There are blips from time to time.

There is talk that couples are being offered 35-year mortgages.  A set of parents told me recently that their son was gazumped on a property whose value had increased by perhaps &euro;15,000 over the value settled upon.  Bearing in mind NAMA&rsquo;s function, there would be a temptation to wind it up pretty quickly because, as an entity, it could realise a return.  Would doing so provide the best return on balance to the taxpayer?</p></speech>

It concerns all the factors we have been talking about here.  The other dimension is that there is very definitely a supply issue in Dublin.  Perhaps the other aspect of NAMA that we would certainly draw attention to is the commitment of NAMA.  To be specific, it is 4,500 houses over the next couple of years.  In the longer term, it is a question of whether there is capacity in terms of sites to build another 19,000 or 20,000.  There is a wider dimension to NAMA&rsquo;s investment.  We have approved &euro;1.4 billion in investment for Ireland.  As of yesterday, &euro;1 billion has been drawn and it is at work.  That is a fairly dramatic increase.  There are many other things that NAMA is doing.  There is the financial return but there are other aspects.</p></speech>

The issue in Dublin is clearly one of supply; there is a major supply issue.  I am being told the land worth &euro;3 billion is predominantly in Dublin.  I was present when every line of the NAMA legislation was being passed.  I realise, therefore, that NAMA was set up to have a number of functions.  One was clearly to stabilise the finances.  It was to have a strong social dimension.  Obviously, there is a banking dimension also.  Can NAMA now step into the breach and do something of a more significant nature to facilitate supply in the housing market in Dublin?</p></speech>

There are three areas that I would reference: the 4,500 units that represent a direct commitment over the next couple of years; the potential for 19,000 to 20,000 on-sites if planning issues and everything else are sorted; and the commitment to investment in the Docklands area.  Since the SDZ approval last week, that gives us the go-ahead.  We are really ready to go on that.  That includes something like 2,800 residential units, on top of the 4,500.  In that regard, there is certainly a role.</p><p>  A more general point is that in any ongoing discussions at Government level on housing, construction or supply issues in Dublin, we are very much a part of the mix.  We have no problem getting involved.  As one of the Deputies said earlier, we are very much in that space now and have been put in that space.  The potential elements are the 4,500 units, the potential 20,000, the 2,600 in the Docklands and, of course, the number of social housing units, to which we referred earlier.  By the end of this year, the latter will amount to 1,100.  By next year, it will amount to well over that.</p></speech>

I stand over that recommendation.  I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting what the rate should be.  That is a matter for the board to determine.  I do see it as a potentially useful reference benchmark which would help the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, ensure there is consistency in its decision-making about the timing of disposals or the value that can be achieved if it seeks to invest further to develop properties before disposal.</p><p>  It is also interesting that the chief executive said in his opening statement that there is a prospect that NAMA could break even.  That concept can be expressed as a rate of return.  It would be useful for performance reporting purposes if a figure was put on it.  Not only can one then determine the changing environment impacting on the prospects for NAMA, one can also assess the impact of what a change of strategy would be for rate of return.</p><p>  The chief executive referred to the considerable effort it was to establish NAMA from a standing start and take on such an onerous challenge.  We had a parallel process to meet the challenges that were there for us to audit NAMA and produce reports on it.  I am very happy with the commitment and professionalism of the staff in my office in doing that.  While we have had robust exchanges with NAMA from time to time, overall there has been co-operation, it has been a useful experience and exchanges have been carried out professionally on both sides.</p></speech>

It had also approved around &euro;0.6 billion for retention by debtors but, because NAMA does not maintain a central record of actual retentions by debtors out of rental and other income, it was not possible to determine the extent to which debtors had used these approved advances.</blockquote></p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the order referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 May concerning the ratification by Ireland of the internal agreement concerning the 11th European Development Fund, EDF.  The order of the D&aacute;il stipulated the committee report back by 11 June 2014.  Members are aware the European Development Fund is the main instrument for delivering development assistance to the African Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states.  The 11th EDF will cover the period from 2014 to 2020.</p><p>  On behalf of the select committee I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, and his officials.

As the Chairman mentioned, the EDF is the main instrument for delivering EU development assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states.  The European Development Fund, unlike the EU's other external relations funding instruments, is not funded directly from the EU budget.  Its development co-operation programmes are funded through direct assessed contributions by EU member states.</p><p>  Each European Development Fund is concluded for a multi-annual period and the 11th EDF will cover the period from 2014 to 2020.  There are four main legislative components governing each European Development Fund multi-annual period.  The first of these legislative instruments is the internal agreement, the ratification of which is being considered today.  The internal agreement pertaining to the 11th EDF was negotiated under the Irish EU Presidency, has been agreed and signed by all member states and is in the process of being ratified by them.  The D&aacute;il motion seeking approval to ratify the internal agreement, which has been referred to this committee to report back on, is part of the process of ratifying the agreement in Ireland.</p><p>  The internal agreement sets out the overall funding that will be provided within the multi-annual period of the European Development Fund and individual member states' contribution share, or "key", to the fund.  Total funding for the 11th EDF will amount to &euro;30.5 billion and Ireland's contribution, based on a contribution key of 0.94%, will be &euro;286.775 million.</p> <p>The second and third part of the legislative package consists of the implementation regulation, which sets out how the European Development Fund will be administered.  Also, the Financial Regulation<b></b>which the committee examined in the course of a wide-ranging discussion on the European Development Fund with officials from my Department in February.<b></b>Both regulations will be adopted once the internal agreement has been formally ratified by all EU member states.  The fourth and final part of the legislative package is the<b></b>Overseas Association Decision agreed under the Lithuanian Presidency in December 2013.<br/>Irish Aid very actively engages with the European Development Fund, primarily through our membership of the EDF Management Committee in Brussels.  The geographic focus and aims of the European Development Fund are closely aligned with those of Irish Aid. <br/>The European Development Fund is the primary EU funding instrument for sub-Saharan Africa and has a strong focus on poverty eradication and on fragile and conflict affected states.  Over 91% of funds allocated under the 11th EDF will be allocated for Africa.  This includes significant allocations for our key partner countries which are as follows: Mozambique &euro;734 million, Ethiopia &euro;712 million, Tanzania &euro;626 million, Uganda &euro;578 million, Malawi &euro;560 million, Zambia &euro;484 million, Sierra Leone &euro;376 million and Liberia &euro;279 million.<br/>Ireland's engagement with and oversight of the European Development Fund is managed through our membership of the EDF committee.  In the context of our discussions at the committee, we obviously take a particular interest in the eight Irish Aid partner countries.  In advance of meetings, we consult with our missions in partner countries to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, there is complementarity between the European Development Fund and the approach of Irish Aid's bilateral programmes in our partner countries.<br/>Individual European Development Fund programmes significantly complement Irish Aid's work in our programme countries.  In Malawi the focus on water and sanitation in the 2013 EDF annual action programme has been crucial in improving nutrition and complements the scaling up nutrition work, also known as SUN, with which Ireland has been centrally involved. <br/>In Tanzania, the<b></b>Irish Aid programme has a strong focus on agriculture.  The European Development Fund supported the initiative called the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania, SAGCOT.  It aims to promote the participation of smallholder farmers in the development of agriculture value chains.  The European Development Fund has also allocated over &euro;58 million to Ethiopia&rsquo;s productive safety nets programme of which Irish Aid has been a long-standing supporter.  Also by acting together, through the European Development Fund, member states, including Ireland, benefit from the EU's wide geographical representation in third countries, which is unmatched by any individual member state. <br/>We can, through our support for European Development Fund programmes, complement the work Irish Aid is already doing, especially in the social sectors.  We can also contribute to programmes where Ireland does not have a comparative advantage, such as infrastructure and private sector development. <br/>Irish Aid seeks to ensure the relevance of the European Development Fund's policy and programming approaches to Ireland's bilateral development priorities.  It also engages in issues of oversight and governance of the fund through our participation in the EDF Committee and our monitoring of the governance and accountability arrangements to which the fund is subject.<br/>The European Development Fund has been subject to a number of major external assessments of its performance, including by the European Commission in 2011, the UK Multilateral Aid Review in 2011, and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD DAC, peer review in 2012.  These reviews highlighted the EDF's contribution in assisting African Caribbean and Pacific countries progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  They also highlighted its value for money, flexibility and adaptability to changes in the political and economic climate.  The European Development Fund is also subject to annual review by the European Court of Auditors and consistently achieves an annual statement of assurance from the court.<br/>The European Parliament is responsible for discharging the European Development Fund's accounts, further to the Court of Auditors' annual review.  It discharged the accounts for year ending 2011 in 2013 and the procedure to review the accounts for year ending 2012 is under way. <br/>I would like to briefly mention the Winning Business in Africa initiative which I have been actively promoting.  The purpose of this innovative collaboration between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation is to establish a facility to increase the ability of Irish companies to successfully tender for European Development Fund-supported contracts in Africa.  I am excited by the potential of this soon to commence project.  Initially it will run on a one year pilot basis after which a review will be carried out to determine future project direction and funding.<br/>I hope I have provided a useful, if brief, overview of the internal agreement governing the 11th EDF.I hope I have explained how the EDF's aims and programmes complement Ireland's bilateral aid programme and how we are engaging with the EDF to ensure that it is underpinned by robust and transparent governance arrangements.  The Winning Business in Africa pilot project will, I hope, provide a template whereby we can identify further opportunities for Irish companies to successfully tender for EU contracts.<br/>I thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to speak on this matter.  I will be happy to take any questions Members may have.</p></speech>

My question relates to the latter part of his contribution which referred to the collaboration that takes place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.  He can answer my question along with the other questions that members will ask.  Have Irish companies a big disadvantage when they tender for contracts in African countries?  They must compete with Chinese companies that tender at a much lower cost due to a lower cost of labour.  I ask him to include a response with his answers, at some stage.  I call Deputy Brendan Smith.</p></speech>

Naturally, we welcome funding and assistance being given to poverty stricken areas.  We also welcome assistance being given to development as well as trying to eradicate and eliminate poverty.  However, I have one issue with this matter.  I want to be assured that there is no duplication.  I presume each member state has an overseas development assistance programme.  Thankfully, we have a very substantial one that we all want to see maintained to the maximum possible level.</p><p>   We have an international development commissioner in the European Union who has, understandably, a very substantial budget that funds and supports a major programme of work in less developed countries.  Perhaps the Minister of State would answer the following question and if the answer is not readily available then he might let us know subsequently.  Was the European Development Fund in existence prior to the establishment of an international development directorate in the European Union?</p><p>  We all know that the expansion of the European Union over the years has led to additional commissioners being appointed and that each country has a commissioner.  There were specific jobs, roles and directorates established as a result of the growth in the number of member states and additional commissioners were appointed.  Presumably, the European Development Fund was in existence prior to the International Development Directorate being established in the European Union.  If I am correct in my assumption, was there not a case for bringing the European Development Fund under the remit of the development commissioner?   I reiterate my hope that we are not losing funding and value of investment through duplication and different structures for delivering aid to those particular countries.</p><p>  I note that the funding is not subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament which goes against the tenet of the Lisbon treaty.  Are there changes proposed to give the budget parliamentary oversight?  I welcome the fact that Ireland participates in a governance and oversight role in regard to the funding and  hope that the funding is put to the best possible use.  With regard to the Chairman's remarks, I hope that a greater emphasis can be placed on the opportunities available for Irish companies to take up business opportunities in Africa and elsewhere.  </p><p>  There is one more issue that I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State.  I presume the ratification process is similar for all member states.  Do all member states, to his knowledge, contribute to this fund?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.734" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2014052900004#C00100"><p>I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Smith.  We acknowledge the contribution of &euro;30 billion from the EU, which is the largest donor.  Everybody wants to ensure that the people for whom it is intended gain the most benefit from it.  I note that part of the agreement is that the recipient countries will engage in good governance, human rights and democratic principles.  We know this is not happening in the area of human rights.  I do not think the EU is robust enough on that issue.</p><p>  There is also the other aspect of climate.  I wish to raise a question on how great an issue climate is for recipients.  We have discussed at our meetings that we seem to give with one hand and take with the other hand and there is no joined-up thinking.  We come back to the issues of accountability, good governance, the best use of resources and robust practice in aid effectiveness. In my limited experience from the few African countries I have visited they want to do business with Irish companies because of the reputation that most Irish companies have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2014052900004#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello.  I apologise for being late; it was the traffic.</p><p>  I agree with the comments of previous speakers on the European Development Fund.  It is managed by the unelected European Commission and the European Investment Bank, and the European Parliament has a limited role in scrutinising it, which I have been told is improving.  I am interested in hearing the response to Deputy Smith's questions.</p><p>  There is a view that the aid programme of some donor countries would be based on self-interest and geopolitical strategies.  Irish Aid has a proud history of untied aid.  We are coming from a background of being colonised rather than being a coloniser, and have a strong solidarity with these countries.  That is viewed by many of the recipient countries as a major positive.  I would not like to see Irish Aid money being compromised in any way.  There are concerns about where the investments are made.  The African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states are rich in natural resources.  The European Investment Bank must consider which projects contribute to the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and inclusive economic growth when deciding on developing the extractive industry sector.</p><p>  Would the Minister of State agree that when the EU is doing trade deals with developing countries, it needs to ensure it supports them to diversify their economies, reduce their dependence on the export of raw materials and increase the value of their products through domestic manufacturing and processing?  There is the issue of multinational companies going into developing countries and stripping them of their resources, which is of no real benefit for the people in these countries.  We have seen what has happened with the oil industry and that the benefits of the natural resource have not trickled down and benefited the people of the region.  When the EU is involved, I would like to see it help develop the economy for the greater good of the people in the region and not just for the select few.</p><p>  When the EU enters into trade agreements with other countries, we are concerned that these agreements would be used to maximise human rights.  We have had favourable trade agreements with Colombia, Israel and other countries.  It is important that we have specific political and legal mechanisms to suspend bilateral co-operation when there are repeated systematic human rights violations.  I have mentioned two countries but I do not think it is acceptable that the EU gives favourable status to countries that are going backwards instead of going forward.  It is important that the EU creates legislative proposals in the area of automatic disclosure of transnational corporations' profits and tax payments in an effort to tackle the issue of tax havens.  Ireland was accused of being a tax haven for US companies.  Tax evasion and illicit capital flight undermine bilateral and multilateral development aid.  I think members would agree on the need for greater transparency and accountability of European companies operating in developing countries.  Two possible options are to end the scandal of secret company ownership and fake companies by setting up open public registries, listing the real beneficial owners of company trusts and other structures, and making all companies report on their turnover profits and the tax of their employees in all countries in which they operate.  This is one of the issues that has arisen in relation to aid and how these transnational companies are bypassing the tax laws.  There is a need for the EU and other power blocks to make companies much more accountable.</p><p>  I have a number of concerns about the European Development Fund's so-called African Peace Facility, which many are saying is being used to fund military actions in Somalia and other countries.  We need to remove the military dimension from the EU.</p><p>  I am happy to support the spending on development and the work that Ireland is doing, but we need to tweak the fund.  Ireland needs to have a strong voice in ensuring there are changes in areas that need improvement.  There must be greater involvement by the European Parliament.  I am aware, however, of the proposed major changes in its powers.  I think the Members of the European Parliament collectively would like to have a greater say and greater scrutiny in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.736" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2014052900004#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his team.  This is a fantastic example of what countries coming together, working in a cohesive and organised fashion can deliver in effective development aid to these countries.  I am delighted the European Union is generous enough to contribute &euro;30.5 billion in development aid, predominantly to Africa.  It is interesting that it is co-terminous with our eight programme partners, which leaves us in a very strong position as a relatively small island nation to advise and tap into some of these projects for the betterment of the communities that we as a nation have targeted for development.  It is a substantial contribution from the Irish taxpayers.  We often hear glib criticism that the Government has not abided by our commitment to overseas aid of 0.7% of GDP.  Given the severe austerity resulting from various factors, it might raise eyebrows that Irish people are now contributing &euro;286 million in aid.  Will the Minister explain the structures of the project, involving the 28 countries in the EU over a seven year period?</p> <p>We are experts in the field of agriculture and some of our projects in the programme countries are agriculture based.  When one observes peasant farmers in the fields of Tanzania and Sierra Leone, it becomes clear that capital projects could assist them in terms of production and the distribution of goods to market.  While the figures on the funding available to Mozambique, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and elsewhere are fantastic, they cover a seven year period.  I assume some of the projects are major capital projects such as reservoir, irrigation and sewerage schemes and bridge building projects aimed at giving isolated parts of Africa access to markets.  As an independent country with a great tradition of providing aid to those most in need, we are in an ideal position.  We must influence Irish companies to ensure they engage in some of the major capital projects that will be funded by the European Development Fund over the next seven years.  Are we in a strong position to do this?  How can we maximise our influence to attract funds, not only to our eight partner countries but also to Irish companies with expertise in the relevant fields in Africa?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.738" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2014052900005#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for their questions, which strongly probe the genesis and nature of the European Development Fund.  Deputy Brendan Smith asked about the genesis of the fund and a number of other speakers also referred to the issue.  He noted the role of the European Commission, through the development Commissioner, and the involvement of each member state on the committee that disburses funds.  The European Parliament is not directly involved in disbursement decisions, although it is made aware of them.  It is also part of the process of accountability in that it will sign off on the accounts at the end of the process.</p><p>  It should be recalled that the European Development Fund operates outside the normal European Union funding arrangements for development, including European neighbourhood funds and other instruments.  The European Development Fund was negotiated in 1957 as part of the negotiations to establish the European Economic Community.  It originated in the countries which had colonies in Africa and the Caribbean and Pacific regions and wanted a development fund.  There was, however, little interest in the issue in countries other than the relevant colonies.  A compromise was reached under which an assessed fund would be established to which all member states would contribute.  The new mechanism would remain outside the standard European Union instruments.  From that point of view, the European Development Fund does not come within the remit of the European Parliament, although the position will change when the Cotonou Agreement expires in 2020 and the entire process becomes subject to the Community method.</p><p>  The current position is that the European Development Fund is a separate fund outside the normal instruments of the European Union.  This is relevant because, following the Lisbon treaty, we would all like to maximise the role played by the European Parliament.  The treaty envisaged that the Parliament would be given co-decision making powers.  This matter will be addressed following the expiration of the Cotonou agreement and after the six years of the 2014-20 allocation.  </p><p>  The Chairman asked about collaboration between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and IBEC.  The Department initiated this collaboration recently because I was interested in exploring the possibility of accessing the substantial number of infrastructure tenders that are available throughout the world.  Tenders offered by bodies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank and European Development Fund release substantial amounts of money for infrastructure projects for development purposes in the areas of sanitation, roads, energy and so forth.  On the basis that Ireland was not a strong player in this area, the Department linked up with IBEC and commissioned a report, Winning Business in Africa, which I launched last year.  The report identifies &euro;10 billion that is accessible to Irish companies through tenders and makes recommendations as to how this procurement could be pursued.  It proposes, for example, that smaller Irish companies come together in clusters to meet the threshold required to compete.  We subsequently established a pilot project to see how this would work.</p><p>  We have, therefore, closely examined ways in which Irish companies can access business.  It is interesting to note that prior to the Celtic tiger, Irish companies engaged in external tendering of this nature to a much greater extent.  It appears that during the Celtic tiger, we became more narcissistic and inward-looking and looked abroad to a much lesser extent than previously.  Many companies have started to look outwards again in the hope of re-opening sectors in which they may have engaged previously.  The same holds for ESB International, a State-owned multinational company that is beginning to garner a large number of contracts in areas in which it worked previously.  There is now collaboration in this area between the Department and IBEC as we seek to provide the right environment and mechanisms to enable Irish companies to tender for relevant contracts.  Size was probably the greatest issue in this regard. </p><p>  Countries such as China have their own agenda and I do not wish to engage in a discussion of the issue.  I will visit Africa in the week after next to sign a contract between the Government of Botswana and ESB International for the provision of the country's entire energy production.  ESB International has taken over these contracts from Chinese companies which were unable to fulfil them.  This is an indication of the quality of Irish engineering, particularly in the energy area.  An Irish State company will be responsible for the entire energy production of Botswana.</p></speech>

We should publicise the fact that a State company is able to compete with the largest country in the world.  The quality of its business, engineering and expertise make for a good story and one we should all tell.  Incidentally, I will also sign a double taxation agreement with Botswana.  My visit to Africa will have other elements of a trade mission, both in Botswana and South Africa.</p><p>  Deputy Brendan Smith asked whether there is a danger of duplication with some of the work being done in overseas development aid.  We are keenly aware of this possibility.  As Deputy Eric Byrne noted, there is a natural overlap between the focus of the European Development Fund money and funding for overseas development aid.  Almost 92% of EDF moneys will be allocated to Africa, primarily sub-Saharan Africa where Irish Aid is focused.</p> <p>The EDF mirrors our eight partner countries.  We can consider projects in which we are engaged in those countries and at the same time consider greater infrastructural projects for which we could not provide funding but which would complement our work.  I gave the examples of Ethiopia, Tanzania and Malawi where we do complementary work.  We tie in with disbursement of those funds and can ensure, through our people who are represented on the committee dealing with the disbursement of the EDF funds, that there is no overlap with Irish funding but complementary spending.  The multilateral funding is in many ways an extension of what Ireland is doing.</p><p> The Chairman was at Busan.  This ties in with the Paris and Busan accord and the conference on global partnership for effective development that I attended two months ago in Mexico in focusing on the effectiveness of funding, joint programming, blending and using funding to optimum benefit, which is very important.  We are keenly aware of this and in a perfect position, perhaps more than any other country, for our ODA funding to benefit from the complementary nature of EDF funding.  There is parliamentary oversight through the accountability process and will be more after Cotonou. </p><p> All states do contribute.  It is an assessed contribution.  We do quite well.  Our contribution is 1.14%.  Our assessed contribution for EDF is 0.94%.  Our contribution is less than our national contribution to the EU.  We contribute &euro;286.8 million to the 11th EDF, while Germany will contribute &euro;6.2 billion; France over &euro;5.4 billion; Luxembourg, &euro;77.8 million; Portugal, &euro;365 million; and Greece, &euro;460 million.</p><p>  In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s questions about accountability and good governance, there is a very strong accountability process for the EDF funds.  The European Court of Auditors checks the funds.  The EU has a results-oriented monitoring system, based on regular on-site assessments by independent and external private companies on the various projects and programmes, where the efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability are assessed.  Moreover, the EU&rsquo;s evaluation unit reports its findings on the evaluation of the EU co-operation and development programmes to the external relations commissioners, to take action on conclusions and recommendations.  The European Parliament discharges its annual accounts and the annual report of the European Court of Auditors includes the EDF.  Ireland is engaged with other EU member states on the management committee of the EDF.  The evaluation and audit division within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade further scrutinises our bilateral development partners.  Our embassies and partners abroad keep an eye on matters too. </p><p> As an example of the EDF's response to developing situations, in Uganda it has decided to withhold approval of funding for the Ugandan national programme for the time being because it is concerned about bad governance arising out of the fraud there and the anti-homosexuality legislation.  The EDF committee of member states made that decision this month.   We have been very close to what is happening in Uganda.  I visited there recently and yesterday replied to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan on the Ugandan situation.  We have decided not to penalise the ordinary people of Uganda by withdrawing our funding and continue to make funding available to the areas in greatest need.  We did this on the advice of the Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Uganda despite the anti-homosexuality legislation and the fraud perpetrated on Ireland, which amounted to &euro;4 billion, all of which was recouped, plus interest.  Deputy Smith also tabled a question on that subject.  I assure the Deputies that we have consulted widely on this issue and did not take our decision lightly.  We are monitoring the situation because we are unhappy with developments there and feel that we have a responsibility in that respect.  We continue to make funding available for the time being but totally avoid any government mechanism for that funding. </p><p> Deputy Crowe asked about untied aid.  We have articulated very strongly in our programme, One World, One Future, that we are not imposing any conditions on our international development aid.  Our decision on where to spend funding will be determined by certain criteria.  The overriding criteria are areas of greatest need and that we do not make conditions.  Other countries such as China, Britain and Germany do have conditions linking their aid to contractual matters.  We have decided not to do that.  We have a good relationship, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been built up through centuries of work by Irish missionaries and our shared post-colonial experience.  We have a strong, friendly environment there to offer to our business and private sector.  We do not offer contracts or grants or anything of that nature.  That allows us to maintain untied aid so that we go to places of greatest need and do not have another agenda.  That will continue to be the situation as long as I am in charge, however long that may be, given present circumstances. </p><p> We will always have to address the exploitation of natural and mineral resources.  We sought to do that when we had the Presidency of the EU and we got through a directive on natural resources, providing for accountability and transparency in multinational companies engaged in African and Third World countries.</p> <p>Those based in the European Union would be obliged under the directive to reveal their financial engagement with the various countries where they are involved in exploration or in the exploitation of minerals.  This is currently being finalised and I would like to see it transposed into law here as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

We negotiated the text and the substance of the directive during the Irish Presidency.  As soon as the directive comes to us I assure the Deputy we will give it our immediate attention.  We do not have a timescale but we hope it cannot be too much longer because the substance of the directive was negotiated by the end of June 2013, almost 12 months ago.</p><p>  The OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises clarify how companies can identify and better manage risks, particularly with regard to the exploitation of natural resources in fragile countries.  The United States has also produced similar legislation to this EU legislation.  We need to have more stringent rules because there has been considerable exploitation of natural resources, including mineral, oil and forestry resources in Africa.  There need to be stringent rules with regard to funding and also to how EU member states behave with regard to those countries.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked about peacekeeping.  The Africa Peace Facility is funded by the EU for peacekeeping and funding is not used for military projects or weapons.  It is essential that the African countries are involved in providing the lion's share of  peacekeeping troops and resources in the various fragile countries.  I refer to appalling situations in south Sudan and the Central African Republic.  Along with the situation in Syria, the United Nations has experienced a perfect storm because its entire peacekeeping resources are being taken up by these major conflicts.  We are engaged with the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p><p>  Deputy Byrne commented on the importance of the EU and said that the degree to which it is involved in providing global support for the poorest countries was another good reason for being a member state.  The EU provides the lion's share - approximately 55% - of all international funding to the countries most in need of support.</p><p>  On the question of the overseas development aid target of 0.7% of GNP, a number of targets have been set to achieve it.  The target was set before my time as Minister of State.  The Government set the same target in the programme for Government to be achieved by 2015.  However, we are unable to meet that target because the economic circumstances have been very difficult in recent years.  We have restated our position in the new policy programme, One World, One Future, and the target of 0.7% remains.  We will achieve that target when economic circumstances permit.  It is hoped that in the near future we will be in a position to change the direction of the curve in an upward direction towards that target as soon as possible.  We are definitely committed to it.  We are strong supporters of the 0.7% target.  The definition of overseas development aid has been discussed many times at European level with our colleague member states and with the OECD with regard to whether the 0.7% should be discontinued or adjusted.  In our view it is a statement of intent by member states.  It is the EU target and also the United Nations target and it should not be changed.  Only four or five member states have reached or exceeded the target, including the United Kingdom for the first time.  It should remain untouched as a target because it is a statement of each country's intentions and we have argued for it to be maintained.  In the past year, 16 member states have increased their contributions and 12 member states have decreased their contributions.  It is not all bad news considering the difficult circumstances.  Most member states are making serious efforts to move towards the target.  Some of the newer member states are struggling with their economic situations and are not in a position to move very far up the scale on the targets, but the targets remain and it is a question of constantly seeking to have more member states improve their contributions or to reach or exceed the targets.</p><p>  I thank the members for their questions and for the opportunity to make this presentation.  I emphasise the importance of this fund of &euro;30 billion and the difference it can make to those who are least well-off.  I co-chaired the discussions on this matter during the Irish Presidency when the funding arrangement was drawn up.  It was decided that we would move further towards helping the least developed countries, as opposed to the middle-income countries, even though certain middle-income countries have major internal problems.  We have moved up the scale and well over 90% of the funding will go to the least developed countries, which will result in a further focus on countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900003#D00200"><p>Our session this morning deals with the role of the arts and culture in enhancing reconciliation.  On behalf of this committee, I am pleased to welcome the delegations from various cultural groups in Derry: Donncha Mac Niallais and Carol Nic Conmara from Cult&uacute;rlann U&iacute; Chan&aacute;in, Eibhl&iacute;n N&iacute; Dhochartaigh from the Fleadh 2013 executive committee, Lisa Anderson from Droichead, Derek Moore from the Londonderry Bands Forum, James Kee and Darren Milligan from the Sollus Centre, and Jonathan Burgess from Blue Eagle Productions.  I welcome everybody.  I met some of our visitors on a recent trip to the north west, and it is good to see them again.  We look forward to an informative meeting at which we will find out what they have been up to since we last met them - on the bounce of the success of Derry-Londonderry City of Culture and Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann.  No doubt they are still on a high up there and we certainly sensed that during our visit.  The city is in a good place, although I know there is still an enormous challenge ahead of all us in regard to peace and reconciliation challenges on the ground.  I believe the roles of the various groups here as cultural ambassadors must be commended.  We are delighted they could all be here with us today.</p><p>  We will allow each group make a presentation and then we will have feedback from committee members.  Perhaps we will take half of the groups first and then have feedback and then take the rest.  We will watch the time to see how that goes.  Before we move on to the presentations, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  I now invite Ms Eibhl&iacute;n N&iacute; Dhochartaigh of the Fleadh 2013 executive committee to make her introductory remarks.</p></speech>

The fleadh was a mutual sharing of experiences that was a meaningful, real and true community engagement process, and I believe it should serve as a benchmark for the potential for meaningful engagement where there is open and honest dialogue, mutual respect and the creation of meaningful opportunities for engagement.  There are endless possibilities if there is a willingness to take a leap of faith.</p><p>  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann is recognised as a huge success - a truly historic and momentous event.  It was an inclusive fleadh and all the people of the city were encouraged to enjoy and participate in it.  We are grateful and would like to pay tribute to our friends in the Protestant and Unionist community who supported the fleadh wholeheartedly.  The process of engagement that has ensued demonstrates to all of our communities that we can celebrate in an inclusive and positive way.  The fleadh cheoil was just the beginning of a journey and a collective meeting of minds and sharing of cultures.  We have already set targets for future projects, and our community engagement officer will provide some of the background on those.</p><p>  Undoubtedly, the fleadh was a success, but our engagement with the Protestant and Unionist community, particularly with the Londonderry Bands Forum, was probably one of the most significant positive outcomes for us.  The decision to bring the fleadh to the North and the realisation of those involved from all cultures that they had a place in it and that the engagement was all-inclusive and not tokenistic was significant.  The fleadh is over now, but the feel-good factor and the good news story goes on, which is what we wanted the fleadh to develop.  This is the legacy year, but even before the fleadh, we were looking towards what its legacy would be.  We are on that journey for a continued engagement.  </p><p>  This is my personal experience of the fleadh in terms of community engagement.  I am sure all the other groups here will give their individual interpretation of their sentiments on the fleadh and other aspects of the culture we have been sharing since then.</p></speech>

Among the objectives were: to involve more people in the work of Comhaltas; to host an inclusive, cross-community fleadh; to build strategic partnerships and promote civic unity; and to contribute generally to the building of peace and reconciliation.  That was the remit.  Following this, various meetings were held with different communities within the city.  We were very lucky that during one of the meetings the Londonderry Banks Forum became involved and challenged what its contribution could be.  It expressed some ideas on what it would like to do and gave us food for thought.  As a result, several meetings took place with the forum, during which a dialogue began.  </p><p>  One of the interesting things about these meetings was that when people went into them, the onus was to find common ground.  If one had gone into to these meetings, one would have seen two groups of people who from the outside looked very different.  If one was to judge the book by the cover, one would wonder what kind of meeting would take place.  The common ground was music, cultural heritage and the roots of music and we found that people spent more time discussing their interest in music.  Both groups and the bands forum were very enthusiastic and music was their motivation and passion.  I believe it was because of this that the engagement worked so well.  It was on this basis that the various engagements were built.  The bands became very involved and through building trust with the cult&uacute;rlann, they realised their involvement would not be tokenistic.  We had a number of different engagements with the bands, right through from the pageant to the closing event.  They played on stages with the fleadh logo behind them and they were welcomed and applauded.  This provided them with an opportunity to showcase what they were most passionate about - their music.  This brought people together and gave them the opportunity to see what the fleadh was about and what, ultimately, many of the bands felt they were about - their music.  They received a warm reception and everybody, from both sides of the community, came out of the event having learned a lot. </p><p>  One of the most important aspects of the engagement was that a relationship had been built.  There was listening to a significant degree on both sides.  With the common ground being music, people were able to find something to talk about and could then negotiate and work around what was or was not possible.  Everybody had the same agenda, which was to showcase music and cultural heritage which was to be celebrated, rather than used as a tool to make others feel bad.  Following the fleadh, we have continued our engagement and hope to build on it.</p><p>  A similar engagement is taking place on the Irish language.  We have begun to put together a programme which uses the language as a tool to bring people together.  Through looking at its history, we see that there is significant information of which people are unaware.  We are working with groups and hope to bring the programme to communities that would not normally see the Irish language as something which belongs to them.  We hope to do this through a programme that includes presentations, talks and engagement.  We hope to get a group from the Protestant and Unionist community involved and it has already said it would be interested in using the language.</p> <p>They have already said that they would be interested in taking up the language.  The process that has taken place is using culture - which in the past was seen as one of the biggest areas of contention - as something to be celebrated.  It is just about getting people to look at it in a different way and providing them with an opportunity to showcase their cultural heritage in a way that does not threaten another community.  It is still at the early stages but has been very successful so far and hopefully that will continue.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its invitation.  It is nice to be here this morning.  My name is Jonathan Burgess and I run an independent theatre company in Londonderry called Blue Eagle Productions.  Other witness will speak about how the Protestant or loyalist community has developed since the UK City of Culture experience and the opportunities provided by that designation.  I have been working in theatre in the city for over 20 years.  My community does not really undertake the arts in any serious way in terms of exploding myths or presenting opportunities to validate or tell stories.  My ambition is to continue to try to do that.</p><p>  Work that I have undertaken in the last six or seven years which was particular to my own culture includes The Exodus, a full-length play examining the movement of Protestants from the west bank of the Foyle in the early part of the 1970s.  Approximately 98% of Protestants left that area at the start of the Troubles and my play examines the reasons for that.  That is a hot potato and something which lives deep-seatedly within the conscience of the Protestant community in Londonderry, but it had never really been talked about before.  In presenting it in a theatrical way, one is holding it up but not telling one person's story or exposing one person's truth to the scrutiny of everybody.  One is creating, fundamentally, a dramatised presentation to represent the theme.  In representing that theme, one has created an opportunity for discussion and interaction.  That play toured across the whole of Northern Ireland as well as in Donegal.  It has gone on to create community dialogue.  I have brought copies of the play for everyone here.  It was picked up by the Church of Ireland, for example, which wanted to look at how something which happened in 1973 manifests itself within the Protestant community in 2013.  I also wrote a series of short scenes which were filmed and which became part of a workshop facilitation process which was happening in the community.  I have included a copy of the DVD with the copy of the play for committee members. </p><p>  I did a show last year called Crows on the Wire which was set on the night that the RUC became the PSNI.  It dealt with the dissatisfaction among rank and file officers in the RUC with what was happening to them.  They perceived themselves as being a means to achieve political change rather than being reactive to political change.  They felt that they were being used as a carrot to create that space within society and a lot of people wondered why that was so.  </p><p>  I am not seeking to inhabit the middle ground but to take stories from the areas on the edges, from the marginalised areas within the Protestant community and represent them in a public forum for debate.  A lot of my community missed out on the single identity work which was part of the PEACE Programmes.  We have always been playing catch up but have never really caught up.  Given that we never got the opportunity to do that single identity work, there has been a lack of trust in that process and in the mechanisms surrounding discussion and facilitation of stories within public fora.  That is what I am trying to do through theatre and education.  </p><p>  Last year, as part of the UK City of Culture, I wrote a play which looked at the history of the Orange Order.  That toured to maintained and controlled schools within the Derry City Council area and was received very well.  All I was trying to do was to put the story out there and allow people to see it, create discussion and create the space for it.  Art and culture facilitates such debates and engagement.  I will try to continue to do that and hopefully the work will be well received.  </p><p>  I will now hand over to Mr. James Kee from the Sollus Centre just outside Londonderry.</p></speech>

As a man from the country, from the sticks, I apologise for bringing a script here, which I will use.  I will tell the committee some of what I see as good news stories that have developed from the community that I work with in the Sollus Centre.  My name is James Kee and I will give the committee a synopsis of some of the projects I have been involved in on behalf of Bready and District Ulster-Scots Development Association.</p><p>  Built on the site of an old Orange Order hall, the Sollus Centre is situation in north Tyrone in the village of Bready, seven miles from Derry/Londonderry and just two miles from County Donegal as the crow flies across the river Foyle.  The centre, built seven years ago, is seen as the cultural hub of the community.  Activities and projects that have been delivered from the centre include music tuition, particularly highland bagpipes and drumming classes.  I apologise for the absence today of Mr. Darren Mulligan who had hoped to tell the committee about how, at the age of nine, he was encouraged by his grandfather to learn to play the great highland bagpipes.  At the age of ten, he was told he was not going to make it but he decided that he was going to make it.  He studied folk and traditional music at university in Newcastle in England and is now probably one of the top solo pipers in the country.  He is now based in the Sollus Centre and provides tuition there to others as part of the skilled curriculum.  He is somebody who others wanted to consign to the scrap heap at ten years of age but he decided that he was not having any of it.  </p><p>  Highland dance is also very popular in the centre.  I have a biased viewpoint here.  A young lady who left school with top marks in her GCSEs, Ms Georgina Kee-McCarter - a modern bride who wanted to keep her maiden name, and also my daughter - decided that she wanted to study dance.  She had started dancing at the age of 13, studied dance at Magee University in Derry and is now a full-time dance instructor.  She has about 500 pupils weekly, many of whom are from the seven local primary schools within a 20 mile radius of the Sollus Centre.  </p><p>  When we can, we try to undertake social economy projects.  We have a womens' group called Sollus Social Enterprises composed mainly of the mums of the pupils of the highland dance classes.  Many of them had previous experience of working in the shirt factories in Derry and the surrounding areas which are no longer extant.  Some of them who are in their later years have skills which would have been lost over time but they are now making uniforms for the dancers.  I do not know if committee members are familiar with the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo but the ladies from the Sollus Centre made the costumes for 84 highland dancers for that event three years ago.  That was quite an achievement for a group of about 30 ladies from a wee place in north Tyrone.</p><p>  We have approximately 12 to 13 regular user groups along with some letable office space, which contributes towards the running costs of the centre.</p> <p>The day-to-day management of the centre is looked after by volunteers.  We have no paid staff.  Sontas, a ten-piece traditional group, use the centre for practice.  Sontas, comprising five Protestants and five Catholics, got together approximately six years ago after I delivered a project called Traditions Meet, a showcase telling 400 years of local, national and international history through the medium of music, song and dance.  The group performed for President McAleese at the launch of the 12 July celebrations in Dublin four years ago.  They performed at the launch of the fleadh in Derry last year with President Higgins in attendance and for four of the past five years in Parliament Buildings, Stormont, at the request of the speaker of the House, Mr. Willie Hay.  They have launched St. Patrick's Day festivities and at the request of the tourist board played in Vanderbilt Hall, New York, at a marketing event to persuade international visitors to come and see what we have to offer in this country.</p><p> Our latest venture is Sollus Cultural Promotions, another social economy project set up as a community interest company to organise the Walled City Tattoo, which has nothing to do with body art.  Some 500 performers played to 14,000 paying spectators as part of the UK City of Culture event in 2013.  The country's largest outdoor amphitheatre was created at the historic site of Ebrington, adjacent to the city's Peace Bridge.  I have copies of last year's programme and, with the permission of the Chair, I will leave some of them for members.</p><p> We now work in partnership with Cult&uacute;rlann personnel on some events, delivering what I see as a positive message to the rest of the province.  We do get chastised in some cases for raising our head above the parapet, but the end product is much too important to let this go.</p><p> The common thread that is running through all that has been achieved is the performing arts.  This work may or may not have the ability to become self-sustainable, but in my mind this is one of the main arteries for continuing to building peace and reconciliation in our country.  Our motto in Sollus is: "Have pride in your own culture and respect for others."</p></speech>

The Londonderry Bands Forum was set up in October 2010 with help from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  With another 16 bands, we are members of an umbrella group representing 435 of the 660 bands in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The aims of this unique project, the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, can best be summed up by the following.  I am responsible for hosting monthly meetings of the forum in order to keep the members up to date with relevant issues.  We are also developing training programmes with the aim of helping the current leadership of the bands with the management and general running of the bands.  More importantly, we are doing the same thing with junior members who are identified as the future leaders of the bands.  Education is the most important element of the overall project because we believe that a lack of knowledge and understanding that has led to many of the issues we face.  We believe this initiative has relevance for all sections of the community, and that is our main focus and priority.  In association with local community groups, we are encouraging the bands in some of the more marginalised parts of the city to take an active approach to developments in their own areas.  During the two years I have been working with the forum, I have organised a series of network events for the bands' leadership with statutory bodies.  We are working with organisers of the parades and marching bands.  We are encouraging the bands to promote and publicise all the positive work they do and we are helping the members to forge links with various groups such as Cult&uacute;rlann in order to expand their horizons and spread the culture and ideas through dialogue and education.  The programme is actively building on the tentative steps taken in the past few years by encouraging the member bands to look beyond their own communities and to engage with marching bands in areas they never explored before.</p><p>  Mr. Jonathan Burgess wrote a play, "The Pride", about bands and it was performed by members of the band with professional actors under his direction.  Another band is involved with "Coming Home for Christmas", which is about interaction in the community.  We also work with the All-Ireland Fleadh, the Pan-Celtic Festival and the Walled City Tattoo.  Our work is focused on challenging prejudice and negativity.  We are looking inwards as well as outwards because, as we take risks with engagements, we realise that our stance and reasons must be clearly defined and we lead the debate because we will never lose sight of the fact that preconceived opinion exists in all communities.  </p><p>  We communicate with the media at local and national level to try to balance out coverage of the bands scene.  It is difficult because the media focuses on the negatives and leaves out the positives that are less newsworthy to them.  Our focus with the bands is to make them aware of their image in the media and their image on social media.  In the eight months I have been with them I have had some success and there has been progress in the programme.  The attendance at the monthly meetings has increased and we now have 14 bands in the forum, four more than when I started.  One of the bands is a highly respected brass band, probably the first interdenominational band in the forum.  We have developed training courses for 20 unemployed bandsmen with accredited training on event safety and management to help Mr. James Kee with the Walled City Tattoo.  We have also produced a pamphlet with the good relations branch of Derry City Council, encouraging debate and understanding of the band culture.  We started a programme on Tuesday of this week with four classes of 16 year old girls in a Catholic college in Greggan.</p><p>  St. Columb's Park House has also hosted a two-day conference at which the forum supported the bands that are working with other groups in the area.  They are developing a joint approach to social, economic and environmental issues.  We are encouraging the local bands to engage with the development structures in the areas.  We are challenging them to help use their influence with young people.</p><p>  In tandem with the education programme, we have been very active in taking our message and aims to the public in the short time the project has been ongoing.  We have had meetings and made presentations to the organisations identified in our aims.  We have been invited to speak to a variety of community and culturally based organisations.  In the past four months we have organised and hosted meetings with the Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys and people who are involved in the various parades and commemorations that will take part in the city.  The aim is to discuss and create a code of conduct and a set of rules and responsibilities for the participants in the events.  This work is very close to completion and we will produce a document and a blueprint for discussion in all areas of the province.  These meetings are ground-breaking and the bands forum is a major factor in this effort.  Progress has been made on proactive attempts to balance the negative press coverage by showing the work being done by the forum and our links with groups outside the city.  We are trying to address the negative images of the bands.  We are not saying that all criticism is unfair, but we are trying to create a balance.</p> <p>In the short-term, the honest and successful portrayal of band related issues, "The Pride", will soon be on show in Sligo where the play will feature at this year's fleadh.  One of the bands that did not play in last year's fleadh will also perform in Sligo where we will make presentations on behalf of the bands as part of our process of ongoing engagement.  </p><p> We have been working with the Cult&uacute;rlann in the city as part of our ongoing strategy of helping all communities to move forward.  We believe the people involved in the centre are genuine.  The cost of our project over two years will be &pound;124,500, which we believe will be the best money the International Fund for Ireland will ever spend.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.775" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Dougherty" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900007#H00200"><p>I do not intend to speak at length because my colleagues have discussed many of the benefits of the work we are doing to promote good relations in Londonderry.  I am the director of St. Columb's Park House Centre for Reconciliation, an organisation based in the Waterside that is involved in a range of peace-building programmes and projects.  We are also responsible for co-ordinating the Londonderry Bands Forum under which Mr. Moore is employed.</p><p>  I will comment briefly on the strategic importance of this type of work we do, its benefits in terms of good relations and the progress we made last year working with Ms N&iacute; Dhochartaigh and the Cult&uacute;rlann in building peace in Derry.  I was born in 1968 and grew up in the city of Derry.  I could not wait to leave the place.  As Mr. Burgess outlined in his play, "The Exodus", the whole dynamic of the city was affected by the geographical and demographic split that occurred when the Troubles were at their height.  In the past year, more has been done to promote good relations through culture than in the first 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  The principal reason was the opportunity the UK City of Culture provided to Protestants and Catholics in the city to push boundaries and put their heads above the parapet, as Mr. Kee outlined.  </p><p>  I was greatly frustrated to hear Dr. Richard Haass describe parading as a stumbling block to cementing peace in Northern Ireland.  I believe parading and the structures around it offer the key to finding a solution.  As Mr. Moore outlined, bands offer the most disciplined and organised structures for young people to engage in their personal development.  Northern Ireland has 660 bands in which 30,000 people are involved.  The vast majority of band members are young people who have a role to play.  The capacity building work Mr. Moore is doing with band leaders provides a wonderful opportunity for them to do so.</p><p>  The band leaders in loyalist communities should be youth and community workers because they make a significant impact on the ground.  The recent flag protests in Northern Ireland continued in parts of Derry city until as late as March last year.  One particular protest took place nightly outside Caw, a loyalist area of Derry.  Through the work of the Londonderry Bands Forum we encouraged the young people involved in the protests and the leaders who were organising them to consider the possibility of progressing a fledgling band.  They came to a meeting of the bands forum at which we discussed with them the possibility of engaging in the fleadh.  While their initial reaction was not positive, having listened to their peers, all of whom, unlike me, were bandsman, they eventually decided to give it a go.  They put their heart and soul into progressing the Caw band.  Having blocked roads in March, the young people led the parade to the Foyle Cup, an international soccer competition, through the city of Londonderry in June.  Their band was also one of five bands to play at the Gig Rig during the fleadh in August.  To move from such sectarianism, for want of a better word, to expressing their frustration and culture in a more progressive way marked significant progress.  This was only possible through the medium that culture provided. </p><p>  Shortly after the fleadh, a bandsman told me that having been largely marginalised for decades - as a minority community, Protestants are simply tolerated in Londonderry - he felt for the first time in his life that the attitude to him, his culture and his band had changed from tolerance to acceptance.  That is a major shift in the city and it demonstrates that it is much more comfortable in its own skin.  While the position is not perfect by any means, Protestants feel part of the city for the first time and there is a sense of pride that was not in evidence prior to the cultural revolution in which Me Moore, Mr. Kee and Mr. Burgess have played a major role. </p><p>  On the issue of leadership, St. Columb's Park House has been fighting consistently through its research to address the hunger in the Protestant community to establish new forms of leadership.  There is a real sense that Unionist politicians in the city have let down Protestants who now see band leaders and structures as potentially offering such leadership.  In last week's council and European elections more than half of young people in Protestant districts did not bother to vote.  This illustrates the need to provide other forms of leadership in the city.  </p></speech>

While listening to Mr. Dougherty, it struck me that we have not taken small steps but made major strides forward.  Last year, during the fleadh and various other events, it seemed as if Derry was waiting to blossom.  People from all communities had a sense of pride about their city and themselves.  There is a confidence that needs to be nurtured and community leadership will be key to doing so.</p><p>  All the speakers, in their own way, are giving good community leadership.  The secret of engagement is to create meaningful projects that work in the community.  Such leadership has been lacking for one reason and another and I am not speaking out of turn - it has been stated here and elsewhere - in pointing out that, unfortunately, leadership has been lacking in the Protestant community.  I describe the representatives of the Protestant community present today as community leaders because they are the key or secret to progress.  Our purpose today is to speak and answer any questions members may have.  </p></speech>

Members have made a number of visits to Northern Ireland.  Our visit to Derry earlier this year was incredible because one could see the positive and vibrant effect the fleadh had on the city.  The event did not receive adequate attention.  As Ms N&iacute; Dhochartaigh correctly noted, it was the occasion of major strides rather than small steps for Derry.</p> <p>I am looking forward to the witnesses coming to Sligo from 10 to 17 August 2014 and to meeting them.  It is very near where I live.</p><p> I was at the European elections count in Castlebar last Monday.  Behind the count centre is the Mayo Peace Park.  We tend to forget our history.  If one forgets it, one is doomed to repeat it.  Here was a park for the many young Mayo men and women who died in the First World War and Second World War about whom we had totally forgotten.  In 2008, the peace park was created but 95% of people in Mayo do not understand this rich history with which we are starting to grapple.  It is an issue I am passionate about as I come from Boyle and note the 126 young men from a town with a population of 3,000 who died fighting with the Connaught Rangers.  They were totally air-brushed from our history.  These are matters into which we must look ourselves to realise where we come from.</p><p> What we are discussing here is more of a music festival that brought all traditions together and it must be publicised.  It has done huge good work in Derry.  Is Belfast ready for a fleadh?  While it could be a step too far, it has done incredible things in the north-west region.  It needs to be highlighted that it has been so positive.  Is Belfast ready?  It could be positive, but I ask the experts.  While they are not from Belfast, I want to know their opinion.</p></speech>

It is a challenging question to be fair and, no doubt, people will have an opinion on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.781" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900008#J00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I note that this is one of the most positive things that has happened in a very long time.  The wider cultural aspect of it has been the fleadh in Derry, the city of culture.  It was hugely encouraging that many people travelled from the Twenty-six Counties to the Six Counties to attend the fleadh.  More importantly, they had a great time and thought it was very well presented.  It broke down a perception that had been built up over decades with the Troubles.  It had a huge impact on people.</p><p>  Mr. Dougherty mentioned 660 bands and the 30,000 young people involved in them.  He also made reference to band leaders and said they should be the youth leaders.  That is a very good idea.  The manipulation of bands for political and sectarian reasons has been a concern to many of us who have been trying to build cross-community relations and create a framework in which people can see others as equals rather than to focus on the labels associated with them.  I refer to the role of the Unionist political parties on this.  We have a committee here and try to do the best we can.  The engagement we have with the Unionist, Protestant, loyalist communities is with groups like this and meeting them.  There are seats here for the elected unionist representatives, which they have yet to take up.  It does a disservice to everything the witnesses are trying to do.  It is disappointing that people who have the mandate to represent their communities fail to avail of it.  Having said that, the committee has been to many parts of the Six Counties and to Unionist, loyalist and Nationalist areas.  Among the ordinary people who make a difference on the ground, there is a growing mutual respect, which is very encouraging.  It is something that needs to be continued.</p><p>  The debate within Unionist communities on the Irish language and the Irish language Act promised under the St. Andrews Agreement are outstanding issues.  Cultural matters will play a huge role in progressing those matters.  The witnesses are breaking down barriers every day.  Breaking down those barriers creates that mutual respect.  Creating that mutual respect leads to the implementation of what was agreed in a coherent and cohesive way.  That is something I welcome.</p><p>  The role of good cultural relations was mentioned.  It is excellent that Protestant children are attending the bunscoil and that people can be educated together.  You have integration of young people who see each other for what they are - human beings and kids, not labels.  That is to be welcomed.</p><p>  We are legislators and elected representatives from different parties.  Some of the witnesses might like to elaborate on our role and the role of those within the Unionist communities.  Are the witnesses satisfied with our role and with their role regarding the building of the necessary relationships?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.782" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900008#J00400"><p>I welcome the group which has made the presentation and apologise for missing it.  Deputy Crowe and I were attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade as this meeting commenced.  As one who attended the fleadh in Derry last August, I note that it was a great event.  There were huge crowds, a great atmosphere and a wide range of activities.  It was a great week.  I am very familiar with the Fleadh as it was held in Cavan for three years, in which good town I live.  The fleadh is not just about music nowadays.  There is a huge range of cultural events outside the music arena which adds a very welcome new dimension to the fleadh week.  That was very evident in Derry.  When one looked at the cl&aacute;r, one did not know where to be there was such a great range of attractive events taking place at the same time.</p><p>  The Chairman, Deputy McHugh, and I were in Derry some months ago and we met some of the groups.  The whole area of cultural activities has the potential to bring people together to a greater extent to work on common interests.  How does the city council interact in this regard?  It was very much involved the Fleadh as was necessary to provide the necessary infrastructure and human resources to make its hosting feasible.  I note that there has been a reconfiguration of local authorities and district councils in Northern Ireland.  Do local authorities take a leading role in the promotion of cultural activities?</p> <p>Regardless of the deficiencies in public administration, whether at national level or local level, there is always room for improvement.  Oftentimes the statutory framework has the potential to bring together different groups and to leverage better outcomes and more activity.  To my knowledge, Derry City Council has been a rather progressive council over the years.  Derry has put the past behind it far quicker than Belfast.  Thankfully, we do not hear of violence in Derry for the most part and we have no wish to hear of it.  Does the statutory framework and its architecture assist the deputations in their daily work and ongoing activities and in their programmes and hopes for the future?  I am sorry I missed the presentation but I will get an opportunity to read it when it is published.  From my knowledge of their work the deputations deserve great commendation.  I wish them well in the initiatives under way to improve life for all society locally.</p></speech>

Festivals, by their nature, should be inclusive rather than exclusive and this is what the deputations have pulled together in respect of the Fleadh Cheoil and the work of its executive committee in the city.  People say that if we could have bottled what happened in Derry during that period we could all have benefited from a sup of it.</p><p>  What will happen now?  The city has had this success and the deputations have brought people together.  What is next step?  What are they looking for in terms of support?</p><p>  People have spoken of Derry and the surrounding region.  I gather access is one difficulty.  Should the road infrastructure and tourism be developed to a greater extent?  I realise bridges have been built and so on.  If the deputations had a magic wand in the morning what would they do in this area?</p><p>  People have commented on the fact that things are different in the Derry region compared to Belfast.  What do the deputations put that down to?  Is it that people are talking to and meeting each other?  Is it because it is a smaller area and people know each other?  Is it a matter of leadership, whether political leadership or leadership from the churches, the community and so on?  What is the difference?  If the deputations were to send a message to the areas clearly in conflict or where there are difficulties at the moment, what would they say about what has worked for Derry and what they would like to see replicated elsewhere?</p><p>  What about the financial benefits for businesses in terms of pounds, shillings and pence?  Have the deputations outlined the benefits in the submission?  Were jobs created?  Was there more employment during that period?  Has there been associated economic benefits and spin-off benefits?</p><p>  The fact that it was enjoyable is relevant.  Among everyone I know who was involved the common factor was enjoyment.  The executive committee pulled all these things together but at the end of the day it was enjoyable.  It was not about symbolism, rather it was about all these other things.  The most important thing for all the people who took part was that they enjoyed it.  Will they come back?  Anyone I talked to who travelled to Derry, including people from outside Ireland, was excited.  It was talked of as the gig of the year.  Where does Derry go from here?  Well done to the deputations.</p></speech>

What I find most interesting is the fact that over a 12 month period such change unfolded in the area.  It is more an observation than a question.  It has been good for us to hear this.  What we need to do is figure out how the knowledge and experience the deputations have gained in the past 12 months as well as the changes that have taken place in the city can be harnessed for the rest of Northern Ireland and the Border counties to determine if change can take place in those areas as well.  The knowledge and experience gained needs to be tapped into for the wider area.  I am keen to see some way that the deputations could be contacted by other communities to ensure the knowledge they have gained over the period is not lost and such that it could be harnessed elsewhere.  We need to consider ways to facilitate that, if possible.</p></speech>

I am happy to address the points raised, all of which were valid.  I will begin with the comments of Deputy Frank Feighan on Belfast and the Fleadh Cheoil.  We had many obstacles.  Initially, the fleadh bid was rather public and it was not without its problems.  Furthermore, we had to sell the fleadh to people who had never been to the North before.  Some people had preconceived ideas about what the fleadh would be like, how difficult it would be for them and how it would not be safe.  There were various other obstacles in the way initially which we had to get over.  It was a constant hill to climb.  We can talk now, just as we should, about how successful it was as an enjoyable event and for community building as well as the various other tourism benefits and so on.</p><p>  Reference was made to Belfast.  I suppose those in Belfast must do all the groundwork.  They have to do their homework and get their communities to buy into it.  All I can say is that if there is a will, there is a way.  I see no reason why Belfast should not host the fleadh or anywhere else in the North for that matter.  Derry has done it.  It is not rocket science.  People simply need to have the will to engage.  They must have their communities behind them and get community leaders to drive the process forward.</p><p>  We focused our thinking, as Deputy Ferris noted, in terms of music.  There was a major focus on that, although it was only one of the vehicles in terms of community engagement that has worked and that does work.  We have an ongoing project.  Although the fleadh seems to have been the highlight of what we did during the year there were other community engagement projects leading up to the fleadh.  One such event was Singing the Bridge from which we are about to embark on a substantial three year programme with an international music organisation, Musicians without Borders.  I am unsure whether the committee members have heard of it.  We have done work in areas coming out of conflict using music as a vehicle for engagement.  There is also a programme to train community leaders.  We have seen what the bands forum leaders are doing.  People see them as community leaders and that is what they are.  The idea is to target such people in a meaningful project using music as a vehicle for engagement and training.</p><p>  I will push on because Mr. Mac Niallais and others may wish to comment at this stage.  Our engagement with the city council has been very positive.  The fleadh is a huge animal.  It is not the small event it used to be when it took place in small villages in Ireland.  It is a major event and it cannot work without the support of the local council.  We had all of that.  Our dealings with Sharon O'Connor, the chief executive, were very good.  We had the support and the back up of the various committees at our disposal and this was without a doubt positive and helpful.  Mr. Mac Niallais may wish to comment on some of these points.</p></speech>

There was an issue around the designation of Derry as the United Kingdom city of culture which created problems in some people's minds, although personally I could not really understand it.  One of the other major issues in terms of bringing the fleadh to Derry was that it is a city.  Some people took the view that it was too big and consequently that it would not work there.</p> <p>We saw off that kind of argument.  I am surprised that others did not touch on the fact that the day before the Fleadh started there were 20,000 Protestant loyalists marching through the city of Derry.  When we got the bid for the Fleadh we were aware that would happen and said we had to take it on board.  It had to be part of the engagement with people in the Unionist community.  The last thing we wanted was petrol bombs flying back and forth the day before the Fleadh was due to open.  It was the quietest Apprentice Boys of Derry commemoration in years, which was not a coincidence.  That was due to a lot of hard work by people across the city, on both sides of the river.</p><p> It is for people in Belfast to make a call.  It has to be done on the basis of being as inclusive as possible.  The Fleadh is regarded as an economic generator.  It can generate millions of pounds or euro for local economies.  We could also consider it as a peace generator.  That was part of its role in Derry.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; touched on that magnificently in Derry.</p><p> Politicians have a very powerful role in society, which can be negative or positive.  For the most part, Derry politicians have been very positive.  I speak from personal experience in my engagement with William Hay, MLA, who represents the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, in the city and is Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  He has been very positive across the board and it is regrettable that he is retiring.  He will be missed.  I hope whoever succeeds him in representing the Unionist community will be as positive as he has been since the Assembly got up and running.</p><p> The council was positive.  People in Derry would be quite critical of the council&rsquo;s engagement with communities.  We are the people who elect the councillors.  They will be increasingly held to account.  It remains to be seen how the new super councils will kick in.  The cultural drive will come from local communities.  The council has only to facilitate what the communities want to do.</p></speech>

Although bands culture was an integral part of my life as I grew up I have never been in a band.  Mr. Moore is in a better position to talk about that.  There are many misconceptions and myths about what bands represent.  The media focus on Twadell Avenue last year accentuated those myths.  The Parades Commission is at pains to point out that there are 4,500 parades in Northern Ireland every year, of all types, not just loyalist parades and it has to make a determination on less than 5% of those.  Between 95% and 98% of what bands do is locally-based, village musical competitions.  They are like sports competitions, where the interest is simply to be better than the band from the next village.  The majority of them are not politicised.  For example, the Newbuildings band is going to the Fleadh in August.  It has two bands, with a combined membership of approximately 100, of which approximately 50 or 60 are under the age of 21.  They practise 52 weeks a year.  There is no youth club in Newbuildings that could cater for that number of people over the year.</p><p>  The bands have a major role in building confidence in those young people.  Most of those attracted to them are the most marginalised in Protestant society.  Some of the figures in recent reports about educational under-attainment among Protestant boys show it is crucial to maximise the potential of this type of structure.  Mr. Moore is involved in a capacity-building training programme in schools.  It is ironic that we find it easier to get into the Catholic than the Protestant schools.  That perception exists within many elements of Protestant society.  The bandsmen and bandmasters are not perfect but they are the most progressive group of people I have ever worked with.  I have a good relationship with them.  We have an opportunity to build on that.</p><p>  I am as frustrated as the committee members at the lack of consistency in Unionist representation at meetings such as this.  Our politicians in the city have been progressive in many ways.  Derry has always had a history of communication and dialogue from the mid-1990s.  That ethos and mentality made it easier to sell the concept of Unionist engagement in the Fleadh because the groundwork had been done.  As Mr. Mac Niallais said, William Hay was at the forefront of much of that work.  Unfortunately, it is not consistent across the board in the city.  We are trying to work towards achieving that.  In the run-up to the Fleadh the Unionist politicians were slightly wary of whether to support it.  It came to a point where the bands said, "To hell with you" &ndash; excuse my language &ndash; "we are going to do this".  That opened the floodgates for the broader Protestant loyalist community to endorse it because these were respected, credible leaders in their community.  The majority of Protestants in the city did engage, they went across to the city centre and enjoyed it.  That had an economic impact because up to the opening of the Fleadh the local bars and shops were wary of whether to endorse it.  When the bands endorsed it they felt free to endorse it and get into the mood in the city.</p><p>  The strategic part of Derry City Council has always been very progressive.  We did research in 2005 that indicated otherwise but in the years preceding that there was a huge push by the council&rsquo;s good relations department to ensure the minority community was fully engaged in all forms of good relations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moore" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900010#L00300"><p>I will speak from the bands' point of view and stay outside the strategic issues others have discussed.  Participation in the Fleadh was not as big a deal for bands as others might think.  Within the city and within other cultures there might have been questions about why they did it.  Two of the bands at the Fleadh have been coming to the Limerick International Band Festival for the past 15 years.</p> <p>They have received a great reception.  At times in the North when we could march nowhere, we were more than accepted in Limerick and Cork.</p><p> Reference was made to bands in Belfast.  Some of the bands around Belfast also go to Limerick to play.  People do not realise that bands are pretty insular.  We are very lucky down in the city - the 14 bands in the forum are really lucky to have me because I have the only full-time position in the country and I am at the end of a phone.  Most of my life in a band has been spent going home from work and working for the band then, working with other people.  There was never anyone one could telephone on a Monday morning at ten o'clock to try to sort out problems and to pass on information.  It is far easier to deal through a central person or a central organisation.  The bands forums are not as strong in Belfast as in the rest of the country.  There are so many bands in Belfast and it is much like a football team in that people want their best players so they keep to themselves all the time.  There is no huge structure among bands.  In the case of two or three bands in the Village area of Belfast there would be more animosity between those bands than there would be between them and their Catholic neighbours anywhere else.  That is the sort of mentality around Belfast.</p><p> On the issue of helping out in Belfast, Brian Dougherty and I have spoken recently to an outreach worker from Sinn F&eacute;in in the city who came to visit us.  We stressed to him that perhaps the key lies with them engaging with the bands in Belfast and not the other way around.  We feel that they could exert more influence around some of the trouble spots.  How can they say that marching bands are a problem in Belfast when they do not say that in Derry?  It is a perception.  We feel that maybe Sinn F&eacute;in has more power than they realise or are prepared to use in those situations.  They could use us as an example.  We work with the schools and we are trying to take the demonisation out of being in a band.  We use the analogy that young Catholics going to school with musical instruments are musicians while young Protestants with flutes are in a band and they are not classed as musicians.  From the perspective of the bands it is not a big deal because it is about the music.  We tend to stay away from the political end of things.  Some bands around Belfast and other places are politically motivated by sections of the community but on the whole, we do not practice for 50 weeks of the year and spend &pound;30,000 to &pound;100,000 in gear to go out and annoy people; it is just too big for that.</p></speech>

The good news is that the party goes on.  We have just come down from a very successful pan-Celtic festival in which we all participated.  We have had the jazz festival and the Clipper yacht race again this year.  I am glad to say that the walled city tattoo is back due to the success of last year.  The sun shines some days up in Derry so the show goes on.  It is evident that resources are not as plentiful as last year so we have to cut our cloth to suit.  In view of the work there will be a lasting legacy in Derry city.</p><p>  The question of Belfast keeps coming up.  We were asked if we could leave here today and go to Belfast and maybe sort out the issue there.  Perhaps the reason for the question is whether the PUL community would be included.  I do not know the answer to that question.  I wish to be associated with Derek Moore's remarks that we should take small steps at a time rather than trying to sort things out overnight.  We have a template in Derry city that can work elsewhere but it is a case of identifying those leaders in the community who are prepared to take an odd knock and who have an influence.  The bands forum and places like An Cult&uacute;rlann can provide that leadership.</p></speech>

We had a great year last year as part of the UK city of culture.  We got to do things that were bigger and better than we could ever have imagined.  We could not have achieved the scale of events such as the Tattoo with 13,000 people over four nights.  We could not have that scale without the UK city of culture accolade.  It is a question of how to get that to filter on.  We do not have a massive population to support arts and culture activities and we have to look to the public purse for funding.  The committee members will know better than anyone the strain being put on the public purse because of the recession and recovery.  We have to line up in the queue.  I am sure the city did very well economically and in the number of bed nights for specific events but we are not privy to those figures.  It would be nice to see the level of funding and the desire to create a legacy to be built on and to continue in the future and that those events can be made and sustained.  From the point of view of community relations what has happened in the city is that the people in what is a fairly small Protestant community within the city, know each other fairly well and act cohesively quite well together.  The city council has tried to drag people in to facilitate stories and to tell stories.  They have been quite proactive for which their officers should be congratulated because it has resulted in a good community relations outlook.  I work with the telling of the single identity stories.  I always come back to the point that in terms of keeping the Protestant community engaged it is creating the opportunities for single identity work whereby we are working with people to try to establish their story and to identify their culture and to manifest it in the public forum for everyone to see and to appreciate, instead of people being part of a culture which is reactive, with people having cultural positions which are in spite of other people as opposed to being actually what one is.  Once people feel comfortable enough within their own community - by that I mean the entire community - to represent their own opinion then that is when the genuine peace-building begins because that is when they tell their story and they are heard and it is received and it is not a scary thing to have opinions which are from a cultural perspective.  We do not all have to go into the middle and agree that beige is the one colour that we all like.  That is my opinion.</p></speech>

Whenever culture is on show and has been on show, it has been something that shows the difference in people.  One culture is different from another because of this, that and the other.  As Jonathan Burgess says, one does not necessarily have to go to the middle ground.  What the Fleadh has done and what we do in our work is to provide people with an opportunity to show their culture.  On a personal and psychological level, people are very interested in their own identity.  Culture gives people an opportunity to identify their own culture and also to be proud of it and to celebrate it.</p><p>  At one of the meetings a discussion took place and one of the band members said that at the end of the day they were all musicians and they love to show off.  They all wanted to have the opportunity to show what they could do.  As Derek Moore said they practice and they spend a lot of money so they are passionate about it.  At another meeting it was very clear that because of the symbols present in the room, such as the shirts being worn and key-rings, the conversation began.  At the end of the meeting, all those symbols had really disappeared.</p> <p>From my personal experience, that has not happened very often, because those types of symbols are very much the things that take precedent.  In fact, what people say is often regarded as secondary to the symbols they display.  During those meetings, however, I found that it did not matter what tattoo somebody had or what they were wearing; they were talking about something they were passionate about in a way that was not offensive to anybody else.  The lesson we can take from that is that people want to have an opportunity to investigate and celebrate their own identity, and they are very passionate about it.  Culture and music provide a space to do that in a way which has not been done in the past, in a positive rather than a negative way.</p></speech>

Reference was made to infrastructural issues, problems with job creation and the continuing problem of poverty.  These are ongoing issues and are greater than we around this table can solve.  All we can do is work within our communities to bring a positive sense of belonging to people.  I sit on the board of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and one of the major elements of its strategy for the coming years is the question of how to engage with impoverished communities and bring the arts to them.  There are aspects of the arts that are very important in people's lives.  The fleadh, for example, has played a role in facilitating community engagement and peace-building, but it also simply an enjoyable event.  People living in areas of poverty need some of that in their life.  It is what we are about and will continue to be about.</p></speech>

We have learned some interesting things today which will add value to the committee's work.  Gabhaim comhghairdeas le Donncha Mac Niallais as an obair iontach at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh aige maidir leis an teanga.  We appreciate his observations on the language and wish him well in his work.  As discussed, there is the outstanding issue of an Irish language Act and so on.  Mr. Mac Niallais should feel free to contact us if he ever wishes to discuss that or any other issue.</p><p>  Deputy Feighan and I attended an event hosted by the City of London Corporation in the London Guildhall during President Higgins's State visit.  I am not sure whether the delegates have read or heard the speech the President made on that occasion but it was a phenomenal tribute to the work they have been doing in Derry in the past year or so.  We will send them a copy of the speech, which offered real insight into the historical connection between the City of London Corporation and the city of Derry, which was the genesis of Londonderry.  It is part of the unique history of the city.  It was a very powerful contribution and, as I said, an acknowledgment of the work being done by the delegates.</p><p>  There have been several high-level political visits to the city in recent times.  President Higgins was there in March last year, as the delegates will recall.  I hope that level of engagement will continue in the future.  I support the comments regarding Willie Hay, and not just because he was born in Kilmacrennan in my own county of Donegal.  We take pride in the great work he is doing there.</p><p>  Reference was made to finding a language that will help us to move from tolerance to acceptance.  That is something we all want to see.  We do not want communities feeling vulnerable and in danger of losing their identity or part of their culture.  The delegates are seeking to celebrate the different cultures and identities in Northern Ireland and create a safe environment and space for that purpose.</p><p>  When we travel to the North we always hear people from different groups saying that the peace process, which is still in the embryonic stage, is very much a case of two steps forward and one step back.  We are delighted to hear a new phrase today, which is that Derry is striding forward.  We wish the delegates well in their work and will be happy to assist them at any stage.</p></speech>

My initial contact with the partnership was through Mr. Maurice Kincaid, whom I met in Boston, and from whom I obtained a good insight into the work the partnership does.  The committee is familiar with the cultural aspect of the partnership's work.  For the information of members, the East Belfast Partnership is a social partnership with community, statutory, political and business members dedicated to regeneration of east Belfast.  It was formed in 1995 and given responsibility to encourage stakeholder organisations to work together to develop and implement plans for the social, economic, environmental and cultural regeneration of east Belfast.  I am familiar with the work the partnership does in respect of the C. S. Lewis festival.  We look forward to other hearing about the other projects the partnership has under way and the impact these are having not only on the development of east Belfast but also on that of the city in general.  As Ms Langham is aware, our earlier discussion focused on the role of arts and culture in enhancing reconciliation.  The East Belfast Partnership has a strong focus on cultural regeneration and perhaps she might explain this in greater detail.</p><p>  Before she makes her presentation, I wish to advise Ms Langham that she is protected in respect of her evidence to the committee.  However, if she is directed by the committee to cease making remarks in respect of a particular matter and continues to do so, she will be entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of those remarks.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

For a city of its size, location and relatively short history, Belfast has given the world more than its fair share of remarkable people.  In the context of Belfast as a whole, it is in the east that the brightest stars have risen.  I will now refer to some of the projects in which the partnership has been involved and which it is currently undertaking in east Belfast.<br/>I always like to show this first slide because it reminds me very much of the work with which I am involved in the context of establishing a new greenway in east Belfast.  It illustrates the power of landscape and good design.  I do not know if members are familiar with the location depicted in the slide but I will comment further on it later.  To date, no one to whom the slide has been shown has guessed the location correctly.<br/>East Belfast is an area of need.  It is quite similar to other deprived urban locations in Belfast and elsewhere throughout Northern Ireland.  Listed on the second slide are some of the factors we are trying to address by means of the work of the partnership.  I was recently obliged to give a presentation on C. S. Lewis to a group of Americans.  I carried out a Google search in respect of east Belfast and the third slide shows the images which appeared.  Said images are not indicative of the east Belfast I see in the course of my work.  The 2014 edition of the <i>Rough Guide to Ireland</i>states, &quot;In East Belfast, across the river beyond the great cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, lies suburbia and very little of interest apart from Stormont ... it is inadvisable to go visit&quot;.  That is something which the partnership is working very hard to address and I am of the view that we have made good inroads in that regard.<br/>The partnership's stated mission is to make east Belfast a better place.  The projects in which we are involved are very much focused on that.  As a result of the time constraints, I will limit myself to discussing the projects relating to arts development, the Connswater Community Greenway - which I am heading up - the Holywood Arches plan and tourism.  The next slide illustrates some of the work we have done on the main arterial routes in east Belfast.  This work includes new shop fronts, pocket parks and trying to tackle the dereliction in the heart of the area.  The projects in this regard have been very successful and they have helped to change the look of the area in the past couple of years.<br/>The Giro d'Italia cycle race recently went through inner east Belfast.  Part of our role in this regard was to work with the different communities along the route in order to try to get them to engage with the race.  The members of the communities in question would not usually engage with cycling but we tried to encourage them to work towards welcoming tens of thousands of people to our city.  We had a brilliant and successful day when the race came through.<br/>I take inspiration for the work I do from the role model project of the High Line in New York, which is depicted by the green strip in the image on the right in the next slide.  The High Line is a greenway which was developed along the route of the old railway that used to run through Manhattan.  One the right had side of the slide is a picture of the River Lagan, beside which is depicted a sort of green footprint.  The latter shows the scale of the project I am currently leading, namely, the Connswater Community Greenway.  We have seen how river regeneration has worked in many other cities.  I am aware that there are greenways in the south of Ireland as a result of discussions I had with members of the Committee for Regional Development, who visited the Great Western Greenway in Mayo.<br/>The problems we face in the context of developing the greenway at Connswater include the poor quality of the water in the rivers, combined sewer outfalls and tidal surges.  The picture in the top left quadrant of the next slide shows the sandbags we were obliged to put in place in January when a tidal surge occurred.  I am sure such surges also occurred in rivers here during the same period.  The picture in the top right quadrant shows the flooding which seems to have become an annual event in the city.  The greenway we are developing is based around the rivers but it also includes a significant integrated flood alleviation scheme.  It will also comprise a 9 km linear park, 30 new bridges or crossings, 16 km of foot and cycle paths, tourist and heritage trails, signage and a new C. S. Lewis civic square.  In addition, it will serve 26 schools and colleges.  These are the key outputs they will benefit at least 41,000 who live alongside the rivers relating to the greenway.<br/>While the greenway is an investment in the physical environment, we are also seeking social outcomes.  Our work does not just relate to making the place look better.  What we are trying to achieve is very much based on promoting community safety and cohesion, creating a stronger and safer community and developing a welcoming place in which people feel comfortable.  The latter has come across strongly in the context of the community consultation relating to the project in which we have been involved since 2005.  People want a place for their families, a place where they feel comfortable, a place they can call their own.<br/>We have worked with people in the context of supporting community learning and creating opportunities.  This is aimed at assisting them in improving their quality of life.</p> <p>One of the other key drivers we are looking at is promoting well-being, providing places for recreation and exercise resulting in healthier and more active people and communities.  This slide shows a combination of pictures of people engaged in activities.  We have community gardens.  We have taken children to show them good examples of growing and from where plants come.  They did not know from where potatoes or carrots come.  That exercise has been very successful.  We have just completed phase one, which took place in Victoria Park.  I assume the members are familiar with Belfast but the Sydenham bypass is the road that can be seen at the edge of the top of the map, which is quite close to the George Best Belfast City Airport.  We have recently completed an area  in Orangefield.  </p><p> One of the key things we have done at this stage is put in new path networks.  We have put in a new bridge that links east Belfast through to the new Harbour Estate.  Much of our work is about linking through to the Titanic Quarter, linking to the city centre and linking the communities together.  Over the years the rivers that have run through east Belfast have acted as another interface and have separated communities.  Part of what we are doing is connecting people back together, connecting people and places.  That is why we have all our new improved bridges and crossings.  The next slide shows pictures of the bridge opening, which opened on 4 April 2014.  We tried to get 2,014 people to cross the bridge at the opening; we got 2,287 people and we were quite pleased with that number.  Since then there has been more than 46,000 crossings of the bridge.  I have not been counting the crossings but we have one of those counters in place and I can daily log in to check the average use of the bridge.  This bridge connects east Belfast to the Harbour Estate which links through to the Titanic Quarter, which had never been connected previously.  In terms of creating history, we are making significant changes in east Belfast.  It is the Sam Thompson Bridge.  Sam Thompson was a playwright.  He worked in a shipyard.  He was probably best known for a play he produced called "Over the Bridge" which very much tackles sectarianism within the shipyard.  Through a public vote process the bridge was named Sam Thompson Bridge.</p><p> The next slide shows an area in Orangefield Park where we have extended the park but we have also moved the path of the river - the project has involved literally moving the paths of rivers and building bridges.  We moved the path of the river right to become a central feature of the park and extended the park to make a much better amenity.  The black line in the top picture is where the river used to flow beside those houses - they suffered from the threat of annual flooding and were uninsurable.  This gives members an idea of the new pathways of the rivers now in place.  The construction site is still not open but we have planted the areas adjacent to it and already it is looking fantastic.</p><p> Under the next phase of the project we are putting a new civic square into the heart of east Belfast, an outdoor event space.  It is called the C.S. Lewis Square and I will talk a little more about C.S. Lewis shortly.  This slide shows a cycle cafe and we have plans for such a cafe on the square and also for a new information centre.  It will mean that people visiting east Belfast will have a place to start their journey and can find out all about the tourist product there.  We have held two years of successful arts festivals in east Belfast and there are plans to hold a further festival in August.</p><p> Last November was the 50th anniversary of C.S. Lewis's death and to recognise that we held a C.S. Lewis festival.  C.S. Lewis came from east Belfast, which not many people, and certainly not many people in east Belfast, knew.  We had 26 different events, many of them local, based in the city centre, working with schools and libraries and it was a very successful event.  We also produced our new  C.S. Lewis Trail and I have brought a few of these with me and they glow in the dark.  It tells the story of east Belfast and C.S. Lewis as an east Belfast man. </p><p>I like this picture that is now displayed because it shows the potential.  The dots on the map are the C.S. Lewis based organisations throughout the world.  What is interesting is that obviously we do not have any but we have C.S. Lewis and that shows the potential.  We recently talked to representatives of the C.S. Lewis Institute who visited Belfast about how to develop our links with C.S. Lewis and then with the other organisations. </p><p> We have just launched an arts strategy for east Belfast.  This is on the basis that only 4% of Belfast's money that goes towards arts comes to the east of the city.  There was a gap very much for us to start building the product around art in east Belfast.  We are looking at a new arts centre and we have plans to bring in arts officers and develop that product in east Belfast.</p><p> This is my second last slide.  I always liked this picture because it reminds me very much of the people of east Belfast who are definitely the independent spirted type, with a strong work ethic and ambitious.  By celebrating the people and the characters we know, whether it is the yardmen or the literary legends who are the artistic heroes, we have the opportunity to capture the imagination and bring visitors to east Belfast and also to celebrate our own achievements and our inspirational potential.</p><p> On the opening of Titanic Belfast, we tried to recreate the picture in the top left hand corner of the slide and to celebrate the people from east Belfast and their role in the building of ships and the Titanic.  We organised a community activity.  We asked people to dress as yardmen, which, as the members can see, surprisingly, they did.  They might see a few who they recognise in the front of the picture, Sammy Douglas - I do not know if any of the members knows him.  He is in the middle in the front of the picture.  Dan Gordon is also there.  Well over 1,000 yardmen did a yardmen cycle and walk and raised &pound;23,000 for bowel cancer.  For me that shows the strength of character and the strength of the participation of the people of east Belfast in getting together to celebrate but also to do something positive and to give back.  That is type of project and the sorts of activities in which I am involved.</p><p> To return to the first slide that showed the landscape, for me, the power of landscape to tell the stories is very important.  The first image is from the Famine memorial centre in the financial district in New York.  Throughout the development of the greenway, like many projects, we have been very ambitious.  I want it to be like the High Line in New York.  I want great public art and I want it to become a destination.  For me, it is a reminder that we have to aim high because only by aiming high we can really achieve our full potential.</p></speech>

I congratulate those involved.  It is the way forward.  We are embracing greenways in this country and they are hugely successful.  Is it intended to create more greenways across the city of Belfast in order to link one in with another?  I agree that once such a project is started, people will see how successful it is and will want more.  People look for 30 miles or 40 miles of greenway but I have always said that it is important to get just 5 miles and then people will see how successful it is and more can be done.  It is important to link the various traditions in Belfast, across Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

The High Line in New York shows how imagination can show off part of a city people do not normally visit in large numbers.  A greenway could have a hugely beneficial impact on a city.  I wish those involved well in their work.  Greenways have worked well elsewhere and there is no reason for them not to work equally well in Belfast.  The example mentioned has been incredibly successful.</p></speech>

I commend the work they are trying to do and the efforts they are making to make the city a more welcoming place.  Reference was made to deprivation and poverty and the perception that it would be inadvisable to visit certain areas.  Is there a difference between east Belfast, west Belfast and North Belfast in terms of deprivation, poverty and unemployment and what are the outworkings of that?</p><p>  Would it be fair to say that an investment programme as is envisaged, as well as a job creation programme, is necessary to turn the situation around?  The media perception is based on the conflict around flags which is concentrated in the east Belfast area.  If one promotes an area in a different light and tries to end deprivation and create employment that would provide a mechanism by which one could remedy existing problems.  The promotion used by the witnesses is very welcome and will change perceptions.</p></speech>

A number of things were mentioned.  Deputy Feighan mentioned visiting the Skainos Centre.  One is struck when one goes up the Newtownards Road by the number of abandoned shops.  It was said that the area was cleaned up for the Giro d'Italia.  One of the success stories in places such as Galway are pop-up shops used by artists and others.  Has that been considered in order to bring life to the area?  Whatever about going to the area during the day it is depressing at night and not very welcoming.  I have not seen the area since the Giro d'Italia but such an approach could be something to discuss with the local authority and others.  Perhaps something could be done with the goodwill of the Governments as the road is the main spine into east Belfast and if it is rundown and shops are closed then one could ask why one would visit it.  The Rough Guide to Ireland conclusion that it is inadvisable to visit the area is understandable.  When was the report written?</p></speech>

Is there an update in that regard?  What are the witnesses trying to do?  Reference was made to C.S. Lewis, the writer of the Narnia series.  Is there reference to him in the murals?  The question could be asked about where one would bring people with an interest in such matters.  It could be a welcome development if one could see characters from the books depicted in murals in the area.</p><p>  The river generation project is exciting.  Local authorities and others are involved.  Reference was made to the importance of having an inclusive space that families could call their own.  It is important that it would be safe along the river.  Has the inclusion of activities been considered, for example, placing exercise machines along the banks?  Allotments are very popular in Britain and Ireland.  Has that aspect of land use been considered?  They encourage people to grow their own plants but it is also activity which means more people will be about and that makes people feel more comfortable.  I wish the witnesses well.  They have a considerable task ahead of them in terms of things that need to be done but change is evident.  We were all impressed with the Skainos Centre, the tent and shared space, which is attracting visitors.</p><p>  There was reference to people visiting the area.  Is there accommodation that would help to build on the C. S. Lewis theme?  When we were in the Short Strand area there was talk about linking it to the area across the river in the Titanic Quarter but it is difficult to get there from the Short Strand.  There is no bridge that links the areas.  I do not think anyone from the Short Strand area even worked in the Titanic Quarter but they could still see the shipyards.  It was a case of looking in rather than being part of it.  Are there proposals for development to build a linkage bridge along that stretch?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900015#Q00700"><p>I thank Ms Langham for her positive contribution, outlining the potential for development and the positive picture for east Belfast which is important as well.  The general commentary on the development that has taken place so far in the Titanic Quarter, for example, is that very few employment opportunities have been created for the local population.  Has that improved in any way in recent times or is there a likelihood that it would?  Are there specific training programmes under way to ensure that one has within the local community people with the requisite skills to take up whatever employment opportunities there may be?</p><p>  In the financial services centre area of Dublin the community was very well supported, for example, in the development of child care services, by major local companies based in the area.  The companies took it on as part of their corporate responsibility.  Major businesses supported local community initiatives.  That brought to the fore the value of the employment.  Unfortunately, in the area in question very few members of the local community gained employment in the companies but it gave a certain ownership of the businesses there to the local community.  That is an area that could be targeted for the potential benefit of the businesses that are sited there in addition to benefitting the local community.  I wish the witnesses well with the regeneration project.</p> <p>It is absolutely necessary and would be a great message to get out not just to our community but internationally also.</p></speech>

I visited east Belfast recently and I intend returning shortly, but I am most interested in what is happening with education in east Belfast.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Wendy Langham" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014052900016#R00300"><p>I thank the members for their questions.  The first question Deputy Feighan asked was about the links with the other greenways and plans to expand.  Our greenway is 9 km in length, but that is 16 km of cycle and walkways.  We intersect the Comber greenway, which is an existing greenway that runs through east Belfast and is now connected through to the Titanic Quarter and the city.  That is key for us.  We are building our new civic square at the intersection point, so linking to the Titanic Quarter and the city centre is very important.</p><p>  The Department for Regional Development, DRD, roads section has just set up a new cycling unit in Belfast and we are very keen to work with them about expanding and linking to other parts of the city.  Also, the design team that worked with us initially has been working with the Shankill partnership, and I know they have plans for a Shankill greenway.  I am glad to say we have got the best greenway, however, because we have got the rivers, which make it unique and special, but we have learned a good deal.  We have used legislation like the public path creation orders to acquire land.  We have been working at this for a number of years so we are keen to help other parts of the city learn from the lessons we have learned.  It has been an incredibly big project to deliver and we have had a few bumps along the road.  Therefore, we would like to be able to use some of our experience and try to develop that elsewhere.</p><p>  Key for us in east Belfast is playing our part as part of a city.  It is not just about making east Belfast great.  We want east Belfast to be very well-connected to the rest of Belfast and also to be a place people from other parts of Belfast visit.  We are not very good at travelling around Belfast and getting to know other parts of the city.  One of our intentions is that we bring different people into east Belfast, not just tourists but people from throughout Belfast.</p><p>  Deputy Conlan has been to the High Line.  It is now the number three tourist attraction in New York in an area that was not visited much previously and it has shown what this type of project can do in terms of creating a destination, changing pace and bringing people to it.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked about the deprivation and the poverty in east and west Belfast.  I would say that east Belfast is no worse or better than parts of west Belfast.  We have a huge disparity in east Belfast between wealthy people and the less wealthy.  Through projects like the greenway we are trying to reduce some of the social inequalities.  The different projects we are involved in are very much looking at health and addressing the physical environment and also community cohesion.  Deprivation is made up of a number of different factors but I know that the physical environment and poor health contribute to our deprivation statistics.</p><p>  As a partnership, when we looked at what had been achieved over a ten year period, what was disappointing for us as an organisation is that the areas originally deprived were still as deprived following that decade of investment and work.  We have never led on a project of this scale in this part of the city.  The project is ambitious.  It is a &pound;43 million project, and growing, but we believe it will have some effect over the longer term in terms of the deprivation because it goes through the most disadvantaged wards in the city.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about bringing people to east Belfast.  We have just undertaken a place branding exercise because we know people may be put off coming to east Belfast, especially if they Google east Belfast and come up with the images I showed the members.  We worked very hard on developing it as a destination for tourists and we are about to launch a new brand for the area called EastSide, which will encompass what we believe is a very strong product that will be useful for people who live there but also in terms of helping tourists understand our C.S. Lewis, Van Morrison and George Best tours as well as the other strong products we have to offer.  Trails are very important for us in terms of what we are doing along the greenway also, and we know from work Queens University is doing for us that we can get an economic return by investing in that type of product.  It is hoped that the C.S. Lewis Square, the public art and creating a welcoming place people can come to will help us overcome some of the barriers people face when visiting.</p><p>  Deputy Conlan referred to abandoned shops.  Newtownards Road has been a challenge.  We had a Newtownards Road 2012 project which is now called the Newtownards Road 2020 project because, unfortunately, some of the things we intended to do by 2012 for the opening of Titanic Belfast remain, but we have made a good deal of progress.  We recognise that we need more people living on the arterial routes.  Many of the small shops are no longer viable and we are looking at clustering.  We are looking again at the living over the shop grant.  We have bought many of the vacant sites.  We have put in pocket parks and are waiting for those to be developed.  We have plans.  We have had some pop-up businesses but in terms of building in Civic Square, our organisation has a property development company and we have just completed a development plan for the Holywood Arches, which we are marketing heavily to attract new business into that area.  We have bought many of the properties.  We are looking at urban development grants and various opportunities to attract businesses into the area.  We are told property prices will rise along the greenway, and by us making a significant investment in the area, we believe we will sustain many of the existing businesses that are struggling, but also we have the ability to attract other businesses into the area over time.</p><p>  Somebody asked about the outdoor gyms.  We have two outdoor gyms on the greenway already installed in the two areas members saw were already developed.  We are working with Belfast City Council and others on a programme of activities.  We want the space to be animated and well used, not just for a festival but throughout the year, including night time.  We have installed lighting on the entire route.  We want it open and lit.  In the past we have closed our parks once dusk arrives; they were dawn to dusk parks.  We have changed the way we are looking at this process.  We want an open greenway that is accessible and useable 24 hours a day, seven days a week where people feel safe.  That is what we are hoping to deliver.</p><p>  We have started community gardens and very much want to consider the community groups allotments idea in the parks as well as along the green spaces on the way.  The allotments may not be labour intensive but the community gardens, while they are very successful, are very labour intensive.</p> <p>This simply is because of the type of people and groups that seek to use them and which require continual support.</p><p> Deputy Brendan Smith then asked about the employment opportunities and training programmes linked to the Titanic Quarter in the private sector and the local businesses.  We definitely could do more in the North, especially in east Belfast, where we tend to rely on the smaller employers with whom we have worked for a long time.  Employment initiatives have been linked both to the Titanic Quarter and through the social clauses we have in the contract for the delivery of the greenway.  Some of these have been harder to deliver then we had envisaged such as the clauses on apprenticeships and trainees on site.  We may have underestimated the amount of work we need to put in to make these happen and to make sure that the employers are delivering on them.  From our side, local people are working in the Titanic Quarter and work in Bombardier and various organisations throughout east Belfast.  However, this is ongoing work that must continue and I do not believe we have tapped into the private sector and the bigger companies located right on the periphery of east Belfast in respect of their corporate social responsibility and how they can engage with us, not simply for a once-off contribution to the festival but on a more ongoing basis.  If members have ideas on how we might do this, it would be very useful.</p><p> I am unsure whether I have answered everybody's questions.</p></speech>

We have some of the worst educational attainment figures throughout Belfast.  We are hoping that a new super primary school will be provided in east Belfast and there are discussions on where that might be.  There undoubtedly is a lot of work to be done in respect of education.  On a smaller scale, as a partnership we have been highly successful in recent months in running Easter schools and schools for children in east Belfast who are about to sit their GCSEs and who currently are on a D grade.  The idea is to bring them up to a C grade and this has been very successful.  We are running them in places like Skainos for free and are encouraging kids to attend at Easter or on Saturday mornings to try to bring them over the line and get them to the next level at which they need to be.  We have Belfast Metropolitan College right on our doorstep with a huge new facility in the Titanic Quarter - I must declare an interest because I am on the board of the college - as well as one in Castlereagh.  While there are many opportunities for kids, it is just that we need to ensure they can avail of them.  It is a huge issue for east Belfast, especially for Protestant loyalist males in east Belfast, and I do not believe we are anywhere near finding a solution.</p></speech>

Lewis Festival involved a group called Replay Theatre Company, which conducts drama workshops.  It went into the most disadvantaged schools in east Belfast, ran workshops about teaching them to become story investigators and it was so powerful.  It was stunning that they got children who, even at the age of six or seven, had disengaged.  What surprised me is that one can be disengaged from education at the age of six or seven but there was an attempt, through that single session, to awaken their imagination in education, storytelling, reading and literature.  We also had a Seven Chronicles in Seven Libraries event throughout east Belfast.  We brought in the poet laureate, Sin&eacute;ad Morrissey, to conduct an unseen poetry workshop in secondary schools in east Belfast, where we got together three groups of schools that had never worked together previously.  She went through her poetry, as well as that of C.S. Lewis, and made that meaningful to the kids, who perhaps had never really had that type of interaction.  While it was part of a festival and is not an ongoing thing, it is a complex issue and we must consider different ways in which education can be delivered to those groups that cannot avail of it for many reasons at present.</p></speech>

We do not envisage this meeting as a once-off event and if the committee returns to Belfast, we might follow up and get a visual glimpse into the work the Connswater Community Greenway project is doing.  Having seen some of the slides presented today, the project is aiming high and given the work in which it is involved, the group clearly is thinking outside the box.  Moreover, its positivity is contagious.  One hears questions continually as to what is a peace dividend from an economic point of view and here, one can see clearly there is a peace dividend with all the infrastructure development.  On Ms Langham's question as to how the joint committee can help the project in respect of corporate social responsibility, members can think about that issue.  If we can have follow-up to this meeting that would be great.  I am aware that Maurice Kincaid is in New York and that Ms Langham's group appears to be learning a lot from different examples, including New York.  Many towns that are struggling at present in the context of expanded retail developments and town centres that are hurting could learn a lot from the infrastructural connecting, pedestrian-wise, in Belfast.</p> <p>We can learn more from the witnesses.  If they are interested in working with us, we would like to continue this relationship.  I thank Ms Langham.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Sandra McLellan, Catherine Byrne and Peter Fitzpatrick and Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  I would like to wish Deputy Fitzpatrick, who had a slight accident at the weekend, a speedy recovery.</p><p>    I remind members, witnesses and people in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  The purpose of today's meeting is a discussion on the important work of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  Members will be aware that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the National Youth Council operate in all the local authority areas countrywide in providing young people with opportunities to get involved in the development of local services and policies.  The Ceann Comhairle has a liaison role with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the National Youth Council in developing synergies.  I commend all involved on the work they do.  </p><p>  I welcome Mr. Berti Nesirky, Tipperary Comhairle and member of CNN National Executive Council, Mr. Cillian Byrne, Meath Comhairle, Ms Kayleigh Power, Galway Comhairle, Ms Becky O'Connell, Waterford Comhairle and Mr. James Doorley, Deputy Director, and Mr. James O'Leary, President, National Youth Council of Ireland.  Also present in the Public Gallery are Ms Karyn Farrell and Ms Anne O'Donnell from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I thank everybody for attending today's meeting.  As a committee, we believe it is important to have ongoing liaison with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the National Youth Council of Ireland.</p><p>  Before beginning I draw the attention of all witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  I ask witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I understand Ms Kayleigh Power will make the first opening statement.</p></speech>

My name is Kayleigh Power.  I am accompanied today by Mr. Berti Nesirky from Tipperary, Mr. Cillian Byrne from Meath and Ms Becky O'Connell from Waterford city.  Today, we would like to focus on the work being carried out by us as members of the National Executive of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  We will be happy to answer any questions which members may have following our presentation.  I will now pass over to Mr. Nesirky who will outline what exactly Comhairle na n&Oacute;g does.</p></speech>

Although there are many issues affecting the youth of Ireland today each area has its own set of unique challenges.  Comhairle fits in perfectly with this and works with the local authorities and local youth services which understand these issues to ensure young people's voices are heard and understood.</p><p>  The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national showcase takes place every two years and provides all comhairl&iacute; across the country with the opportunity to get together and showcase their work.  This year's showcase on 20 November coincides with the 25th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, on which convention Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is based.  We would like to extend an invitation to all members of the committee to attend the showcase at which more than 500 members will showcase their work.  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g is the main decision making body of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive, of which we are all members.  This event, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, brings together more than 200 Comhairle members who discuss the recommendations and work of the national executive for the following two years.  This year's recommendation was that we hold a national youth gathering for second level students with music and events to improve attitudes towards mental health.  </p></speech>

We want that young people to understand and accept that mental health, good or bad, is a part of everyone's life; that there are mental health facilities available and that there should be no shame is using them to improve the mental health of all young people.</p><p>  I will now hand over to Ms Becky O'Connell.</p></speech>

In our meetings to date we have concentrated on the types of gathering that would best realise our recommendations and the expected outcomes in this regard.  We came up with key messages which we want to communicate in our events.  At our last meeting, we came up with four short descriptions of what our event or events will be, including four hashtag.  Young people and all Comhairle members are now voting online in this regard.  We are fortunate to have inherited a supporting team from the Houses of the Oireachtas to support us in the work that we do.  The team appointed by the Ceann Comhairle - some of whom are present today - includes Deputies Jerry Buttimer and Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Kathryn Reilly and Averil Power.  We look forward to their support as we progress.  As a national executive, we are lucky also have a steering committee to assist us in our work.</p> <p>This steering committee is made up of representatives from the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Headstrong, <i>reachout.com</i>and the school of education in UCD.  This committee is very useful in our work as it has a range of expertise in the area of mental health.</p></speech>

The launch was attended by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  We were lucky enough to be directly involved in the implementation of the policy framework, and as it is such an important topic to us as young people we will be involved with the implementation team at the Department.  Members of the national executive will meet the policy consortium of the secretaries general to give feedback on the topics outlined in the policy framework.</p><p>  As this is the end of the presentation, I thank the committee for its attention and having us here today.  I extend an invitation to all members of the committee to attend our showcase on 20 November, which will coincide with the 21st anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

We have 48 member organisations which are really active in every community.  I have no doubt Deputies and Senators are very aware of the work of youth organisations at a local level and there are approximately 40,000 volunteers, which is one of the great aspects of youth work in Ireland.  Youth services have a very active cohort of people working with and for young people, and there are approximately 1,400 staff in those organisations.  A study by Indecon in 2012 indicated that up to 382,000 young people are active in youth organisations in Ireland, which is one of the highest participation rates in the EU.</p><p>  The National Youth Council of Ireland elects a voluntary board every year, led by our president, Mr. James O'Leary, and there are 19 full and part-time staff.  The work of the council is divided into two areas, with the first representing the interests and supporting the work of the organisations working with young people.  For example, this would involve promoting the value of youth work and non-formal education in the lives of young people and giving them the skills they need not just in employment, but as active citizens.  We undertake research and we engage with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other Departments to be a collective voice, as the Government would deal with us rather than 48 different organisations in getting views on a range of issues.  We try to bring the views together before bringing them to Government.  We work through the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, which is made up of representatives of youth organisations as well as Departments working on youth work policy.</p><p>  We have also been very active in promoting the national quality standards framework, which is around trying to ensure that youth services provided are of high quality and support young people.  We have been very active in the area of child protection and we have operated the child protection consortium, which processes the vetting which we send to Thurles, and we also work on legislation in the area.</p><p>  We work on issues affecting young people, and essentially our member organisations come together and bring us their views through consultation with young people and youth workers dealing directly with young people.  I will not go through the full list but we have done much work on issues like youth unemployment, emigration, alcohol misuse, mental health, equality and active citizenship.  For the past couple of months, for example, we have been on a registration drive to encourage young people to be registered for the local and European elections and also to encourage young people to participate in that process.</p><p>  The mandate is to speak about the work of the National Youth Council of Ireland and we are involved in many areas but I am conscious of the time.  I will briefly discuss four areas.  The publication of the Brighter Outcomes, Better Futures document by the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is significant, and we acknowledge her work.  She has left a strong legacy and I look forward to working with the new Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Within the document is a proposal for a national youth strategy and we are looking forward to working with the Department in developing that.  It will be the first time we have had such a strategy in Ireland.  The only issue we have is that it is important to have plans, objectives and vision but it is also important to have implementation; we can have all the documents in the world but there must be strong implementation as well.</p><p>  I wish to highlight the work of youth work organisations.  As noted, up to 380,000 young people are involved in and supported by youth services in the country, which is up to 43% of those aged ten to 24 in the country.  We have the highest percentage in the EU involved with youth services and over half of those young people are what the Indecon report described as from socially disadvantaged areas.  The Indecon report considered the numbers specifically, whereas we might argue that youth work is good or enhances the lives of young people.  As somebody who many years ago was involved with youth services, I know its value but in the current environment, the figures must be examined, including how much is being invested and the value for money that can be achieved.  The Indecon report indicates that for every euro invested by the State, it saves up to &euro;2.20.  Not only is investment in youth services good from a social perspective, but it is also economically sound. </p><p>  We know other sectors have seen cuts in the past number of years but we argue that youth services have suffered disproportionate cuts from 2008 to 2014, and we are down from &euro;73 million to &euro;49.78 million, which equates to 31% or 32%.  That has had an impact, although organisations have tried to work better and protect front-line services.  Nevertheless, staff have been made part-time or worked fewer hours, with services having to close as well.  As politicians engaging in the area, I am sure the members are aware of that.  We are concerned about a potential further cut in the next budget, as that would also hit services.</p><p>  We have been very active in trying to combat youth unemployment and trying to ensure the voice of young jobseekers can be heard.  We did a survey of young jobseekers in 2011 to get their experiences of engaging with the public employment services; we have also held a number of conferences and produced two reports.  We were one of the first organisations in Ireland to call for the youth guarantee and we welcome the progress made, as well as the publication of a plan earlier this year.  Nevertheless, we are concerned about the pace of implementation.  There have been positive steps but we need to do more.  There is a concern about the 30,000 young people on the live register for 12 months or more as a recent Central Bank study found that up to 90% of the jobs created in the past year were for people with third level degrees.  There is a concern that a cohort of young people with no work experience and limited qualifications will be left behind and we must focus on that.  The plan implies that there will be such a focus but we must do more in that regard.  It is important to focus on quantity of places and we need more education, training and work experience opportunities.  There should also be quality in the work and there is a concern out there that the opportunities provided to young people are not always of quality.</p><p>  As this is the health committee, there has been much more work on the areas of alcohol and tobacco, etc.  We support the work of the Government in this respect and the Opposition parties are also very supportive of action to deal with alcohol misuse in Irish society.  We are concerned about the impact on youth people, including the immediate impact and long-term damage, and we did some work in 2009 on the impact of alcohol advertising on young people.</p> <p>We got young people over a period of months to record their experience of engaging with advertising.  They said they all thought the advertising on television, outdoor advertising and in sport was brilliant.  It clearly showed that alcohol advertising has an impact on them.</p><p> We support the proposals in the national substance misuse strategy report.  We were members of the group and we believe the issues of price, availability, marketing and advertising must be addressed, particularly marketing and advertising to young people.  We welcome the fact that the Government is consulting on the drinks industry's sponsorship of sporting events, as that has an impact.  We would say there is a problem there and there is evidence to suggest that price, availability and promotion have an impact.  We must move towards actions at this stage.</p><p> The committee received a copy of the presentation so I spoke about it very quickly.  We will be happy to answer the members' questions on it as it is quite difficult to give an overview of it in a few minutes.</p></speech>

I have been trying for years to be in two places at the one time.<br/>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an foireann &oacute; Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I welcome the team representing Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I have a number of brief questions.  I will not start by saying the presentation was excellent as I took it for granted that it would be, and it was.  It is important to have this type of engagement.  I noted what the representatives asked of us and it is a very short list.  They are not very demanding in the context of those who appear before the committee on a more regular basis.  However, the representatives have indicated that they would like to appear before the committee again at a future date and I would be very interested in that.  I am sure the committee would be delighted to accommodate that opportunity because this type of engagement is very important and useful for us as legislators.<br/>I note that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's showcase event is taking place in November in Croke Park.  I hope it will be very successful.  It will focus on the rights of the child and the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Each of the 34 comhairl&iacute; will make presentations or organise the showcasing of their experience and views in regard to that.  The last D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g in 2013 had a focus on mental health and it is in that context that the representatives wish to return to meet the committee.  That is not the focus of the showcase in November.  When do the representatives expect to progress their ideas and their engagement on mental health issues impacting on young people in the 12 to 18 year old age group?  I note that D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g meets every alternate year.  Is that further engagement scheduled for next year, 2015, or is there another event they are working towards specifically on that subject?  In what timeframe would the representatives wish to return to meet the committee on that issue?<br/>There is not only this statutory committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas but there is also an <i>ad hoc</i>cross-party group on mental health issues, comprising a representative of each of the political parties and the Independent Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They meet on a regular basis and work on mental health reform.  It might also be of interest to create an opportunity to engage with that cross-party group.  The fact that we have a cross-party group on mental health is a statement of shared acceptance of the importance of addressing this issue.  For far too long it has been left to the margins in society and it must become a part of the central political address of these Houses and across Irish society today.  Nowhere is it more obviously required than in helping young people to prepare for the challenges of life.  This is something on which we can have further meetings.<br/>With regard to Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and how it engages initially, would each of the representatives tell us how they became involved?  They are from a disparate range of locations across the country and there is an opportunity for people in both the city and county administrations to engage, but how does one become involved?  How proactive is Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in seeking the involvement of new people?  The choice of Croke Park is very good.  Sporting organisations that cater to young people would appear to be a logical point of engagement to open the work of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g to a wider body of young people and, hopefully, to encourage and entice more to become directly involved.  How proactive is Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in promoting its work and encouraging more participation?  We would have a greater understanding of that if we knew how the representatives first became involved.  I would be grateful to hear that.<br/>I thank James O'Leary and James Doorley for attending the meeting today.  I have met James Doorley on many occasions and thank him for his contribution.  However, my questions are for our important visitors this morning, with no disrespect to my fellow senior representatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.873" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014052900005#E00600"><p>I thank the representatives for their good presentations and for their involvement in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I also thank the representatives of the National Youth Council of Ireland.</p><p>  I started my career through my involvement in youth work.  I was on the national executive of For&oacute;ige when I was young.  In fact, it was interesting to hear the representatives mention money because the first time I came to the Oireachtas was when we were lobbying for funding from the relevant Department.  At that time funding was cut back substantially and that was the reason I visited the Oireachtas when I was very young.</p><p>  On the issue of mental health and young people, there have been many developments over the last number of years but do the representatives, as young people, believe enough is being done by the statutory agencies, be it the Department of Health or the HSE, the representatives' organisation, youth clubs and youth organisations on this area?  Do they believe more could be done?  Have they identified a specific area where they believe an improvement could be made if further funding was provided?  Mental health is a big issue for young people given the pressures they are under.  The representatives have direct contact with young people so they would be more aware of what is happening on the ground.</p><p>  Second, with regard to the funding issue, I note the point about the 31% reduction.  It is a substantial reduction and, having been involved in a youth organisation, I am aware of the importance of youth clubs and youth organisations.  Do the representatives think there is more we can do?</p> <p> We have many different agencies of which the delegations may not be aware.  In terms of the health budget, 2,600 organisations receive funding from the HSE.  Would things improve if there were more rationalisation and amalgamation of the support groups?  For instance, in Cork the youth organisation I was in was amalgamated with For&oacute;ige.  Would more amalgamation lead to better value for money?  Are there areas where moneys being spent by statutory agencies do not deliver value for money?  Where could that money be better used by the organisations present?  Have the organisations identified such areas?  We could invest that money into youth organisations whom I think do an amazing job for the amount they receive.</p><p> The third issue which I wish to touch on is socially disadvantaged areas.  Has there been a major improvement in service delivery for young people in such areas over the past ten years?  Have there been cutbacks in what was available to the young people living in these areas?  While a lot of people are involved in sports organisations in disadvantaged areas, a huge percentage of young people do not get involved in such organisations.  When I was involved in youth organisations, a huge vacuum existed in many of these areas.  Does it still exist?  A lot of work has been done over the years.  What has been achieved over the past ten years?  Could a lot more be achieved? </p></speech>

It is great to see Kayleigh and Becky here who represent 50% of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  That is a percentage we do not enjoy in the D&aacute;il, only 16% of which comprises women.  It is great to see 50% representation and for women to put their voices forward.  What can we, as politicians, do better for young people?</p><p>  My next question relates to schooling and education.  Should Comhairle na n&Oacute;g have more of an input into decisions about curriculum, for example, how the junior certificate will be examined and how history may not be taught as a subject in schools?  What do the delegations think about those areas of education?</p></speech>

At the moment our work is entirely related to mental health.  We need politicians to act as a platform that promotes  our work.  We want to be able to return here in a few months when we have more work done on our event and planning.  That would be a huge help to us.</p><p>  As regards whether we believe Comhairle na n&Oacute;g should have a greater impact on the school curriculum, the topic of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the national executive is determined each year at D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g.  The topics are voted on based on what young people believe to be the biggest issues at the time.  For the next two years our issue will be mental health and, therefore, we will not be working on school curriculums.  However, as an individual I believe young people should have a greater impact on the school curriculum, what is taught and how it is taught.</p></speech>

Usually representatives from each school in the county attend an annual general meeting of a local comhairle and that is where elections are held.  In my comhairle we try to mirror the local county council with constituency lines and a certain amount of people in each area.  That is how I got involved.</p></speech>

We will use the event to celebrate the fact it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child.  However, mental health will be the main topic of the day.</p><p>  I became involved in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g after being approached by my transition year co-ordinator last year who thought I might have an interest in the matter.  Therefore, this is only my second year of involvement.  I attended the annual general meeting and was very impressed by comhairle's work.  Also, I wanted to become involved in improving conditions for young people in Galway city.  That is how I got involved.</p></speech>

We went to an AGM where I made a short speech and was elected.  I was very young at the time and did not fully understand what comhairle meant.  Over time I got to know what it was about and was happy to work with comhairle.  Then, from comhairle I was elected on to the national executive.</p></speech>

I have been a member of Comhairle since 12 years of age and I am now 17.  This is my fifth year and I was elected onto this body this year.</p></speech>

How proactive is the organisation?  Is there some dependence on the disposition towards this of transition year heads?  Is there a programmed way of informing young people about the work of Comhairle across schools, youth clubs and sports organisations?  Is there a way of disseminating information to young people?</p></speech>

The main way of doing so is to approach schools and to allow the students to attend the AGM.  We also make use of social media and approaching youth clubs and other available facilities.  We want to have as broad a range of people from different backgrounds as possible so that we can represent the needs of every background with our local areas.</p></speech>

We work under the secretarial support of Mental Health Reform, which is another umbrella organisation that does a lot of good work.  It may be a useful engagement to organise an opportunity for that cross-party group.  The committee is statutory and we all represent our political groupings within these Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ideas might come out of us sitting together to discuss initiatives and presentations.  The Oireachtas committee system is limited and perhaps we could open up an opportunity for wider engagement with Members of the two Houses.  As a representative on the cross-party group on mental health, I am happy to endeavour to facilitate it if the witnesses would like to return.  We can explore that with Mr. James Doorley and Mr. James O'Leary at some point down the road.</p></speech>

I thank the members for bringing forward this opportunity.</p></speech>

With regard to working in a cross-European alliance, have we any response received from the Government agencies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-29a.902" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014052900007#G00700"><p>There is a review of the role of apprenticeships and trying to broaden the range of apprenticeships.  Traditionally, apprenticeships have been concentrated in the construction sector.  The recently published apprenticeship review is trying to spread the range of sectors across which employers engage in apprenticeships so that people do not have to go to third level.  In terms of job creation, it is a concern for us because many of the jobs are dependent on domestic demand.  Examples include jobs in the hospitality sector or the retail sector.  It is an issue in terms of the youth guarantee because we are supportive of providing a guarantee of a quality education or training opportunity.  For the young people involved, they want to think they have a chance of getting a job at the end of it.  It will be a major challenge for the youth guarantee and for the Government as a whole to ensure young people who have just done the leaving certificate or left school before that have hopes of getting jobs when they enter the guarantee.  Organisations at local level are doing very good work linking with SME employers and asking whether there are opportunities locally for young people on training courses who might fit the remit.  The Department of Social Protection is doing more on employer outreach, which is important, and much of it will be dependent on more of a pick-up in the economy.  We welcome the jobs growth.  If it is all at higher level, it is great for returning migrants.  We think it is likely young people will come back if jobs are created but the 30,000 young people I talked about will need a lot of support before they get into that area.  It is a challenge but it is more about ensuring young people are prepared and doing more on employer engagement.  Hopefully, the economy will continue to make progress.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses respond?</p></speech>

Some 2,600 organisations are funded through the health services.</p></speech>

There are 48 youth organisations in Ireland and a small number of them provide mainstream services by larger organisations.  Examples include For&oacute;ige, Youth Work Ireland, YMCA and the scouting organisations.  They are the bigger outfits and the rest of the 48 are more specialist services.  It allows for diversity within the youth sector.  Some of the examples, such as BeLonGTo, which works with LGBT young people and SpunOut, which works with youth mental health using the IT platform, and our organisation is engaged with young travellers.  ECO-UNESCO is involved in environmental youth work and YCW is a faith-based youth organisation.  I am trying to present a picture of the larger organisations providing services in all counties and the smaller specialist organisations providing specialist services in supporting them or delivering directly.</p><p>  With regard to rationalisation, a value for money report is being done on youth work.  If there was support to examine it, we could explore the issue.  Sometimes mergers do not give savings and the great value in the youth sector is its diversity.  A small number of those organisations manage to reach out to some 382,000 young people.  Sometimes we can go looking for something through savings and merging organisations and it may not be there.</p> <p>Through diversity, almost any young person in Ireland can find an organisation that will meet his or her needs.  The organisations within the youth work sector work well together.  If there is an opportunity to explore whether more efficiencies can be found, we will certainly engage in it.</p></speech>

It is important that we develop our work on the issues of alcohol and tobacco.  I thank Ms Karyn Farrell and Ms Anne O'Donnell of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for their assistance in organising this meeting.</p><p>  The clerk and I have been discussing the national showcase initiative on 20 November.  As it will be a Thursday, it will coincide with a day on which we meet, but I hope that the committee will agree to send a delegation to that important event after our meeting.  Perhaps we could hold our meeting as part of the showcase in Croke Park.  It is important that we send a message of support and highlight the commendable work being done on participative democracy and active citizenship.  Ms Power or Mr. O'Leary might liaise with Mr. Paul Kelly, our clerk, after the summer holidays so that we might include this in our work programme.</p><p>  We might further our relationship with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's cross-party group on mental health and provide a platform for its work.  The group is important and mental health is an issue that we should not be ashamed to discuss.</p></speech>

Our guests have outlined valuable information about the 382,000 people out to whom they are reaching.  I suggest that they send a circular on the 48 organisations to all Oireachtas Members providing a brief summary of the work being done and how it provides value for money.  Youth clubs provide significant value for money.  Sporting organisations have a media profile, but youth organisations do not have the same opportunity to get the message of their valuable work across.  Giving that information to Members would be helpful.  Some 382,000 is a lot of young people and a great deal of good work is being done.</p><p>  People involved in youth organisations undergo considerable training and have skill sets, be they in business, college or work.  Youth clubs are about people working together.  We need to highlight what the youth organisations are doing.</p></speech>
