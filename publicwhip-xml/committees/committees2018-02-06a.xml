    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018020600002#G00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I thank members of the committee for the invitation to meet with them today to discuss the status of the recommendations of the independent aquaculture licensing review group.  This opening statement is intended to provide a broad overview of the aquaculture licensing system and how it operates; the key issues associated with the licensing backlog, which gave rise to the review; a brief overview of the key recommendations of the review; and implementing the review.  I will be glad to take any questions from the committee members.</p> <p>  The aquaculture licensing system operates as follows.  An aquaculture licence is required by law for the cultivation of finfish, shellfish and certain marine plants such as seaweed.  Some aquaculture takes place on land but the vast majority of aquaculture activity takes place in the marine environment on the foreshore.  In Ireland, almost all foreshore is in public ownership and aquaculture activity therefore requires both an aquaculture licence for the activity being licensed - that is, to conduct the operations - and a companion foreshore licence to lawfully occupy the area of foreshore in question.  Even in the rare case of private foreshore, an aquaculture licence is required to engage in aquaculture activity.</p> <p>  The foreshore is measured from the high water mark out to 12 nautical miles and is approximately 39,000 sq. km in overall size.  It is roughly equal in size to just over 50% of the land area of the State.  However, the areas suitable for aquaculture represent a small fraction of the foreshore and, in the case of finfish cultivation, are exclusively on the western seaboard.</p> <p>  The legislation covering aquaculture is that the Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the following legislation: the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997; the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended; the EU Habitats Directive of 92/43/EEC; the EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC; the Consolidated Environmental Impact Assessment Directives of 2011; and the Public Participation Directive, the Aarhus Convention.  The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.  In addition to the above legislation, the Department must adhere to a wide range of regulatory requirements and other legislation which impact on the licensing process.</p> <p>  The Public Participation Directive has emerged as a crucial factor in the roll out of the licensing system as it applies to individual cases.  The key aim of this directive is to grant the general public specific rights regarding access to information in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and trans-boundary environment.</p><p>It is important to note that while attention has been given to difficulties associated with licensing, the industry itself is in fact a buoyant industry with good employment potential.  BIM survey data show that there was an overall increase in output from Irish aquaculture of 10% across all the species over the 2015 to 2016 period.  We are also likely to see that continue over the 2016 to 2017 period although the final statistics are not available at the moment.  On that basis, in 2016, the industry produced approximately 44,000 tonnes of high-value seafood. Not only did the volume of output increase, so did the value, which reached a level of &euro;149 million at first point of sale at the end of 2015, and &euro;168 million at the end of 2016.  These figures reflect the growing global demand for seafood which in turn is underpinned by a strong demand for differentiated, quality assured seafood products within the EU 28.  While some areas such as rope mussel production are relatively static since 2008, oyster production increased in volume from 2007 to 2016 by over 25%, with a value increase in the order of 128% over the ten-year period. The salmon farming sector also experienced an increase in production in the order of 60% from 2007 to 2016, reaching 16,300 tonnes.  However the increase in value for salmon is quite striking with an increase of over 100%, reaching nearly &euro;105 million in 2016.<br/><br/>The major complaint from the aquaculture industry and farmers on licensing relates to the backlog that has developed in the processing of licence applications.  The background to the backlog is that in 2007, the European Court of Justice issued a negative judgement against Ireland for breaches of the EU birds and habitats directives.  In total, some 71 marine sites had been designated in previous years as Natura 2000 sites and most aquaculture takes place in those sites, although significant aquaculture is really only present in about half of these.  A large element of the judgement from the European Court of Justice, ECJ, concerned a failure by the State to put in place a system for data collection, definition of scientific interests and adequate assessment of aquaculture licence applications in the Natura 2000 areas.<br/><br/><font color="#FF0000"></font>At the time of the ECJ case, national legislation was put in place to ensure that Irish aquaculture operations operating under pre-existing licences, and which were seeking renewals could continue to operate under those licences until the Minister could make a determination on their renewal application in compliance with the Natura 2000 directives.  In the negotiations with the European Commission to address this negative ECJ judgement, a process was agreed with DG Environment, known as the roadmap, and this is being implemented and has been rolled out since.  The issues were how to give the Commission comfort so as not to move to daily fines or to requiring aquaculture to be removed from the bays and to find a way forward whereby aquaculture could be licensed in compliance with the birds and habitat directive.<br/><br/>That process of licensing includes data collection, the setting of conservation objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the identifying the scientific interests to be protected in these Natura 2000 bays, the carrying out of appropriate assessments of the licence applications against those scientific interests, and appropriate licensing, taking account of, among other things, the Natura requirements.  The production of these appropriate assessments has been resource intensive and very time-consuming, not least because of tidal cycles and seasonality issues relating to data gathering on bird migrations and other environmental phenomena.  In many cases multi-year time series data had to be collected.<br/><br/>Data collection in the relevant bays can be very comprehensive.  It involves collection of data on the benthos, the seabed, the bathymetry, the contours on the seabed, the substrates, the gravels and muds and so forth on the seabed, the fauna and the communities living in the bays, the migratory animals such as cetaceans in the bay, and the birdlife around the tidal area of the bay.  For example, the data collection work involved 123 survey events carried out in 71 Natura sites by ten contractors.</p><p> In addition, the profiling of aquaculture industry activities was carried out for all of the bays to define the likely interactions with the conservation features of sites.  In many instances there was very little data or published literature on the likely interactions between the aquaculture activities and the conservation features.  A number of targeted studies and reviews were commissioned by the Department to investigate responses of conservation features, such as birds and-or habitats for specific aquaculture and fisheries activities.  Many of these have subsequently been published in primary literature.  All of this preliminary work was necessary to prepare the groundwork for consideration of licensing and such work took place from 2009 onwards.</p><p> I am glad to report that most of this data collection, definition of scientific interests and the appropriate assessment process is almost complete.  The appropriate assessment reports have been received by the Department from the Marine Institute, which was contracted to carry out this work in respect of 27 bays.  Those bays constitute the bulk of the aquaculture activity.  The work that has been carried out since 2009 has permitted licensing to commence, in compliance with the Natura 2000 directives and the European Court of Justice, ECJ, judgment.  Since licensing commenced under the new system, a little over 600 licensing decisions have been made on aquaculture sites located around the coast.</p><p> I will give a brief overview of the key recommendations of the review.  Dealing with the Natura elements has been the major focus for all involved in the licensing process up to recently.  There are other issues, including legislative reform, the streamlining of procedures and the optimum use of technology associated with licensing that also need to be addressed.  Due to these elements, the Minister commissioned the independent review of aquaculture licensing in December 2016 and a report was delivered at the end of May 2017.</p><p> The review group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and considered comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner.  The group's report has been published and is available to view on the Department's website.  The report contains 30 separate recommendations which can be broken down as follows: 15 recommendations contain immediate actions in the short-term under the current legislative framework; five recommendations focus on the licensing authority and who should be responsible for aquaculture licensing; two recommendations are on tackling the licensing backlog and the future of licensing; two recommendations are on licence duration, terms and conditions and request that a dedicated procedure be put in place for scientific and trial licences; five recommendations relate to the wider issues of licensing; and one recommendations focuses on future legislative reform.</p><p> Since receiving the report the Department has engaged in a detailed consideration of all of the 30 recommendations with a view to preparing a comprehensive implementation plan.  The draft implementation plan takes account of legislative, environmental, technical and public interest issues that have a bearing on the sustainable development of the industry.</p><p> As has been stated, it is possible to break down the recommendations into a number of key areas.  The Department's implementation strategy has accorded priority to the recommendations on the basis of the following criteria.  They represent key goals for industry representatives and are, therefore, likely to be the subject of strong expectations on their part.  They represent a necessary initial stage that will lead to the implementation of the report as a whole.  They require immediate commencement in view of their overall medium and long-term implications and the potential effect that implementation can have on the reduction of the licensing backlog.</p><p> As members will be aware, the core concern that gave rise to the review was the licensing backlog.  Accordingly, the elimination of the backlog is the highest priority.  The implementation of the report's findings, coupled with the substantial work done to date, will represent a new departure in the regulation of aquaculture which will facilitate the establishment of a well-functioning licensing system.  Implementation will also help to achieve the necessary balance between the very legitimate needs of industry and public expectations in terms of environmental protection.</p><p> The Department is actively working towards the achievement of 300 licence determinations for 2018 with a further 300 projected for 2019.  Achieving this will require the co-operation of a variety of other parties who have an input in the licensing process.</p><p>Achieving this level of licence determinations will meet a core recommendation of the aquaculture licensing review group.  While there will always be licence applications in the pipeline, the achievement of 600 determinations during the next three years will effectively eliminate the backlog as an issue.</p><p> The Department's implementation plan is very much a working document and will be subject to ongoing change as we make progress in addressing the various recommendations made.  The Department will consult and has consulted the industry and initiated consultation in the implementation of certain recommendations.  I can confirm that we have already met industry representatives from both the shellfish and finfish sides of the industry to discuss implementation of the strategy and I have no doubt that the close engagement will continue.</p><p> In addition to the Minister's commitment in respect of licence decisions in the next few years, he has also put in place substantial financial and other supports for the industry.  The financial support is supplied under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund operational programme and directed toward three main areas - sustainable aquaculture production, knowledge innovation and new technology, and more effective governance of marine planning.  In addition to the direct financial support, BIM provides a range of technical supports for the aquaculture industry to assist in the development of existing business, address industry-wide issues such as disease management and the introduction of new technologies.</p><p> The aquaculture licensing industry has been developed sequentially since the judgment of the European Court of Justice and is being further reformed on foot of the review to deliver a system for timely, robust and compliant aquaculture licensing in Natura 2000 areas where most of the aquaculture occurs.  It will be a significant asset in the development of the industry.  The fundamental business case for the aquaculture sector remains sound as a strong market demand for its products continues to grow and as increasing global demand for high quality differentiated seafood intensifies.</p><p> I hope this statement has been of assistance.  I will be glad to respond to questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

I have been examining the statistics for Scotland which has been subject to the same environmental directives which I hope will not change following Brexit.  Apparently, the period in which licence application decisions are made rarely exceeds 20 months, whereas it is six years plus in Ireland.  Will the delegates explain why it takes so long to administer and make a decision on a licence application?</p> <p>  We discuss objectives for our produce.  We know that 60% of all seafood consumed in Europe is imported.  There is, therefore, significant potential to increase prosperity and jobs across the west.  How does it tally that, on the one hand, the Department and other agencies funded by the State talk about the need to develop the agrifood sector and set targets and that officials accompany the Minister on visits to markets across the world and that, on the other, it has taken more than six years to come up with ideas for aquaculture?  How can someone develop a market for aquacultural products when one does not know if one will have a licence in five or ten years' time?  There is no certainty in that regard.  One cannot guarantee that one will have a licence.  Do the officials have a view on the inherent contradiction in the case of aquacultural produce?</p> <p>  Arising from the review, there is a proposal to establish separate offices for the issuing of licences and monitoring compliance.  Apparently, this is the position in the EPA in which there are two separate offices.  It is proposed that the proposal be supported by the industry, concerned NGOs and, of course, the review group.  Do the officials support the recommendation and will they implement it to ensure there will be a separate office for the issuing of licences and another for monitoring compliance?  It makes absolute sense to me to ensure there would be no conflict of interest in that regard.</p><p>Who or what office is responsible for making sure that the regulatory framework for the industry is updated?  This is a critical issue for the industry and for those concerned about environmental standards, at both sides of the equation.  Who is responsible for making sure it is updated on an ongoing basis, that everything that is being done in the industry is keeping up with necessary environmental requirements and that it is flexible and dynamic?  Who is responsible for that within the Department; who makes sure that is happening?<br/><br/>The next question relates to renewals.  The following point has been made to me and it makes absolute sense.  If one has this dynamic proactive regulatory framework, overseen by the Department, and the environmental standards are being checked all the time, and rightly so in terms of those who are in the industry, why do we need a renewal process?  Why does one need to renew one's licence and go through everything again in terms of environmental studies and so on?  How can one have certainty?  I mention the analogy of the driving licence in that one proves one's competency once.  It is not the best analogy in the world but one does not have to renew it again and again.  The issue here is that if the Department is monitoring this and if a person has a clean bill of health again and again and is complying with the standards, why does that person need to go through the renewal process?  How can one give certainty to a market?<br/><br/>The final question relates to the other side of the equation, those who have environmental concerns and local communities that wish to, and have the right to, object.  The Aarhus Convention was referred to.  I can only speak with authority about Donegal but we have heard complaints that licences have been granted without local communities being aware of it and that it has been too late to appeal.  I have raised this issue with the Department before and raised it again recently.<br/><br/>Let us just take the example of Donegal which is a very large county.  Deputy McConalogue and I are from the Inishowen Peninsula while Deputy Pringle is from Killybegs, the other end of the county.  People living on the Inishowen Peninsula read the following three newspapers: the <i>Inishowen Independent</i>, the<i>Inish Times</i>and the<i>Derry Journal</i>.  Donegal is quite parish based.  If one wants to make sure the local community knows what is happening and has a right to object, one must stipulate clearly that these are the newspapers in which the Department must advertise.  However, the Department stipulates only the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>.  The only people who read the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>in Inishowen are the people from south Donegal, a handful of people.  That is just the reality created by having that rule.  I have given a practical example from Donegal.<br/><br/>I want to give an example of where this fails in a community, and we have dealt with this before at this committee and I will revisit it today because the Department is refusing to address and review this issue.  I refer to the planning permission given at Linsfort for an oyster farm.  I can tell the officials that the promoters of that oyster farm were told - they did not choose to do this - that they must advertise in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>, which meant minimising the ability of people to be aware of it  The wording of the application stipulated &quot;on the shores of Lough Swilly&quot;.  I am sure the Department is very aware that the shores of Lough Swilly can swing from Malin Head down to Inch Island and right back up to the Fanad Peninsula; they could be anywhere.  A huge coast hugs Lough Swilly but that is what the advertisement stated.  The Department insisted the advertisement be placed in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>and that it state &quot;on the shores of Lough Swilly&quot; rather than &quot;Linsfort Beach, Buncrana, County Donegal&quot;, thus providing specific information.The advertisement was not placed in a local newspaper which people would read.  This was raised with the Department the last time it was here.  In the last couple of weeks, I was told that the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>was fine and that it was the newspaper the Department insisted that people advertise in.  That is just a practical example of how the system is not being fair to local communities and giving them a chance.<br/><br/>I want to be very clear.  I support the potential of aquaculture.  I have seen it creating jobs in my home county of Donegal, so I support it happening along the coastline.  However, there has to be fairness to those who wish to object.  Let them make their case and then a fair and an efficient system can make a decision in relation to it.  I highlight to the Department the concerns and frustrations of industry, and the concerns of local objectors.  I hope the Department can address the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018020600002#M00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and for their presentation.  I have read through the review of the aquaculture licence process and it seems to be a very good document.  To someone who is not an expert in the field, the recommendations in it are common sense.  They set out a pathway forward to try to resolve this issue.  I was shocked To learn the length of time it takes for a person to get a licence.  One would have qualified as a doctor by the time one would have got a licence to set up in the aquaculture industry.  It is mind-boggling how it can take so long.  That being said, this document sets out recommendations to change that and to move it forward.</p> <p>  I refer to the recommendation - I think recommendation No. 10 - on the need to put in place an implementation plan to implement this report.  Have we got that implementation plan?  Does it set out a timescale as to when all the recommendations in this report will be in place?</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the timescale for the application for the licences.  There should be a time limit.  One of the recommendations - I think it is recommendation No. 8.1 - is that a six month time limit be set in which to determine a licence and it should apply to all new licence applications submitted by 1 January 2018.  Is that in place yet?  When people apply for a licence, do they get a timescale as to when it will be dealt with so that they know what they are dealing with?</p> <p>  The Minister has committed, and it was mentioned in the presentation, that 300 licences will be dealt with and issued this year.  How long have those licences been there?  Do they going back six years or more?  How long have these people been waiting to get licences?  </p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned modern practices.  There have been huge changes and scientific advances within the whole industry.  Does the licensing process take all that on board?  Does it recognise the advances that have happened in the whole aquaculture sector and how these changes will impact on the sector?</p> <p>  If it is the case that 600 licences have not been dealt with and we are going to deal with 300 of them in one year, one would have to ask how has it taken so long for this to be done?  Nobody is casting any aspersions on anyone's competency or anything else, but it seems mind-boggling to me or to any independent person.  If we can deal with 300 licences now and set a target for that, why in the name of God were these people left in limbo for years?  These people and the public deserve a clear explanation.  I think that is very obvious.</p> <p>  I refer to the future and what we can do from now on.  Clearly, there is huge potential in this industry.  There are also people who have concerns and they are entitled to have them.  Nobody wants to see the foreshore or anywhere else polluted or any issues in that regard.  The people who have concerns must have the opportunity to make them known and to object or whatever they wish to do.  At the moment if somebody has a licence for an oyster bed in a specific place but the oysters are failing as a result of disease, to solve that problem the person just needs to move it up the bay a little bit.  However, if they do that, they will be in breach of the licence.  There is no flexibility at all in regard to what people can do.</p><p>In other words, they either have to breach their licence, which gets them into a lot of trouble with the Department, or sit back and watch their business go down the Swanny.  In any situation, and we discuss issues relating to agriculture all the time as  well as farmers in trouble and the problems they have, there is always some solution, there is a bit of flexibility and there are people who are prepared to do something to resolve the issue.  However, from what we hear from the people in the aquaculture industry, the Department is absolutely Stalinist in its approach in that one does it its way or else.  We need to be assured that these recommendations will be implemented in full, that there will a be change in attitude, that people will find there is some flexibility when they are being dealt with and that they are dealt with in an appropriate manner in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</p></speech>

First of all, I will take Deputy Kenny's point that people are entitled to understand why it is taking so long, and they absolutely are.  I tried in my opening statement to explain that the whole issue started and can only be understood in the context of the European Court of Justice judgment, which covers almost all the area.  Once the judgment was made, the negotiations, which went on in 2008 and were settled in 2009 with the Commission on what would happen, were crucially important to the industry and those discussions were centred on whether the Commission was going to move to daily fines on the State in which case the Commission would also have potentially moved to require all aquaculture activity in the State to be moved out of the Natura 2000 bays until there was licensing compliance with the directives.  A roadmap was agreed with the Commission where a series of steps would be taken that would enable the State to make licence decisions in compliance with birds and habitats directives and there was a provision put into national legislation allowing people to continue their aquaculture activities in those areas under the terms and conditions of the licences they had, pending a decision on renewal.  All those who was operating could continue to operate on the terms and conditions of their own licences, pending a renewal.  People were not stopped from operating.</p> <p>  Moving on to how one can make licence decisions in compliance, the infrastructure did not exist in the State to do this.  It was not a matter of bureaucrats taking their time or something like that.  All we had was a red line around the areas that had been mapped by a person in the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service for Natura 2000 sites.  Nobody had done detailed internal mapping of what was in those bays, what was on the seabed, what was growing there, what was to be protected, what was in the intertidal areas and what substrates were.  The Department, therefore, commissioned this enormous data collection exercise to map those bays, to map what was on the seabed which had never been done, what was growing on the seabed, what type of substrates there were, whether it is was mud, gravel or whatever, what was in the intertidal areas, where the migrating birds were feeding and so on, and where the cetaceans, the dolphins and so on, were moving.  Once that data became available, and it became available sequentially, it could then be analysed and presented to the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service which identified the scientific interest being protected in the bay and where it was.  The Department then had to take all the aquaculture that was in the bay - we are talking about bays that can be 30 to 40 miles long and 20 to 30 miles wide - and map it over the environmental data that was then available, which are called shape piles.  Once the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service had identified the scientific interests to be conserved and the aquaculture had been mapped on to that, which relates to what I said earlier on the impact particular types of aquaculture have on particular types of environmental features and whether they can or cannot coexist, then appropriate assessments had to be carried out for that bay for all the aquaculture taking place there in order to know what could and could not, from an environmental perspective, be licensed there.</p> <p>  If one is dealing with oysters, oyster trellises are often placed in the same place in which the migratory birds feed.  To have any basis on which the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service can assess the impact of the aquaculture on these migratory birds, which may be a protected species and for whom there may be a protected habitat, one needs to have some sort of time series.  One is talking about gathering information for four or five years.</p><p> Two things were happening.  The aquaculture was not stopped from happening and it continued on as it had before, but no new licences could be given while all that infrastructure was being built up.  The appropriate assessment of a particular bay could be 500 or 600 pages of dense detailed data.  All that had to be created.  Only when one got out the other side of the appropriate assessment process could one then deal with the normal licensing things like navigation, safety, cage structures and all that sort of thing.  There was a period from 2009 to 2012-2013 when there was no infrastructure on which one could license as it was being built.  We have now got to the point since 2012-2013 where we have begun to start producing licences out of this new infrastructure, this new system, and 600 licences have been decided through that process to date.  It has been sequential and it has been built up and we now have 27 bays where the appropriate assessment process, which is the end of that Natura 2000 process, has been gone through and we are clear that the scientific interests have all been identified, etc., so the foundations on which to make decisions are now there.</p><p> There are 600 licences awaiting renewal and all these people have been operating over the interim period.  The figures I gave members on output give the facts on that aspect.  The ability to do the licensing is now possible because all that infrastructure is in place as without that one could not do it.  The target is to do 300 in 2018 and 300 in 2019.  It is not just the Department which has to step up to the plate on that.  There will also be the scientific advisers, the Marine Institute and BIM.  </p><p> Things happened along the way that were not foreseen.  Once we started doing the appropriate assessments and started looking at the licensing in bays, the people who deal with underwater archaeology showed us the new legislation that had been brought in by the Legislature on underwater archaeology and they required us to do underwater archaeology surveys on the bays before we would license.  Quite a lot of people benefitted as this process moved along.  Things stopped in a number of bays until we could get the underwater archaeology surveys done for those bays.  There are reasons behind this; it was not just somebody being tardy.</p><p> That system has now been built.  The 600 licences that went out from 2013 until now went out more or less evenly over the years.  We were dealing with a situation where the 1997 Act had led to licences being written in 1998 to 2000, largely for a ten-year period.  They all fell for renewal just as the ECJ judgment issued.  At the very time when one would have had a logjam of renewals, one had the ECJ judgment, and that stopped matters and it took until to 2013 to get all that infrastructure in place.</p><p> Those ten-year licences will fall for renewal year by year from here on.  If all the actors that are being pulled together can deliver the 600 licences over the next two years, then we will have cleared the backlog about which we talked.  There will, of course, be new licences and in a few years' time, we will be back to renewal issues.</p><p> That is the explanation to the very understandable questions as why this happened and why it takes so long for someone to get a licence.  Those people who were operating when all this happened were able to continue to operate.  They will now get decisions on renewal.  That explains the length of time and the process.  The industry was at least able to continue to work through that period but there was nothing ideal about it.</p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about Scotland.  In Scotland, one needs - it is all written up in the report - five to seven consents to start an aquaculture operation.</p><p>One also needs a fore-seabed and foreshore lease from the Crown Estate, a planning permission, an environmental impact assessment from the local authority, a marine licence from Marine Scotland, an authorisation to carry out aquaculture business from Marine Scotland, a controlled activity regulation from the Scottish Environmental Agency and a habitats regulations appraisal.  The review group looked at the Scottish model and came back saying that there was a balance to the Irish model, where one needs two licences - an aquaculture licence for the activity that is taking place, and a foreshore licence for the foreshore one is occupying.</p></speech>

We are not going to be in that position again, in so far as one can see into the future.  I refer to the issue of the delay and the issue of the bureaucracy and whether the Scottish system is less bureaucratic than the Irish one.  As I said, the review group looked at that, and it is in the report.  It looked at the five to seven licences one needs under the Scottish system and came to the view that there were advantages to the Irish system where only two licences were required.</p></speech>

I do not see why it would be greatly different.  Scotland is not working under a European Court of Justice negative judgment, at least at this point it is not.  Perhaps it will not be going forward.  That is the unique circumstance in Ireland.  <br/><br/>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue that we have development reports for aquaculture, and we absolutely do.  We have a national sustainable development strategy for aquaculture.  We have a whole series of schemes in place to support the development of aquaculture under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, in the Department.  We do both regulatory and developmental work within this.  We have the Food Wise 2025 targets.  We can see no contradiction between having a sustainable licensing system, which is fully compliant and which will be a marketing asset and so on to the industry, and assisting the industry in selling internationally.  We have oyster products going to China and we have a whole lot of aquaculture products going around the world to 80 or so markets.  It is a very international business in Irish products.  If one looks at the price of Irish farmed salmon, we were getting maybe &euro;6.50 per kilo in 2016, although it is probably higher now.  Norway is held up as being a great example in terms of aquaculture but the Norwegians were getting about &euro;4 per kilo while the Scots were getting about &euro;5 per kilo.  It is a high quality product and it has development potential.<br/><br/>As these licences are completed, another <i>quid pro quo</i>is that people get full access to all the support funding.  Under the ECJ judgment, that was limited until one got the licensing system in place.  The funds in the EMFF programme have been back-loaded to take account of this, so that if all of the licensing backlog is cleared over the next 24 months, then everybody will have access to all the funding arrangements which will be back-loaded.<br/><br/>In terms of the licences and the ability to update, anyone can ask for an amendment to the licence.</p><p>The legal responsibility on the Department is to respond to the application that it gets, and it is driven by what it is legally supposed to be doing under the legislation.  The consideration is on the basis of what somebody applies for.  If somebody has a licence and wants to change that licence, they can apply under the legislation to do so.  If it is a material change to the licence, then they must go through public statutory consultation because things one does in the marine environment and things one does on the foreshore impact on other people.</p><p> Deputy Kenny brought up the case of a person who found that the oyster ground that had been licensed was not very productive and they wanted to move.  They can apply to move but it must go through the statutory public consultation process because other people may have an interest in the area of the foreshore to which they may want to move.  They are not precluded from applying for change, but the change must go through the whole process.</p><p> There is an awful lot of transparency in this report.  Every step in the licensing process is set out in flow charts in the back of the report.  I was asked a question on the six-month timeline.  The flow charts in the report, which were prepared by the Department, explain to people that the steps in the process are all legally required steps in the legislation under which we must operate.  Each of those steps has a legal obligation, a legal timeline, etc., that one has to work under.  It sets out how one moves through the process, if it is a material change.</p><p> Under the Irish system, people do not own the foreshore, they simply lease it from the State.  It is publicly-owned property.  If they want to move to a different piece of foreshore, there has to be consideration that other people have interests in that issue.</p></speech>

The industry is very small and there are limits.  All of what I talked about earlier - the data collection, mapping and appropriate assessments - was carried on the public purse.  If it was a different type of development then the developer would have to carry out an environmental impact statement and so on.  There are limits to the amount of bureaucracy.  My division is relatively small and it is one of many in the Department that deals with this matter.

The legislation requires the Minister and the Department to consider the applications that it receives on their merits and make a decision.  That is what the person applies for.  If a person has a licence but wants it changed then the legislation permits him or her to apply to do so.  If the change is a material change then there is requirement to go through public and statutory consultation, etc., because it is on public property and other people have an interest.  That is how the dynamism exists.</p></speech>

Publishing in two or three newspapers will ensure that the notice is read by somebody who lives in the community and will be affected by the decision.  I have made that basic point before yet it still has not been accepted by the Department.  In recent weeks I received a letter that still says that the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>is a newspaper that circulates in the region.  I am sure Deputy McConalogue will have more to say about this matter in a minute.  Persisting with the same publishing policy is just madness.</p></speech>

We are working through all of these and trying to establish a hierarchy.  The report recognises that the primary legislation will take too long in terms of dealing with the backlog issue.  The first priority is to clear the backlog, then there will need to be new legislation and we will start consideration of the new legislation.  There are only three pages of recommendations and I tried to categorise them in my presentation.  It is not an inordinately long list of recommendations and some of them are easier to implement than others.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny asked a reasonable question about the six-month time limit. </p></speech>

They are all there because they are legally required to be there.  We cannot remove them.  It is difficult to see how one can fit with the six-month time limit yet meet the legal requirements.  Those are the sorts of issues that are being considered.</p> <p>  The report talks about the pre-application process.  Let me outline one of the issues.  I think the Department started out being very helpful to aquaculture applicants because it is a relatively new industry and people may not submit full or complete applications, site maps would have to be sorted out and other things would have to be sorted out.  We have not traditionally dealt with it in the way that a planning authority would do so and return an application to the applicant if a comma or full stop was missing.  That has not been the culture up to now.  Part of the implication of not having that culture is that things take longer due to sorting out the applications, working with the applicants to source site maps, which they would not have necessarily, marine mapping, surveying, etc.  </p> <p>  One of the recommendations is that there would be a much stricter pre-application process.  One of the considerations is whether BIM would take on the role of assistant.  I am thinking in terms of farm advisers and people who help people to complete applications in the agriculture sphere.  If BIM takes on that role then it cannot be involved in the post-application processes.  We, in the Department, primarily work with two agencies - BIM and the Marine Institute.  The Marine Institute advises us on scientific and technical matters and BIM advises us on development and other technical aspects of the industry.  For example, when we need to get the underwater archaeology done we would work through BIM to get those surveys done. If BIM were to be involved in the pre-application process it could not legally get involved in post-application processes.  If we took on that recommendation today we would weaken the ability to deal with the existing backlog as the measure would take one of the players out of the game.  Nothing is straightforward but that is life.  If we got past the backlog of existing licences then one could move.  I think we would generally favour a much clearer and stronger pre-application process because it takes a lot of time to straighten out applications.</p></speech>

There seems to be an attitude that the Department will deal with and implement the report when it has completed the other work of issuing the 300 licences that it wants to issue.  I would like reassurance that that is not the case and that there is a commitment to implement the recommendations of the report, notwithstanding that the Department needs to get the new licences issued.</p></speech>

The Minister commissioned the report and the Minister and Department are one and the same.  He commissioned the report for a purpose.  A central recommendation of the report is that the backlog should be cleared by the end of 2019.  That involves a threefold step-up of the rate of determinations on licence applications each year, in 2018 and 2019.  That has never been achieved under this system.  It is the central short-term recommendation to be done.  We are accepting the timeline and making every effort to try to step up to that timeline.  There is no question of not accepting the report but even if one reads the structure of the report, it talks about what can be done in the short term and what can be done in the longer term.</p></speech>

It is a very timely meeting and it is important that we have it because it is crucial that the independent report commissioned by the Minister is moved on and that we see those recommendations acted upon and implemented.  As I know, and Senator Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Pringle will know, there is potential in aquaculture, in my own county in particular - we are among the most impacted by it - for an increase in employment as a result of the development of oyster farms.  There has been an increase in production and also the tremendous employment provided by Marine Harvest in the Fanad Peninsula in an area where there is not much other employment.  There is much more potential there if we can get our licensing system motoring, renewals completed and new applications streamlined so that there can be prompt decisions.  The Marine Harvest plan in Fanad is operating at well under its capacity.  It does most of the processing for the rest of the country and could do much more but it is stymied by the fact that these licences have been on hold for the last period and the opportunity to expand is not there.  There is an onus on us as the State to ensure that we push that forward.</p> <p>  I have a few questions on the independent review.  One of its key recommendations is that an implementation plan would be published.  The independent review was commissioned in December 2016 and it was published in May 2017.  We are now in February 2018 and the implementation plan is not in place.  Whatever about getting all the recommendations implemented, the actual plan as to how we will implement them has not been published or finalised.  Although progress may be made on the recommendations, the key overarching plan has not been agreed.  I know the witnesses have referred to the draft implementation plan.  Is it possible for us, as committee members, to be privy to where that is, what the Department's position is and what the plan currently is?  It is important that the 300 licences in 2018 and the extra 300 in 2019 are issued.  I acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that will be involved in that for the Department.  That will indeed be a significant objective for it.  The Department is saying that there are 600 licences in hand at the moment to be renewed.  How many have been renewed up to this point?  In 2018 and 2019, we are talking about 300 each year.  That is 600 renewals.  What number of new applications are we talking about at the moment, or amended applications where an entity seeks to amend a licence it has been working off for the last years since the court decision?</p><p>I want to comment on and seek further clarity about two or three of the recommendations.  Senator Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Kenny have touched on recommendation 8.1, which states: "A six month time limit should be set in which to determine a licence and that this should apply to all new licence applications submitted after January 1 2018."  Are we in a position to achieve that for new applications?  I presume that is for applications which are on hand but it indicates that we should achieve a six-month timeline for new applications as of now.  Where are we with that?  I know the witnesses commented that they feel the recommendations of the report relating to the six-month timeline may not be compatible with the legislative obligations that have to be met with regard to a licence application.  Will they flesh out which parts of the licence application they believe are not compatible with that six month objective?  Are there steps that we can take to try to ensure that compliance with the legislation becomes possible within the six months?</p><p> Recommendation 8.16 recommends that work should commence immediately on new aquaculture legislation.  Has that work commenced?  Where are we with that work and that new legislation?  Recommendation 8.7 indicates that consideration should be given to assigning the licensing function to a new body.  This is the first occasion we have had today to properly discuss that.  Given that this independent report has been available since May, I think these issues need to be crystalised promptly with regard to fleshing out that idea.  That feeds into the implementation plan and where we go with that.  Following on from that, how many of the 30 recommendations does the Department agree with?  That is not clear at this stage.  The report is there but we do not know, point by point and recommendation by recommendation if the Department agrees with or intends to pursue them and bring them forward.</p><p> A comparison was made to Scotland.  The Scottish industry has developed and expanded at a much faster pace than ours.  There is a consideration there that, post-Brexit, if it leaves - we hope it does not, but it is making such a mess of it that there is a real possibility that it will not work out how we like - the current requirements, restrictions and regulations on the Scottish industry, for example, will be removed and it will be able to proceed at pace and develop even further.  I know there is the European court decision which has tremendously impacted on our situation.  What did the Scots do differently from us which has meant that they did not have similar court decisions against them and have been able to grow at a faster rate?</p><p> With regard to salmon fishing licences versus aquaculture oyster licences, for example, are salmon licences up for renewal?  Are they all being included in that 300 this year and 300 next year?  Does the Department wish to deal with all of them?  Is there a differentiation in how it views those?</p><p> A significant body of work has been carried out about the appropriate assessments.  Were there existing licences which fell outside of areas which required appropriate assessments or are we talking about appropriate assessments being required for all areas where licences were in place?  Has the Department been able to continue to issue them in some areas which were not affected by the court judgment?</p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn made a point about the newspapers.  He indicated that it is dictated by law that there should be information in papers published in the vicinity of the area.  Will the witnesses give us further detail on that?  I believe people have been directed to certain papers before.</p><p>Is there a schedule of newspapers held by the Department which it provides to those making applications to outline which newspapers they are required to publish in?  If so, is it possible to amend and update it?  It is very important to develop the sector.  It is also important that we take communities with us and that people have the opportunity to participate in the process.  There have been issues and difficulties in Inishowen.  Linsfort is a case in point where people did not feel they got that chance.  It is very important there is a streamlined system.  </p><p> On the foreshore licence applications, where are we at on the timeline involved?  How promptly is it being dealt with?  </p><p> Will Dr. Beamish comment on the Department's position on the oyster industry along Lough Foyle, given there is no jurisdiction over it?</p></speech>

The answer is that 600 licence decisions have been made under the new system.  He asked if there were areas outside of Natura.  There were but they are limited.  Bantry Bay is the largest non-Natura area; most of the rest are Natura areas.  We dealt with Bantry Bay in 2012 to try to clear the decks of the non-Natura areas before we got into the Natura ones.</p> <p>  He asked me about Scotland and the ECJ.  I cannot answer that.  The Deputy would have to ask the Commission that question.  I do not know the specifics of the situation.  </p> <p>  The Deputy talked about finfish and salmon.  The salmon situation is a little different because under the environmental impact directives, an environmental impact statement has to be produced for each salmon application.  There are only 38 finfish licences.  There are only one or two new ones so the rest are operating as they were under their old licences.  An environmental impact statement has to be produced and there are only one or two of those on hand and they are only on hand about a couple of weeks.  We are awaiting environmental impact statements on the rest before we can advance the renewal process and the decisions on those applications.</p> <p>  The growth in salmon I talked about in my opening statement has occurred in the context of people operating under their existing licences.  There are estimates that we may get to 19,000 tonnes for 2017 but it is an estimate at this stage.  It was 16,300 tonnes in 2016 and 12,000 tonnes in 2012.  People have been operating under the licences they have.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the salmon industry in Norway and Scotland.  There are some things happening there which are different.  For the past five years, salmon production in Norway has plateaued.  It has been pretty static for the past five years and equally so in Scotland.  In Norway, there are essentially no new licences in the existing areas.  There are some possibilities for what they call green licences where one is using a new technology or new species or for going offshore into deeper water.  They are beginning to hit some limits in terms of their capacity to grow.  Salmon production in Scotland has been static for the past five years as well.  There are things happening to people and the story is evolving from where it was which was one of rapid growth.</p><p>In terms of the 600 applications we are targeting to decide over the next 24 months, the estimate is that about 40% will be new applications that are on hand and 60% will be renewals.  That is an estimate.  I do not have detail on it but that is what people are saying.</p><p> I will address the issue of newspapers, which seems to be a big issue, as it was last year when we appeared before the committee.  The legislation is very simple.  It says the applicant should publish in a newspaper circulating in the vicinity of the location.  We cannot publish in every provincial and local newspaper.  I do not know the total number but there are up to seven in some bigger counties.  We have tended to pick the biggest in a county.  We discussed the Inishowen issue in detail.  It may well be that that model has to be reviewed, for example, if there are new technologies.  In new aquaculture legislation, it will have to be done differently.  One of the alternatives is to publish in national newspapers so we would not have this issue, but that is not a very satisfactory either.</p></speech>

We keep it under review.  We are open to keeping it under review.  We have a budget, but like everybody else, we have limits.  There have been some publications in the <i>Inishowen Independent</i>.  I do not know if we can sustain it but it has happened.  We will keep it under review.  We are listening to what is being said.  We are well aware of what is being said.<br/><br/>Lough Foyle has always been a complex issue.  The aquaculture licensing legislation does not apply to Lough Foyle.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Loughs Agency is envisaged as having future functions in aquaculture licensing in Lough Foyle.  The issue underlying everything in Lough Foyle is the fact there has been no settlement on jurisdiction on Lough Foyle.  Before the Good Friday Agreement and the referendum, under Articles 2 and 3, it was all considered to be part of the State.  Subsequently, it changed with the changes of Articles 2 and 3.  There has not been a resolution of the jurisdiction issue.  It impacts on the foreshore.  The aquaculture legislation does not apply.  There is ongoing interdepartmental work on Lough Foyle, which has been going on for some time.  There are contacts with the United Kingdom authorities, although the jurisdiction issue is primarily a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issue, to try to see if there is a way forward.  Until the jurisdiction issue is resolved, it is difficult to see how the foreshore issue can be defined and how the functions can be given over to the Loughs Agency because there remains the issue of how the foreshore will be dealt with.  In the UK, the Crown estate owns the foreshore and that is quite different from Ireland.  The Crown estate is an independent entity.  It regards it as its real estate, wherever the boundary is.  The United Kingdom authorities have to deal with the Crown estate as well as part of that discussion.  It is not resolved.  There is active work going on.  It is not something on which a timeline can be set for a resolution.</p></speech>

The recommendation was that would commence work immediately.  Dr. Beamish dealt with issue of the new licensing function in a previous question, but obviously that has to form part of the implementation plan as well.</p></speech>

The person is asking for the piece of property to carry out the aquaculture activity.  There is no point in pre-granting that piece of foreshore if a decision has not been made on the aquaculture.  They are separate files because they are separate legal entities.  However, the Minister makes a decision, in an individual case, on both the applications for an aquaculture licence and a foreshore licence simultaneously.</p></speech>

The recommendation is that a six-month limit should set. If we look at page 66 and onwards in the report, it sets to the process that is pursued at the moment to grant a licence.  Each one of the steps timelined in the flow charts is what is legally advised and required.  That does not reduce the six months.  I am not saying six months is not the right aspiration.  However, it does not reduce the six months.  We are looking at whether there is any way to be legally compliant and get through the process in that timeline.  The report itself does not explain how that could happen.  That is the issue being looked at.</p></speech>

The Scottish case was a couple of years.  The backlog that arose from the ECJ is exceptional.  There is no doubt about that.  However, so was the agreement to maintain aquaculture activity during that period.  If we have the architecture on which we can now build a decision, such as the appropriate assessment, data collection and scientific conservation interests identified, it is a much more streamlined process.  It cannot be started without that.</p></speech>

It was a more friendly way of doing things.</p><p> Many of the traditional aquaculture operators are relatively small farms, new in the business or they were at one time.  Much of the information they require would not be easily to hand privately.  Traditionally, it is expensive to get.  We helped with mapping and so on in the past.  However, with the recommendation to go for a much more demanding pre-application process, the post-application process can certainly be shortened.  When comparing one country with another, those are the kinds of things that might give different results.</p></speech>

In shellfish cases, a pre-screening is done by the Department and its agencies, and a decision is taken as to whether an EIS is required.  In most cases it is not and that shortens the process for shellfish.  For finfish it is mandatory under EU law.  There has to be an EIS and that takes longer.  One of the other reasons there are different figures for those timelines is public and statutory consultation.  Depending on what arises in those consultation exercises, there may need to be feedback loops, adjustments and so forth, and that can take longer.</p></speech>

We have been doing that both in the Department and with our Minister.  We have not created a document for publication.  However, we have been working internally on a strategy to deal with these.  It is easy to go through the recommendations and talk about them and what consideration is going into them.  It is quite clear, however, that we and others will not be able to do everything immediately and clear the backlog.  There are a limited number of people who work in this area.  The Legislature will take some time to do a whole new aquaculture framework.  It tends to be a high-interest group activity.  I am sure there will be a lot of amendments and adjustments when we are doing it.  The report is quite open about that.  It recognises that some things are longer-term than others.</p> <p>  Anything that we can adopt relatively quickly, get in place and that will drive the clearing of the backlog is being done.  We have started work on things like developing electronic systems and e-licensing with our IT people.  We have also started work on a draft aquaculture management information system that would do an e-mapping system.  However, we are a long way from being in a position to have anything that would be capable of being issued and relied upon in a legal process.  All the things listed that can be started and moved along are being looked at and we are trying to be move them along.  The report does not say that everything has to be done.  The ones with the timelines are the backlog.  That is accepted and that challenge is being taken up.</p></speech>

With some of them it is challenging to see how they can be implemented with the range of legal obligations imposed on the Minister and the Department.  These are not optional and cannot be removed easily.  They are European requirements etc.  There are some immovable objects that a recommendation simply will not get past.  If there are other ways of doing it or faster ways of doing it, it might be possible.  Much of what we are discussing is a historical problem.  We could have been having this conversation in 2007 or 2008 when we were really in trouble with this project with the negative judgment and no architecture.  We have almost addressed a problem that is getting closer to resolution.  We are a good way down the road of resolution of many of the problems, although not all of them.  There will always be new problems.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the need for the implementation plan to be finalised and published.  I take his point that many of these recommendations will be more medium term and so on and that some will be more achievable.  The priority has to be to get the licences renewed and issued.  Resources need to be allocated to that.  Some of these recommendations may have a longer timeline than we might like.  At this point it is crucial to see what the plan looks like.  We need to see the timelines and the Department's views on the various recommendations - whether it accepts them and wants to put a timeline on them or if it does not think they are feasible.  Given that the independent review was published last May, we should have seen the implementation plan before now, including a formal response and plan of action from the Department.</p></speech>

Obviously the recommendations are listed, as Dr. Beamish has said.  Will he supply the committee with a response to each recommendation and a timeline for implementation or, if they cannot be done in an acceptable timeframe, the reasons for that?  If he says there are difficulties, that is fair enough.  He needs to let us know the difficulties.</p></speech>

We have been working actively on some of these, including the resourcing of ALAB.  ALAB has been given additional resources since this.  There is a request for a service level agreement.  There are legal issues about that because it is an independent body.  Putting a burden on it for delivery on operational independent legal decisions does not sit with the primary legislation.  However, we are looking at drafting a governance agreement with ALAB if we can within legal advice.  That has been ongoing.  It is dynamic and probably anything we might give the committee would probably be out of date shortly after it is given to the committee because it is all changing.</p></speech>

It needs to be crystallised.  That implementation plan with targets set needs to be prioritised and put in train, understanding that there are resource implications and certain things will be given priority over others.  It is not acceptable to kick that can down the road.</p></speech>

I would be interested to see the implementation plan when the Department publishes it.  It would go a long way towards setting the process in train for us.</p><p>This whole process arises from the European Court of Justice recommendation.  Dr. Beamish had told us that the intention in Europe was that this system would be rolled out across the rest of Europe.  How close is it to being rolled out across the rest of the European Union so that everyone will be on a level playing field in future?</p><p> The public has a role in deciding the application process.  It has not been mentioned much in Dr. Beamish's presentation.  I think there was one sentence out of four or five pages, which is a retrograde step.  The Department is the licensing authority.  It has responsibility to the public and to the people applying for licences.  Therefore it should take on board the views of all and ensure that everybody is taken care of.  Obviously, people involved in aquaculture licensing or in any sector do not like to see the public being involved because they see it as a difficulty that has to be dealt with.  They do not like to see the licensing people doing that.  It states that a common theme in the submissions received during the public consultation process was inadequate public notification of applications.  It is there and it is vital.  It is very important that the public has faith in the process as well as the industry having faith in the process.  I do not think the two are mutually exclusive.  I think they actually work together.  By having both sides fully on board with the process, at least we can know that the process can stand up.  I would be concerned that the public consultation is seen as a nuisance rather than being a vital part of the process.</p><p> I probably know the answer to this and it may also be contained in the document.  Increasing the licensing period from ten years to 20 years probably makes sense.  Will Dr. Beamish outline his views on it?</p><p> I presume the aquaculture appeals process is separate from the procedure outlined here and that is probably why it is not covered in it.  Will there be a similar process for that or will it also be a streamlined process?  Will Dr. Beamish outline his views on that?</p><p> On the timeline for implementation of all the report's recommendations, the legislation seems to be long-fingered.  Will Dr. Beamish expand on that?  The focus is probably rightly on clearing the backlog of outstanding decisions.  What about the legislative measures?  The report recommends that the two happen in tandem and that work should start straight away on that.  Has that happened?  If not, when will it happen?</p><p> Has the environmental impact assessment directive been taken into account?  I know it came in after the final report was drawn up.  Has that been taken into account?  It will probably have an impact on the licensing process in the future.  This has to be a dynamic process to keep track of how the EU legislation is changing.</p><p> Deputy McConalogue asked about the Lough Foyle licensing.  I know Dr. Beamish said the foreshore is caught up there.  What is happening to the produce of Louth Foyle?  I accept the licensing cannot happen, but production is taking place there and I presume the product is going somewhere.  What role does the Department have in the produce from Lough Foyle?</p></speech>

We have heard from eminent people with great knowledge and from the Department whose officials have exceptional knowledge of the issue.  It has been very helpful.  The backlog has been the biggest issue the Department has homed in on.  It has expressed the hope that most of these issues will be resolved in the very short term, not the medium term.  It hopes to resolve 600 cases in the next two years.  That is 300 a year if I am to believe what I have heard today.  How is the Department going to resource that from a manpower perspective given that 600 cases is what it managed to deal with in the period from 2012 to date?  It will mean an enormous drive to make the necessary changes to the Department's structures, manpower and efficiencies to manage as many cases in the next two years as it has managed since 2012.  Will the Department explain in detail how it will manage this?  Will it be through computerised courses, budget changes or staff increases?  How will that move forward?</p> <p>  Dr. Beamish mentioned BIM and whether it should be involved with the industry itself first before it comes to the Department.  Dr. Beamish reckoned there might be a conflict of interest in that regard.  Is there a need for a Teagasc-type organisation to be set up for the process?  In the agricultural sphere, Teagasc has a relationship with the Department to some degree as the funder and it advises farmers on a day-to-day basis regarding grants and how they work.  On the other side, Teagasc provides an information service to inform the development of national policy.  Is there a space for a Teagasc set-up in Dr. Beamish's industry to help streamline applications and assist the Department with the system?  If such an institution were set up, how should it be constituted?</p></speech>

In particular, I refer to the environmental impact of industrial-scale fish farms and how the concerns around that are addressed.  Part of the process involves the National Parks and Wildlife Service setting conservation objectives.</p> <p>  The area I am from has a bountiful river for salmon fishing, the River Moy.  I do not know if I heard it at the committee or elsewhere, but I have often heard IFI concerns about fish farms and the possibility of escaped farmed salmon carrying lice and disease and interfering with the breeding patterns of wild salmon.  Indeed, a farmed salmon was found on the river.  There appears to be some contamination in the wild.  The IFI has expressed concern and it is the body which is charged with the conservation of wild salmon.  On the other hand, the Marine Institute does not seem to be as concerned about it.  Who takes precedence?  Who decides what is a priority and what balance should be struck?  How does the National Parks and Wildlife Service arrive at a determination on priorities?</p> <p>  How are the rights of traditional seaweed harvesters being accommodated, recognised and protected or, indeed, limited in the licensing process?  Many concerns have been raised about the rights of people with a long-standing tradition of cultivating and cutting seaweed from the shore.</p> <p>  I should have added the following to my first question.</p><p>I refer to the situation with onshore as opposed to offshore fish farms.  I understand the former are environmentally preferred.  What are the pros and cons there and why is it not the natural choice?  Is it simply a matter of cost?<br/><br/>We have talked about marine harvest and we have objectives here for aquaculture.  That is what the Department is dealing with.  It gives out licences so that we can hit targets in this strategic economic activity in the food sector.  On the other hand, an issue which is coming more and more to the fore involves the Government's objectives on renewable energy.  That will include marine energy generated from waves, tides and, possibly, offshore wind.  The Government is looking at the possibility of providing support tariffs to offshore wind.  I know solar is up.  With reference to the Department's aquaculture licensing function, how does it reconcile competing interests?  Is there a <i>de facto</i>marine spatial strategy?  To what extent will there be conflicts of interest as we move more towards offshore renewables, for which there is a greater public appetite than for onshore renewables?  Has that been considered at all?</p></speech>

The issues we have been talking about today relate to the habitats and birds directives.  The European Commission is the guardian of the implementation of those directives and it took Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  I am not privy to its interactions with other member states.  The large competing states are the UK and, to a lesser extent, France on some of the shellfish.  Norway is an EEA country and in a different situation.  We are not privy to the interactions and communications on enforcement between the Commission and other members states but they are subject to the same rules and should be meeting the same obligations.</p></speech>

The other way to look at it is that once the system and its architecture is built, we will have a very significant aquaculture asset to help us know what we are doing.  Any food product one is selling requires a high level of environmental certification.  It is increasingly the case in the wild fish area that if one does not have environmental certification, one loses a very significant portion of the price.  Our aquaculture industry will be in a better place by virtue of having this, albeit it is a painful child to give birth to.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the issue of public involvement.  I have just looked at the presentation.  A lot of it is concerned with the Natura 2000 scheme and the environmental dimensions because that is what much of the licensing report is about.  That was the core issue.  However, I did mention that the legislation provided for periods of public consultation and I talked at some length about the public participation directive.  Of course, the public are stakeholders.  It is a public good and public property.</p></speech>

We have had applications in respect of which we have received 1,700 or 3,000 objections.  The public are actively engaged in the process.  There is a process of public consultation for every licence application and each view has to be assessed, dealt with and considered in the decision-making process.  The public are intimately involved in the process.  Members of the public are often involved in appeals through the Aquaculture Licensing Appeals Board.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about shortening licensing periods from 20 years to ten.  This is something on which we have had initial consultations with the industry because the report makes the recommendation and it is legally possible to receive a 20-year licence.  There is a variation of interests.  The non-governmental organisations, NGOs, have lobbied to have three-year licences, but we have tended to stick with a ten-year period as a middle ground.  It is not only an aquaculture licence but also a foreshore licence.  Normally, applying for a 20-year foreshore licences involves obtaining a valuation from the Valuation Office and there are five-year rent reviews.  A mid-term environmental impact statement will probably be required because environmental factors are likely to change over a 20-year period.</p><p>As such, we have tended to operate using a ten-year period, with standard fees for foreshore licences.  Certainly, if we were to change to a 20-year period, it would not be possible to clear the backlog because we would have to obtain Valuation Office valuations for every one of the licences.  There is no possibility of having 600 of them done in anything like the timeframe we are discussing.  Moreover, we would have to draw up formal leases for such a period, which would involve rent reviews, etc.  </p><p> We have started a consultation process with the industry to obtain on their views on this issue.  It is possible to change to a 20-year period, but it would have implications.  It would have significant cost implications and we have supplied some indicative comparative costs of what might happen in such a situation.  One option is to deal with the applications in hand in the way the other applications have been dealt with and then examine a prospective move to issuing longer term licences.  There would also be other considerations in having 20-year licences.  Effectively, somebody is sterilising an area which is very large in the case of some aquaculture licences.  If the company is not capable of performing adequately, a 20-year period would create a long-term rather than a short-term problem.</p></speech>

Simply saying that we will do 300 licences does not do the 300 licence determinations that have to be done.  All the building blocks will have to be delivered to do that.</p> <p>  I will now respond to the questions put by Senator Lombard.  We had a discussion earlier on the infrastructure that had to be built to enable licensing to happen.  That is largely now in place.  That is what enables a stepping up of the licensing process.  In itself it does not achieve it but it does enable it.  </p> <p>  In his contribution Senator Lombard spoke in terms of the role of Teagasc in an advisory capacity where it advises applicants for grants and so forth.  BIM does that in the seafood area.  BIM works with applicants on the preparation for grant and other schemes, advising on how the schemes run and how they apply.  The issue of BIM working in an express way on the pre-application process is that BIM is a statutory consultee when that application comes in at present.  BIM helps the Department on some of the things that we might need to do.  I spoke earlier on the underwater archaeology earlier.  It seems to us that if BIM were to do the kind of pre-application role that farm advisers may do, that would seem to have implications for any post application involvement.  It is a question of the balance of advantage.  Is the balance of advantage to make that move at this time when one is trying to up the rate of decision determination?</p></speech>

However, let us look at Teagasc model.  Teagasc is a statutory body that advises the Department, but a farmer can bring his agricultural adviser from Teagasc to the appeals hearing.  The crossover is not quite so drastic as Dr. Beamish is stating.</p> <p>  I see a great similarity between the role of the BIM and Teagasc.  I see it as something that needs to be looked at.  The benefit from the agricultural point of view to having that independent body coming to a person through a process is very helpful.</p> <p>  Dr. Beamish states how open he is to working with the applicant.  While that must be acknowledged, there is a place and time in the industry for looking for a Teagasc-style body to be put in place so that those in this sector can benefit from it.</p></speech>

I am saying we will look at those suggestions.  We have to consider them before making any move.  I think it was Deputy Pringle who raised the question of public opinion.  The public often has a very strong interest in this and has a very clear view about whatever decision might be made about a licence and it may be challenged legally.  People are entitled to do that.  The process needs to be clean in terms of any arguments about being involved in pre and post and so on.  It is an area in which there is a high level of interest group involvement in any decisions made.  We do not want to get into a situation where the licensing is being done faster but the licences themselves have less of a possibility of withstanding challenge.  That is not in the interest of the applicant, whatever licence decision is made.</p></speech>

I think from her previous contributions her interest is primarily in salmon farming, and that would be understandable in the context of the Moy.  I spoke about the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, setting conservation objectives in relation to NPWS defined Natura 2000 areas.  If in a Natura 2000 area there is a large area of eelgrass which is a habitat for a lot of young mussels, that might  be identified as the scientific interest to be preserved by NPWS.  In an area of marl, which is a sort of cold water coral, the NPWS may say this is an area that needs to be defined out from an aquaculture activity.  The role in the State of defining the scientific interest and the lead role on Natura areas is with the NPWS.  What I have outlined are the type of scientific interests that the NPWS is dealing with in this process.</p></speech>

The State set conservation objectives for salmon which were implemented when the State bought out the draft nets at sea.  This was done to preserve the wild salmon stock.  Are these measures taken into consideration now in the granting of licences that could adversely impact on wild salmon?</p></speech>

All the features in those Natura areas have been mapped.  The NPWS is saying that within this bay, which could be 30 miles by 20 miles, there are these areas of particular interest.  These are the things that this area was designated to preserve.  Those areas must be taken into account in the licensing system.  There might be other areas where there are no such implications or interactions with the scientific interest.  We are talking about spatial considerations.  Salmon conservation is primarily the function of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, comes under that Department.  IFI deals with the policy on the conservation of wild salmon.  It has set the objectives for salmon.  When it is proposed to establish a salmon farm or there is an application for renewal of a salmon farm licence, an environmental impact study must be conducted and an environmental statement provided.</p><p>It must go through statutory and public consultation, of which IFI is one of the consultees.  All of that is fed into the decision-making process.  There are management measures in place dealing with things like sea lice.  There is a system in place and protocols that govern all salmon farms.  There are 14 inspections a year on the farms and all the results are available on the website.  There are treatment trigger levels set under the protocols which require treatments to happen when lice levels go above a certain level in those inspections.  There are consequences if those treatments do not work.  There is a ratcheting-up system.  The lice are endemic and have been there for millions of years.  They are endemic in the marine environment in about 40 different species.  They build up on salmon farms on occasion and they have to be managed.  It is in the interest of both salmon farmers and wild salmon interests that they be managed and kept at low levels.  </p></speech>

Notwithstanding my respect for the Marine Institute and its wealth of scientific knowledge, I am concerned when the IFI has concerns because the salmon and trout stock and so on is its primary concern.</p></speech>

Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, did a study of them in the past couple of years and the commercial reality of salmon farming on contained systems is not established.  Norway produces 1.2 million tonnes of salmon a year in sea cages and has not transformed into an onshore system.  There is work going on looking at the possibility that the salmon smalls would be kept growing for a longer period in the hatcheries and grown to a bigger size before they go to sea.  To move everything onshore is not proven anywhere at this point.  The vast bulk of salmon farmed around the world is farmed at sea.  In the Irish context, we have a high-cost energy environment and a relatively high temperature which are particular challenges in Ireland.  Technology is evolving.  It may well be that this is where it goes or it may go there for different stages of the life cycle.  That is not a proven scenario at this stage.</p></speech>

We will always find people who have sometimes extreme environmental concerns who see everything going pear-shaped very quickly but it has been explained to me and I have seen footage of very problematic offshore fish farms in Canada where it seems to have caused environmental disaster.  I understand they have to be placed in a certain place where there is current so it can disperse the excrement or whatever is coming from the salmon but it raises legitimate concerns that we get the right balance here.  I want to know, because it is raised so often, if we are looking at the possibility of onshore fish farms.</p></speech>

There are a number of technological challenges that will need to be overcome before economic viability can be proven.  At the end of the day, it is a private sector enterprise that only operates on a profit basis.  If it is not viable it does not happen.  To incentivise these types of developments, the Minister increased the grants under the EMFF sustainable aquaculture scheme in December 2016 to the maximum possible rate of 50% for applications in 2017.</p><p>He also doubled the maximum grant amount permissible.  The incentivisation to do the research and to look at this is in the schemes we have but that does not mean it has proven viability.  It is a private sector industry.  We do not have applications on hand.  We have applications for sea farming but we do not have applications on hand for somebody to do a commercial recirculating aquaculture system.  </p></speech>

We dealt with these types of issues with renewable energy.  We have to support renewable energy at the moment.  As it goes along and technology develops it becomes more self-financing and self-sustaining.</p></speech>

The maximum grant amount was doubled in May.  I do not have that information to hand but I do not think it has been taken up.  There are about 1.2 million tonnes being produced in Norway and it has not moved in large scale to recirculating systems and neither has Scotland which produces 160,000 tonnes a year.  We have to compete in those markets.  It is a competitive market scenario.  It is still a young industry and it is evolving.  We have been farming for thousands of years but we have only been farming at sea for the past 30 or 40 years.  The species, the technology and the ways of handling things are evolving constantly.  The demand for aquaculture product is almost exponential.  The EU is importing two thirds of all the seafood it needs which is not a sustainable position going forward so we will see a growth.  We are seeing rapid growth globally.  Farmed seafood is very close to exceeding captured seafood.  Captured seafood has its biological limits.  Globally, we will see a big growth in aquaculture.  We are seeing it year on year.  It is a very young industry.  The way it is done and the species involved will evolve.</p></speech>

If somebody wants to set up a seaweed farm and that activity is under way, we deal with the licensing of it but the management of the foreshore is all managed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as is taking anything off the foreshore whether it is sand, rocks, gravel or seaweed.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on renewable energy, there is an EU directive on marine spatial planning.  At the risk of being wrong, because I do not have the date here with me, we have to have a marine spatial plan in place by 2020 or 2021.  Work has commenced with the Marine Institute on doing all the scientific research to underpin such a plan.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will ultimately publish the plan and we will be moving forward on the basis of planning and development and working within the framework of the marine spatial plan.</p><p> While it is evolving, it is not there at the moment in respect of renewable energy, oil, gas, aquaculture or fisheries.  It is much more complicated than terrestrial planning because one is operating in a three-dimensional environmental - what is underneath the seabed, what is sitting on top of it, what is in the water column and what is on the surface.  A variety of consenting bodies, some national and some international, govern this.  In fisheries, for example, everything is covered by the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU.  One cannot simply make a plan and zone fishing in one area or another or restrict it.  One must go through a process of interacting with the other affected member states before anything like that can be defined, given that it would impact on their interests and rights.</p><p> A directive, a commitment and a timeline for producing a marine spatial plan are in place.  Ironically, much of the mapping that we did under Natura will feed into that because many of the inshore bays have been mapped by virtue of that process in a way they never were previously.  That information has been reused.  A wider mapping exercise of our seabed, called INFOMAR, has also been under way for a number of years.  Ireland is probably well ahead of everyone else in that respect.  All of that will be pulled together by the Marine Institute as the scientific advisory body to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this issue.  That work is under way.</p></speech>

Similar to the Chairman, I am from a landlocked county and am not nearly as knowledgeable on this issue as my colleagues, all of whom are from coastal counties.  I have learned much from today.  It was a good presentation and there were good interactions, from which basis I will ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  Based on the fact that the Department has been rolling over licences since the 2007 judgment, I presume that the monitoring of their terms and conditions has happened based on the original terms and conditions.  As such, it would not have taken into consideration the results of the mapping, scientific research and so on under the habitats and birds directive that were required as a result of the ruling.  Is there a chance that there has been an ongoing negative environmental effect while licensed?</p> <p>  Prior to the judgment, how many licence applications were unsuccessful?  Will that figure increase after the new terms and conditions have been taken into consideration?</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  I am not a member of the committee, but I represent a constituency with a large fishing industry.  That is why I am present.  Aquaculture is of considerable importance to the people of Cork South-West.</p> <p>  In fairness, Dr. Beamish went through the question of the delay in the issuing of licences in detail.  I will take him at his word, but it still seems a long time in light of everything he said.  There will be 300 licences this year and 300 next year.  Given the long delays, could those applications be expedited?  In many constituencies, aquaculture is a large industry and employer, which has a domino effect in those regions.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Beamish have any comment to make on the granting of the licence in Bantry Bay to harvest 1,860 acres of native kelp?  I have spoken at three public meetings in the area in recent months.</p><p>There is considerable public anger over the issuing of the licence.</p></speech>

I have reviewed the transcript of the committee's February 2017 meeting with the witnesses, at which we also we dealt with the matter of Linsfort beach.  Unfortunately, the issues that I raised a year ago - ensuring full public access to an application - have not changed as of recent weeks.  I will read from the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, with which Dr. Beamish will be familiar.  It stipulates clearly what must be published in a newspaper advertisement - the name of the applicant, the address, the structures to be used, the species to be cultivated and the location of aquaculture proposed.  Is it acceptable that, in this case, the Department worded the application for the applicant and instructed the applicant to state that the site's location would be the shores of Lough Swilly?  I made this clear at the previous hearing and was not contradicted.  The advertisement of the location that the Department insisted upon related to the shores of Lough Swilly.  Did referring to the shores of Lough Swilly rather than Linsfort beach, Buncrana, County Donegal, comply with the legislation and the Department's requirements under it?</p></speech>

We will be constrained in what we say on that.  There have been 600 licence determinations since 2013 and we do not have with us all of the information on each of those.  As such, what we will say will be constrained to general statements.  My colleague, Mr. Quinlan, will address the matter in a moment.</p> <p>  Senator Daly used the term "rolling over licences".  I will work from memory.  Under the amendment made to national legislation, an applicant whose licence had expired by virtue of the effluxion of time, had applied for a renewal and was awaiting a determination on that could continue to operate within the terms and conditions of the licence previously held.  It is not the applicants can operate freely.  Rather, they must operate within the licence's terms and conditions.</p></speech>

That determination might grant the same licence, refuse it or vary it.  What the outcome would be at the point of determination must be free and based on the evidence.  A decision on whether that particular activity in the area was doing harm to the environment would be made on the licence's renewal, which is when all of the information would be to hand.  That is how that works.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked how many applications were unsuccessful in previous rounds of applications. Most of the previous licences were given out under the 1997 Act in the period from 1998 to 2000.  I do not have information on the number of applications refused, varied and so on at that time.  Of the applications that we have been dealing with to date under the new system, 32 have been refused and a good many - I do not have the exact number - have been varied, in that they would have got a different set of-----</p></speech>

If one goes through all this process, one gets conditions attached or adjustments to the area applied for and so on.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked a few questions.

I am speaking from memory on this and I believe we had a lengthy dialogue on that particular case at the previous meeting when we appeared before the committee.  We are constrained in what we can say about individual cases, and rightly so.  I am speaking from memory on this, as it has not been possible for me to check the full facts, and I am relying on some of my colleagues here, but there is a system in place for people in the area to appeal the licence.  I do not recall whether that happened but it was available to people.  I am aware of the controversy there was around it at the time.  We discussed this at length on the last occasion.  The only point I would made in concluding on this is that the procedures adopted by the Department have not been found to be at fault by anybody to date, the licence has not been overturned and it is a sound and valid one.  That would say something about the procedures.  Decisions, whether one refuses or grants a licence, can be controversial.  The important point is that there are procedures in place whereby applicants for a licence who are disappointed, or members of the public who may be disappointed at the decision, have recourse to the procedures that are in place.  That was entirely the case in the instance referred to by the Senator.  My understanding, and I am speaking purely from memory on this, is that whatever systems were there were exhausted.  As far as I know the licence is in place and the procedures have stood up to the scrutiny.</p></speech>

He said: "The Department cannot - I repeat cannot - depart from what is said in legislation because it is there to protect the public and the individual member of the public who has applied for an aquaculture licence."  He clearly said that the Department cannot depart from what is said in legislation.  I will frame the question clearly for Mr. Quinlan.  Does he understand that with respect to the legislation referring to a location, the actual location must be specified, not the shores of Lough Swilly but the actual location, in this case, Linsfort beach?  Would that be his interpretation of the legislation, that an actual location must be stated?  It is clearly the interpretation that I would take from it and my reading of it.</p><p> Mr. Quinlan referred again, as he did on the previous occasion, to people not appealing.  They could not appeal because they did not see the advertisement as it appeared in a newspaper very few people in that area would read, but I will not go back over that ground.  If Mr. Quinlan does not want to deal with the specifics of that issue, does he believe generally, in terms of the legislation, that when his Department guides an applicant, that the location should be the actual district electoral division, the actual townland where it is taking place, or the general bay?  What is the usual practice in terms of legislation when an application is being submitted?  I remind him of what is said in the legislation which is there to protect the public and the individual member of the public who has applied for an aquaculture licence.  I asked the question, being mindful of that and having repeated Mr. Quinlan's words that the legislation "is there to protect the public [which is the basis of the issue I am raising] and the individual member of the public who has applied for an aquaculture licence".</p></speech>

There was also tolerance on the part of the Commission in terms of pulling back from taking all the aquaculture out.  The aquaculture area continued on the terms and conditions it was on.  Equally, the funding mechanisms are cofunded by the Commission, and it has been very clear all the way through this, and was clear back at that time, that if an activity was operating in a Natura site but was not licensed in compliance with the Natura habitats and birds directives, it could not receive development funding.  I tried to address that earlier in saying that the current funding round that is in its place, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, has been back-loaded in the aquaculture area.  Most of the funds are still available.  If the backlog can be cleared, the development funding can be drawn down.  However, it is true that if an operation was not licensed in compliance with the birds and habitats directives, it could not draw down development funding, and that was a reality and a difficulty.  Of the 600 applications that have gone through and on which determinations have been made, it is open to those people who have got licences draw down funding.  I checked with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in the past few days and the level of interest in, and demand for, the schemes is going up all the time.  If the backlog can be cleared, those people who will get determinations at that point will be able to pull from the schemes that are there, the EMFF schemes.</p></speech>

The answer I gave the last time was absolutely the correct answer.  It is the only answer I can give today.  For the record, if the Department had departed from the legislation, at the time, it rightly would have been held to account, either through ALAB, the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, or through a judicial review of the procedures.</p> <p>  I know, because of the interest which existed at the time in the area over this case, that an enormous amount of examination of the Department's procedures took place.  They were not found to be at variance with the legislation.  I can say no more today.  The licence is standing.  It speaks for itself.</p></speech>

How can my question be interpreted as asking the Department to depart from the legislation?  The legislation states the location must be named.  What does the Department interpret that to be?  Is it the exact location, such as the district electoral division, DED, the townland or the general bay?  I am not asking the Department to depart from legislation.  I want it to give me its understanding of what the legislation requires.</p></speech>

In every single case, the Department specifies the location to the extent possible.  If anybody has a difficulty with that, there is an avenue in the legislation open to him or her to proceed.

May I answer?  This is precisely the point I am making.  It was a contentious case in the area.  It gave rise to a considerable amount of correspondence and examination.  Had there been a difficulty with the procedures, this would have been pointed out.  I have no doubt about that.  Appeals would have been lodged.  The fact that this did not happen in itself would be at least one indication that the Department's procedures were found not to be at fault.  The systems in place for people to use were not utilised in a situation where there was much local public interest in the case.</p> <p>  This is more or less what I said the last time and it remains the position.  The Department does not depart from legislation, at least consciously so, as I presume there are occasions when mistakes can be made.  I am not aware of one.  There are procedures for people to hold the Department to account.  I am not aware that anybody in the area was deprived of those procedures.  It is what it is.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinlan referred to being asked to depart.  Nobody asked him to depart from the legislation.  The witnesses are highly qualified people.  If legislation asks to stipulate a location, what would be their understanding of location?  If I asked them where they are right now, would they say they are in Ireland or in a committee room in Leinster House?  I cannot be clearer than that.  Does Mr. Quinlan believe that it would be expected of an interested party that the term "location" would stipulate the exact location or the general bay area?</p></speech>

Interference from mobile phones can also adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.</p> <p>  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders on education inequality and disadvantage, an issue about which all members, including me, feel strongly and passionately.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan, Maynooth University, Dr. John Bissett, community worker with the Canal Communities Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, Ms Sin&eacute;ad Dooley, assistant CEO of Irish Rural Link, Ms Niamh Quinn, senior youth officer in For&oacute;ige, Ms Elizabeth Waters, CEO of An Cos&aacute;n, Ms Deirdre Malone, executive director of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, Ms Olive McGovern, principal officer in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and Caitriona O&rsquo;Brien, principal officer in the social inclusion unit of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>We very much appreciate everybody coming.  Two weeks ago when we looked at the programme we wanted to follow and the individuals we wanted to come before us, we were not sure whether we could get somebody from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to do so because of the direct line with the Minister.  Therefore, we very much appreciate the fact that we have an opportunity to hear from Ms McGovern and ask her questions.  <br/><br/>The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the delegates to make a briefing opening statement of a maximum of three minute duration.  It will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.  Of course, prior to the meeting we also received the formal written submissions.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise them that any opening statement they make and their written submission will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>I invite Dr. O'Sullivan to make her opening statement on behalf of NUI Maynooth.</p></speech>

Therefore, I want to start my statement by telling my story.  </p> <p>  I am a doctor of psychology who graduated top of her class from Trinity College Dublin.  I have published several research papers and book chapters on widening participation and presented at many conferences worldwide.  I currently work in the University of Oxford in partnership with the Department of Education in examining the impact of following alternative access routes.  To many, I am your average middle-class woman, but I am also the daughter of two heroin addicts.  I was a teen mom having had a baby at the age of 15 years and an early school leaver.  For a long time I lived on Benefit Street and felt comfortable working in a caf&eacute; around the corner from here serving people like me fried eggs and bacon, but through many supports and interventions, I have been able to over-achieve and outperform many of my friends in education and employment and navigating the dark arts of the system.  However, it has not been easy.  It is my view that there is no easy solution to the problem the committee is addressing.</p> <p>  I have been privileged to have read about and research what educational disadvantage is and how it impacts on lives.  I have also been able to develop activities and work in areas in which people have been moved successfully from disadvantage to advantage.  I bring with me some of the views I hold.  </p> <p>  First, I think the DEIS scheme does not work in the stance it has taken.  The recent review showed that it only had a significant impact on school planning and that levels of literacy and mathematics had only improved in line with all national improvements and that there were still large disparities between DEIS and all other schools.  I would change the programme, including the prescribed sets of activities in which all schools included in the scheme must participate from primary through to second level.  They should include subject support, aspiration-building activities and college awareness programmes.  It is not enough to ask schools that are already stretched in time and resources to plan their own activities when we have a body of knowledge which shows what works and what does not.  I would include an internship programme for all DEIS schools under which companies would commit to taking students from DEIS schools in transition year.  I would also provide tax benefits for the companies involved.  </p> <p>  On a more national scale, I would reform the higher education access route, HEAR, scheme and make the points reduction bigger and regulate it across higher education institutions.  To date, each institution manages its own entry requirements.  They are "interpreted" in differing ways.  I would formalise the path from the leaving certificate applied programme to third level and from further to higher education.  It is not the job of higher education institutions to try to recognise programmes or build relationships with further education colleges to formalise these routes.  I would also recognise access routes by creating incentives for higher education institutions to develop routes to their courses from access and community programmes for the hard to reach groups - prisoners, lone parents and those who are severely marginalised.  </p> <p>  I thank the joint committee for listening to my views and would welcome questions.</p></speech>

One of the things that it is important for me to say is that when I was a PhD student, I used to read about reproduction in education or the reproduction of inequalities in education.  After 30 years, I know what reproduction means.  It means very little change in the educational circumstances of large numbers of young people, particularly in working-class communities.  The key point I want to make is that the education system is philosophically based on the foundation of equality of opportunity.  That is a critical mistake and we need to change it.  We should replace it with what is called equality of condition, a fundamentally different way of looking at how the education system is structured which has critical connections with the economic and financial system to give people the wherewithal and resources to participate in education in a realistic manner and in a more general sense in the society in which we live.<br/><br/>The philosophy based on equality of opportunity is a liberal philosophy that has become common sense and a <i>doxa</i>as the Greeks call it such that people think it is the only way.  In 1960 the Council for Education advised the State that we should not have a fully public secondary school education system.  I argue that today equality of opportunity is the new problem we face.  It is based on meritocracy - the idea that IQ plus effort equals merit.  The problem is that it ignores structural injustices within Irish society, principally in our economic structures.  We live in a capitalist society that produces inequalities due to the nature of its structure.  The equality of opportunity model presents the system as if everybody can make it if he or she just applies himself or herself and in such a way that those with the most intelligence will rise to the top when, in fact, the problem is that for lots of people the system is rigged from the beginning.  The myth of equality of opportunity is very powerful and difficult to break down.  <br/><br/>Education is full of class practices.  Groups with more resources are able to buy their way through via private education resource packs to privilege or to enable their children to do so.  This option is not available to large sections of the population, be they working-class, of other races or ethnic groups or women.  Things such as extra tuition, grinds, out-of-school activities and other capital items about which people like Pierre Bourdieu have written extensively are transmitted to and inherited from one generation to the next.  <br/><br/>We have had some changes in the education system over 30 or 40 years in terms of participation rates at the various levels.</p><p>My argument is that relatively little has changed since the introduction of post-primary free education.  One of the key questions is on what values do we want the system to be based.  Are they competitiveness and places for the talented few?  How will nurturing, trust, solidarity and care fit into the education system?  Effectively, we have a system that has been built to manage inequality and is presented as a <i>fait accompli</i>, the natural state of affairs, when we could fix and completely restructure it.</p></speech>

The general perception is that the education system is a good one, but that is a dangerous mentality.  When we compare our system to the Finish model, sadly, it is lagging behind.  The Finnish model is moving away from the emphasis on subject workload, heavy volumes of homework and rote learning, while in Ireland we use league tables as a barometer of children's success.  We encourage students to revise and retain large volumes of sometimes irrelevant information and regurgitate it in a structured form in order to maximise their points.</p> <p>  When we look at extracurricular activities within the school system and the outcomes from young social innovators, young scientist competitions and Concern debates, to name but a few, we see that when young people are allowed to be creative, they excel above all those from other nations.  We should have an education system in which innovation and creativity are rewarded, encouraged and recognised as part of the curriculum.  Employers are shouting from the rooftops that they require employees with training and skills, as opposed to employees with multiple degrees and no problem solving skills.  Encouraging innovation and problem solving skills from an early age would not only benefit the labour market, it would also build confidence and social skills which would enable young people to deal with issues in a logical manner and also reduce the number presenting with anxiety and stress.  However, very often there are extra costs associated with participating in extracurricular activities.  The Irish League of Credit Unions back to school survey in 2017 showed that 67% of parents surveyed would not have been able to afford extracurricular activities.  While the level of early school leaving has decreased, children from disadvantaged areas are still more at risk of leaving school before completing their leaving certificate examinations.  There may be a range of factors in a young person leaving school early, one of which is that the student has to conform with the education system.  Reducing the average European rate of early school leaving to less than 10% is one of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy in the area of education.  It would help towards the integration of young people into the labour market and contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty and deprivation that leads to the social exclusion of too many young people.  </p> <p>  The Youthreach programme which was originally intended to meet the needs of the student who felt "detached" from the education system has become more academic.  We are suggesting this be reviewed.  Funding for the programme, like others, is now outcomes and awards based, with the expected outcome for participants being to obtain a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 4 qualification which equates to basic leaving certificate standard.  The programme must revert to adopting a person-centred approach, where it would be tailored to meet the young person's needs.  There is a mismatch between outcomes and awards and the skills match to which the Minister continually refers.  The programme needs to be practical and skills based in order to be effective and relevant and encourage positive participation.</p> <p>  Too often schools place more of a focus on Central Applications Office, CAO, points and third level courses, highlighting past pupils' achievements by the third level institutes they attend and the level of qualification attained.  Apprenticeships are often seen as the Cinderella route to a career, being referred to as the alternative option to explore.  Students who choose to opt for an apprenticeship, whether it be in the traditional trades or the new apprenticeships of information and communications technology and finance, should not be made to feel inferior to those who choose to go directly to third level.  Teachers and career guidance counsellors need to proactively promote all options available to students.</p> <p>  This opening statement and our brief submission only scratch the surface of the need to engage in further dialogue.  Irish Rural Link proposes the establishment of a task force to carry out a critical analysis of the education system, one which will be representative of all education and skills providers and include an analysis of the availability and accessibility of community education programmes to ensure issues of disadvantage and inequality will be addressed adequately across the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.325" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Quinn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#F00400"><p>I am a senior youth officer with For&oacute;ige and a front-line youth officer in Blanchardstown.  For&oacute;ige is a leading youth work organisation.  Much of our work focuses on areas of severe disadvantage in which poverty and other social issues impact negatively on young people's educational attainment.  Youth work in Ireland is fundamentally an educational and developmental process, defined by active and voluntary participation and a planned curriculum.  It complements the formal education system.  Our research and work on the ground indicate that no single factor but a constellation of difficulties leads to educational disadvantage, culminating in early school leaving.  Particularly noteworthy are misbehaviour in school and anti-social behaviour in the community; poor parental engagement in the young person's education; possibly a family history of early school leaving and being a member of the Traveller or Roma community.  Some research suggests that since measured intelligence only accounts for about 25% of the variance in the level of school success, other non-cognitive factors such as personality, persistence and willingness to study must be important.  It is from this perspective that For&oacute;ige and youth work can have a vital impact on the young people who may be at risk of educational disadvantage.  Key to our role is educating and upskilling young people in the range of soft skills necessary to successfully move from adolescence into adulthood.</p> <p>  We use a range of evidence-based and evidence-informed programmes, as well as an emergent curriculum based on the individual needs of the young person or group of young people in front of us.  Programmes we deliver regularly include For&oacute;ige's leadership for life programme; Relationships Explored and Life Uncovered, REAL U, a relationships and sexuality programme; the Aldi For&oacute;ige youth citizenship programme; drug prevention and education programmes; Be Healthy, Be Happy, an holistic health programme; the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, NFTE, programme; and a range of youth offending behavioural programmes.  We support the development of positive family relations through evidence-based programmes and workshops on identified areas of need.  We also have a range of family support and teen-parent support programmes nationally.  At a community level, For&oacute;ige and the youth work sector are active with and passionate advocates for young people.</p> <p>  The education system appears to work for the majority of young people.  However, there is a sizeable minority who require a range of additional supports to obtain its benefits.  We have a range of potential solutions which might help to bridge the educational attainment gap.  We would like to see increased collaboration between the formal and non-formal education sectors to ensure young people who require a youth educational development intervention or support will be identified, referred and supported.  This could also take the form of youth work organisations upskilling and supporting the formal education sector in the delivery of appropriate youth education and development programmes such as the REAL U and NFTE programmes.  </p> <p>  We would like to see consideration being given to the expansion of the age range covered by the Education Welfare Act 2000 to include those younger than six years and those older than 16.  In the younger age range this would enable educational welfare officers to engage with parents whose children's attendance is erratic or poor to address the issue before patterns are established.  At the upper age limit, vulnerable young people who may be on the cusp of disengaging from education could be supported to remain or move into employment or training.  We would like consideration to be given to the development of early warning system, EWS, indicators of potential disengagement that schools or communities could use to identify those young people who may require additional supports to remain engaged in education.  We would like additional resources to be provided to meet the formal and non-formal educational needs of young people from the Traveller and Roma communities, ethnic groups which experience high levels of educational and social disadvantage.</p><p>Where children in disadvantaged communities regularly attend at least one preschool year under the early childhood care and education scheme we have found that it improves their school readiness and has a far wider impacts than the impact on the young person; it impacts on the family too.</p></speech>

An Cos&aacute;n developed in and is located in the community of Tallaght west, but now we have regional and national reach through our fledglings early years services and our virtual community college.</p> <p>  I have been a community education practitioner for over 25 years.  I am passionate and I know that education is the only fast-track out of poverty and social exclusion.  Educational underachievement is absolutely linked with intergenerational unemployment, poor health and well-being, multiple addictions, mental health issues, homelessness and suicide.  These are the outcomes.  It takes really resilient creative communities focused on personal and social change to challenge the underlying inequality and disadvantage and to turn that tide.  Community education is such a process.  Community education is adult education in a particular context.  It intersects educational disadvantage, unemployment, social welfare, dependency and poverty.  Community education is a community-led educational model.  It reflects and values the lived experience of individuals and their communities.  It is grounded on principles of justice, equality and inclusiveness.  It absolutely results in wide-ranging positive outcomes for individuals and their communities and for society as a whole.  For the past 30 years, An Cos&aacute;n in Tallaght west has facilitated over 16,000 learners to move from basic education to further education and right through to degree level with extremely successful outcomes in terms of access to employment.</p> <p>  Those of us in An Cos&aacute;n have learned what we call the one-generation solution.  If we educate a young woman who is a lone-parent to degree level, she will earn 40% more than her colleagues who have no degrees and she will exit poverty with her children forever.  That is one of the most significant issues.  The ESRI produced a report last week on the issue of lone parents and the impact of poverty in their lives.  Some 23% or one third of lone parents are in consistent poverty.</p> <p>  Community education does not focus on equality of opportunity but on equality of outcomes.  It really seeks to put in place all of the supports that are needed to ensure equality of outcomes.</p> <p>  My experience working in prisons and working with homeless young women and with a wide range of marginalised groups has taught me to see the impact where those issues are not resolved.  At best we have long-term unemployment but there is also addition and anti-social behaviour and in Tallaght we are constantly faced by the outcome of suicide.</p> <p>  I see the impact on the lives of individuals who have engaged in second-chance education, either through their own determination and courage or perhaps with a gentle nudge from engaged practitioners and organisations like An Cos&aacute;n.  I am here today to advocate for all involved in community education.  We work successfully with those on the margins.  As a result, we are also marginalised.  Everyone knows that we get the crumbs from the educational table - I do not think anyone would debate the point.  We are sitting here today discussing the same issues that I talked about 30 years ago.  I do not understand why we do not have the long-term vision to know that targeted investment will give us the results we require.  I am here to recognise the power of community education and to recognise it as a sector by itself that really impacts on social disadvantage.  We need the resources to do that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Malone" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#G00500"><p>Our area of expertise lies primarily in penal policy and prisons.  We believe crime and punishment have to be viewed in the wider context of social policy, marginalisation and exclusion.  Fundamentally, that includes education inequality and disadvantage.  Victor Hugo said that when we open a school door, we close a prison.  Regardless of whether he meant that figuratively or literally, the significant point remains that in responding to crime and the risk of crime, education and genuine access to all forms of education is a vital part of the solution.  It is part of prevention and diversion.  Even where someone has convictions, whether one or many, it can be part of transformation and rehabilitation.</p> <p>  Our submission identifies five key groups we come across in our work.  Each should be relevant to the consideration of educational inequality by the committee.  Each has specific needs as well.  The first is children affected by parental imprisonment, of which there are at least 6,000.  The second is children in care, of which there are more than 6,000.  The third is young people who are already in contact with the criminal justice system.  The fourth is prisoners and detained children.  The final group includes those who have come out but who have criminal convictions.</p> <p>  I will try to assist the committee with a snapshot of the situation in prison.  We are grateful to the Irish Prison Service, which allowed us to use some recent statistics gathered.  The statistics were taken from 800 prisoners in three prisons.  A quarter of those who answered the survey attended no secondary school.  More than half left before the junior certificate and 80% left before the leaving certificate.  Only one in five had completed the leaving certificate, which compares to three in five in the general population.</p> <p>  It is my view that those children did not fail the education system; the system failed them.  We talked to a group of young people between 18 and 24 years who were, by admission, involved in some form of offending behaviour.  Every one said they wanted to stay out of trouble and that they were interested in getting a job but they were completely unable to do so because of what had happened along the way in their education.</p> <p>  While our focus is on prison and the penal system, I urge the committee to look at prevention and early intervention.  I know that the people sitting here have been talking about this for many years.  It is not rocket science.  It is straightforward.  It requires resources and looking at people as individuals.  It requires listened to people who are experiencing this every day.  I note that no young people are in this room to tell committee members about their experience and what they think the solution might be.  I appeal to the committee to consider that for a future session.</p> <p>  Where someone has gone into prison, the lack of supports available to him or her upon release is problematic.  It is a problem even where there has been fantastic engagement with prison education and where people have gone on to do degrees.  They come out with no stable accommodation no continuing education and a conviction that acts as a barrier to ever getting a job in future.  One concrete thing that could be done is to review the spent convictions legislation.  The legislation is posing a major barrier to people looking for employment and further education when they come out.</p> <p>  In summary, five things can be done: prevention and early intervention; identifying and directly supporting at risk groups; recognising diversity in education; looking at the person and not simply the system; and supporting the transitions and people on release.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.333" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olive McGovern" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#H00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak at this session of its examination of educational inequality and disadvantage.</p> <p>  My Department's interest in the issue arises, in the first instance, in the context of our work to promote the voice of children and young people in decision-making.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has overall policy responsibility for ensuring that the voices of children and young people are heard in the decisions that affect their lives.  In undertaking this role and as members may be aware, it is normal practice for the Department to provide children and young people with the opportunity to speak for themselves.  It is very rare that adults like me speak on their behalf.  The exception being made today is a reflection of the fact that the specific pieces of work relevant to educational inequality and disadvantage are works in progress.  Therefore, the work has not been brought sufficiently to completion to allow for this to be presented by the children and young people directly involved.</p> <p>  That said, it was the view of the Department that the work under way is so strongly connected to the committee's theme, and specifically to its request for insight into the impact of educational disadvantage on the individual, society and a person's outcomes, that the opportunity should not pass without providing the committee with some of the detail coming directly from children and young people themselves.</p> <p>  D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g is the national youth parliament for 12 to 17 year olds.  The most recent D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g in December considered the topic of equality under five domains relevant to children and young people's lives: school; home and community; online; public services; and sport and leisure.  For each topic, the participants at D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g were invited to consider two broad questions, namely, what are the equality issues in this place and what needs to be done to improve equality in this place?  At the end of the discussions, D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g delegates voted on one area of action for change or improvement.  School was the area for action selected by the greatest number of delegates.</p> <p>  The key equality issues in the school topic from the most to the least commonly mentioned were: unequal treatment of students by teachers; school uniform and appearance issues; gender inequality in subject choices; LGBTI equality issues; issues related to curriculum; religious equality issues; and Irish language equality issues.</p> <p>  The first meeting of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive for the period 2017 to 2019 took place on Saturday last , 3 February.  The executive will work to refine the topic content further and set out a programme of work to make changes or improvements for young people in that regard.</p> <p>  The purpose of this submission is to give insight to the committee into the views of young people and the changes to which they have given early consideration in the context of the December D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g proceedings.  It has been a frequent practice of the executive to seek an opportunity to make a submission to this committee as its work develops.  As such, the Department expects to be in further contact with the committee as that work progresses.</p> <p>  The Department wishes to bring to members' attention the work of the Children's Equality Commission, which is also a work in progress.  The commission was established by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the aim of enabling the voices of children who experienced or understood economic hardship or poverty to be heard directly and acted on by policy makers.  Three panels of children and young people were established and the topics identified of relevance to the committee's theme are set out in our written submission.  The suggestions outlined for change are in the children's own words and provide insight into young people's views when asked directly about this topic.</p> <p>  The work of the Children's Equality Commission has not yet been completed and the intention is that a video format reporting that work will be available in due course.  Engagement with the committee once the work has been completed would be a welcome opportunity for the young people.</p> <p>  In my submission, I have detailed some early work under way regarding reform of the school completion programme.  While I do not hold policy responsibility for this area, I will be working with the relevant policy unit to support and ensure that the voices of children and young people are central to the reform process.</p> <p>  I look forward to this afternoon's session and hope that I can be of assistance in exploring the important issues identified for discussion.</p></speech>

A key priority for the Minister for Education and Skills and his Department is for education to be a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.  We have a wide range of policies and supports in place to tackle educational disadvantage across the education continuum from early years to primary through to post-primary and on to further and higher education.</p> <p>  As noted in our submission, the Department does not work in isolation on this issue.  Many of the additional supports provided in and around schools come under the remit of other Departments and agencies with whom we work collaboratively and closely to ensure that those most in need are targeted.  As the committee can see from the detailed submission provided by the Department, we take the issue seriously and are doing our utmost at all levels to encourage participation, retention and progression in education.</p> <p>  The recent review of the DEIS programme and the introduction of a new DEIS plan last year marked an important step in our ongoing attempts to prioritise the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  In the extensive research and evaluations carried out to date by the Department's inspectorate, the Educational Research Centre and other bodies as well as with relevant stakeholders, an overall improvement has been seen in those schools supported by the DEIS programme.  The wide-ranging supports provided under DEIS, from teaching to financial resources to access to specific interventions, such as home-school community liaison, the school completion programme and literacy and numeracy programmes, represent an investment by the Department of over &euro;125 million annually.  Although the results from the evaluations are encouraging in terms of educational outcomes, attendance, retention, progression and school planning, it is evident that a gap still remains between DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  The goals and actions under DEIS Plan 2017 are aimed at narrowing this gap further and a monitoring and evaluation framework is being developed to allow us to better determine which interventions are having the greatest impact as well as providing an evidence base to inform future policy.</p> <p>  As a Department, we are also mindful that success cannot be measured solely by educational outcomes.  Other aspects need to be taken into consideration, such as the attitude of the students, their aspirations and the school climate.  DEIS Plan 2017 contains actions aimed at supporting well-being, stressing the importance of school climate and encouraging the involvement of the wider community in school life.  There are also actions in the plan relating to the importance of transitions across each stage of the education continuum, with the ultimate aim that those who wish to transition to further and higher education should be able to do so.</p> <p>  Equity of access to further and higher education is a fundamental principle of Irish education policy.  Both the further education strategy and the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 are working on breaking down the barriers for target groups to enrol in and complete their chosen areas of study.  We collaborate closely with other Departments and agencies on these issues, and the supports offered include various financial grants and funds made available to those most in need and supports for higher education institutions to encourage participation by under-represented groups.</p> <p>  I look forward to this afternoon's discussion and hope that I can be of assistance.</p></speech>

Before turning to members, I wish to say that youth organisations were invited to attend and young persons could have been the ones to deliver their presentations.  The invitation was declined.  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has presented to us previously, as has the secondary schools organisation, in which case a secondary school student presented.  The WorldSkills group also presented to us on youth apprenticeships.  Without a shadow of a doubt, we want to hear the voices of young people and those who have experience of working with them.</p></speech>

If a fit of coughing starts, just ignore me.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  This is a topic close to my heart.  I will start with a criticism, though.  With all due respect and while I am sorry to shoot the messenger, the contribution from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, a body that represents some of the most vulnerable families in terms of their outcomes in life and their lack of educational attainment, referred to D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, but that group is not representative of what we were asking about in our questions.  We could have heard something valuable from the Department about the kids whom it represents through Tusla and so on.  Five direct questions were asked about the outcome of educational disadvantage for the individual, and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g discussing equality issues within the school setting does not address them.  There might be some crossover at stages, but those are two different issues.  I just wish to note my disappointment with the quality of what was presented on this topic.</p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is another Department that sees early school leavers also walk through its doors in their droves to sign up for jobseeker's allowance and SOLAS courses.  It refused to make a submission as it felt that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would adequately cover the concerns.</p><p> I have about four questions.  Ms Malone gave a very insightful submission which everyone should read.  In considering education for prisoners, we think of education while in the prison system, which is like putting a plaster on it.  Obviously early intervention is key.  In the absence of early intervention and when people end in the prison system, does Ms Malone see a role for the education system within prisons to lead directly into universities or community education?  I ask her to give more detail about the problem of the spent convictions and being able to progress further.</p><p> I have a simple question for Dr. O'Sullivan.  Why are the current systems not working?</p><p> I have a question for Dr. Bissett.  Can the Irish education system address the inequalities that exist in Irish education and Irish society in general?  </p><p> I believe Ms Waters touched on the issue of adult education.  We look to early intervention, which obviously is the best-case scenario, but there is that ripple effect of education.  I was on the pilot of the lone parents two-year programme all those years ago.  I notice that it has recently been cut and will no longer exist.  That is an amazing programme that works with lone parents, provides child care and has benefitted people like me.  I ask Ms Waters to comment on that and what it means for her organisation.</p><p> I have one simple question for For&oacute;ige on the Education (Welfare) Act.  Ms Quinn suggested moving it beyond the age of 16.  What supports need to be in place?  Women are already punished.  They already lose their child benefit if their child leaves school.  That may be through no fault of the parent who might be working very hard to get their child to school.  Rather than further punishing parents by extending that beyond the age of 16, what supports should we introduce so that the children can positively and actively engage in education?  Should we redefine what education means?  If they are not necessarily in mainstream schools, should we be looking at changing the definition of education in the Education (Welfare) Act to include Youthreach, community education and apprenticeships?  I ask for Ms Quinn's suggestions on that because I know it was a recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#J00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I follow on from Senator Ruane's question to Ms Quinn on the expansion of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  I have been pursuing the matter and have submitted questions to the Minister, Deputy Zappone.  I do not know how we can expand something that is already overstretched.  Mr. Noel Kelly appeared before the committee before Christmas.  The answers I received from the Minister, Deputy Zappone, indicate that we have 89 education welfare officers.  That seems pretty poor compared with the 120 in the Six Counties, as advised by Mr. Noel Kelly.  Using the Northern Ireland figure for comparison, we would need 300 to run the service properly.  At the moment according to the answer to the parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, I have been told that we have 45 schools per education welfare officer.  It is not possible to deal with referrals; they cannot get to the students quickly enough with a ratio of 45 schools per education welfare officer.  He reckons that will be 40 by the end of 2018.  How can the system work with that?  How does the Department of Children and Youth Affairs intend to address that?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Sullivan mentioned that leaving certificate applied students are more likely to be unemployed than those who leave school early.  Surely that means there is something wrong with the leaving certificate applied.  It is not rocket science, but the lack of a review since its introduction 1995 may be part of the problem.  Perhaps the Department should learn from that; no programme should be in place for more than 20 years without being reviewed.  I taught in a DEIS school and I taught leaving certificate applied for nearly 20 years.  I was never surveyed on the course as to whether I was getting adequate resources and whether I felt students were benefitting enough.</p> <p>  However, I learned that the same teachers get assigned for 20 years.  I loved teaching leaving certificate applied.  If a teacher had good classroom-management skills and was seen as innovative that was the person who was assigned - and assigned for life - to leaving certificate applied.  That is also something that needs to be examined.</p> <p>  There are weaknesses in the module descriptors for leaving certificate applied.  It is a case of ticking the box at the end, getting the key assignment done and handing it in.  Teachers are told at the September following the student's graduation that there is a possibility that those key assignment might be checked and told to hold on to them until the end of September.  How often are they checked?  If they are not being checked they may not be done well or extra help might have been given to those key assignments.  There are tasks in leaving certificate applied, such as the personal reflection and practical achievement tasks.  Sometimes I wonder if teachers are helping students too much, because those are the tasks that are being checked.  When they are coming in, the teachers know that that is the one.  A teacher wants to help the child as much as possible, but the child is not learning if the teacher is practically doing the task for them.  Teachers talk about this frequently.  Why are the teachers not being surveyed on this to ensure it is being done properly?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Sullivan made a recommendation on the transition year programme.  Why has that programme not been reviewed?  One finds that it is the same teachers who teach transition year.  Has the Department considered making it compulsory for DEIS schools?  I believe it should compulsory for all schools.  There is an amazing difference in the maturity level of a child who has gone through transition year.  In that break they get to experiment with so many subjects and get a flavour of everything.  That difference can be seen in a child who has gone through transition year.</p> <p>  Ms McGovern spoke about the reform of the school completion programme.  Some school completion officers have told me of their fear that there will be a move to a regional school completion officer.  I do not know how that would work.  The school completion officer and the home-school liaison work as a team.  They have established trust with the families.  They know the families and the families know them.  To move to a regional officer would be catastrophic for that programme.  It is central to the development of vulnerable children in DEIS schools.  Can Ms McGovern shed light on that?  There are concerns, which I believe are justified, but it may not be the intention; I hope it is not.</p></speech>

If the witnesses do not mind, I will use them.  I may call on the witnesses privately in the coming weeks and months to follow up on some of the points that were made.  With all the submissions to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills we now have a body of documents that form an incredible resource.  The witnesses may think they have given just an opening statement, but it adds up together to a large library of information for policy makers.</p> <p>  Do any of the witnesses believe that there is a bit of divergence on the Education (Welfare) Act with the involvement of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  I know the officials cannot give any policy views on that, but they may be able to say something.  I think it should be with the Department of Education and Skills and not with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p> <p>  I noticed Dr. O'Sullivan disagreed with Ms O'Brien at one point.</p><p> Can Dr. O'Sullivan clarify that, as she was nodding her head?  While Ms Caitriona O'Brien does great work in the DEIS section, Dr. O'Sullivan seemed to be quibbling with some of the figures.  I know there is no malice in her reaction; just a lack of agreement and I would like to hear more on the disagreement.</p></speech>

I am like a bold child in school, nodding her head in the back.  I explained earlier that I was an early school leaver, which is my excuse.  My issue was about the misrepresentation, not by Ms O'Brien, but of the success of the DEIS scheme.  I was very excited when the DEIS report was released, not only as an academic in the area but as a practitioner.  I was peeved when I delved down into the statistics, which showed there were no gains for the DEIS students in literacy, maths or retention in comparison with national averages.</p></speech>

I was further peeved to see the DEIS scheme being reformed, which invested more money and expanded the scheme.  I have worked in two universities that have developed really meaningful programmes and have worked with adult and community education programmes that have evidence-based activities that do change the lives of children.  I have had meetings with people who implement the DEIS scheme and have tried to pitch to them ideas to change what is happening in these schools.  What we have had to do is source philanthropic funding for activities we knew were really meaningful for children in DEIS schools.  Over the past four years, I have worked in over 20 DEIS schools where the activities aimed at uplift are funded by Google and other organisations because there was no space to change what was happening.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane asked why the current systems are not working.  I have many views on that.  First, when things are found to be wrong, there is an unwillingness to shift.  The leaving certificate applied was referred to.  We are having conversations here that not only have been ongoing for 30 years but which sociologists have been having for 100 years and yet, we still have the same problems.  People buy into policies and it is very difficult for them to change after massive investment has gone into them.  The DEIS scheme is a perfect example of that.  The review shows there were no gains.  </p> <p>  Another thing which is very problematic is that there is a funding model for higher education and school systems, along with community and adult education, that is competitive.  We are not facilitated to work together in a way that involves joined-up thinking to solve the problem but instead have sectors that are competing for funding.  We are hiding solutions from one other because we do not want other groups to perform better than us.  We compete for publicity in the media, to get Deputies and Senators to present our awards and show everyone how great we are because we are in a model where we are not funded equally and we are not forced to cross-pollinate and share successes and good resources.  Nor is the competition only in higher education.  We see it in league tables where schools are in competition with one other.  I have even seen it in DEIS schools, where there is competition to prove how bad they are in order to remain in the funding scheme, so sometimes they hide their successes to stay in a system that celebrates being a failure.  </p> <p>  Another of the many issues I have has been showcased here, namely, the reactive nature of the system.  Currently, lone parents are the buzzword.  There has been a recent report on lone parents.  Maynooth University has recently been awarded programme for access to higher education, PATH 1 funding for a return to teaching programme because we need to diversify teacher education.  Trends emerge but as the trends change, the other groups we have been targeting and trying to shift and help are forgotten, such as Traveller activities, which are moved.  Sometimes, there is a reaction in policy to what is in the media and what is current, without stopping to ask ourselves what have we done in the past and how can that transfer into what we are doing now.  In the PATH 1 fund, we are required to reserve places for lone parents.  Previously they were not specified, but now we have to give them places.  That is good, it is recognition that this group needs to be targeted, but it means that other groups are no longer targeted.</p> <p>  My final complaint is that we have no funding for evaluation in higher education or in the education system generally.  The Government funds institutions such as the ESRI and the Educational Research Centre, ERC, to undertake that sort of thing but there are limits to what they can do.  That research is often descriptive and sometimes is supportive of policy.  The national access plan for equity has five strands.  Educational disadvantage is not only early school leaving, the definition also relates to progression into higher and further education.  The plan states that we should be researching and evaluating and establishing quality activities.  There is little or no funding for research.  Any access office I have been to has no scope to evaluate what it is doing and nor has any school I have visited.  We have no evidence base of what works.  If I have a good message and a good way of promoting it, that usually is what works.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Waters" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#K00700"><p>I want to comment as a practitioner, first on early years intervention, specifically the two-year preschool, and its absolute significance.  Our experience on the ground in Rainbow House shows that the children who go through the two-year programme that we bring them through have far better outcomes in primary school than the other children going into school.  It is really important that we target early intervention in areas of disadvantage in order that they have the resources to really bring those children through, along with their parents.  We know the issue is intergenerational and that children's outcomes are really connected in with those of their parents.  I will not go into the statistics, which are contained in my report which members have.  Not everyone will agree with me but I look at the importance of really targeting the other group.  I know it is a buzzword now but lone parents has always been a buzzword for An Cos&aacute;n.  Senator Ruane is a shining example but is not the only example of the young women who are lone parents living in social isolation in a very busy area, who come in and who go through a process over two years, which has brilliant outcomes.  It was funded for six years as innovation.  After six years, they told me that it was no longer innovation so they could no longer fund it.  There was no funding available for something that was proven to have quality outcomes.</p> <p>  There are huge issues is respect of young men aged between 18 and 30.  I expect the representatives from For&oacute;ige will agree that once one hits 18 years of age, one is on one's own.  There is very little support available.  There is a need for targeted intervention for that particular group.</p> <p>  Every day, I am out trying to raise philanthropic funds to pay for what the State should resource us to do.  I will get it for a period, and I prove the model, but it does not matter.  I need this committee's support to say that community education has proven itself as an alternative model for education to work with the groups the committee is discussing and is concerned about.  Fund us.  The young lone-parents programme is an excellent example of a model that works and is proven to work but it is not funded.  </p></speech>

It is really important to note how highly prisoners speak of teachers who come into prisons.  They are people who see them as students for the first time, rather than prisoners or ex-offenders.</p><p>They honour aspiration.  They do not focus on what a person has done.  They focus on what a person would like to do and can do.  Changes are needed in resources and budget.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission noted in a recent submission to one of the UN bodies that, between 2013 and 2017, the education budget in the Irish Prison Service was reduced.  Staffing shortages also resulted in a reduction of school hours.</p><p> The IPS needs sufficient funding to ensure education is open to as many in the prison system as possible.  It is also important that employers go into prisons and see the skills and interest there.  This is a model-well known in the UK.  The Timpson brand, which does key cutting and shoe repairs, has a model of employing ex-prisoners.  It makes sure they have training and education in prison and that there is a job waiting for them.  Prisoners are welcomed out from prison into a job and a new life.  There is continuing support for accommodation for people when they come out and continue education.</p><p> Senator Ruane asked about spent convictions legislation.  This is legislation that, in limited circumstances, provides for wiping the slate clean.  After a seven-year period convictions do not have to be declared.  However, it is not reaching the groups that we know.  It is limited and it is a long period.  A person with convictions at 18 or 19 will have to wait until he or she is 26, 27 or 28 before starting again with an employer.  There is an opportunity here for a post-enactment review of the legislation at least to remove or reduce that barrier or the amount of time for people.  It is a practical thing that could be done.  We have seen people come up against this repeatedly when they have done amazing work within the prison system.  Then they come out and they are disillusioned with having to start again.</p></speech>

These are important questions.  The Irish education system cannot address many of the issues because it is part of another institutional system, which is the economy.  I refer to how our economy is structured in respect of jobs, job opportunities, zero-hour contracts and the collapse of the apprenticeship system.  I ask the committee how it is going to understand the connections between the two things.  There is a continuum from the local within the education system.</p> <p>  One of the dangers when we have conversations like this is that we all become sectoral very quickly.  That is fair because everybody has a view that the work they do is important, and I accept that.  Key texts written by people like Michael Apple say that is important to understand.  If that basic point is not taken, it means we assume the education system will fulfil all of these functions.  It just cannot do that.</p> <p>  Our egos get the better of us.  We think we are supermen and superwomen and can sort it all out.  That is not to say the education system does not have other important functions to fulfil and things it can do.  The education system should be built around the radical equality of condition idea, based on radical education models like Paulo Freire, Jacques Ranci&egrave;re and other people who argue we should reconceptualise how our education system is structured.  We need to think about that.  Why do we have DEIS schools?  Why do they exist?  They exist because we accept the inequalities and stratified nature of Irish society is somehow the best we can do.  It is not the best we can do.  We can abolish the inequalities.  That has to be the goal and the education system has to part and parcel of abolishing the inequalities at a global level and not just at a sectoral level.</p> <p>  We are counter-intuitive in the community sector sometimes.  We argue for the sustaining of structures which perpetuate the problem we want to get rid of.  We need to think at a radical level to reconceptualise.  That is the problem with the idea of equality of opportunity.  I said at the start it is not just.  The education system is just for a talented few.  Who in their right minds in the past ten years would think there is a good reason to stay in education except people who really benefit from the system?  I refer to the collapse of all of the infrastructure throughout the State.  We are talking here after eight years austerity.  I refer to all of the programmes that were cut and all of the things that were taken away.  Are we delusional to think that this never happened?</p> <p>  At a foundational philosophical level, I am asking the committee how much of a vision it is going to have when it sits down to write its document or report.  I am not sure of its journey or where it is going.  Are we talking about small bits of sectoral change?  Will it be a bit of revision to this and another bit to this or is the committee thinking at a really deep and profound level about what is necessary, to understand what the education system has the capacity to do and what it does not have the capacity to do, and that we are going to take on the broader economic issues, really go after them and name them?</p></speech>

Let us talk about what we can do.  We can have that other conversation later.  I want to respond to one or two things.</p> <p>  Ms Malone suggested that we should listen to children.  The Chair made the point that we had invited one group.  How would the witnesses suggest the committee might go out and visit some young people?  If anybody has suggestions, he or she might come back to us.  I do not mean D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g.  I am talking about children who have issues around feeling they will not progress through the system or their parents have not.  That is my first suggestion.</p> <p>  The most shocking figure in all of this is again from Ms Malone.  One quarter of people in the research on prisoners had not even gone to post-primary education.  I apologise to those who have a particular interest in post-primary but I really think early intervention is really crucial.  I want to state that.  It makes such an enormous difference.  My first question is to Ms McGovern.  The early years and the school completion programme are both in her Department.  I know Ms McGovern is not responsible for these particular areas.  However, are there ways in which her Department has information with regard to early intervention in those early years?  That is crucially important.</p> <p>  Both Ms Waters and Ms Quinn spoke of team parenting and, again, early intervention.  How can we reach as many parents as possible to break intergenerational disadvantage?  The witnesses' programmes are successful.  Is it about more resources to reach more people?  How many, as a percentage of the community, are being reached as opposed to those not being reached?</p> <p>  On the DEIS schools, there is a network of DEIS primary principals in my constituency in Limerick, and I have spoken to all of those as a group and individually.</p><p>It appears to me that DEIS is quite successful at primary level.  I know that principals of DEIS schools believe the children in their care have benefited hugely from DEIS.  Should there be greater concentration on the more disadvantaged areas in DEIS?  Are there communities that have been identified as needing significantly more support than is currently available to schools under DEIS?  I know from talking to principals in some of the very disadvantaged communities in my constituency that they would love to be able to help families more.  They know the families the children come from and they know also that school is the one place where the children are getting extra support.  Should DEIS be more targeted than is already the case?  Perhaps the witnesses would respond to that question, in particular Dr. O'Sullivan and Ms O'Brien, if she is in a position to answer a policy question.</p><p> In response to earlier questions, Dr. O'Sullivan referred to the agencies hiding solutions from each other.  Could community education be linked more with primary education, in particular, for children whose parents are in prison?  In what way can this committee help such that the agencies are not all operating in silos and there would be cross-referencing that would make a real difference to families?  We are probably talking about a relatively small percentage of families in Ireland where there is chronic intergenerational difficulty that needs to be cracked.  Perhaps if we could answer those questions we would address Dr. Bisset's issue a little.</p></speech>

How can the benefits of DEIS be expanded to disadvantaged children outside of DEIS schools?  I am often asked by parents about what is being done to assist schools outside of the DEIS framework.  How can inter-agency work be improved to achieve more effective delivery of a range of supports that are important to DEIS schools?</p> <p>  It was mentioned in one of the opening statements that low levels of education are more likely to lead to death at a young age, particularly in reference to risk factors exclusive to people in rural areas.  Perhaps the witnesses would expand on that statement.  It was also mentioned that one participant surveyed in the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, survey of young men with offending behaviour said: "If you can't get a job you're going on the rob."  How can we better implement education models to encourage employers to hire rehabilitated offenders?  Also, how could the EU Youth Guarantee be better utilised in this country?</p></speech>

I agree with much of what has been said by my colleagues in regard to DEIS.  Having worked in a DEIS school as a primary school teacher I know that there is no school that does not need resources.  Often it does not matter in what way those resources come about.  Schools that are in DEIS have more resources and support for the children in their care during school hours and often after school in terms of homework clubs etc., and this enables those children to have a better and more positive experience.  In my experience, that works.  I am more concerned about the schools that do not get any funding through DEIS status but absolutely need it.  I say that coming from a county that not only did not get one additional rural or urban DEIS designation, it lost a DEIS designation at a secondary school, which has had a huge impact on that school.  DEIS supports are important.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Sullivan mentioned that sometimes one vulnerable group gets additional support at the cost of another.  It is four years since I last visited Maynooth University.  At that time, the university operated a programme which encouraged people with intellectual disabilities to do modules at the university.  This meant that young people with an intellectual disability were able to go to college and they had a fantastic experience.  Funding for that programme has since been withdrawn and so people with intellectual disabilities no longer have that opportunity.  That, too, is an important issue.</p> <p>  On transition year students and trying to ensure that children in a DEIS school have the same opportunities, I am working with the head of the local enterprise office, LEO, in Kildare, the president of the chamber of commerce in Kildare and a careers guidance teacher in Kildare on the development of a pilot scheme for schools in Kildare which we are calling "passport to work".  We have ten different modules.  We are hoping to roll out the programme this September.  The aim of the programme is to ensure that from an employer's point of view and the school point of view there is certainty and clarity around the expectation of the student, the school and the business.  As a person who is now giving work experience to young people, I am well aware of the disparity in this regard.  We hope to roll out the programme in eight schools next September.</p> <p>  When I started teaching, the INTO had produced a really good document called Breaking the Cycle.  It was about the generations of families who never achieved more than the generation before.  There has been some success in this area but not enough.  We have heard some fantastic examples of how this can be done from Ms Waters, Dr. O'Sullivan and others.  We need to put far more effort into doing that.  Ms Dooley spoke about apprenticeships.  The committee has produced a paper on the issue.  Encouraging parity of esteem in relation to apprenticeships is hugely important.  The committee has done a bit of work on the issue with SOLAS and Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.  We hope to continue that important work.  The committee has made the suggestion that, similar to the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, we should be doing something on a national level about apprenticeships and skills, possibly using the National Ploughing Championships as a means of showcasing particular areas.</p> <p>  If there are issues that the witnesses would like to highlight today but they do not get an opportunity to do so, they can forward further submissions to the committee.  All submissions received will form part of our final report on this issue.</p><p> On the difference between urban and rural opportunities and disadvantage, some rural areas do not have the same opportunities as urban areas.  There are disadvantages in Tallaght and Ballintubber but they are different.  It is about focusing on how we can help and support these areas.  For example, the small rural school in Coill Dubh, County Kildare, which is dealing with a completely different type of social disadvantage, does not have DEIS status, while a large school in Newbridge does.</p><p> I firmly believe that non-formal education is as every bit as important as formal education.  We need to invest in supports and resources to develop the rounded person in his or her community, the family and in society, as well to develop his or her resilience and all of that.</p><p> On For&oacute;ige, Ms Niamh Quinn spoke about intervention with those under six and those over 16.  A home-school community liaison officer will work closely with the under sixes and the school completion officer will work with those over 16.  We informed the Minister that we felt that position would sit better in the Department of Education and Skills than in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Should For&oacute;ige work with home-school community liaison scheme?  Should it take it over and how would that relationship work?</p></speech>

How they experience their lives and what matters to them has been well documented as part of that initiative.  The piece is specific on how they experience school.

This is regarding the Children's Equality Commission which was not just about school but about the children's lives overall and how they experienced economic hardship and deprivation.  Obviously, that was not the language used with the children and young people themselves.</p> <p>  The pieces we took from that initiative were what they had to say on school for submission to the committee.  I will make sure the Department provides the committee with submissions on prevention and early intervention programmes, the non-formal education sector and the overall education welfare service.  We checked with the committee that it had received input from Tusla on the education welfare service.  However, it was regarding the voice of the child, which is why the specific focus of our submission was the material which Department has directly from children and young people themselves.  As I said, the particular material from the Children's Equality Commission consists of exact quotations, the way the children describe themselves and how they experience inequality in school, if they are living in some economic hardship.</p> <p>  I wanted to clarify that for the committee.  I am sure our Secretary General will gladly provide the material the committee wants for the broader area of policy for which the Department has responsibility.  Many of those who have spoken to the committee are in service provision at the end of the policies of the Department.  Much of that is represented in the practice that other people today have presented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Quinn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#N00700"><p>I do not see broadening the Education (Welfare) Act and extending it after 16 as punitive.  We would like to see is as a support and acknowledgement that the education of over 16s is equally important as that of those under 16.  From my practice experience, the retention of young people after the junior certificate is not a priority.  They are not encouraged or supported to remain engaged, particularly if they are presenting with potentially troublesome behaviours.</p> <p>  In Blanchardstown, we have an early school leavers programme for those 12 to 15 year olds who, for whatever reason, are not able to remain in formal education.  They are presented with opportunities to improve literacy and numeracy, as well as to complete the junior certificate in a youth work setting.  They also receive a range of youth work interventions which look at personal effectiveness, ability to self-regulate and all of those issues which proved to be a problem for them in a mainstream school where they were one in 30.</p> <p>  In the case of over 16s in Dublin 15, they struggle to stay in education and identify pathways into employment.  Several years ago, the JobPath programme was developed.  I worked on the pilot scheme in Mulhuddart, which involved a group of young mothers between 18 and 21 years of age, none of whom had completed the junior certificate and four out of the five of them had been in care.  They were presenting with a wide range of issues.  They were a particularly passionate group and engaged fully with it.  It was that balance of practical skill, academic knowledge and youth work programmes, which look at confidence, efficacy and self-belief, that enabled those members to go out and look for further education and employment opportunities.</p> <p>  In the case of under sixes, based on my personal practice, youth work is best when it is seen as part of the continuum of care.  A young person does not come into existence at ten and fall off the planet at 21.  We have to work with service providers for children under ten and we must work with them after they reach 18 or 21 to successfully support those who are most vulnerable to be able to access further services.  Again, we will work closely with primary and post-primary home-school liaison officers.  Sometimes the home-school liaison officer is the right person to work with the parents.  Other times, youth work intervention is most appropriate.  Youth work is well placed to work with parents because we engage with them where they are, whether that requires sitting with them in their kitchen or talking to them at their door.  For some parents, who may have had a negative experience of education themselves, engaging with the youth worker can be seen as softer engagement piece.</p> <p>  On Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's request to meet young people, again in Blanchardstown, we can provide the committee with many opportunities to meet young people who are currently out of school and those who are still within formal education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Waters" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#N00800"><p>If one wants to work with people who have been failed by the system, one has to work differently and cannot impose the same.  We have a policy whereby our work starts with consultation.  The success of the young women's programme was that it emerged from a process of consultation about what they wanted and they needed.  It is the same as our young men's programme, which we have just initiated.  It is a consultation process that involves an outreach to people.  It is the co-creation of programmes that they believe will work successfully.</p><p>This works particularly well with young people but also older people.  Sometimes we get lost in speaking about young lone parents, young men and so on.  The vast majority of the 100,000 people who engage in community education are from disadvantaged communities and most of them are older.  A cohort of people aged 30 years and upwards are trying to find their way again.  In many ways, they are lost because they are not viewed as being a particular target group.  These are the people who are most likely to become actively engaged in their community and bring about the type of social change - the resilience - that is needed.</p><p> There is a serious issue with competition for resources.  It took 15 years in An Cos&aacute;n, with which I have been for 25 years, to let go of competitiveness and move into collaboration because I have seen the power of collaboration.  This is a long journey when one is fighting for such limited resources.  If anything comes out of this meeting, it will be the call to resource community education adequately and recognise independent community education organisations, which work not under SOLAS but collaboratively with SOLAS.  Core funding is needed if we are to be able to make the contribution we wish to make.  I want to be able to provide funding for lone parents, most of whom are young women, and the young men's programme, which is focused on developing social enterprise with young men aged between 18 and 30 years.  That is where we are, namely, pinching for bits and pieces, yet we know they will work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Dooley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#O00200"><p>I could listen to Ms Waters all day.  If nothing else comes out of this forum, it should be that her message would be taken on board.  Her many years of experience have shone through.  I was purposefully quiet because I am in awe of the experience of Ms Waters.  She said exactly what every rural community group represented by Irish Rural Link is saying, in particular, on reaching women in communities.  I am not being sexist.  A number of education and training boards do a wonderful job in terms of the courses, apprenticeships and training they provide.  However, there is a significant gap in society because many women of my age group and younger do not realise the benefits of returning to community education.  As the Chairman is aware, I have 25 or 30 years of experience in community education and as a former public representative.  None of this means anything unless one has a piece of paper or degree.  Community education instils in people a confidence and ability to find self-worth.  Even if they do not move into employment outside their community, they bring back to their local community expertise and experience.  Continued multi-annual funding for community education is the key to unlocking disadvantage.  When children see their mother or father returning to education, it instils in them a willingness to do better and remain in the education system.</p> <p>  I was envious of two of the other witnesses who arrived with cycling helmets as it occurred to me how nice it must be to be able to cycle to this meeting.  However, there is no point in lying because I probably would not cycle even if I was living close to the Oireachtas.  It calls to mind one of the major barriers in rural areas, namely, the lack of transport, especially affordable transport, to access community education facilities.  I fear that those of us who live in rural areas are facing a return to the 1980s when parents had to choose which of their children would go to third level education.  The costs involved are a serious barrier to people living in rural areas because all of the universities are located in cities.  While we have some wonderful institutes of technology on our doorsteps, if a child in a rural area aspires to attend university, his or her parents are forced to play God and choose which of their children they can afford to send to college.  I did not expect rural areas to return to the economic position in which we found ourselves in the 1980s but that has occurred.</p> <p>  Dr. John Cullinan in NUIG did a study recently with some of his colleagues which found that for every 10 km someone must travel to access a third level institution, the likelihood that he or she will go to college reduces by 2.7%.  When one translates this to a requirement to travel 50 km to third level college, the person will be 13.5% more likely not to go to third level.  We do not need this.</p> <p>  Dr. Bissett made a wonderful, passionate contribution and he is correct that people should not be geographically displaced or disadvantaged in education in any country.  In Japan, cost is not a factor in education and the country is considered to be the best educator in the world for this reason.  I acknowledge that Japan has a low level of third level participation for different reasons, but in terms of providing equal educational opportunity from birth until the end of second level, cost is not a factor.  It should not be a factor here.</p> <p>  I was surprised by a comment made by Deputy Martin on self-evaluation of teachers in the sector.  The Deputy is right that teachers' innovative and entrepreneurial spirt will be quashed if the work they are doing is not evaluated or valued in the educational system.  A report by the European Commission provides examples of measures aimed at preventing people from leaving school early.  Poland has a very good programme, known as the GOLDEN5, in which teachers engage in self-evaluation by choosing five or six ways to make the classroom more congenial and build better relationships.  A 16 week programme is then run in the school which selects students it believes would benefit from the programme.  GOLDEN5 has had tremendous outcomes and effects, not only for participating pupils but also for the teachers who see the positives and benefits of self-evaluation.</p> <p>  I referred to the task force in our submission.  Arising from today's meeting, I believe we must remove competition and have more cross-departmental and cross-agency support.  Solutions are available and we should remove competition and have everybody sit down and produce solutions for resolving the issue once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018020600002#O00300"><p>I will respond to a few points made by Deputy O'Sullivan.  In response to the Deputy's question as to what we can change to help the groups in question, I made a note that we must make higher education, further education, school, community education and informal education more accessible for people, whether in terms of travel, grades, online grades or physical access, and we must make education affordable.  In the case of the back to education programme, I wrote a document today in which I beg that students who are emerging from the leaving certificate applied programme and need to enter an access programme be given back to education support in a university access programme.  The reason is that the applied programme is not recognised under the back to education programme as a further education course.  While we may argue that the programme has benefits, they are extremely nuanced, complex and difficult to access.  We can have all the services we want but if somebody decides to change his or her life, we must be able to tell that person how it can be done and provide the money to support this decision.</p> <p>  People say there is no representative voice here.  I am a representative voice.  I grew up in a household that had nothing and I spent half my childhood visiting my dad in prison.  I am an early school leaver like all my family and my brother was imprisoned.  I could tell a sob story for hours but I am a voice.  I did not choose to go on in education because I did not have money or it was not accessible but because I did not know anyone else who had gone further and the option was not sold to me by anyone.  I was pushed to the back of the classroom because I was noisy and loud and told to told to shut up and be quiet and not to argue about the rules.  Many interventions could and did happen but the pivotal factor for me and many others is to have a meaningful relationship with an older person, either someone from one's community who has been successful - a mentor or role model who has been celebrated - or a teacher.</p><p> In the system we have at the moment, we do not recruit teachers for their love of the subject, or at least not all teachers.  Much of the time, teachers graduate with a maths or an English degree, wonder where they can work and decide to use their qualification in education.  I am not slagging all teachers off, because I love teachers.  My role at the moment is to diversify education.  However, having meaningful access to role models in our communities is most important, because that is the step up.  There are many programmes that do this.  It is not reinventing the wheel.</p><p> Reference was made to the Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, scheme.  I do not think we should cut the DEIS scheme.  That is not what I am saying.  The DEIS scheme should be extended.  I would not call it DEIS, because the word "disadvantage" is awful.  I would incentivise schools and call them "schools of distinction", because they are succeeding in a system in which they are placed right at the back.  They are losing the race before they have even started it.  I would flip the whole concept of DEIS if I had the opportunity.  It would still have the same resources and support, but I would add leadership and governance.  At this point, schools are autonomous within the terms of the DEIS plan.  They are allowed to make their own plans and decide what steps to implement, and at the end of the year they are assessed on what they have implemented.  Instead, the schools should be presented with a list of activities that are proven to work, as manifested in retentions, academic attainment, progression, and any other measure the Government wants to target.  If a school is suffering or not performing in these areas, management should be asked which of these initiatives to implement.  Schools should be offered more financial support and whatever else they need to implement those schemes.  My proposal is not to scrap DEIS, but rather to extend it.</p><p> A speaker referred to the stated views of teachers.  Where is the research on that element?  We assess DEIS in terms of literacy and maths.  Why not ask the children and get their reaction on record?  Are children saying that being at school makes them feel better?  That is an important message too.</p></speech>

Teachers are reporting it, and I am not saying it is not true.  However, we need evidence.  If children are happier in school, that is a metric in and of itself.  Maybe that is what we should be assessing in the DEIS plan, rather than the other outcomes, in order to determine whether it is successful.  At this point, I would contend that it is not succeeding according to its own aims.</p> <p>  Deputy McLoughlin has left, but he talked about the benefits of the DEIS plan for other students.  I know he is not here to respond but I hear this view sometimes when I deal with people in affluent situations.  I do not know how to say it without offending.  They ask about their own children and claim that it is unfair that the DEIS children get more.  They want the same resources for their own children.  My answer to that is that they already have it.  I wish they would shove off and get away from my resources.  Those parents probably have a great parents' council that will provide extra money if a letter is sent out.  Those better-off schools can use the model, which should be made public and shared with them.  I worry when that rhetoric is deployed, because I have heard it many times.  If more places are given to the poor children, what will happen to the children who are doing really well?  I echo Dr. Bissett's views.  We want to get rid of the idea of meritocracy.</p> <p>  I will finish with this point.  I do not want Dr. Bissett to think I am not on board with him, because I am.  Paulo Freire said that in order to change the oppressive system, one must infiltrate it, become part of it and learn its rules.   That is what I am trying to do; learn the rules and infiltrate the system.  However, I am on board with Dr. Bissett.  The whole system needs to change, and we need to remove the concept of meritocracy altogether.  However, that is probably never going to happen. </p></speech>

Exactly the same thing applies in the prison system.  The idea of peer-to-peer mentoring is so important.  I was also struck by how often everyone in the room mentioned their memory of a programme or pilot that really worked, or a programme that was funded for six years.  We need to look at data.  We must find the evidence for what works and continue to fund it.  Conversely, we must find the evidence for what does not work and stop funding it.  We must stop reinventing the wheel every five or ten years.  We must replicate the successful programmes.</p> <p>  My last point is in response to Deputy McLoughlin's question about how to deal with rehabilitated offenders.  My answer would be that, in the same way we should stop calling schools "disadvantaged", we must stop calling them "rehabilitated offenders" and start calling them our students, our employees and our colleagues. </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Ger Mitchell and Mr. Stephen Groarke, each of whom has attended previous meetings of the committee, together with Ms Breege Timoney and Mr. Greg O'Leary.</p> <p>  I know that each of the various bank executives who have appeared before the committee in the past two weeks begun with an apology.  I know that the committee has found the apologies to be wearing thin at times, but I must start in the same vein.  </p> <p>  Nobody goes to work to do harm to customers, but real harm was caused as a result of the errors and failures that happened at our bank, for which we are very sorry.  We are committed to doing better and working very hard to fix the situation.</p> <p>  Let me outline the current position.  When we talk about our work in this area, we talk about three separate but linked work programmes, namely, the 2015 PTSB-specific mortgage redress programme which focused on specific issues and which was conducted under the supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland; the programme set up under the product review group which we launched in late 2015 which focused initially on tracker mortgages; and the Central Bank of Ireland's industry-wide tracker examination programme.  Each of these programmes reviewed the management and administration of different categories of mortgage account in respect of entitlements to tracker mortgage products and inevitably the three programmes had a substantial overlap.</p> <p>  Through the programmes we have identified a total of 1,979 customer accounts which have been deemed to be "impacted".  A total of 1,374 of these accounts were identified under the mortgage redress programme in 2015; while 605 were identified under the Central Bank of Ireland's industry-wide tracker mortgage examination which included work commenced under the product review group.  Of course, like every other institution, our work in this area is subject to review by the Central Bank of Ireland and we are co-operating fully.</p> <p>  In the case of impacted accounts, all have now been offered redress and compensation.  The majority have accepted and received the payments.  We await acceptance of offers to complete payments for the residual number of customers.  Where accounts are still open, they are all on the correct tracker mortgage rate.  The majority were redressed and compensated in the second half of 2015.  The final letters were issued to the remaining customers in December 2017.  We acknowledge, of course, that some have chosen not to accept the payments offered.  However, as both the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland have recently confirmed to the committee, accepting the payments now will have no impact whatsoever on a customer's ability to appeal or challenge the amounts offered, if they consider that is appropriate.  As there is literally no downside to accepting the payments, I urge anyone who has yet to do so to accept them now.</p> <p>  The committee has, rightly, spent a lot of time in trying to understand how the problems occurred.  In the case of PTSB, the core problem was that we had not provided customers with full information when they asked us to break early from an agreed fixed rate, typically in 2008 and 2009.  When customers applied to break early, we did not tell them that a consequence of that request would be loss of an automatic entitlement to move to a tracker mortgage rate at the point when the fixed-rate term would otherwise have concluded had the customer not requested to break early.  We have found no evidence that this information was deliberately withheld.  However, we accept that we erred by not providing the right information, which is why, in the mortgage redress programme in 2015, we went back to each of the customers and worked out how much they would have saved had they moved to a tracker mortgage rate at the relevant time.  As a number of members of the committee have said in recent days, this was their own money and we have returned it to them with compensation.</p> <p>  The number of customers identified through the mortgage redress programme was 1,374 of the total of 1,979 impacted customers across all three programmes, or approximately 70%.  The bank's work under the mortgage redress programme identified certain other categories of customer whom we felt might have been disadvantaged for various unrelated issues - typically administrative errors.  In September 2015 the board initiated the product review group to review these additional issues and, on an ongoing basis, to monitor and deal with any other legacy issue we might find.  Given our experience on the tracker mortgage issue, I think this was and continues to be a prudent measure.</p> <p>  The number of impacted tracker rate mortgage customers identified by the product review group was 201 of the final 1,979, or approximately 10%.  As the product review group began its work in late 2015, the Central Bank of Ireland requested all banks to undertake a fuller examination of the issues related to tracker rate mortgages in their institutions.  This required us to identify any mortgage account that ever had an entitlement to a tracker mortgage rate or an entitlement to be offered one.  In addition, we had to consider how changes which could occur to a customer's mortgage throughout its duration might be related to their entitlement to a tracker mortage rate, including changes to repayment dates, the use of payment holidays, switches in or out of fixed rates and so on.  This required a review of the workings of 342,000 mortgages over a 12-year period.</p><p>They were reviewed according to a detailed framework required by the Central Bank of Ireland which considered both legal and regulatory requirements.  This took 24 months and involved close to 200 people.  At all times the work and analysis were subject to oversight by an external firm.  For the sake of completeness, this last element of the three work programmes, the Central Bank of Ireland industry-wide tracker examination, identified 404 of the 1,979 impacted accounts, or approximately 20%.</p><p> An issue which has received a lot of attention since the exercise began is that of the appropriate rate.  It concerns the actual tracker mortgage rate to which certain customers have been returned and, in particular, the margin above the European Central Bank, ECB, rate which has been applied to accounts.  To step back for one moment, what we are doing on the tracker mortgage issue is returning to people that which was theirs: first, the money we took from them that they would not have paid if we had not made our errors and, second, the option to move to a tracker mortgage rate that had been lost to them because of the errors.  The margin to which they could have returned, however, differs from account to account, depending on the particular contract a customer signed when commencing his or her mortgage or the conditions to which he or she agreed when commencing an agreed fixed rate term.</p><p> In many cases, the relevant documents set out a specific margin above the ECB rate that would apply to the tracker mortgage of which the account holders could avail at a future point in time.  Where that was the case, we have given all of the relevant customers a tracker mortgage rate with the specific margin applied.  For other account holders, however, the margin which would apply to the tracker mortgage to which they could move in the future was not specified in the originating documents.  That is similar to what happens today in the case of other mortgages.  For example, customers today move to a fixed rate for two, three or five years in the understanding they will move back to a variable rate when it ends without knowing what that rate will be.  Again, we have honoured the commitment to these customers in our redress and compensation programme.  The tracker mortgage rate to which they have been moved is the one for which they would have been eligible when their fixed rate term reached its scheduled end.  This is actually what was applied to customers in the same situation who did not break and, therefore, reached the agreed end date of their fixed rate term.  This is reflected in the wide range of margins, from 0.75% to 3.35% above the ECB rate.  The particular margin applied to a particular account depends on the date at which the fixed rate reaches its scheduled conclusion.</p><p> Our approach ensures consistency between customers who have a fixed rate maturing on the same date and who each have a commitment to an appropriate tracker mortgage rate.  If one customer stayed with the fixed rate term to conclusion, he or she moves to a tracker mortgage rate without disruption.  If a second customer broke early from the fixed rate term and was, therefore, incorrectly denied a tracker mortgage rate, we now give him or her the same tracker mortgage rate as the first, thereby applying consistency.</p><p> The other issue which has been discussed in detail is the overall attitude of the banks to tracker mortgages after the financial crash.  Again, I can only speak for Permanent TSB, but I have seen no evidence to date to support the assertion that the bank was deliberately acting against customers with tracker mortgage entitlements.  The following points are pertinent in that regard.  When the bank withdrew tracker mortgage products for new customers in 2008, we did not prevent existing customers from moving to where they were entitled and many did.  By way of example, 47% of the balance sheet of the bank was tracker mortgages on the day the product was withdrawn for new customers in 2008 and this figure grew to 54% by the end of that year as existing fixed rate customers continued to mature on to tracker mortgages.  The bank did not entice or encourage customers to apply to break early from their fixed rates.  Almost half of our mortgage customers continue to have tracker mortgage rates which have operated entirely normally.  In 2014, before the tracker mortgage issue exploded, my team had spent months developing and launching an innovative new product to help account holders to maintain their tracker mortgage, even where they had sold the underlying property and begun an entirely new mortgage on a new property.  Of course, the bank has offered over 30,000 long-term treatments to customers in mortgage difficulties.  For tracker mortgage customers, these treatments are constructed around the customer&rsquo;s pre-existing tracker mortgage conditions which we have not amended or removed.</p><p> This issue should never have arisen.  The errors and failings that lie at the heart of the mess should never have emerged to harm our customers and their families, but they did, sometimes in very distressing ways, for which we acknowledge our responsibility and apologise.  In response, we are undertaking, through the product review group, a forensic review of all of our products.  Of course, this review started with the tracker mortgage issue.  We have also taken unprecedented steps to avoid further damage to customers as a result of our failures.  We resourced our redress and compensation programmes to conclude as urgently as possible; restructured both our management team and the board to reflect a new focus on risk and governance; and continue to invest in product design and control.  Good banking should be at the very heart of Irish society.  We are committed to rebuilding the reputation of and trust in our profession.</p></speech>

To tease out the issue of the independent review panel which the bank set up, it hears cases in which there was a loss of ownership or the account holders were involved in legal proceedings at any stage.  In response to Question No. 28 in the questionnaire which the bank completed, it stated that in the case of 40 appeals which were upheld or partially upheld by the panel, the total additional compensation awarded was 285% of the initial compensation figure.  How many appeals in total were lodged with the independent review panel?</p></speech>

Perhaps I might ask Mr. Mitchell to help me.  To complete the picture for the Deputy, at the time of my last appearance before the committee the guidance was that we would have up to 32 cases involving loss of ownership.  I can confirm that in the end the number was 31.  Of these, 12 involved private dwelling homes and 19 buy-to-let properties.  I hope that gives the Deputy the final data point.  </p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Mitchell might address the issue of appeals.</p></speech>

In addition, the bank made available &euro;1,250 in legal expenses to customers.  That was an immediate payment on account to each of the customers affected.  Each of these customers was invited to take each individual case to the appeals panel to discuss and share with the panel the exact nature of what he or she lost.  The appeals panel adjudicated on each case.  The cases varied from person to person.  The bank put in place measures as part of the appeals process such that customers were returned and fully redressed any overpayments they made.  Any payments they made on any residual amount after they disposed of the properties were returned to the customers, as they should have been.  A designated account manager was appointed.  An allowance was made for the increase in valuation of each property.  We also made available a tracker mortgage to customers who wished to purchase a new property.  In some cases, we provided a 20% equity deposit.  Finally, any shortfall in that mortgage was written off.</p></speech>

It would allow the appeal to work through with each individual case because the value of properties would have been different.  The degree to which the detriment would have been incurred would have been different from customer to customer.  It was an initial holding payment for each customer.</p></speech>

That is the point I am getting at.  Why was that imposed in this case?  Why could the bank not have calculated in the first instance what customers were entitled to and make the best offer of redress and compensation in the first place?  These people lost their homes.  I imagine the appeals process went on for months and months in some cases.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that in 2015 we had the launch of the mortgage redress programme.  This was an integral part of the process.  It allowed an independent body of people &ndash; there were three independent people &ndash; that was separate from the bank to meet each customer and his or her advisers, as necessary, to make an independent decision proportionate to the detriment that the customer may have suffered.</p></speech>

That panel operated where a home was not lost or where the customer was not in legal proceedings with the bank.  To my knowledge, Permanent TSB is the only bank that has a nominee on one of these appeals panels.</p></speech>

We took the view that it was likely that there would be some complexity when we looked at the number of different customer types and product types that we had to review.  We took the view that having a customer representative on that panel was useful for the panel to make the right decision.  We were also cognisant that we wanted to avoid any belief that having a bank employee on the panel could disproportionately influence a decision.  I presume that is the basis of Deputy McGrath's point.  That is why it is a majority voting construct and the chairman has a casting vote.</p></speech>

What I will say is that the chairman of the customer accounts appeal has been clear that the bank representative has been invaluable to the panel, the person has been objective, and the person has been helpful in unpicking the complexity.  I have no wish to comment on design principles employed by the other banks.  I am comfortable that the panel retained objectivity at all times.</p></speech>

I am comfortable with the fact that it is independent as a panel.  I am also comfortable that if we look at the processes we go through and if the customer provides new information, then those panels absolutely retain their objectivity and, most important, understand the level of customer detriment that was caused as well as the bank's duty to make that right as well as it can.</p></speech>

The reply from the bank states that compensation is set at the higher of 10% of the redress amount or &euro;1,000.  In cases where the home was not lost or where the customer was not subject to legal proceedings by Permanent TSB, the cap was 10%.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

We would not have current accounts for probably over half of our mortgage base and, therefore, we would not be familiar with exactly where they were.  Hence, we set up the customer appeals panel.  As I mentioned, some 278 appeals were lodged.  The customer appeals panel found in favour of 34 cases.  The average redress for what has gone through is 26%.  That is the amount of redress paid out in compensation overall.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the case the Deputy mentions.  When the offers were made in 2015 - this is a 2015 case - customers had a choice to accept that, which they lost nothing by doing, taking it to the appeals panel, taking it to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, or in some cases going to the court.  The customer in this instance declined the offer, declined to go to the appeals panel and went directly to court.  The multiples that were mentioned are on the lower end, for the record.</p></speech>

We have been concerned to hear some solicitors argue that impacted account holders of any bank should not take any redress and compensation offers and instead should wait to make a court challenge.  On the basis, as Mr. Mitchell said, that there is a logical loop between the offer, the appeals panels, the FSO and into the courts, I am afraid that is nonsense advice and does no service to their clients.</p></speech>

It moved in conjunction with the increase in the cost of funds over that period.  It was based on the cost of funds available to PTSB over that time, but it changed from year to year.</p></speech>

The Deputy and I have discussed this issue on a number of occasions at the committee.  Obviously, the Deputy has made his position clear.  I make the following points to him.  First, the lodging of a Supreme Court appeal did not delay or change the resolution of these issues for the 1,979 impacted customers.  The majority of these customers received redress in 2015 under the mortgage redress programme, as I have outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#F04100"><p>Not only did it impact the number of customers Mr. Masding is talking about, but up to 30,000 customers were also impacted because of the Permanent TSB's selfish decision to appeal this to the Supreme Court because the Central Bank did not take action.  Representatives of the Central Bank have told the committee it could not take action because of a Supreme Court challenge.  Friends of mine and family members of mine, who were screwed over by banks and who were lodging appeals to the Financial Services Ombudsman, received the response that there was a case before the courts and they had to wait for that case to be dealt with.  That was Permanent TSB's case.  Not only did the bank's action impact on thousands of customers, it impacted on the lives of tens of thousands of customers who could not get redress at that point because Permanent TSB decided in its interest to appeal this to the Supreme Court.  Is that not the case?  Does Mr. Masding dispute what the representatives of the Central Bank said, that it could not initiate a wide-scale tracker rate mortgage examination because of the legal challenge by Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

The appeal involved four customers, as the Deputy will know.  We withdrew the appeal in February 2015 and within six months we had redressed 1,372 customers.</p> <p>  The appeal to the Supreme Court, as we have discussed before, was taken in response to a concern that a consequence of the High Court's decision involving those four customers would be fundamentally to change the level of advice that retail banks were required to provide when acting on customer requests.  After the Central Bank commenced its enforcement investigation, and following the Permanent TSB's detailed analysis, it became clear that we were dealing not with four customers, as the Deputy has said, but with a broad customer welfare issue.  That is why we withdrew our appeal and that is why, within six months, we had redressed 1,372 customers.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Masding accept that?  He will know that because in order for the customers to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman, they had to go through the bank's independent appeals process.  I have heard from those customers.  I have sat in their kitchens and listened to them.  The bank has recorded their telephone calls so it will know that the customers broke down.  The bank tried to take their homes from them at the same time as it was robbing them.</p></speech>

In his position, therefore, I absolutely respect the depth of his feelings.  However, as he has made the point very particularly about me, I would like to stand over the manner in which I have conducted myself throughout this exercise.  I was not working in Ireland when this problem was sown in Permanent TSB.  The Deputy has focused on one particular issue but I want to reference the following: the steps I took to end the appeal to the Supreme Court, once new information was given to me; ensuring the resources and supports necessary to have a successful and speedy conclusion in 2015 of the mortgage redress programme, which established the blueprint for how the industry has responded to the issue up to date; sponsoring the establishment of the product review group to rule out legacy issues; putting in place a pause on all legal actions being taken by the bank in respect of mortgage arrears, and in response the Deputy's point about the loss of ownership, we are the only bank that I am aware of that has done this; and ensuring the timely conclusion of the industry-wide tracker examination, as detailed this afternoon.  I am happy that my conduct is that becoming of a Permanent TSB CEO.  </p></speech>

I have nothing personal to say against him.  I passionately believe that until bankers are held individually to account for the actions that they have taken individually and collectively, this type of scandal will continue to present itself time and again.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the so-called systems error.  When an individual came off his or her fixed rate contract and when his or her contract stated very clearly in special condition No. 6 that he or she would roll back on to the tracker mortgage rate, where was the systems error?  The contract clearly states in black and white at special condition No. 6 that the customer will go back on to a tracker mortgage but that was denied by the bank.  Please explain where the systems error occurred.</p></speech>

It is absolutely clear that a bank has an obligation to explain to its customers the consequence of breaking early.  We did not pass that test and, hence, the reason the MRP was set up.</p></speech>

The contract at the time, to use the exact language, talked about the customer going back to the tracker rate at the expiry of the fixed rate period.  For customers who did not reach the expiry of the fixed rate period, the system defaulted them back to the variable rate rather than the tracker rate.  For a large proportion of this time the variable rate was a cheaper rate because the ECB rate was higher at that time.</p> <p>  In terms of customer service over the desk, it was not identified to people that that was a disadvantageous position.  The systems error was that we did not put in place warnings, which we should have done under the consumer protection code, that the position might reverse and the tracker rate could be a more favourable rate in future years.</p></speech>

As Mr. Groarke has outlined, customers were automatically put on the standard variable rate.  If a bank's customers repeatedly inform it about something, then the error should be corrected.  We would believe there was a systems error if the bank had corrected the error, but it did not do so.  Please explain why the matter was not corrected if the bank believed there was a systems error.  At some level in the bank, perhaps at board level, officials made the decision to do this.</p></speech>

The control that we should have had in the bank was to warn customers of the potential.  There was no deliberate decision that we have been able to identify.</p></speech>

Are the officials saying that it was the individual on the other end of the telephone call or the person who read the email who made the decision there and then?  Did the bank staff refer to some type of operations manual or bank policy on this issue?  I believe the bank made a deliberate decision to put customers who said they were caught in the so-called systems error automatically on the standard variable rate.  If so, then the bank is wrong and does not have a leg to stand on.</p></speech>

Due to the fact that the customer had not reached the expiry of a fixed rate period, he or she was not entitled to a tracker because he or she had broken early.  That was the nature of the appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman and the High Court until the appeal was withdrawn by more recent management.  The systems error was the absence of having the right controls in place to warn customers initially of the potential for the tracker rate to become more attractive than the variable rate and not to recheck the view of the contract right up to the point where it was being appealed in the courts.</p></speech>

That is superseded by a regulatory obligation under the consumer protection code to give them the right warnings.  In this case the regulatory obligation, under the consumer protection code, supersedes anything that is in the contract.</p></speech>

They were supposed to go through the independent appeals process but have not done so.  On the adjudications made by the independent appeals panel, the individuals concerned have walked away, on average, with 285% of the compensation figure.  Individuals who endured huge torture as a result of the activities of the bank have not appealed because the bank has put the onus on the victim to appeal.  It is supposed to do what is right.

How many of the 31 customers definitely received letters and definitely know that there is an offer of &euro;25,000 or &euro;50,000, depending on the type of mortgage involved, and that they have the right to appeal and are being encouraged to do so?</p></speech>

I stand by the approach of this management team to lead and complete a very intensive and complex tracker mortgage review, as soon as we understood the nature of the customer issue.  We might disagree on that.  I had 200 staff working on the tracker review for a period of more than two years, that is roughly 8% to 10% of the headcount.  We reviewed every mortgage account that we had.  I can stand over the governance of that programme.  It was "a separate line of business".  While we all will have views on who, what, why and where, as the Senator might expect, I will stick up for Permanent TSB's approach to redressing this.</p></speech>

Ms Kenny had an interest only mortgage of &euro;550,000, and it was a tracker mortgage if she wished, which was for the lifetime of the mortgage.  There was a top-up in 2006 of &euro;80,000, bringing the total mortgage of &euro;630,000.  The terms of the original mortgage of &euro;550,000 were completely rewritten.</p></speech>

Mr. Masding has stated the cases were not within the terms of the review.  How do we know that all affected customers have been contacted and included in the review?</p></speech>

One woman contacted the bank in October asking about the tracker review and eventually the bank acknowledged that she fell within its scope.

I have several letters like it where people have been refused that I could read out.  However, I do not want to use up my time on it.  This woman says, however, that she identified herself to the bank but that Permanent TSB was never in touch with her and that she is really concerned about it as it is likely there are other people who are not identified.

It is always a value judgment but we felt that we had a very high bar to meet in terms of our duty of care to those who had lost their homes and who were in "late legal" and that is why we did it.</p></speech>

I take that from the first letters, so there is a bit of a contradiction there.  I still do not understand the rationale for it.  The other thing I do not understand relates to the customer appeals panel.  The bank has a Permanent TSB representative on the panel.  There are three members on it.  Why is a Permanent TSB representative on it?  Why, as with other banks, is it not completely independent?</p></speech>

My understanding is that there was a variety of different contracts and there was not a hard cut-off between what we call the price promise and the appropriate rate.  Even within those types of contract, there were variations.  To my knowledge, there was no hard date before and after which we were offering different types of contracts.</p><p>I suggest we might come back with that detail because it is a more complex matter than the question assumes.</p></speech>

Every customer who had a specific margin in his or her contract has been reverted to that margin.  In terms of appropriate rate, through the exact datum we will get those through.  The Senator will recall that the financial world was in turmoil and the cost of the bank's funding changed over those periods.  Therefore, the margins changed.</p></speech>

The bank's hired hand called in to say that I was giving wrong information and asserted that the interviewer and I had made incorrect suggestions on this point in recent times.  I do not mind having a direct exchange with the bank here and I do not mind that exchange being robust, but I do take exception to a bank that is under this type of scrutiny sending out a sniper to take me out just because I was quoting the Minister's comments.  The bank would be better off if it took the money that it pays these firms to keep an eye on matters and applied it to its staff.  I did not like the attitude of the bank in that regard.  I certainly did not like the attitude of the individual who contacted RT&Eacute; and with whom I spoke later that morning.  I do not mind us having exchanges here, but I take exception to people trying to muddy the waters when they are not prepared to go on the same radio show as me to discuss the matter or defend their numbers or position.  It was a cowardly act.</p><p> I will turn to the matter of Permanent TSB's customers, who appeared before us.  Since they outlined their position to us, nothing seems to have happened in their cases.  The witnesses will not discuss individual cases, but these cases have been made public with the consent of the bank's customers.  I will, therefore, do as Senator O'Donnell suggested and give the witnesses the opportunity to respond directly to us regarding the customers whom they have heard giving outlines of their circumstances to this committee.  I will provide the information to the witnesses after the meeting to ensure that there are no crossed wires.</p><p> As Mr. Masding and Mr. Mitchell were speaking, the number of text messages that came through and their content told a story.  The banks have a way of using words at this committee.  They certainly have a way of painting a picture that gives the impression of everything being okay and they are on top of their game.  I use my time on this committee to try to bring them back to their customers.  What the witnesses said in their opening statement and in their answers to members' questions has caused outrage among many people.  For example, one texter wrote about being livid listening to "this rubbish" and that resistance was the position of the bank.  Something else that caused issue was Mr. Masding's standing by the approach of his team and how he stuck up for Permanent TSB.  His bank's customers are writing to us asking us to stand up for them because they believe that they are not being listened to.</p><p> Mr. Mitchell outlined what happened at oral hearings and so on.  Someone who attended an oral hearing today said that none of what he outlined was offered to him or her.  That person simply wants him to know that that is the case.  In a different situation involving a repossession, no money has been paid to the client.  That information was received during the course of this meeting.</p><p> I will turn to some of the other customers who have written to us.  I do not know how these loans were sanctioned.  When a mortgage was sanctioned in 2004, would the bank have asked about or insisted on mortgage protection?</p></speech>

The reason I am making this point is because Permanent TSB has not dealt fully with this individual.  That it would continue to write to his wife, who died three years earlier, shows that either Permanent TSB's records are not what they should be or it ignored the individual, who was suffering as a result of the loss of his wife, and pointed out when it did write that the lady who had died owed it &euro;358.  I find that outrageous, given what Permanent TSB is saying to others in this tracker debacle.  Is there no humanity or compassion in the bank?  What flexibility has it when dealing with tracker cases and others?  What flexibility has Mr. Masding to intervene and bring about a reasonable solution for a family that is under pressure?  What sort of oversight does he apply to such cases?</p></speech>

I have made that statement at every public event since 2015, including before going to the Minister, and I repeat that to the Chairman.</p> <p>  Second, on a separate point and I hope without causing confusion, since 2015 we have had 200 people out of a total staff population of just over 2,000 focusing on this work.  We looked at every single mortgage contract over a two and half year period.  Each of those customers and those contracts went through a set of gates to determine whether they were an impacted customer.  In Permanent TSB, that programme was done in a systematic fashion.</p> <p>  Third, and a point I must reiterate, we do not make payments to customers until they give us permission to do so because we are not allowed to do so.  We would encourage, as we do at all public events, anybody who has an offer to please send it back to us and we will make the payment.  As Mr. Groarke has said, that does not disallow the customer from going through the process of appeal, which includes our own appeals process, the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, and the courts.  Again, I commend to the committee members that if any of their constituents remain suspicious, as I am sure some of them will do, to please send the offer back.  We will make the payments and it does not deny any customer their right to avail of the appeals process.</p> <p>  In summary, we did harm, we apologise, and we tried to do the programme to the standards set by the Central Bank.  My comments about Permanent TSB were around the ways that we did the programme.  In terms of offers, I encourage all customers please to send back the offer so that we can make the payments.</p></speech>

We have been clear on the loss of ownership cases, for example, that we will write down any mortgage shortfall.  As the Chairman will know, we recently had an assisted voluntary sale programme in our buy-to-let book.  We received positive feedback from customers for giving them a way out, including writing off the shortfall.  We have a track record, I think, of being innovative in trying to help customers with their situations.  Again, I commend to the Chairman that the bank has the right mindset in terms of its customers.</p></speech>

That is the difficulty.  He just keeps on throwing out the same mantra to question after question.  I have asked him about humanity and compassion; I have asked him about everything.  As he has said himself, he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with everything that he is doing.  I must tell him that the bank's customers are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff that he is doing.  He seems to ignore that despite what he said in his opening statement.  That is the point I am trying to make continuously in relation to the treatment of the bank's customers.</p><p>The customer I referred to said:</p><blockquote>My personal view of this process is that it is just a joke and window dressing.  We got the same standard response that the bank thinks the overpayment did not have an impact on us.</blockquote> <p>The sum of &euro;60,000 represents their income for a year.  I do not think that Mr. Masding understands some of the bank's customers.  If it was not for this committee's hearings, he would never even listen to them at this depth.</p></speech>

It is fine that the processes are there, but why does Permanent TSB not act in an upfront way with them?  Why does it not try to remove the hardship they have experienced from their lives?  Why does the bank not live up to the witnesses' words?  There are very fine words in the opening statement.  However, the bank's actions, according to what I read in correspondence from its customers, is quite different.  Mr. Masding has to understand.  The customer whose words I have just read was overcharged by &euro;60,000.  That is a huge amount of money for anyone trying to rear a family, keep things together and contend with the various costs of living.  At the same time, they are being harassed by Mr. Masding's bank.  I do not think he understands that at all.</p> <p>   I have another piece of correspondence from a man who is trying to get redress, having tried before and been refused by Permanent TSB.  That is in spite of the letters he has received, which date back to 2006, stating that he could switch to a tracker or fixed rate mortgage at any time.  That is what this letter says.  It was still ruled that he had not been impacted.  </p> <p>  There are other pieces of correspondence here from the same gentleman.  It is the same story.  How can the bank use words as clear as those in a letter in 2006, and then deny this man the right to be considered as an impacted customer?  I just do not get it.  Again, I will pass the details of that case to the witnesses after this hearing.</p> <p>  This is not confined to just one or two cases.  These are only examples of correspondence.  I have done this with every single bank that has come before the committee, and the witnesses are no different from the rest.  Permanent TSB has robbed these customers, it has covered it up and it is attempting to do it again.  I am not talking about Mr. Masding personally.  However, the banking situation in this country, the attitude of the witnesses before this committee and what this process has highlighted leaves an awful lot to be desired. </p> <p>  I will return to the same point as before.  It is not acceptable.  If Mr. Masding does not understand the difficulties in people's lives, he should get somebody else to do so. Would he like to make any comment on any of that?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening remarks, my team and I will do all we can to try to rebuild that reputation and trust on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

He cannot be without some sort of humanity and compassion.  His every word, in the beginning of his statement and during the questioning, concerned rebuilding PTSB.  Does he know what he should do?  He should attempt to rebuild the lives that have been destroyed by PTSB.  That in itself would rebuild PTSB.  I do not see him doing that.  The customers that have written to me and other members of the committee are telling the truth.  They pour out their lives to us.  I cannot believe that Mr. Padraic Kissane has written to us again today, telling us that the Permanent TSB customers that appeared before this committee have still not been looked after.  They receive the standard reply saying that the rate they are on is the one to which they are contractually entitled.  Does Mr. Masding stand over all of that?</p></speech>

In view of that, does he think he is falling short of some standard that must exist in Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

This bank has not changed one single bit.  If it got the chance tomorrow it would do exactly the same thing.  I do not believe for one minute that it was a systems failure.  One bank's representatives came before the committee and told us that the tracker mortgages may have stopped because their bank was losing money on them.  In answer to Deputy Doherty, Mr. Masding continued to say that it was a systems failure.  He is the best company man that I have seen in here for a long time.  However, he is certainly not a friend of his customers.  I know I may be pushing the boat out here, but I am appealing to Mr. Masding and his colleagues to have some understanding of his customers and what they have gone through.  I appeal to him to apply some flexibility, understanding and compassion to their cases.  The witnesses' statement says it all, but the bank's actions are quite different.  If Permanent TSB acted in accordance with the words that used in the statement, we would probably not get these text messages and emails.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Masding engaged with Padraic Kissane?  I do not mean in his capacity as a representative of customers.  Has Mr. Masding chatted with him about the overall issues around the tracker mortgages?  Has Mr. Masding tried to learn anything from him, given that he is constantly named as the individual that knows most about these issues?</p></speech>

To date, 52 of the 58 customers have been fully redressed and compensated.  We make every effort to help these people, in so far as financial means can help these customers rebuild their lives.  We are in active engagement with-----</blockquote> <p>Mr. Mitchell was interrupted and when asked what that meant, he said: &quot;What it means in real terms for home owners is that there is a &euro;50,000 compensation payment immediately.&quot;  Did 58 individuals get this compensation and Permanent TSB has now figured out that actually it was only 31?  Where did the other 27 go?</p></speech>

We were the only bank running the programme.  At the time when the question was asked, we assumed that meant the stopping of the harm, the redress, the compensation, any appeals fees plus the staff costs.  That is what the &euro;80 million related to at the time.  Since then it has become clear that other banks are breaking it out differently.  In order to compare like with like, the &euro;57 million is the redress and compensation payment.</p></speech>

That included not just the redress and compensation but also the technology costs of having to build systems to go back and interrogate the mortgages over time; the staff costs, including having to get extra staff in from outside the bank; independent oversight; and the cost of running the appeals panels process.</p></speech>

Of that amount, &euro;45 million is the customer's own money back and of the other &euro;100 million it is costing the bank, &euro;12 million is in compensation to the customer.  Therefore &euro;88 million is going to advisers, bankers and whatnot.  Many people profited and unfortunately the customers got the raw deal here.  The money was taken from these customers and &euro;12 million goes to them in compensation while &euro;88 million goes to bankers, advisers, legal firms and all the rest.</p></speech>

We are talking about either the normal salaries of people who have been seconded into the programme or people we have had to get in from outside the bank or people we have had to get in to build the technology to run the programme or indeed to run the appeals processes.  We certainly would not like it to be held that in any way people have personally profited from this.</p></speech>

Why would the bank provision for existing staff costs?  Did it increase its complement of staff by 200?  I understand that it did not do so.  If it did not increase the complement of staff by 200, why would it have to make a provision for staff?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#S00300"><p>Sure.  The non-tracker question is a related one because the issue is who ultimately is paying for all of this.  I, therefore, want to raise the issue of mortgage pricing again with Mr. Masding.  I have put it to him before that his bank's mortgage rates are very high.  For a long time the bank was not offering a fixed-rate option to existing customers.  He committed to the committee that the bank would introduce one and it did, but it is not the same as that available to new customers.  For example, for an existing customer the two-year fixed rate is 4.2% while the two-year fixed rate for a new customer varies, depending on the loan-to-value ratio, from 3.2% to 3.6%.  That is up to 1% less.  No loan-to-value differentiation whatsoever is made for the existing customer on fixed rates.  That is clear discrimination against existing customers.  Similarly, as I understand it, Permanent TSB customers can revise their managed variable rate once and this can bring them to a rate of between 3.7% and 4.3%.  Therefore, the lowest managed variable rate an existing customer with Permanent TSB who has a low loan-to-value ratio can get is 3.7%.  The corresponding rate with AIB is 2.75%.</p><p>My point is that Permanent TSB's customers who are unable to switch, which could be for a whole host of reasons such as loss of employment, reduced income or change in family circumstances, are stuck.  They are stuck with Permanent TSB and they are goosed.  The bank is crucifying them with the interest rates it is charging.  When I look at the bank's most recent financial results for the half year to June 2017, the bank's wholesale funding costs were 0.08%, which is eight basis points, and its customer deposit pricing was 0.17%, which is 17 basis points, yet the bank is still charging some customers a managed variable rate of up to 4.3% and fixed rates of 4.2%.</p><p>The only reason existing Permanent TSB customers would not now switch is that they are stuck, and anyone who could should.  That is a pretty stark position for the bank to be in.  As a bank, it is marginally profitable and Mr. Masding might argue that mortgage pricing is as good as it gets and that the bank cannot do any better.  If that is the case, it raises more fundamental questions.  It is not good enough, however.  The bank continues to discriminate against its existing customers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>its new customers and overall its rates are way out of line with its cost of funds.  Its net interest margin has increased to 1.81%.  We will wait for the full year results, which will be released shortly, to get more detail on that.  It is a pretty grim picture for its mortgage customers, who are stuck with it, however.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Masding" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#S00400"><p>There are probably three elements to my answer.  First, the bank has had a track record in recent years of, within the boundaries on it, delivering attractive pricing, including reductions in its standard variable rate, SVR, its tracker mover products, and the introduction of the managed variable rate suite.  For that suite, there is a correlation between front book and back book pricing.  We have a track record of listening to stakeholders, including the committee.  The second thing I would say is that, within the constraints on me, I keep pricing under constant review.  I hear the Deputy's points and we will continue to review our pricing.  That is a commitment from me to the Deputy.  Third, as I have mentioned before, it is not just the cost of funds that goes into the pricing model.  There is also a cost of operations which, in banking, has increased in recent years.  This is due, in particular, to the fixed cost base.  There is the cost of risk and we have to take into account the past in our future cost of risk.  Further, the cost of capital is high in Ireland because of that past.  I would not want to argue with the Deputy about the cost of funds but the pricing of our mortgage has more than one dimension.  In summary, I hear what the Deputy is saying and, as always, respect his position.  I keep pricing under constant review, and perhaps the Deputy will give me the opportunity to continue to iterate the pricing as the bank's situation changes.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy McGrath's first question, I am advised that the number of non-customers is 329.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce the delegation from the bank.  I am accompanied by two senior members of the bank&rsquo;s management team, Ms Dara Deering, executive director retail banking, and Mr Barry D'Arcy, chief risk officer.  The committee will have received our written responses to the questionnaire.  With the agreement of the committee, I will proceed to read my opening statement, following which we will respond to any specific questions the committee would like to ask. </p> <p>  In our appearance before this committee on 28 September 2017, we were not in a position to provide the committee with the number of impacted mortgage accounts because we had not concluded our review and engagements with the Central Bank on a number of customer cohorts that we were investigating.  However, I told the committee then that I hoped and expected to be in a position to give it considerably more information when we met next.  Such disclosure has now been included in our completed questionnaire. </p> <p>  Since that meeting we have engaged with the Central Bank to conclude the identification phase of this review and we have fully understood the need to progress at pace for our customers.  We have endeavoured in all our assessments to understand the full customer journey, as conveyed by the facts and considerations of reasonable expectations, to determine if a customer or a group of customers should be or should have been on a tracker rate and, therefore, be considered as impacted and receive redress and compensation. </p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in late October following engagement with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank, the bank identified as impacted 417 mortgage accounts that should have been on a tracker rate or were on the incorrect tracker margin.  Redress and compensation payments to those customer accounts commenced in November 2017 and full payments have now been made to all those customers.</p> <p>  Following supervisory engagement and challenge from the Central Bank, the bank concluded its analysis on other customer cohorts in late December and confirmed in a public statement as of 20 December 2017 that a further group of approximately 2,557 mortgage accounts were identified as impacted for a variety of reasons.  This number includes approximately 1,907 mortgage accounts that up to July 2008 converted from a tracker rate to a fixed rate product post-drawdown, and ultimately rolled off to a non-tracker rate product.  The documentation and terminology was not clear for these customers.</p><p>This number also includes <i>circa</i>650 PDH mortgage accounts that were identified as impacted, as they related to new mortgage applicants in the period from November 2006 to February 2008 who had drawn down their mortgage on a fixed rate, with a roll-off to a standard variable rate.  While they were never on a tracker mortgage rate and did not have a contractual right to such a rate, the bank has decided to offer these PDH customers a tracker mortgage rate product if the account is still open.  <br/><br/>Overall, the bank has identified <i>circa</i>2,974 mortgage accounts as impacted as part of the tracker mortgage examination.  We have written to all of these customers to advise them that their individual mortgage account is being or will be reviewed, with a status update before the end of March, if the review is not completed.  If they are going through a legal enforcement process, this is put on hold.  If they are in the process of or considering selling or surrendering their property or applying for a form of debt resolution, we encourage them to discuss their options with their financial and-or legal advisers prior to committing.  <br/><br/>I reiterate my apologies to all impacted customers for the harm and distress caused by the bank's error or failure.  So far, it has made rate rectifications and redress and compensation payments to 501 customer accounts.  Furthermore, the remaining mortgage accounts will be restored to the correct tracker mortgage rate by the end of February, if the account is still open, and receive redress and compensation payments as soon as possible but no later than the end of June.  The bank has made a provision of &euro;120,300,000 to account for redress and compensation payable to the impacted accounts since the start of the examination.  In line with the tracker mortgage examination framework, it has established an independent appeals panel for customers who are not satisfied with the level of redress and compensation offered.<br/><br/>Regrettably, some customers have lost their homes or their investment properties as a result of not having been on a tracker mortgage rate.  So far, we have concluded that six customers lost their homes as a result of not being on a tracker mortgage rate.  We have also determined that 27 customers lost their buy-to-let properties for the same reason.  We expect this number to increase as the individual causation assessment and calculations are completed in the recently identified cases.  In determining causation, by which we mean establishing the link between the loss of ownership and the bank's error or failure, we have formulated our decision model to be as customer focused as we can in assessing these cases.  The question we have tried to answer is whether the customer could at the time under the most lenient restructuring arrangement available to them have managed to make his or her mortgage payments if he or she had been on a tracker mortgage rate.  If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, we conclude that he or she lost his or her property because of the bank's error or failure.<br/><br/>We appreciate that the financial compensation offered cannot compensate for the emotional stress caused by the loss of a home.  For this, I sincerely apologise once again.  We cannot undo what happened in the past, but we can provide for remediation and learn from mistakes.  The bank has conducted the review under the examination framework in the interests of achieving a fair outcome for customers, identifying circumstances where the interaction between the bank and customers has been seriously deficient or the handling of customer cases has not been of a standard required under the framework.  While taking into account its legal and contractual commitments in making its determinations, the bank's approach has been to ensure the balance of consideration is in favour of the customer.  As we restore impacted customers to the correct tracker mortgage rate, make redress and compensation payments, respond to customers' questions or requests and, ultimately, the facilitation of the independent appeals process, the bank shall maintain this approach.  <br/><br/>As a sector, financial institutions need to take meaningful incredible actions to regain the trust of all customers.  Since the events leading up to the review, the bank has strengthened processes and procedures that are supported by a strong and more robust regulatory environment.  We will continue to work towards the conclusion of the examination in all its facets.  The bank's parent, KBC Group, has also taken the review very seriously.  We are very supportive of the establishment of a banking standards board and an agenda to bring about cultural change in banking.<br/><br/>Mr. Deering, Mr. D'Arcy and I will respond to questions.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

However, it is clear from the case reviews we have conducted that a number of circumstances and practices were deficient, as I indicated in my opening statement, either in the correspondence to customers or the documentation used or other influencing factors.  That is next to a number of errors we have uncovered during our forensic review of cases.</p></speech>

Mr. Verbraeken has acknowledged that some customers were denied their legal contractual rights, but bankers are unwilling to say they broke the law.  Is it not fair to say they broke it?  Some customers had a legal contractual right to a tracker mortgage rate, but the bank did not provide it, for whatever reason, whether it was systems, information or any other excuse.  There was a legal right to a tracker mortgage rate, but the bank denied it to some customers.  Why is Mr. Verbraeken not comfortable in saying this?  AIB stated it.  It told us that there were cases in the bank in which it was very clear, written in black and white, customers had legal rights and that the bank had denied them these rights.</p></speech>

The close to 3,000 mortgage accounts we have identified as impacted constitute a minority, but obviously any case in that category is one too many.</p><p>I agree with that.</p></speech>

More than 40 such cases were brought to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO.  In all but two cases, the bank's position was upheld at the time by the ombudsman, who indicated that the documentation we used was clear and unambiguous, that the bank had not failed in its duty to bring key features to the attention of the customer, and that the bank did not disguise important information.  That was found at the time.  Today we have found differently and we now consider that cohort to have been impacted.</p></speech>

What does Mr. Verbraeken have to say to them in respect of these eight years?

Ulster Bank is one of the outliers, but KBC takes the main prize.  It is the worst in terms of both redress and compensation and in putting customers back onto their tracker rates.  We are talking about fine language but, as we speak, the bank is automatically deducting money it is not entitled to from its own customers' accounts every single month.  There are still 2,500 customers on the wrong rate.  I am a customer of KBC, my mortgage payment goes out at the start of the month.  I am not an impacted customer, but if I was, on the first Monday of this month KBC would have stolen money from my account that it is legally not entitled to, despite the fact that it has known for quite some time that what it is doing to these 2,500 customers is wrong.  How can Mr. Verbraeken justify that?</p></speech>

They will be restored to their correct rates by the end of this month.  To clarify the rationale or reason 2,500 customers are still on the wrong rate, the process we went through with the Central Bank stretched all the way into December 2017 when we reached a final determination about all the customers and cohorts that were considered to be impacted.   That is when we started the process of writing to all of these customers, which happened at the beginning of January 2018.  They will be put on the right rate within two months and they will be redressed and compensated within six months.</p></speech>

This process continued through the second half of 2017 and we concluded it in December 2017, having reached a position in which there was no further dispute between the bank and the Central Bank on any cohorts.</p></speech>

Is that the reason, in reality, if we cut out the rest of it, the bank is so far behind the rest of them?</p></speech>

We had a different perspective on certain customer journeys.  I clarified, for instance, with regard to the customer journey the Deputy referred to, that we had on file findings by the FSO in the bank's favour which would have strengthened that position.</p></speech>

How did the bank compensate individuals where there was a loss of the home with regard to the six family homes and 27 buy-to-lets?  What is the compensation process for them?</p></speech>

For an owner-occupied property, the offer to the customer would be a &euro;50,000 lump sum payment.  There would be compensation for the uplift in value of the property between the time of repossession or sale of the property and the time of compensation.  There would be a write-off of all residual mortgage balances.  There would be a compensation for the future value of a tracker unless that same customer took up our offer of a new mortgage loan on a tracker rate.  We would also offer them legal fees to the extent of &euro;2,000 or other reasonable vouched fees that they spent.</p></speech>

Has the bank thought about it?  Has it thought about the impact of having to tell one's children the bank is taking one's home and of packing up the toys and moving to a different area?  Many people feel shame as a result of that.  Irish people are very proud.  How does the bank gauge all of that and put a value on it?</p></speech>

We appreciate and acknowledge that but we have to address, with the means we have today, the situation these customers are in and offer them compensation.  Of the six owner-occupied properties that were lost as a result of the bank's error and failure, we still have five in our possession.  As part of the redress and compensation engagement we have with these customers, whom we have contacted specifically and personally, we will offer them their homes back.</p></speech>

The home would be offered back with the reduced mortgage loan on a tracker so they would be in a similar position as customers who lost their property outright.  There is an equivalence of value that we offer to a customer where we still possess the property.</p></speech>

They will take out a mortgage with KBC to get their home back.  It did not answer the question.  Perhaps it did answer the question because the bank is looking at it very much in financial terms and considering the uplift and so on.  All of that has to be done.  In the scenario I put to Mr. Verbraeken, what price does he put on having to go in and tell the children they are leaving the house and packing up and maybe having to go into rental accommodation?  Some value has to be put on it.  There is no way that any type of money can undo the harm the bank has caused those people.  The bank has obviously made some calculation somewhere so what is it?  Has the bank actually engaged with the six customers to find out the impact?  Has the bank asked them to submit a victim impact statement?  I asked the banks to do this a year ago.  If we were in court, that is what would happen.  It would show how it impacted on the customer.  Has the bank looked at that?</p></speech>

I fully agree with the Deputy that any financial compensation or value offered would not compensate for the harm done.  We would prefer not to be in a position of having any cases where a loss of property has occurred.  We believe the process we are going through with these customers is to some extent showing we are trying to do the right thing by them given where we are today and the findings we have come to in recent in months.</p></speech>

They are individuals who took out mortgages in the period of November 2006 to February 2008.  Can Mr. Verbraeken explain to the committee why the bank has chosen those dates?  I raised this over a year and a half ago with the bank.  I presume it is to do with the advertisement and the leaflet that was being bandied about by all the brokers which said that customers would roll on to a tracker rate at the end of the fixed-rate period.  I have numerous letters from customers of the bank who were given the same type of commitment and were aware of the flyer but who were not deemed impacted.  I will give Mr. Verbraeken an example of a person who applied for the mortgage in August 2006.  In January 2007, the person finalised and decided to fix the rate but were deemed by the bank not to have been impacted.  It is the same commitment.  I presume that is the reason the 650 homes were deemed impacted.  Can Mr. Verbraeken elaborate on that?</p></speech>

We welcome all customers who believe they have evidence that we did not consider to come forward.  I welcome the same in this case.  The 650 customers relate to new owner-occupied, PDH, customers who applied for their mortgages between November 2006 and February 2008.  That coincides with a period when the bank had issued a communication to its intermediaries, the brokers, which are governed by their own specific regulatory context, for a product that was specific to new owner-occupied, PDH, customers which meant they started on a fixed rate and rolled off to a tracker.</p><p>We have decided, based on the review we conducted on the period right up to December 2017, that the 650 customers who signed loan agreements to start on a fixed rate and roll off to a standard variable rate should have had the customer journey of a fixed rate rolling off to a tracker, as did 90% of all new PDH applicants who applied in the window of time in question.  More than 6,000 cases originated through the broker network in the window during which the broker communication was valid rolled, as intended by the bank, from a fixed rate to a tracker.  The 650 cases signed a loan agreement based on moving from a fixed rate to a standard variable rate.  We have decided, as a matter of policy, to offer these customers a tracker rate and to offer redress and compensation.</p></speech>

They do not make a final decision until they make a final decision.  Therefore, an inducement whereby one may move to a tracker rate at the end of the two-year fixed term has an influence.  If I received a letter of offer from KBC Bank but had not decided on that bank and my broker advised me I would roll on to a tracker mortgage, I would sign even though my application preceded the advice.  Surely to God it would be deemed an influencing factor.</p></speech>

Mr. Verbraeken is saying the policy is that someone who was told by his broker that he would roll on to a tracker after taking out a mortgage with KBC Bank, which would involve a final letter, should not be deemed impacted.  Surely to God it had an influence.  The bank needs to revisit this policy.  It will force victims to go to the bank, through the internal appeals process and to the FSPO.  This is an obvious matter.  If before signing up with the bank one's broker is saying one will roll on to a tracker, it is obviously an influencing factor.  How could it not be?</p></speech>

I will continue with Deputy Pearse Doherty's line of questioning.  I am conscious that people who are directly affected are watching.  Members will have received correspondence in this regard.</p> <p>  Let me tease out the issue a little further.  The 650 PDH mortgage accounts that Mr. Verbraeken identified as being affected relate to new applications.  He deemed the application date to be the cut-off point.  The period in question is from November 2006 to November 2008.  The customers started out on a fixed rate, with a roll-off to a standard variable rate.  They were never on a tracker rate.  Is it correct that the relevance of the dates is based on the existence of a flyer that the brokers were using to market and promote the product?</p></speech>

Obviously, these relate to the cut-off date or dates either side of that.  One customer said they met their broker in February 2008 to discuss the options and the broker produced the KBC Bank flyer, making it clear that the customer could roll on to a tracker on expiry.  The customer placed a lot of emphasis on that advice.  My correspondence does not state when the customer applied for a mortgage but they signed off on it in early May 2008 and drew the first payment down in early June 2008.  They say the flyer with the tracker option was pivotal in the making of their decision.  Clearly, it was not communicated to them between February and May that the flyer had been revoked.  Is it true that KBC Bank was offering a tracker mortgage up to 4 July 2008?</p></speech>

If the customer in question applied after April 2008, the bank would not have had any tracker product, never mind a fixed tracker product, for example.  As Mr. Verbraeken said, we tried to take a policy decision considering where we believe the flyer might have been used in conversations.  Obviously, we cannot rule out where it was or was not used.</p><p>We believe, however, that it is most appropriate and reasonable to expect that it may have been used as part of the sales process and that is why we have taken an application date.  There may be some cases around the edges, and clearly we will look at them on an individual basis, but the policy is to apply it where we believe it is most reasonable and consistent from a consumer perspective.  As with the other 90% of customers who went from a fixed rate to a tracker, we have applied the same criteria to these customers who went from a fixed rate to a standard variable rate. </p></speech>

They challenge that KBC has used the application as the cut off.  They make the legitimate point that it is not complete until fully signed and reviewed by all parties, legal advice is sought and when the mortgage is executed.  If it was within the window during which this flyer was in circulation, then I believe they have a very arguable case that they should be included.  The bank, however, has taken a different view.</p></speech>

In October, KBC revised down the 490 customers to the 417 mortgage accounts.  This was the very first group that had been identified as not rolling on to a tracker rate after a fixed rate period or were moved off their tracker rate following a change to the terms of their loan or were on the incorrect tracker margin.  Were those cases clear cut?  They had a contractual entitlement to a tracker rate at a particular margin, or at least an entitlement to be offered such a tracker.</p></speech>

The large majority, 358 cases, were cases that had been on a tracker rate and then had an agreed change to their mortgage contract in the sense they went on to an interest-only period, and ultimately they rolled off to a variable rate.  In October, we determined that the terminology used in the instruction letter for the interest-only period could have been confusing as to its intent and that the customer may have reasonably expected to return to a tracker rate.  Although the correspondence stated, in most cases, that the customer would move to a variable rate, we determined that it was not clear to the customer-----</p></speech>

These customers had originated on a tracker rate or before moving to the fixed rate they were on a tracker rate.  They rolled off to a standard variable rate but after a review, we ultimately took the decision that they had potentially not fully aware they were giving up their tracker rate by entering the fixed rate.</p></speech>

With the agreement of the Central Bank we commenced redress and compensation in November.

We are not doing average or prevailing rates.  Second, we have to set the loan back up as a tracker, because it now tracks ECB.  That process is to make sure the calculation is correct on a go-forward basis.  That is the basis on which we then calculate redress.  There are two stages in a process involving someone who makes and someone who validates the change.</p></speech>

There are several steps in the process.  One is to go through all the original contracts to make sure the customer gets the original rate and then, second, to do the calculations.  I assure the Deputy if we could have done it in early January it would be done by now.  We are doing it as fast as is practicable, while also ensuring that we meet our customer obligations in terms of getting payments out to customers who also have been impacted by this.</p></speech>

We have concluded that phase of the review with the Central Bank in the sense that there is an agreement with the Central Bank on those cohorts but we continue to perform quality control and quality assurance and we are still going through various cases.  As we indicated earlier, we invited certain customers to submit to us the relevant information or evidence to verify whether their case would be impacted.  We are not closing the identification phase of the examination.  This is ongoing.  We are trying to redress and compensate all customers we have identified.  We are not finished.  We expect that the additional cases will be individual cases with circumstances that were not captured by some other cause.</p></speech>

We would not have given the commitment we have made publicly and also to each customer in restoring him or her to the correct rate and paying the redress and compensation due by the timelines indicated, if we did not believe we could deliver on it.

I have received an email from a customer who was impacted on to the tune of &euro;500 per month in the nine-year timeframe, which means that he was overcharged by a considerable amount.  This customer has still not resolved the issues involved with the bank.  He has been trying desperately to have the matter sorted because it is having an ongoing impact on him.  For someone like him, the timelines appear to be too far down the line.  It is important that cases such as this be concluded early.  The individual in question has been in contact with the bank dating back to the beginning of the discovery of the error.  It is not a source of great comfort for this customer that the issue is being dragged out and remains unresolved.  The last letter he received on 5 January was the standard one.  He is seeking the support of the committee to bring his case to an early conclusion and highlight his poor customer experience with the bank.  I am informing Mr. Verbraeken of the content of the email.</p></speech>

I draw lessons at a macro and a micro level.  At the micro level within the bank, 90% correct is not good enough.  Very often we have failed to be precise in our communication and correspondence on the clarification we have provided for customers and need to bring it up to a higher standard.  I believe the processes we have put in place to date in the bank will help us to achieve that standard.  At a macro level, I understand there was a lot of competition in the years leading up to the financial crisis and this event.  I believe lenders did not consider the potential long-term impact of new products such as tracker mortgage rates on their customers.  They should learn the lessons of designing and managing products which have the potential to have a very negative impact on customers in the long run.</p></speech>

There is a need to exercise some flexibility and the bank should look at how many individual cases are involved.  It is important to do so before there is another row about the matter.  In line with the opening statement we have heard, the bank should give some relief to these people.  It is clear from some of the letters I have received that they took legal advice but it took time to sign contracts.  None of us can calculate the impact the November 2006 flyer had when it came into play.  We do not know how it would have affected their view of things going forward into the future.  The bank needs to be flexible in its approach to this issue.</p></speech>

The repayments the bank was seeking were just under &euro;1,500 per month.  The correct tracker rate was 1% so the repayment the bank should have sought was &euro;970.  Based on our affordability assessment of this customer, who was in financial distress, they could afford to pay just under &euro;490.  We then look at what was the lowest restructuring or resolution option which we could have offered to a distressed customer at that time.  We do not look at what their tracker mortgage should have been but we assess what we would have offered to this distressed customer, which was a 50-50 split mortgage, meaning their repayment would have been &euro;368.  In this case, the customer's affordability was greater than the lowest restructure option we had and we deem that they could have afforded that.  Causation for loss of ownership in this case was, therefore, that of the bank.</p></speech>

We determine the point at which we would have made a decision on the outcome of the case, in this case March 2014.  We would have had all the information at that time and we consider whether, had the customer been on a tracker at the right rate, and bearing in mind the lowest restructure rate and the lowest repayment, they would have had the affordability to meet that payment.  We should have offered the customer that lowest repayment option so the decision to determine the mortgage as unsustainable was incorrect on the part of the bank.

KBC has made the commitment to the committee.  I appreciate that but it is an absolute disgrace that KBC has so many customers not on the right tracker rate.  While it has made a commitment to this committee, it has not done so to the 2,500 impacted customers.  It wrote to them on 5 January stating clearly that if the bank had not concluded a review of the customer's mortgage account before the end of March 2018, it would provide them with a further status update at that stage.  Why did KBC not tell them they would put them back on the proper rate at the end of month?</p></speech>

As soon as we concluded the review, which we did on 20 December, and we made a statement about impacted customers, our first priority was to make sure those customers knew they were impacted.  Our second priority is around getting the payments out for the customers who had been identified back in October.  That has been done.  The third priority was to move towards how quickly we could get these accounts back on a rate.  The quickest we can get them is by the end of February at the latest.  Clearly, customers are talking to us every day.  That is part of the ongoing engagement.</p></speech>

However, it does not have the decency to tell its customers.  There are no ifs or buts about it.  That is completely and utterly wrong.  We are trying to hold the banks accountable for Irish citizens.  We are trying to force the banks to change their culture and give people back their money.  As much as giving them back their money, the banks should also give them respect.  It is nothing personal but it is Ms Deering's name on the letters.</p></speech>

However, we are trying to manage customer expectations.  Customers are massively frustrated by the length of time this is taking.  I am not trying to exacerbate this problem.  On 5 January, when we issued those letters, we were not in a position to make a categorical confirmation to customers that they would be back on the correct rate by the end of February.  I did not want, therefore, to exacerbate the already high levels of frustration for customers because, naturally, for many of those customers, we had only deemed them to have been impacted in December.  We thought the best next step for those customers would be to say they are impacted.  As their rates are rectified, they get communications from the bank.  We understand the frustration.  That is why we said initially that we would try to have communication by the end of March, which is in the letter to which the Deputy is referring.  Since then, we have put all efforts into getting those customers back on their rate for the end of February.  At least, their repayments are lower going forward, recognising the payment of redress and compensation will continue to the end of June.</p></speech>

In that timeframe, we are trying to get the operational process in place so they can be put back on the right rate.  As mentioned earlier, we are trying to identify what is the actual rate they should be moved to.  We are in the process of finalising that, transferring it to our operations teams to ensure they can move into a space where they can make a change and the customer restored to the appropriate rate.  That will happen in the month of February.</p></speech>

If it is a subsequent letter, will they go out in a batch in June?  Can KBC give the committee any targets as to what it is planning to hit in March, April, May and June?</p></speech>

To give an example, we are planning to redress 350 customer accounts in the month of February.  This number will increase in March and April.  This is not a matter of postponing everything until June for the accounts which are still open.  As we mentioned earlier about 600 are no longer open, meaning they would not be part of the rate rectification process but part of the redress and compensation scheme.</p></speech>
