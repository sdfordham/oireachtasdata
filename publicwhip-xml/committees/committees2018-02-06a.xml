I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Ger Mitchell and Mr. Stephen Groarke, each of whom has attended previous meetings of the committee, together with Ms Breege Timoney and Mr. Greg O'Leary.</p> <p>  I know that each of the various bank executives who have appeared before the committee in the past two weeks begun with an apology.  I know that the committee has found the apologies to be wearing thin at times, but I must start in the same vein.  </p> <p>  Nobody goes to work to do harm to customers, but real harm was caused as a result of the errors and failures that happened at our bank, for which we are very sorry.  We are committed to doing better and working very hard to fix the situation.</p> <p>  Let me outline the current position.  When we talk about our work in this area, we talk about three separate but linked work programmes, namely, the 2015 PTSB-specific mortgage redress programme which focused on specific issues and which was conducted under the supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland; the programme set up under the product review group which we launched in late 2015 which focused initially on tracker mortgages; and the Central Bank of Ireland's industry-wide tracker examination programme.  Each of these programmes reviewed the management and administration of different categories of mortgage account in respect of entitlements to tracker mortgage products and inevitably the three programmes had a substantial overlap.</p> <p>  Through the programmes we have identified a total of 1,979 customer accounts which have been deemed to be "impacted".  A total of 1,374 of these accounts were identified under the mortgage redress programme in 2015; while 605 were identified under the Central Bank of Ireland's industry-wide tracker mortgage examination which included work commenced under the product review group.  Of course, like every other institution, our work in this area is subject to review by the Central Bank of Ireland and we are co-operating fully.</p> <p>  In the case of impacted accounts, all have now been offered redress and compensation.  The majority have accepted and received the payments.  We await acceptance of offers to complete payments for the residual number of customers.  Where accounts are still open, they are all on the correct tracker mortgage rate.  The majority were redressed and compensated in the second half of 2015.  The final letters were issued to the remaining customers in December 2017.  We acknowledge, of course, that some have chosen not to accept the payments offered.  However, as both the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland have recently confirmed to the committee, accepting the payments now will have no impact whatsoever on a customer's ability to appeal or challenge the amounts offered, if they consider that is appropriate.  As there is literally no downside to accepting the payments, I urge anyone who has yet to do so to accept them now.</p> <p>  The committee has, rightly, spent a lot of time in trying to understand how the problems occurred.  In the case of PTSB, the core problem was that we had not provided customers with full information when they asked us to break early from an agreed fixed rate, typically in 2008 and 2009.  When customers applied to break early, we did not tell them that a consequence of that request would be loss of an automatic entitlement to move to a tracker mortgage rate at the point when the fixed-rate term would otherwise have concluded had the customer not requested to break early.  We have found no evidence that this information was deliberately withheld.  However, we accept that we erred by not providing the right information, which is why, in the mortgage redress programme in 2015, we went back to each of the customers and worked out how much they would have saved had they moved to a tracker mortgage rate at the relevant time.  As a number of members of the committee have said in recent days, this was their own money and we have returned it to them with compensation.</p> <p>  The number of customers identified through the mortgage redress programme was 1,374 of the total of 1,979 impacted customers across all three programmes, or approximately 70%.  The bank's work under the mortgage redress programme identified certain other categories of customer whom we felt might have been disadvantaged for various unrelated issues - typically administrative errors.  In September 2015 the board initiated the product review group to review these additional issues and, on an ongoing basis, to monitor and deal with any other legacy issue we might find.  Given our experience on the tracker mortgage issue, I think this was and continues to be a prudent measure.</p> <p>  The number of impacted tracker rate mortgage customers identified by the product review group was 201 of the final 1,979, or approximately 10%.  As the product review group began its work in late 2015, the Central Bank of Ireland requested all banks to undertake a fuller examination of the issues related to tracker rate mortgages in their institutions.  This required us to identify any mortgage account that ever had an entitlement to a tracker mortgage rate or an entitlement to be offered one.  In addition, we had to consider how changes which could occur to a customer's mortgage throughout its duration might be related to their entitlement to a tracker mortage rate, including changes to repayment dates, the use of payment holidays, switches in or out of fixed rates and so on.  This required a review of the workings of 342,000 mortgages over a 12-year period.</p><p>They were reviewed according to a detailed framework required by the Central Bank of Ireland which considered both legal and regulatory requirements.  This took 24 months and involved close to 200 people.  At all times the work and analysis were subject to oversight by an external firm.  For the sake of completeness, this last element of the three work programmes, the Central Bank of Ireland industry-wide tracker examination, identified 404 of the 1,979 impacted accounts, or approximately 20%.</p><p> An issue which has received a lot of attention since the exercise began is that of the appropriate rate.  It concerns the actual tracker mortgage rate to which certain customers have been returned and, in particular, the margin above the European Central Bank, ECB, rate which has been applied to accounts.  To step back for one moment, what we are doing on the tracker mortgage issue is returning to people that which was theirs: first, the money we took from them that they would not have paid if we had not made our errors and, second, the option to move to a tracker mortgage rate that had been lost to them because of the errors.  The margin to which they could have returned, however, differs from account to account, depending on the particular contract a customer signed when commencing his or her mortgage or the conditions to which he or she agreed when commencing an agreed fixed rate term.</p><p> In many cases, the relevant documents set out a specific margin above the ECB rate that would apply to the tracker mortgage of which the account holders could avail at a future point in time.  Where that was the case, we have given all of the relevant customers a tracker mortgage rate with the specific margin applied.  For other account holders, however, the margin which would apply to the tracker mortgage to which they could move in the future was not specified in the originating documents.  That is similar to what happens today in the case of other mortgages.  For example, customers today move to a fixed rate for two, three or five years in the understanding they will move back to a variable rate when it ends without knowing what that rate will be.  Again, we have honoured the commitment to these customers in our redress and compensation programme.  The tracker mortgage rate to which they have been moved is the one for which they would have been eligible when their fixed rate term reached its scheduled end.  This is actually what was applied to customers in the same situation who did not break and, therefore, reached the agreed end date of their fixed rate term.  This is reflected in the wide range of margins, from 0.75% to 3.35% above the ECB rate.  The particular margin applied to a particular account depends on the date at which the fixed rate reaches its scheduled conclusion.</p><p> Our approach ensures consistency between customers who have a fixed rate maturing on the same date and who each have a commitment to an appropriate tracker mortgage rate.  If one customer stayed with the fixed rate term to conclusion, he or she moves to a tracker mortgage rate without disruption.  If a second customer broke early from the fixed rate term and was, therefore, incorrectly denied a tracker mortgage rate, we now give him or her the same tracker mortgage rate as the first, thereby applying consistency.</p><p> The other issue which has been discussed in detail is the overall attitude of the banks to tracker mortgages after the financial crash.  Again, I can only speak for Permanent TSB, but I have seen no evidence to date to support the assertion that the bank was deliberately acting against customers with tracker mortgage entitlements.  The following points are pertinent in that regard.  When the bank withdrew tracker mortgage products for new customers in 2008, we did not prevent existing customers from moving to where they were entitled and many did.  By way of example, 47% of the balance sheet of the bank was tracker mortgages on the day the product was withdrawn for new customers in 2008 and this figure grew to 54% by the end of that year as existing fixed rate customers continued to mature on to tracker mortgages.  The bank did not entice or encourage customers to apply to break early from their fixed rates.  Almost half of our mortgage customers continue to have tracker mortgage rates which have operated entirely normally.  In 2014, before the tracker mortgage issue exploded, my team had spent months developing and launching an innovative new product to help account holders to maintain their tracker mortgage, even where they had sold the underlying property and begun an entirely new mortgage on a new property.  Of course, the bank has offered over 30,000 long-term treatments to customers in mortgage difficulties.  For tracker mortgage customers, these treatments are constructed around the customer&rsquo;s pre-existing tracker mortgage conditions which we have not amended or removed.</p><p> This issue should never have arisen.  The errors and failings that lie at the heart of the mess should never have emerged to harm our customers and their families, but they did, sometimes in very distressing ways, for which we acknowledge our responsibility and apologise.  In response, we are undertaking, through the product review group, a forensic review of all of our products.  Of course, this review started with the tracker mortgage issue.  We have also taken unprecedented steps to avoid further damage to customers as a result of our failures.  We resourced our redress and compensation programmes to conclude as urgently as possible; restructured both our management team and the board to reflect a new focus on risk and governance; and continue to invest in product design and control.  Good banking should be at the very heart of Irish society.  We are committed to rebuilding the reputation of and trust in our profession.</p></speech>

To tease out the issue of the independent review panel which the bank set up, it hears cases in which there was a loss of ownership or the account holders were involved in legal proceedings at any stage.  In response to Question No. 28 in the questionnaire which the bank completed, it stated that in the case of 40 appeals which were upheld or partially upheld by the panel, the total additional compensation awarded was 285% of the initial compensation figure.  How many appeals in total were lodged with the independent review panel?</p></speech>

Perhaps I might ask Mr. Mitchell to help me.  To complete the picture for the Deputy, at the time of my last appearance before the committee the guidance was that we would have up to 32 cases involving loss of ownership.  I can confirm that in the end the number was 31.  Of these, 12 involved private dwelling homes and 19 buy-to-let properties.  I hope that gives the Deputy the final data point.  </p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Mitchell might address the issue of appeals.</p></speech>

Of these, 74 have been upheld in favour of the customer, or approximately 28%.  Forty of the appeals were made to the independent review panel and 34 to the customer appeals panel.</p></speech>

Each of these customers was invited to take each individual case to the appeals panel to discuss and share with the panel the exact nature of what he or she lost.  The appeals panel adjudicated on each case.  The cases varied from person to person.  The bank put in place measures as part of the appeals process such that customers were returned and fully redressed any overpayments they made.  Any payments they made on any residual amount after they disposed of the properties were returned to the customers, as they should have been.  A designated account manager was appointed.  An allowance was made for the increase in valuation of each property.  We also made available a tracker mortgage to customers who wished to purchase a new property.  In some cases, we provided a 20% equity deposit.  Finally, any shortfall in that mortgage was written off.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Mitchell saying it was always the case that the person in each of those instances was going to go to appeal?  Is that the point?</p></speech>

We were very upfront.  We took the view that those customers deserved to get more of a payment.  That is why the specialist independent review panel was created.</p></speech>

Any customer who lost a buy-to-let property was paid &euro;25,000 in a down payment initially.  That was a holding position to allow customers time to lodge the appeal and put them in funds.  It would allow the appeal to work through with each individual case because the value of properties would have been different.  The degree to which the detriment would have been incurred would have been different from customer to customer.  It was an initial holding payment for each customer.</p></speech>

It was an integral part of the process.  Every case where the home was lost was going to end up in this review panel.</p></speech>

One panel was set up for customers who did not lose the home or property and for customers who were not at an advanced stage of the legal process.  The cap for that customer appeals panel was &euro;35,000.  That panel could refer difficult cases to the independent review panel, which was set up separately.  The independent review panel has an autonomous threshold of up to &euro;250,000 to make awards to customers.</p></speech>

That is the point I am getting at.  Why was that imposed in this case?  Why could the bank not have calculated in the first instance what customers were entitled to and make the best offer of redress and compensation in the first place?  These people lost their homes.  I imagine the appeals process went on for months and months in some cases.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that in 2015 we had the launch of the mortgage redress programme.  This was an integral part of the process.  It allowed an independent body of people &ndash; there were three independent people &ndash; that was separate from the bank to meet each customer and his or her advisers, as necessary, to make an independent decision proportionate to the detriment that the customer may have suffered.</p></speech>

That panel operated where a home was not lost or where the customer was not in legal proceedings with the bank.  To my knowledge, Permanent TSB is the only bank that has a nominee on one of these appeals panels.</p></speech>

We took the view that it was likely that there would be some complexity when we looked at the number of different customer types and product types that we had to review.  We took the view that having a customer representative on that panel was useful for the panel to make the right decision.  We were also cognisant that we wanted to avoid any belief that having a bank employee on the panel could disproportionately influence a decision.  I presume that is the basis of Deputy McGrath's point.  That is why it is a majority voting construct and the chairman has a casting vote.</p></speech>

What I will say is that the chairman of the customer accounts appeal has been clear that the bank representative has been invaluable to the panel, the person has been objective, and the person has been helpful in unpicking the complexity.  I have no wish to comment on design principles employed by the other banks.  I am comfortable that the panel retained objectivity at all times.</p></speech>

I am comfortable with the fact that it is independent as a panel.  I am also comfortable that if we look at the processes we go through and if the customer provides new information, then those panels absolutely retain their objectivity and, most important, understand the level of customer detriment that was caused as well as the bank's duty to make that right as well as it can.</p></speech>

The reply from the bank states that compensation is set at the higher of 10% of the redress amount or &euro;1,000.  In cases where the home was not lost or where the customer was not subject to legal proceedings by Permanent TSB, the cap was 10%.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

We would not have current accounts for probably over half of our mortgage base and, therefore, we would not be familiar with exactly where they were.  Hence, we set up the customer appeals panel.  As I mentioned, some 278 appeals were lodged.  The customer appeals panel found in favour of 34 cases.  The average redress for what has gone through is 26%.  That is the amount of redress paid out in compensation overall.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the case the Deputy mentions.  When the offers were made in 2015 - this is a 2015 case - customers had a choice to accept that, which they lost nothing by doing, taking it to the appeals panel, taking it to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, or in some cases going to the court.  The customer in this instance declined the offer, declined to go to the appeals panel and went directly to court.  The multiples that were mentioned are on the lower end, for the record.</p></speech>

We have been concerned to hear some solicitors argue that impacted account holders of any bank should not take any redress and compensation offers and instead should wait to make a court challenge.  On the basis, as Mr. Mitchell said, that there is a logical loop between the offer, the appeals panels, the FSO and into the courts, I am afraid that is nonsense advice and does no service to their clients.</p></speech>

I do not have it with me.  The point of principle I am making is that we have been going at this since 2015.  We have a process and I would encourage the customers to work with us and in particular to take their redress and compensation payments.  There is no downside to doing that for them.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy is aware of another bank with a similar situation.  In PTSB the rate was calculated across a number of years in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  It moved in conjunction with the increase in the cost of funds over that period.  It was based on the cost of funds available to PTSB over that time, but it changed from year to year.</p></speech>

The Deputy and I have discussed this issue on a number of occasions at the committee.  Obviously, the Deputy has made his position clear.  I make the following points to him.  First, the lodging of a Supreme Court appeal did not delay or change the resolution of these issues for the 1,979 impacted customers.  The majority of these customers received redress in 2015 under the mortgage redress programme, as I have outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#F04100"><p>Not only did it impact the number of customers Mr. Masding is talking about, but up to 30,000 customers were also impacted because of the Permanent TSB's selfish decision to appeal this to the Supreme Court because the Central Bank did not take action.  Representatives of the Central Bank have told the committee it could not take action because of a Supreme Court challenge.  Friends of mine and family members of mine, who were screwed over by banks and who were lodging appeals to the Financial Services Ombudsman, received the response that there was a case before the courts and they had to wait for that case to be dealt with.  That was Permanent TSB's case.  Not only did the bank's action impact on thousands of customers, it impacted on the lives of tens of thousands of customers who could not get redress at that point because Permanent TSB decided in its interest to appeal this to the Supreme Court.  Is that not the case?  Does Mr. Masding dispute what the representatives of the Central Bank said, that it could not initiate a wide-scale tracker rate mortgage examination because of the legal challenge by Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

The appeal involved four customers, as the Deputy will know.  We withdrew the appeal in February 2015 and within six months we had redressed 1,372 customers.</p> <p>  The appeal to the Supreme Court, as we have discussed before, was taken in response to a concern that a consequence of the High Court's decision involving those four customers would be fundamentally to change the level of advice that retail banks were required to provide when acting on customer requests.  After the Central Bank commenced its enforcement investigation, and following the Permanent TSB's detailed analysis, it became clear that we were dealing not with four customers, as the Deputy has said, but with a broad customer welfare issue.  That is why we withdrew our appeal and that is why, within six months, we had redressed 1,372 customers.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Masding accept that?  He will know that because in order for the customers to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman, they had to go through the bank's independent appeals process.  I have heard from those customers.  I have sat in their kitchens and listened to them.  The bank has recorded their telephone calls so it will know that the customers broke down.  The bank tried to take their homes from them at the same time as it was robbing them.</p></speech>

In his position, therefore, I absolutely respect the depth of his feelings.  However, as he has made the point very particularly about me, I would like to stand over the manner in which I have conducted myself throughout this exercise.  I was not working in Ireland when this problem was sown in Permanent TSB.  The Deputy has focused on one particular issue but I want to reference the following: the steps I took to end the appeal to the Supreme Court, once new information was given to me; ensuring the resources and supports necessary to have a successful and speedy conclusion in 2015 of the mortgage redress programme, which established the blueprint for how the industry has responded to the issue up to date; sponsoring the establishment of the product review group to rule out legacy issues; putting in place a pause on all legal actions being taken by the bank in respect of mortgage arrears, and in response the Deputy's point about the loss of ownership, we are the only bank that I am aware of that has done this; and ensuring the timely conclusion of the industry-wide tracker examination, as detailed this afternoon.  I am happy that my conduct is that becoming of a Permanent TSB CEO.  </p></speech>

I have nothing personal to say against him.  I passionately believe that until bankers are held individually to account for the actions that they have taken individually and collectively, this type of scandal will continue to present itself time and again.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the so-called systems error.  When an individual came off his or her fixed rate contract and when his or her contract stated very clearly in special condition No. 6 that he or she would roll back on to the tracker mortgage rate, where was the systems error?  The contract clearly states in black and white at special condition No. 6 that the customer will go back on to a tracker mortgage but that was denied by the bank.  Please explain where the systems error occurred.</p></speech>

It is absolutely clear that a bank has an obligation to explain to its customers the consequence of breaking early.  We did not pass that test and, hence, the reason the MRP was set up.</p></speech>

The contract at the time, to use the exact language, talked about the customer going back to the tracker rate at the expiry of the fixed rate period.  For customers who did not reach the expiry of the fixed rate period, the system defaulted them back to the variable rate rather than the tracker rate.  For a large proportion of this time the variable rate was a cheaper rate because the ECB rate was higher at that time.</p> <p>  In terms of customer service over the desk, it was not identified to people that that was a disadvantageous position.  The systems error was that we did not put in place warnings, which we should have done under the consumer protection code, that the position might reverse and the tracker rate could be a more favourable rate in future years.</p></speech>

As Mr. Groarke has outlined, customers were automatically put on the standard variable rate.  If a bank's customers repeatedly inform it about something, then the error should be corrected.  We would believe there was a systems error if the bank had corrected the error, but it did not do so.  Please explain why the matter was not corrected if the bank believed there was a systems error.  At some level in the bank, perhaps at board level, officials made the decision to do this.</p></speech>

The control that we should have had in the bank was to warn customers of the potential.  There was no deliberate decision that we have been able to identify.</p></speech>

Are the officials saying that it was the individual on the other end of the telephone call or the person who read the email who made the decision there and then?  Did the bank staff refer to some type of operations manual or bank policy on this issue?  I believe the bank made a deliberate decision to put customers who said they were caught in the so-called systems error automatically on the standard variable rate.  If so, then the bank is wrong and does not have a leg to stand on.</p></speech>

Due to the fact that the customer had not reached the expiry of a fixed rate period, he or she was not entitled to a tracker because he or she had broken early.  That was the nature of the appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman and the High Court until the appeal was withdrawn by more recent management.  The systems error was the absence of having the right controls in place to warn customers initially of the potential for the tracker rate to become more attractive than the variable rate and not to recheck the view of the contract right up to the point where it was being appealed in the courts.</p></speech>

That is superseded by a regulatory obligation under the consumer protection code to give them the right warnings.  In this case the regulatory obligation, under the consumer protection code, supersedes anything that is in the contract.</p></speech>

This is scandalous.  There is a problem with how they designed the process.  Outside the fact that many of their customers believe the other process is rigged and that they have not got a fair hearing, with regard to those who lost their homes, the delegates contend that the figure was &euro;50,000.  They were supposed to go through the independent appeals process but have not done so.  On the adjudications made by the independent appeals panel, the individuals concerned have walked away, on average, with 285% of the compensation figure.  Individuals who endured huge torture as a result of the activities of the bank have not appealed because the bank has put the onus on the victim to appeal.  It is supposed to do what is right.  What has it been doing in the past two years or so to make sure people get what they deserve?</p></speech>

With how many of the 31 customers can the delegates categorically tell the committee that the bank has been in contact?  This is not rocket science.  If the bank was looking for a payment, someone would be knocking on the bloody door or waiting on the other side of the hedge.  I have received letters from people who have been harassed on the telephone by Permanent TSB staff while watching their grandchildren play football because they are in arrears as a result of the bank's actions on tracker mortgages.  How many of the 31 customers definitely received letters and definitely know that there is an offer of &euro;25,000 or &euro;50,000, depending on the type of mortgage involved, and that they have the right to appeal and are being encouraged to do so?</p></speech>

It was around 6 p.m.  All I could do was take her call and put her in contact with somebody I knew as an adviser dealing with Permanent TSB.

I stand by the approach of this management team to lead and complete a very intensive and complex tracker mortgage review, as soon as we understood the nature of the customer issue.  We might disagree on that.  I had 200 staff working on the tracker review for a period of more than two years, that is roughly 8% to 10% of the headcount.  We reviewed every mortgage account that we had.  I can stand over the governance of that programme.  It was "a separate line of business".

Ms Marian Kenny, 2 Gosworth Park, Castle Park Road, Dalkey, a customer of Permanent TSB has written to the committee, allowing us to use her details.  Mr. Padraic Kissane would have written to Mr. Masding on 31 October 2017.  Mr. John Mason would have replied to Mr. Kissane on 8 November 2017.  Ms Kenny had an interest only mortgage of &euro;550,000, and it was a tracker mortgage if she wished, which was for the lifetime of the mortgage.  There was a top-up in 2006 of &euro;80,000, bringing the total mortgage of &euro;630,000.  The terms of the original mortgage of &euro;550,000 were completely rewritten.</p></speech>

The focus was on the balance of 33,500 customers who may have switched at some stage during their mortgage or there may have been a margin deviation at some stage during their mortgage.</p></speech>

My time is very limited.  I wish to seek assurances for people who have had Permanent TSB mortgages that they have been included in the review or do they need to get out their contracts and do a review themselves?

We have conducted that review for 31,500 customers of the 33,500 and everything followed exactly as it should have.  Effectively in the review we conducted, there was a core team, an independent decision forum team, an independent steering group and all of that was overseen by KPMG.

One woman contacted the bank in October asking about the tracker review and eventually the bank acknowledged that she fell within its scope.  Had she not contacted it, however, her case would never have been examined.  Given that some people were only included because they went to the bank, how can Mr. Mitchell be sure that the bank has completed the process?  I want an answer for that woman.</p></speech>

I have several letters like it where people have been refused that I could read out.  However, I do not want to use up my time on it.  This woman says, however, that she identified herself to the bank but that Permanent TSB was never in touch with her and that she is really concerned about it as it is likely there are other people who are not identified.  That really concerns me.  It is as if the bank is presenting a picture of "nothing to see here, the shop is closed" and that is it.</p></speech>

I take that from the first letters, so there is a bit of a contradiction there.  I still do not understand the rationale for it.  The other thing I do not understand relates to the customer appeals panel.  The bank has a Permanent TSB representative on the panel.  There are three members on it.  Why is a Permanent TSB representative on it?  Why, as with other banks, is it not completely independent?</p></speech>

My understanding is that there was a variety of different contracts and there was not a hard cut-off between what we call the price promise and the appropriate rate.  Even within those types of contract, there were variations.  To my knowledge, there was no hard date before and after which we were offering different types of contracts.</p><p>I suggest we might come back with that detail because it is a more complex matter than the question assumes.</p></speech>

Every customer who had a specific margin in his or her contract has been reverted to that margin.  In terms of appropriate rate, through the exact datum we will get those through.  The Senator will recall that the financial world was in turmoil and the cost of the bank's funding changed over those periods.  Therefore, the margins changed.</p></speech>

The bank's hired hand called in to say that I was giving wrong information and asserted that the interviewer and I had made incorrect suggestions on this point in recent times.  I do not mind having a direct exchange with the bank here and I do not mind that exchange being robust, but I do take exception to a bank that is under this type of scrutiny sending out a sniper to take me out just because I was quoting the Minister's comments.  The bank would be better off if it took the money that it pays these firms to keep an eye on matters and applied it to its staff.  I did not like the attitude of the bank in that regard.  I certainly did not like the attitude of the individual who contacted RT&Eacute; and with whom I spoke later that morning.  I do not mind us having exchanges here, but I take exception to people trying to muddy the waters when they are not prepared to go on the same radio show as me to discuss the matter or defend their numbers or position.  It was a cowardly act.</p><p> I will turn to the matter of Permanent TSB's customers, who appeared before us.  Since they outlined their position to us, nothing seems to have happened in their cases.  The witnesses will not discuss individual cases, but these cases have been made public with the consent of the bank's customers.  I will, therefore, do as Senator O'Donnell suggested and give the witnesses the opportunity to respond directly to us regarding the customers whom they have heard giving outlines of their circumstances to this committee.  I will provide the information to the witnesses after the meeting to ensure that there are no crossed wires.</p><p> As Mr. Masding and Mr. Mitchell were speaking, the number of text messages that came through and their content told a story.  The banks have a way of using words at this committee.  They certainly have a way of painting a picture that gives the impression of everything being okay and they are on top of their game.  I use my time on this committee to try to bring them back to their customers.  What the witnesses said in their opening statement and in their answers to members' questions has caused outrage among many people.  For example, one texter wrote about being livid listening to "this rubbish" and that resistance was the position of the bank.  Something else that caused issue was Mr. Masding's standing by the approach of his team and how he stuck up for Permanent TSB.  His bank's customers are writing to us asking us to stand up for them because they believe that they are not being listened to.</p><p> Mr. Mitchell outlined what happened at oral hearings and so on.  Someone who attended an oral hearing today said that none of what he outlined was offered to him or her.  That person simply wants him to know that that is the case.  In a different situation involving a repossession, no money has been paid to the client.  That information was received during the course of this meeting.</p><p> I will turn to some of the other customers who have written to us.  I do not know how these loans were sanctioned.  When a mortgage was sanctioned in 2004, would the bank have asked about or insisted on mortgage protection?</p></speech>

The reason I am making this point is because Permanent TSB has not dealt fully with this individual.  That it would continue to write to his wife, who died three years earlier, shows that either Permanent TSB's records are not what they should be or it ignored the individual, who was suffering as a result of the loss of his wife, and pointed out when it did write that the lady who had died owed it &euro;358.  I find that outrageous, given what Permanent TSB is saying to others in this tracker debacle.  Is there no humanity or compassion in the bank?  What flexibility has it when dealing with tracker cases and others?  What flexibility has Mr. Masding to intervene and bring about a reasonable solution for a family that is under pressure?  What sort of oversight does he apply to such cases?</p></speech>

I have made that statement at every public event since 2015, including before going to the Minister, and I repeat that to the Chairman.</p> <p>  Second, on a separate point and I hope without causing confusion, since 2015 we have had 200 people out of a total staff population of just over 2,000 focusing on this work.  We looked at every single mortgage contract over a two and half year period.  Each of those customers and those contracts went through a set of gates to determine whether they were an impacted customer.  In Permanent TSB, that programme was done in a systematic fashion.</p> <p>  Third, and a point I must reiterate, we do not make payments to customers until they give us permission to do so because we are not allowed to do so.  We would encourage, as we do at all public events, anybody who has an offer to please send it back to us and we will make the payment.  As Mr. Groarke has said, that does not disallow the customer from going through the process of appeal, which includes our own appeals process, the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, and the courts.  Again, I commend to the committee members that if any of their constituents remain suspicious, as I am sure some of them will do, to please send the offer back.  We will make the payments and it does not deny any customer their right to avail of the appeals process.</p> <p>  In summary, we did harm, we apologise, and we tried to do the programme to the standards set by the Central Bank.  My comments about Permanent TSB were around the ways that we did the programme.  In terms of offers, I encourage all customers please to send back the offer so that we can make the payments.</p></speech>

We have been clear on the loss of ownership cases, for example, that we will write down any mortgage shortfall.  As the Chairman will know, we recently had an assisted voluntary sale programme in our buy-to-let book.  We received positive feedback from customers for giving them a way out, including writing off the shortfall.  We have a track record, I think, of being innovative in trying to help customers with their situations.  Again, I commend to the Chairman that the bank has the right mindset in terms of its customers.</p></speech>

If we have warehoused part of the mortgage, where we charge 0% and do not look for a repayment until maturity for that portion of the mortgage, to the extent that we have overcharged the customer, typically the warehoused portion would have been smaller than we made it and that is part of applying the correction that we have to make.</p></speech>

Should the bank not wait for the appeals process or the process entered into by the customer to finish before it takes money and puts it back into an account?  The customers have been deprived of the appropriate rate and product, and their lives have been affected.  Mr. Masding has decided for the bank to keep that money, or part of it, before the process has been completed.  He has no difficulty cold-heartedly taking that money and putting it off another amount.</p></speech>

That is the difficulty.  He just keeps on throwing out the same mantra to question after question.  I have asked him about humanity and compassion; I have asked him about everything.  As he has said himself, he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with everything that he is doing.  I must tell him that the bank's customers are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff that he is doing.  He seems to ignore that despite what he said in his opening statement.  That is the point I am trying to make continuously in relation to the treatment of the bank's customers.</p><p>The customer I referred to said:</p><blockquote>My personal view of this process is that it is just a joke and window dressing.  We got the same standard response that the bank thinks the overpayment did not have an impact on us.</blockquote> <p>The sum of &euro;60,000 represents their income for a year.  I do not think that Mr. Masding understands some of the bank's customers.  If it was not for this committee's hearings, he would never even listen to them at this depth.</p></speech>

It is fine that the processes are there, but why does Permanent TSB not act in an upfront way with them?  Why does it not try to remove the hardship they have experienced from their lives?  Why does the bank not live up to the witnesses' words?  There are very fine words in the opening statement.  However, the bank's actions, according to what I read in correspondence from its customers, is quite different.  Mr. Masding has to understand.  The customer whose words I have just read was overcharged by &euro;60,000.  That is a huge amount of money for anyone trying to rear a family, keep things together and contend with the various costs of living.  At the same time, they are being harassed by Mr. Masding's bank.  I do not think he understands that at all.</p> <p>   I have another piece of correspondence from a man who is trying to get redress, having tried before and been refused by Permanent TSB.  That is in spite of the letters he has received, which date back to 2006, stating that he could switch to a tracker or fixed rate mortgage at any time.  That is what this letter says.  It was still ruled that he had not been impacted.  </p> <p>  There are other pieces of correspondence here from the same gentleman.  It is the same story.  How can the bank use words as clear as those in a letter in 2006, and then deny this man the right to be considered as an impacted customer?  I just do not get it.  Again, I will pass the details of that case to the witnesses after this hearing.</p> <p>  This is not confined to just one or two cases.  These are only examples of correspondence.  I have done this with every single bank that has come before the committee, and the witnesses are no different from the rest.  Permanent TSB has robbed these customers, it has covered it up and it is attempting to do it again.  I am not talking about Mr. Masding personally.  However, the banking situation in this country, the attitude of the witnesses before this committee and what this process has highlighted leaves an awful lot to be desired. </p> <p>  I will return to the same point as before.  It is not acceptable.  If Mr. Masding does not understand the difficulties in people's lives, he should get somebody else to do so. Would he like to make any comment on any of that?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening remarks, my team and I will do all we can to try to rebuild that reputation and trust on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

He cannot be without some sort of humanity and compassion.  His every word, in the beginning of his statement and during the questioning, concerned rebuilding PTSB.  Does he know what he should do?  He should attempt to rebuild the lives that have been destroyed by PTSB.  That in itself would rebuild PTSB.  I do not see him doing that.  The customers that have written to me and other members of the committee are telling the truth.  They pour out their lives to us.  I cannot believe that Mr. Padraic Kissane has written to us again today, telling us that the Permanent TSB customers that appeared before this committee have still not been looked after.  They receive the standard reply saying that the rate they are on is the one to which they are contractually entitled.  Does Mr. Masding stand over all of that?</p></speech>

How would he apply that standard to these customers?  Take what I have read out, and what Mr. Padraic Kissane has said, as being true.  In view of that, does he think he is falling short of some standard that must exist in Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

This bank has not changed one single bit.  If it got the chance tomorrow it would do exactly the same thing.  I do not believe for one minute that it was a systems failure.  One bank's representatives came before the committee and told us that the tracker mortgages may have stopped because their bank was losing money on them.  In answer to Deputy Doherty, Mr. Masding continued to say that it was a systems failure.  He is the best company man that I have seen in here for a long time.  However, he is certainly not a friend of his customers.  I know I may be pushing the boat out here, but I am appealing to Mr. Masding and his colleagues to have some understanding of his customers and what they have gone through.  I appeal to him to apply some flexibility, understanding and compassion to their cases.  The witnesses' statement says it all, but the bank's actions are quite different.  If Permanent TSB acted in accordance with the words that used in the statement, we would probably not get these text messages and emails.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Masding engaged with Padraic Kissane?  I do not mean in his capacity as a representative of customers.  Has Mr. Masding chatted with him about the overall issues around the tracker mortgages?  Has Mr. Masding tried to learn anything from him, given that he is constantly named as the individual that knows most about these issues?</p></speech>

At the time when the question was asked, we assumed that meant the stopping of the harm, the redress, the compensation, any appeals fees plus the staff costs.  That is what the &euro;80 million related to at the time.  Since then it has become clear that other banks are breaking it out differently.  In order to compare like with like, the &euro;57 million is the redress and compensation payment.</p></speech>

Of that amount, &euro;45 million is the customer's own money back and of the other &euro;100 million it is costing the bank, &euro;12 million is in compensation to the customer.  Therefore &euro;88 million is going to advisers, bankers and whatnot.  Many people profited and unfortunately the customers got the raw deal here.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#S00300"><p>Sure.  The non-tracker question is a related one because the issue is who ultimately is paying for all of this.  I, therefore, want to raise the issue of mortgage pricing again with Mr. Masding.  I have put it to him before that his bank's mortgage rates are very high.  For a long time the bank was not offering a fixed-rate option to existing customers.  He committed to the committee that the bank would introduce one and it did, but it is not the same as that available to new customers.  For example, for an existing customer the two-year fixed rate is 4.2% while the two-year fixed rate for a new customer varies, depending on the loan-to-value ratio, from 3.2% to 3.6%.  That is up to 1% less.  No loan-to-value differentiation whatsoever is made for the existing customer on fixed rates.  That is clear discrimination against existing customers.  Similarly, as I understand it, Permanent TSB customers can revise their managed variable rate once and this can bring them to a rate of between 3.7% and 4.3%.  Therefore, the lowest managed variable rate an existing customer with Permanent TSB who has a low loan-to-value ratio can get is 3.7%.  The corresponding rate with AIB is 2.75%.</p><p>My point is that Permanent TSB's customers who are unable to switch, which could be for a whole host of reasons such as loss of employment, reduced income or change in family circumstances, are stuck.  They are stuck with Permanent TSB and they are goosed.  The bank is crucifying them with the interest rates it is charging.  When I look at the bank's most recent financial results for the half year to June 2017, the bank's wholesale funding costs were 0.08%, which is eight basis points, and its customer deposit pricing was 0.17%, which is 17 basis points, yet the bank is still charging some customers a managed variable rate of up to 4.3% and fixed rates of 4.2%.</p><p>The only reason existing Permanent TSB customers would not now switch is that they are stuck, and anyone who could should.  That is a pretty stark position for the bank to be in.  As a bank, it is marginally profitable and Mr. Masding might argue that mortgage pricing is as good as it gets and that the bank cannot do any better.  If that is the case, it raises more fundamental questions.  It is not good enough, however.  The bank continues to discriminate against its existing customers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>its new customers and overall its rates are way out of line with its cost of funds.  Its net interest margin has increased to 1.81%.  We will wait for the full year results, which will be released shortly, to get more detail on that.  It is a pretty grim picture for its mortgage customers, who are stuck with it, however.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-06a.469" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Masding" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020600002#S00400"><p>There are probably three elements to my answer.  First, the bank has had a track record in recent years of, within the boundaries on it, delivering attractive pricing, including reductions in its standard variable rate, SVR, its tracker mover products, and the introduction of the managed variable rate suite.  For that suite, there is a correlation between front book and back book pricing.  We have a track record of listening to stakeholders, including the committee.  The second thing I would say is that, within the constraints on me, I keep pricing under constant review.  I hear the Deputy's points and we will continue to review our pricing.  That is a commitment from me to the Deputy.  Third, as I have mentioned before, it is not just the cost of funds that goes into the pricing model.  There is also a cost of operations which, in banking, has increased in recent years.  This is due, in particular, to the fixed cost base.  There is the cost of risk and we have to take into account the past in our future cost of risk.  Further, the cost of capital is high in Ireland because of that past.  I would not want to argue with the Deputy about the cost of funds but the pricing of our mortgage has more than one dimension.  In summary, I hear what the Deputy is saying and, as always, respect his position.  I keep pricing under constant review, and perhaps the Deputy will give me the opportunity to continue to iterate the pricing as the bank's situation changes.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy McGrath's first question, I am advised that the number of non-customers is 329.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by two senior members of the bank&rsquo;s management team, Ms Dara Deering, executive director retail banking, and Mr Barry D'Arcy, chief risk officer.  The committee will have received our written responses to the questionnaire.  With the agreement of the committee, I will proceed to read my opening statement, following which we will respond to any specific questions the committee would like to ask. </p> <p>  In our appearance before this committee on 28 September 2017, we were not in a position to provide the committee with the number of impacted mortgage accounts because we had not concluded our review and engagements with the Central Bank on a number of customer cohorts that we were investigating.  However, I told the committee then that I hoped and expected to be in a position to give it considerably more information when we met next.  Such disclosure has now been included in our completed questionnaire. </p> <p>  Since that meeting we have engaged with the Central Bank to conclude the identification phase of this review and we have fully understood the need to progress at pace for our customers.  We have endeavoured in all our assessments to understand the full customer journey, as conveyed by the facts and considerations of reasonable expectations, to determine if a customer or a group of customers should be or should have been on a tracker rate and, therefore, be considered as impacted and receive redress and compensation. </p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in late October following engagement with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank, the bank identified as impacted 417 mortgage accounts that should have been on a tracker rate or were on the incorrect tracker margin.  Redress and compensation payments to those customer accounts commenced in November 2017 and full payments have now been made to all those customers.</p> <p>  Following supervisory engagement and challenge from the Central Bank, the bank concluded its analysis on other customer cohorts in late December and confirmed in a public statement as of 20 December 2017 that a further group of approximately 2,557 mortgage accounts were identified as impacted for a variety of reasons.  This number includes approximately 1,907 mortgage accounts that up to July 2008 converted from a tracker rate to a fixed rate product post-drawdown, and ultimately rolled off to a non-tracker rate product.  The documentation and terminology was not clear for these customers.</p><p>This number also includes <i>circa</i>650 PDH mortgage accounts that were identified as impacted, as they related to new mortgage applicants in the period from November 2006 to February 2008 who had drawn down their mortgage on a fixed rate, with a roll-off to a standard variable rate.  While they were never on a tracker mortgage rate and did not have a contractual right to such a rate, the bank has decided to offer these PDH customers a tracker mortgage rate product if the account is still open.  <br/><br/>Overall, the bank has identified <i>circa</i>2,974 mortgage accounts as impacted as part of the tracker mortgage examination.  We have written to all of these customers to advise them that their individual mortgage account is being or will be reviewed, with a status update before the end of March, if the review is not completed.  If they are going through a legal enforcement process, this is put on hold.  If they are in the process of or considering selling or surrendering their property or applying for a form of debt resolution, we encourage them to discuss their options with their financial and-or legal advisers prior to committing.  <br/><br/>I reiterate my apologies to all impacted customers for the harm and distress caused by the bank's error or failure.  So far, it has made rate rectifications and redress and compensation payments to 501 customer accounts.  Furthermore, the remaining mortgage accounts will be restored to the correct tracker mortgage rate by the end of February, if the account is still open, and receive redress and compensation payments as soon as possible but no later than the end of June.  The bank has made a provision of &euro;120,300,000 to account for redress and compensation payable to the impacted accounts since the start of the examination.  In line with the tracker mortgage examination framework, it has established an independent appeals panel for customers who are not satisfied with the level of redress and compensation offered.<br/><br/>Regrettably, some customers have lost their homes or their investment properties as a result of not having been on a tracker mortgage rate.  So far, we have concluded that six customers lost their homes as a result of not being on a tracker mortgage rate.  We have also determined that 27 customers lost their buy-to-let properties for the same reason.  We expect this number to increase as the individual causation assessment and calculations are completed in the recently identified cases.  In determining causation, by which we mean establishing the link between the loss of ownership and the bank's error or failure, we have formulated our decision model to be as customer focused as we can in assessing these cases.  The question we have tried to answer is whether the customer could at the time under the most lenient restructuring arrangement available to them have managed to make his or her mortgage payments if he or she had been on a tracker mortgage rate.  If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, we conclude that he or she lost his or her property because of the bank's error or failure.<br/><br/>We appreciate that the financial compensation offered cannot compensate for the emotional stress caused by the loss of a home.  For this, I sincerely apologise once again.  We cannot undo what happened in the past, but we can provide for remediation and learn from mistakes.  The bank has conducted the review under the examination framework in the interests of achieving a fair outcome for customers, identifying circumstances where the interaction between the bank and customers has been seriously deficient or the handling of customer cases has not been of a standard required under the framework.  While taking into account its legal and contractual commitments in making its determinations, the bank's approach has been to ensure the balance of consideration is in favour of the customer.  As we restore impacted customers to the correct tracker mortgage rate, make redress and compensation payments, respond to customers' questions or requests and, ultimately, the facilitation of the independent appeals process, the bank shall maintain this approach.  <br/><br/>As a sector, financial institutions need to take meaningful incredible actions to regain the trust of all customers.  Since the events leading up to the review, the bank has strengthened processes and procedures that are supported by a strong and more robust regulatory environment.  We will continue to work towards the conclusion of the examination in all its facets.  The bank's parent, KBC Group, has also taken the review very seriously.  We are very supportive of the establishment of a banking standards board and an agenda to bring about cultural change in banking.<br/><br/>Mr. Deering, Mr. D'Arcy and I will respond to questions.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

As regards this phase of the examination, I can only speak for my institution.  I have not seen evidence or indications that there was a deliberate effort made by individuals in the bank to deprive customers of a tracker mortgage rate.  However, it is clear from the case reviews we have conducted that a number of circumstances and practices were deficient, as I indicated in my opening statement, either in the correspondence to customers or the documentation used or other influencing factors.  That is next to a number of errors we have uncovered during our forensic review of cases.</p></speech>

Mr. Verbraeken has acknowledged that some customers were denied their legal contractual rights, but bankers are unwilling to say they broke the law.  Is it not fair to say they broke it?  Some customers had a legal contractual right to a tracker mortgage rate, but the bank did not provide it, for whatever reason, whether it was systems, information or any other excuse.  There was a legal right to a tracker mortgage rate, but the bank denied it to some customers.  Why is Mr. Verbraeken not comfortable in saying this?  AIB stated it.  It told us that there were cases in the bank in which it was very clear, written in black and white, customers had legal rights and that the bank had denied them these rights.</p></speech>

The close to 3,000 mortgage accounts we have identified as impacted constitute a minority, but obviously any case in that category is one too many.</p><p>I agree with that.</p></speech>

Did they say that it was their view that they had a contractual right to a tracker rate that they would like to assert?</p></speech>

More than 40 such cases were brought to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO.  In all but two cases, the bank's position was upheld at the time by the ombudsman, who indicated that the documentation we used was clear and unambiguous, that the bank had not failed in its duty to bring key features to the attention of the customer, and that the bank did not disguise important information.  That was found at the time.  Today we have found differently and we now consider that cohort to have been impacted.</p></speech>

If 40 went to the FSO and went through that process, we can expect that multiples of that figure raised concerns with the bank.  That is what happens.

He speaks about practices and more information but these customers knew the bank was doing wrong; they brought the issue to its attention and the bank closed ranks.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank is one of the outliers, but KBC takes the main prize.  It is the worst in terms of both redress and compensation and in putting customers back onto their tracker rates.  We are talking about fine language but, as we speak, the bank is automatically deducting money it is not entitled to from its own customers' accounts every single month.  There are still 2,500 customers on the wrong rate.  I am a customer of KBC, my mortgage payment goes out at the start of the month.  I am not an impacted customer, but if I was, on the first Monday of this month KBC would have stolen money from my account that it is legally not entitled to, despite the fact that it has known for quite some time that what it is doing to these 2,500 customers is wrong.  How can Mr. Verbraeken justify that?</p></speech>

They will be restored to their correct rates by the end of this month.  To clarify the rationale or reason 2,500 customers are still on the wrong rate, the process we went through with the Central Bank stretched all the way into December 2017 when we reached a final determination about all the customers and cohorts that were considered to be impacted.   That is when we started the process of writing to all of these customers, which happened at the beginning of January 2018.  They will be put on the right rate within two months and they will be redressed and compensated within six months.</p></speech>

This process continued through the second half of 2017 and we concluded it in December 2017, having reached a position in which there was no further dispute between the bank and the Central Bank on any cohorts.</p></speech>

Is that the reason, in reality, if we cut out the rest of it, the bank is so far behind the rest of them?</p></speech>

We had a different perspective on certain customer journeys.  I clarified, for instance, with regard to the customer journey the Deputy referred to, that we had on file findings by the FSO in the bank's favour which would have strengthened that position.</p></speech>

For an owner-occupied property, the offer to the customer would be a &euro;50,000 lump sum payment.  There would be compensation for the uplift in value of the property between the time of repossession or sale of the property and the time of compensation.  There would be a write-off of all residual mortgage balances.  There would be a compensation for the future value of a tracker unless that same customer took up our offer of a new mortgage loan on a tracker rate.  We would also offer them legal fees to the extent of &euro;2,000 or other reasonable vouched fees that they spent.</p></speech>

Has the bank thought about it?  Has it thought about the impact of having to tell one's children the bank is taking one's home and of packing up the toys and moving to a different area?  Many people feel shame as a result of that.  Irish people are very proud.  How does the bank gauge all of that and put a value on it?</p></speech>

We appreciate and acknowledge that but we have to address, with the means we have today, the situation these customers are in and offer them compensation.  Of the six owner-occupied properties that were lost as a result of the bank's error and failure, we still have five in our possession.  As part of the redress and compensation engagement we have with these customers, whom we have contacted specifically and personally, we will offer them their homes back.</p></speech>

The home would be offered back with the reduced mortgage loan on a tracker so they would be in a similar position as customers who lost their property outright.  There is an equivalence of value that we offer to a customer where we still possess the property.</p></speech>

They will take out a mortgage with KBC to get their home back.  It did not answer the question.  Perhaps it did answer the question because the bank is looking at it very much in financial terms and considering the uplift and so on.  All of that has to be done.  In the scenario I put to Mr. Verbraeken, what price does he put on having to go in and tell the children they are leaving the house and packing up and maybe having to go into rental accommodation?  Some value has to be put on it.  There is no way that any type of money can undo the harm the bank has caused those people.  The bank has obviously made some calculation somewhere so what is it?  Has the bank actually engaged with the six customers to find out the impact?  Has the bank asked them to submit a victim impact statement?  I asked the banks to do this a year ago.  If we were in court, that is what would happen.  It would show how it impacted on the customer.  Has the bank looked at that?</p></speech>

I fully agree with the Deputy that any financial compensation or value offered would not compensate for the harm done.  We would prefer not to be in a position of having any cases where a loss of property has occurred.  We believe the process we are going through with these customers is to some extent showing we are trying to do the right thing by them given where we are today and the findings we have come to in recent in months.</p></speech>

They are individuals who took out mortgages in the period of November 2006 to February 2008.  Can Mr. Verbraeken explain to the committee why the bank has chosen those dates?  I raised this over a year and a half ago with the bank.  I presume it is to do with the advertisement and the leaflet that was being bandied about by all the brokers which said that customers would roll on to a tracker rate at the end of the fixed-rate period.  I have numerous letters from customers of the bank who were given the same type of commitment and were aware of the flyer but who were not deemed impacted.  I will give Mr. Verbraeken an example of a person who applied for the mortgage in August 2006.  In January 2007, the person finalised and decided to fix the rate but were deemed by the bank not to have been impacted.  It is the same commitment.  I presume that is the reason the 650 homes were deemed impacted.  Can Mr. Verbraeken elaborate on that?</p></speech>

We welcome all customers who believe they have evidence that we did not consider to come forward.  I welcome the same in this case.  The 650 customers relate to new owner-occupied, PDH, customers who applied for their mortgages between November 2006 and February 2008.  That coincides with a period when the bank had issued a communication to its intermediaries, the brokers, which are governed by their own specific regulatory context, for a product that was specific to new owner-occupied, PDH, customers which meant they started on a fixed rate and rolled off to a tracker.</p><p>We have decided, based on the review we conducted on the period right up to December 2017, that the 650 customers who signed loan agreements to start on a fixed rate and roll off to a standard variable rate should have had the customer journey of a fixed rate rolling off to a tracker, as did 90% of all new PDH applicants who applied in the window of time in question.  More than 6,000 cases originated through the broker network in the window during which the broker communication was valid rolled, as intended by the bank, from a fixed rate to a tracker.  The 650 cases signed a loan agreement based on moving from a fixed rate to a standard variable rate.  We have decided, as a matter of policy, to offer these customers a tracker rate and to offer redress and compensation.</p></speech>

They do not make a final decision until they make a final decision.  Therefore, an inducement whereby one may move to a tracker rate at the end of the two-year fixed term has an influence.  If I received a letter of offer from KBC Bank but had not decided on that bank and my broker advised me I would roll on to a tracker mortgage, I would sign even though my application preceded the advice.  Surely to God it would be deemed an influencing factor.</p></speech>

Mr. Verbraeken is saying the policy is that someone who was told by his broker that he would roll on to a tracker after taking out a mortgage with KBC Bank, which would involve a final letter, should not be deemed impacted.  Surely to God it had an influence.  The bank needs to revisit this policy.  It will force victims to go to the bank, through the internal appeals process and to the FSPO.  This is an obvious matter.  If before signing up with the bank one's broker is saying one will roll on to a tracker, it is obviously an influencing factor.  How could it not be?</p></speech>

It has also been part of our discussion with the Central Bank of Ireland on determining the specific cohort impacted upon.  Considering this on the basis of the date of application is ultimately considered to be the fair approach.</p></speech>

I will continue with Deputy Pearse Doherty's line of questioning.  I am conscious that people who are directly affected are watching.  Members will have received correspondence in this regard.</p> <p>  Let me tease out the issue a little further.  The 650 PDH mortgage accounts that Mr. Verbraeken identified as being affected relate to new applications.  He deemed the application date to be the cut-off point.  The period in question is from November 2006 to November 2008.  The customers started out on a fixed rate, with a roll-off to a standard variable rate.  They were never on a tracker rate.  Is it correct that the relevance of the dates is based on the existence of a flyer that the brokers were using to market and promote the product?</p></speech>

Obviously, these relate to the cut-off date or dates either side of that.  One customer said they met their broker in February 2008 to discuss the options and the broker produced the KBC Bank flyer, making it clear that the customer could roll on to a tracker on expiry.  The customer placed a lot of emphasis on that advice.  My correspondence does not state when the customer applied for a mortgage but they signed off on it in early May 2008 and drew the first payment down in early June 2008.  They say the flyer with the tracker option was pivotal in the making of their decision.  Clearly, it was not communicated to them between February and May that the flyer had been revoked.  Is it true that KBC Bank was offering a tracker mortgage up to 4 July 2008?</p></speech>

If the customer in question applied after April 2008, the bank would not have had any tracker product, never mind a fixed tracker product, for example.  As Mr. Verbraeken said, we tried to take a policy decision considering where we believe the flyer might have been used in conversations.  Obviously, we cannot rule out where it was or was not used.</p><p>We believe, however, that it is most appropriate and reasonable to expect that it may have been used as part of the sales process and that is why we have taken an application date.  There may be some cases around the edges, and clearly we will look at them on an individual basis, but the policy is to apply it where we believe it is most reasonable and consistent from a consumer perspective.  As with the other 90% of customers who went from a fixed rate to a tracker, we have applied the same criteria to these customers who went from a fixed rate to a standard variable rate. </p></speech>

They challenge that KBC has used the application as the cut off.  They make the legitimate point that it is not complete until fully signed and reviewed by all parties, legal advice is sought and when the mortgage is executed.  If it was within the window during which this flyer was in circulation, then I believe they have a very arguable case that they should be included.  The bank, however, has taken a different view.</p></speech>

As has already been outlined, we are minded that these customers would have received a loan offer letter that clearly stated they were fixed, standard variable.

In October, KBC revised down the 490 customers to the 417 mortgage accounts.  This was the very first group that had been identified as not rolling on to a tracker rate after a fixed rate period or were moved off their tracker rate following a change to the terms of their loan or were on the incorrect tracker margin.  Were those cases clear cut?  They had a contractual entitlement to a tracker rate at a particular margin, or at least an entitlement to be offered such a tracker.</p></speech>

The large majority, 358 cases, were cases that had been on a tracker rate and then had an agreed change to their mortgage contract in the sense they went on to an interest-only period, and ultimately they rolled off to a variable rate.  In October, we determined that the terminology used in the instruction letter for the interest-only period could have been confusing as to its intent and that the customer may have reasonably expected to return to a tracker rate.  Although the correspondence stated, in most cases, that the customer would move to a variable rate, we determined that it was not clear to the customer-----</p></speech>

We are not doing average or prevailing rates.  Second, we have to set the loan back up as a tracker, because it now tracks ECB.  That process is to make sure the calculation is correct on a go-forward basis.  That is the basis on which we then calculate redress.  There are two stages in a process involving someone who makes and someone who validates the change.</p></speech>

There are several steps in the process.  One is to go through all the original contracts to make sure the customer gets the original rate and then, second, to do the calculations.  I assure the Deputy if we could have done it in early January it would be done by now.  We are doing it as fast as is practicable, while also ensuring that we meet our customer obligations in terms of getting payments out to customers who also have been impacted by this.</p></speech>

We have concluded that phase of the review with the Central Bank in the sense that there is an agreement with the Central Bank on those cohorts but we continue to perform quality control and quality assurance and we are still going through various cases.  As we indicated earlier, we invited certain customers to submit to us the relevant information or evidence to verify whether their case would be impacted.  We are not closing the identification phase of the examination.  This is ongoing.  We are trying to redress and compensate all customers we have identified.  We are not finished.

I have received an email from a customer who was impacted on to the tune of &euro;500 per month in the nine-year timeframe, which means that he was overcharged by a considerable amount.  This customer has still not resolved the issues involved with the bank.  He has been trying desperately to have the matter sorted because it is having an ongoing impact on him.  For someone like him, the timelines appear to be too far down the line.  It is important that cases such as this be concluded early.  The individual in question has been in contact with the bank dating back to the beginning of the discovery of the error.  It is not a source of great comfort for this customer that the issue is being dragged out and remains unresolved.  The last letter he received on 5 January was the standard one.  He is seeking the support of the committee to bring his case to an early conclusion and highlight his poor customer experience with the bank.  I am informing Mr. Verbraeken of the content of the email.</p></speech>

I draw lessons at a macro and a micro level.  At the micro level within the bank, 90% correct is not good enough.  Very often we have failed to be precise in our communication and correspondence on the clarification we have provided for customers and need to bring it up to a higher standard.  I believe the processes we have put in place to date in the bank will help us to achieve that standard.  At a macro level, I understand there was a lot of competition in the years leading up to the financial crisis and this event.  I believe lenders did not consider the potential long-term impact of new products such as tracker mortgage rates on their customers.  They should learn the lessons of designing and managing products which have the potential to have a very negative impact on customers in the long run.</p></speech>

There is a need to exercise some flexibility and the bank should look at how many individual cases are involved.  It is important to do so before there is another row about the matter.  In line with the opening statement we have heard, the bank should give some relief to these people.  It is clear from some of the letters I have received that they took legal advice but it took time to sign contracts.  None of us can calculate the impact the November 2006 flyer had when it came into play.  We do not know how it would have affected their view of things going forward into the future.

The repayments the bank was seeking were just under &euro;1,500 per month.  The correct tracker rate was 1% so the repayment the bank should have sought was &euro;970.  Based on our affordability assessment of this customer, who was in financial distress, they could afford to pay just under &euro;490.  We then look at what was the lowest restructuring or resolution option which we could have offered to a distressed customer at that time.  We do not look at what their tracker mortgage should have been but we assess what we would have offered to this distressed customer, which was a 50-50 split mortgage, meaning their repayment would have been &euro;368.  In this case, the customer's affordability was greater than the lowest restructure option we had and we deem that they could have afforded that.

We determine the point at which we would have made a decision on the outcome of the case, in this case March 2014.  We would have had all the information at that time and we consider whether, had the customer been on a tracker at the right rate, and bearing in mind the lowest restructure rate and the lowest repayment, they would have had the affordability to meet that payment.  We should have offered the customer that lowest repayment option so the decision to determine the mortgage as unsustainable was incorrect on the part of the bank.  We believe in this case that we caused the loss of ownership.</p></speech>

KBC has made the commitment to the committee.  I appreciate that but it is an absolute disgrace that KBC has so many customers not on the right tracker rate.  While it has made a commitment to this committee, it has not done so to the 2,500 impacted customers.  It wrote to them on 5 January stating clearly that if the bank had not concluded a review of the customer's mortgage account before the end of March 2018, it would provide them with a further status update at that stage.  Why did KBC not tell them they would put them back on the proper rate at the end of month?</p></speech>

As soon as we concluded the review, which we did on 20 December, and we made a statement about impacted customers, our first priority was to make sure those customers knew they were impacted.  Our second priority is around getting the payments out for the customers who had been identified back in October.  That has been done.  The third priority was to move towards how quickly we could get these accounts back on a rate.  The quickest we can get them is by the end of February at the latest.  Clearly, customers are talking to us every day.  That is part of the ongoing engagement.</p></speech>

However, it does not have the decency to tell its customers.  There are no ifs or buts about it.  That is completely and utterly wrong.  We are trying to hold the banks accountable for Irish citizens.  We are trying to force the banks to change their culture and give people back their money.  As much as giving them back their money, the banks should also give them respect.  It is nothing personal but it is Ms Deering's name on the letters.</p></speech>

However, we are trying to manage customer expectations.  Customers are massively frustrated by the length of time this is taking.  I am not trying to exacerbate this problem.  On 5 January, when we issued those letters, we were not in a position to make a categorical confirmation to customers that they would be back on the correct rate by the end of February.  I did not want, therefore, to exacerbate the already high levels of frustration for customers because, naturally, for many of those customers, we had only deemed them to have been impacted in December.  We thought the best next step for those customers would be to say they are impacted.  As their rates are rectified, they get communications from the bank.  We understand the frustration.  That is why we said initially that we would try to have communication by the end of March, which is in the letter to which the Deputy is referring.  Since then, we have put all efforts into getting those customers back on their rate for the end of February.  At least, their repayments are lower going forward, recognising the payment of redress and compensation will continue to the end of June.</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier, we are trying to identify what is the actual rate they should be moved to.
