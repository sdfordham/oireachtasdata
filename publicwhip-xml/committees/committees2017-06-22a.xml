He is joined by the deputy director of audit, Mr. Shane Carton.  The minutes of the meetings of 14 June and 15 June 2017 have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  With regard to matters arising, we will come to everything relevant in the course of the meeting today.  We will move straight on to No. 3, which is correspondence received.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Some will relate to the meeting we had with the Garda Commissioner on Tuesday because they have not been noted.  They arrived since our last public meeting but we did not note correspondence.</p> <p>  The first item is the opening statement from Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan for the meeting on 19 June.  We note that because that meeting was held on Tuesday.  The next item is opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Brian Norton.  We note that.  The next item is the opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Desmond Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick.  We note that and it will be published with the other opening statement.  There is an opening statement for today's meeting from Dr. Brendan J. Murphy, president of Cork Institute of Technology.  We note and will publish that.  </p> <p>  Next is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings.  Correspondence dated 14 June from Cork Institute of Technology is as follows: a briefing document as presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 which outlines the background and details of the KPMG report.  We can raise that with its representatives when they are here shortly.  There are also relevant extracts from Committee of Public Accounts opening statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Education and Skills and Higher Education Authority.  We also attach the full copy of the transcript of the Committee of Public Accounts hearing on Cork Institute of Technology, which was held on 10 Dec 2015.  Members have it by way of background information.  We note all that.</p> <p>  No. 603B is correspondence from the chairman of the Office of Public Works regarding a 2013 request to provide office accommodation for Caranua with instructions from the Department that Caranua would meet the appropriate rental costs.  Do we have that letter on screen?  Does anyone want to comment on it?  It is No. 603B.  What is the conclusion of that letter, towards the end of it?  Do members want time to consider it?  We will come back to it next week.  We will hold it over until next week.  </p> <p>  No. 607B is correspondence from the Comptroller and Auditor General dated 19 June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E00400"><p>On the previous letter about the rent, at all stages this committee asked for no rent to be paid.  I reiterate that publicly.  We are putting it on hold to look at it next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E00500"><p>Absolutely.  We will come back to it next week.  We have done No. 603B regarding Caranua.</p> <p>  No. 607B, (i) to (iv), is correspondence from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Committee&rsquo;s examination of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Templemore issue, including a briefing note on the accounting officer's obligations, which is dated 7 July 2015, from Michael Culhane.  It has been referred to and discussed.  We note and will publish it.   </p> <p>  No. 608B is email correspondence from Cyril Dunne, former chief administrative officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with details of the membership of the two steering committees.  It has been circulated and discussed publicly.  We note it.  We are really just catching up on correspondence we did not note publicly at the meeting on Tuesday.</p> <p>  No. 609B is correspondence from Niall Kelly, head of internal audit, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, regarding the EU-funded programmes.  It was discussed.  We note and publish it.  </p> <p>  No. 611B is correspondence dated 19 June 2017 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with details of compliance to Standards in Public Office, SIPO, declarations.  We note and publish that.  It has already been discussed.  </p> <p>  No. 612B is correspondence dated 19 June 2017 from the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the draft audit report on EU-funded programmes.  It was discussed on Tuesday and we note and publish the document.  We are only doing it as a formality at this stage.</p> <p>  No. 613B is correspondence dated 19 June 2017 from the Deputy Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na clarifying the advice referred to at the meeting on 14 June 2017 was advice received from the then chief administrative officer, Mr. Cyril Dunne, and not Mr. Ken Ruane, the head of legal affairs.  Also included are communications from the head of legal affairs with the Department of Justice and Equality.  That was discussed and we note and publish it.    </p> <p>  Item No. 615B is a copy of correspondence dated 12 June 2017 from the executive director, human resources and people development, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We noted and discussed it before and we will publish it now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E00800"><p>May I make one comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E00900"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01000"><p>We only received this letter on the day of the hearing.  It was a very important letter and we probably did not get enough chance to properly go through it with the Commissioner because we only got it.  I note that for the Cathaoirleach.  We have completed our work in terms of our hearings and we will move to a report.  This was Mr. Barrett, who is head of human resources, asking the Commissioner to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  When the questions were put, she said there was no need to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It shows the clear contradiction between his understanding of what happened in meetings and her understanding of what happened at the meeting.  It is quite serious for the head of human resources to be alerting this committee to information he says the Commissioner had in respect of previous briefings she was given before she said she was briefed but also the nature of the meeting that he was present at.  He is writing to her and giving us a letter to say in his view she should correct the record.  She disputes that.  I think we should note that she disputed the content of the letter.</p></speech>

We will write to the Commissioner for a response specifically to that letter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01400"><p>I took note of the letter when it was too late, in the confusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01500"><p>I will make one remark about the letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01600"><p>I know it is only his view and people are entitled to different views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01700"><p>It is not just his view.  We will just go down through it.  I want to draw attention to the second paragraph, in fairness to Mr. Barrett.  I am reading the paragraph that starts, "In the course of the meeting I referred extensively".  The last sentence is, "On 30th June, 2015 and again in early July I had been advised that Mr. Cyril Dunne had brought these matters of critical concern, which I had been raising, to your personal attention".  He is saying he was advised.  He does not say who advised him.  I read it carefully.  That letter is an element of hearsay.  He is saying he was advised by somebody.  He does not tell us who advised him and that something was brought to somebody else's attention.  It is not a statement of fact but we will ask for a written response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#E01800"><p>We also need clarity because probably more important is the last line.  This is the meeting where there was a dispute as to how long the meeting went on.  It says, "In addition, time was spent discussing Mr. Ruane's suggestion that all key external stakeholders (the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality) should immediately be notified before advancing the work of the steering committee further".  We need to hear from Mr. Ruane, if we can write to him.  Is it his understanding?  Did he state at that meeting that all of those stakeholders should be immediately notified?  We know that did not happen.</p><p>It goes to the heart of the matter.  The head of legal made clear in his view who should and should not be notified and when.  The word "immediately" is clear.</p></speech>

It should be a straightforward point.</p></speech>

Our proposal is that, next Thursday, the committee will meet in private session to discuss a preliminary draft of our report on the progress to date on the Templemore issue.  We will finalise it in due course.  At 11 a.m. next Tuesday, we will have a meeting in private session to commence our work on the draft report on third level institutions.  There will be no public meeting next week, only two private ones to discuss draft reports.</p> <p>  Next is No. 589C, correspondence from the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association.  It refers to the HSE's attendance at the meeting of 15 June and provides an update regarding the Deloitte review of the cost of care for Grace.

According to the correspondence, NAMA expects the proposed commission of investigation to consider that Project Shift falls within its terms of reference and, on that basis, NAMA is of the opinion that it would be prudent not to comment further on these matters.  The correspondence states that NAMA will co-operate fully with the work of the commission and, in the course of that work, expects to provide the commission with materials relating to Project Shift and to address fully any question the commission may have about the project.</p> <p>  For the benefit of viewers, Project Shift was originally a part of the Northern Ireland Project Eagle loan portfolio, but it was sold off separately during the course of the transaction, also to Cerberus.

As a matter of courtesy, we will forward all of this correspondence to the commission.  We will send to it anything that we receive about matters under its remit because we do not want to hold anything back that it might consider relevant down the road.  We will also forward a copy of this to Deputy Wallace.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 594C(i) and (ii), correspondence dated 13 June from the HSE regarding the National Ambulance Service and procurement processes in the north Leinster area.  This correspondence relates to a protected disclosure to the HSE made on 11 May 2017 that detailed concerns regarding the purchase of ambulance fleet cars in Leinster.  The matter is being investigated, so I propose that we request the HSE to update the committee when its investigation is completed.  We will put down a marker to ensure that the matter reverts to us at that stage.</p> <p>  Next is No. 595C, email correspondence from an individual requesting the committee to check the accounts of the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the moneys for tolls being collected by it.  In August 2015, the NRA and the Railway Procurement Agency were merged to become Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which is responsible for monitoring and managing existing toll arrangements.  I propose that we write to TII and request it to provide a response to the matters referred to in the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 596C(i) and (ii), correspondence dated 13 June from the chairman of the OPW regarding Cork city's lower Lee flood relief scheme.  This information was requested by the committee following an inquiry from an individual about flooding in Cork city.  I propose that we write to the individual who raised the matter and enclose the OPW's response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 597C, a copy of the letter to the new artistic director of the Abbey Theatre dated 10 June from an individual alleging that the Abbey Theatre censored a play about corruption.  We have only received a cc copy, as the letter was not directed to us.  We have nothing to do on this matter, only to note the correspondence.</p></speech>

There is insufficient detail in the correspondence for the committee to take any action.  All we can do is note it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 599C, correspondence dated 9 June from the Department of Finance attaching a copy of the 2016 annual report and financial statements of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  We note that.</p> <p>  Next is 600C, correspondence dated 24 May from an individual regarding the transfer of salary arrangements from the Department of Social Protection to PeoplePoint, that is, the HR shared services centre for the Civil Service.  This is a policy matter not within the remit of the committee, so I propose that we refer it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a response.  When we get a response, we will consider the matter further.</p> <p>  Next is No. 601C, correspondence dated 9 June 2017 from an individual regarding the excavation of drains in Galway and making certain allegations against named persons.  I propose that we write to the individual about directing any correspondence to the Local Government Audit Service, as the matter is outside the remit of this committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is a local authority issue.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 602C(i) and (ii), correspondence dated 28 May enclosing communication with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The note is on members' screens.  All that we are being asked to do is note the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 605C (i) and (ii), correspondence dated 16 June from the chairman of the Ireland East hospital group regarding receipt of protected disclosures in respect of to St. Vincent's University Hospital.  The matter has been referred to the HSE internal audit division.  I propose that we write to the HSE to be kept informed of the outcome of that.  Members will see the acknowledgement on their screens.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 606C, correspondence from Deputy Murphy dated 19 June regarding a contract for water cleaning chemicals due to be signed on 23 June by Irish Water.</p></speech>

That aspect of its funding comes under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is why we can write to Irish Water directly.  We will confirm which Department covers the communications regulator.  It would be useful for us to have a briefing note.  Somebody in the Oireachtas might get it out to us.</p> <p>  The next item is 610C, correspondence dated 19 June 2017 from the secretary to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission regarding an increase in staff resources to support the Committee of Public Accounts.  The clerk has been in touch with the Office of the Ceann Comhairle and a meeting with the Ceann Comhairle is still an option.  There is a note on additional staff.  We are being informed as to what is being done.  The offer of a meeting was not stated specifically in the letter but it is available.  We will have that meeting as soon as is practicable.</p></speech>

The staff issue concerning this committee is very important.  We said it in private and it is important to say it in public.  Tremendous work is being done.  There is a huge burden not only on us, as members, but also, and more importantly, on the staff.  "Overwhelmed" is the wrong word because I believe the staff are coping, but it is a case of David and Goliath in terms of how we face institution after institution.  We need the likes of "Prime Time" to help us.  What was exposed on "Prime Time" indicates the difficulties we are experiencing in this committee.  They are difficulties for us to work through but we need sufficient staff.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts meets for a minimum of almost a full day every week.  Some committees meet weekly and some meet once a fortnight.  Since last summer, we have been meeting practically twice a week.  Therefore, the workload of the Committee of Public Accounts is extraordinarily extensive.  The staff allocated to us are stretched beyond all reasonable limits and we do need the additional support because of the workload.  Since we are diligent in doing our work, we believe we need to have these extra meetings.  It puts strain on us as members but it puts a double strain on the staff trying to support us.  We do need the resources.  It is for one reason only; it is in the interest of the public who elect us to ensure we do our job as members of the committee.  That is the only reason we are here.</p></speech>

It is important that it be said on the public record that we are under-resourced as we speak.  Not only do we have a very busy schedule, we also have a very diverse brief, unlike other committees, perhaps.  Everybody is before us, which causes a challenge for us, as members, but also for the staff because we are covering virtually the entire gamut of public bodies, officials and so on.  We need the meeting and we need to agree a day and a time for it.  We just need additional resources.  It is doing a huge disservice to the public to under-resource any committee, this one in particular.</p></speech>

We did speak about this matter in private, as other Deputies have said.  It is only this morning that I discovered the limited number of staff available to the secretariat by comparison with the number that were available to the banking inquiry.  The amount of work they do on our behalf is phenomenal.  As Deputy Connolly said, they are coping.  There is the equivalent of a mini-banking inquiry going on here every week, if not from month to month.  When one considers the various reports we are producing at the moment, one recalls that the banking inquiry had an entire floor in Agriculture House.  It had 20 or 30 people at its disposal.  In fact, there was an additional member of staff for each of the members of the banking inquiry.  It is not that I am looking for that &ndash; I am not &ndash; but I am appalled, quite frankly, that the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts, the only constitutional committee of the State, is limited to six or seven staff.  I was genuinely of the view, given the quality of the work coming our way and the research, that there was a team of 20 people behind the scenes.  The clerk, the members of the secretariat themselves and the Chairman should put a plan together and ascertain our optimal number of staff in terms of research, secretarial and administrative functions.  They should go to the Ceann Comhairle and Oireachtas Commission and make the case for them.  The importance of the work is such that it demands that.</p></speech>

I knew there had been suggestions, somewhere in evidence, that the Garda College may have been seeking charitable status but I did not realise the magnitude of what this could mean.  I asked whether there was any correspondence.  There was not.  During a break, the secretariat approached the CAO, who provided the correspondence, within which there was an email that mentioned this troubling muddying-the-waters commentary.</p><p>Included in what was provided was a thread of email correspondence from PwC advising Mr. Culhane, and correspondence to Eugene Banks, who was in the Garda division of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department was able to clarify the other day that he is still in the Department but in a different role.  If we are finished in terms of having witnesses in for public hearings, I would like to have Mr. Banks in to put some questions to him.  It would be reasonable for us to contact Mr. Banks to see what he might like to tell us or share with us in regard to this matter.  In any event, we should look for the entire email thread the correspondence relates to, because there seems to be only one or two but they suggest many more.  We should also look for any other correspondence that may exist between the director of finance and the Garda and Mr. Banks with regard to issues on taxation on the charitable status of Templemore, and any other correspondence with PwC on the same matter.  That would be very useful for us so we can make a fair analysis of this issue before we write our report.</p></speech>

I imagine there would be much more to that particular correspondence that might put a more complete picture on it.</p></speech>

With regard to the Office of Public Works renting out buildings, has there been a change of policy or something we have missed with regard to a direction from the Government or any Government on the office of Public Works getting market rent for its premises?  With regard to the buildings identified following the 2009 Ryan report, in 2002 cash and property was to be handed over.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has followed up on this.  Deputy Cassells and I have raised concerns about buildings that were on the list but have not been handed over.  I will take the specific example, to make it easy, of Lenaboy Castle, Taylor's Hill, Galway, which has not been handed up.  Where can we follow up on this?  This is 2017.  It is down on the list that it was handed over in 2009.  I have chosen one example in which I have a particular interest.  In fairness to Deputy Cassells, he has raised the issue also.  Where can I follow up?  Who is following up on this?</p></speech>

My understanding of what he has said is Caranua was accommodated for a period in accommodation that was assigned to the Department of Education and Skills, and because it was a Department the OPW was effectively paying the rent, and there is a rent payable for the property, but it was not passing on the charge to the Department of Education and Skills.  It had a provision of funding for this, and when the lease came to an end the funding had run out and, therefore, it asked Caranua to pay the rent to it, which it had paid on to the landlord.</p></speech>

I have experience with a piece of land that went into the OPW because the builder went bankrupt. I understand it is through the Minister for Finance that those types of land holdings or buildings end up in the OPW.  Given the crash and all the rest of it there must be an increase in the number of buildings or amount of lands that the OPW acquired, and it would be quite important to look at it at some point.</p></speech>

It is something I am looking at and may produce a report on it.  There has been turnover of the portfolio, particularly if there were break clauses in leases.  If the OPW had been locked into an upward only rent review it might take the opportunity to avail of a break clause to end it, but obviously it needs to go into the market and acquire other property to accommodate Departments.</p></speech>

In the context of our examination of financial statements in the education sector, this meeting is a follow-up meeting relating to certain matters.  The meeting will be divided into two sessions.  Session A will deal with matters relating to the University of Limerick, UL, and University College Cork, UCC.  Session B will deal with matters relating to the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, and the financial statement of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT and certain matters relating to its 2014 and subsequent accounts.  Representatives of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Education and Skills will be with us for both sessions.  We are joined by Dr. Graham Love and Mr. Andrew Brownlee from the HEA and by Dr. Tony Gaynor and Ms Deirdre McDonald, principal officers, from the Department.  The main witness for this session from UL is the president, Professor Desmond Fitzgerald.  We are also joined by Dr. Richard Thorn who has been appointed to conduct an independent review of certain matters at the university.  In fairness to Dr. Thorn, we do not want to cut across his independent work or in any way influence it.  He is here as a courtesy to this committee and we thank him for being present.  The committee will be making some remarks for Dr. Thorn to take on board but he is not answerable to the committee in respect of the work he is about to carry out in the time ahead.  We are also joined by Professor Patrick O'Shea, president of UCC, Mr. Diarmuid Collins, bursar and chief financial officer, Mr. Cormac McSweeney, finance officer and Mr. Michael Farrell, corporate secretary.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  It is not enough to switch them to airplane mode because they still interfere with the communications and recording system.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We will begin with a brief opening statement from Professor O'Shea of UCC.</p></speech>

Ar dt&uacute;s, le cead, ba mhaith liom r&aacute;iteas a dh&eacute;anamh faoin gcomhph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht idir an ollscoil i gCorcaigh agus Foras Bainist&iacute;ochta na h&Eacute;ireann.<br/><br/>The Irish Management Institute, IMI, is Ireland's only executive education provider to be globally ranked by the <i>Financial Times</i>for customised executive education.  It is ranked in 54th position globally, 25th in Europe and 9th in the whole of the UK and Ireland.  The shared ambition of UCC and the IMI is to advance education by raising the standard of management in Ireland and by enabling organisations and individuals to fulfil their potential through world-class executive education.  Partnering with UCC, the institute's future growth will be supported by research-led insight and expertise from within the university as well as the IMI's corporate membership community which together will continue to serve as the bedrock that connects the IMI to the needs of Irish organisations.<br/><br/>Our joint ambition stretches beyond Ireland's shores.  The IMI and the Cork University Business School will forge significant international alliances and relationships with global reach.  This combined with the institute's global ranking offers a unique value proposition that can consistently deliver distinctive world-class executive education to Irish and international students.  The acquisition of the IMI by UCC is a great investment for the university, the institute, our students and the people of Ireland.  The relationship has evolved over eight years and in the period 2011 to 2016, it took the form of an alliance which was launched by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2011.  During that period, the governing body of the university considered the possibility of a formal acquisition of the institute on several occasions.  However, the body decided not to proceed until it was satisfied that the conditions deemed necessary for long-term success were fulfilled.  In January 2015, the governing body, based on extensive information and due diligence, approved the acquisition of IMI, subject to a set of conditions to be met in advance of the completion of the transaction.  These conditions related to the absence of pension liabilities, the general financial position of the institute, settlement of any outstanding cases and approval by the Competition Authority of the transaction.</p><p>The acquisition was completed in November 2016 and is a complex and detailed arrangement which took several years to negotiate.  Both organisations persisted over those years because they fully believed in the benefits for UCC, the IMI itself and for Ireland.  We have outlined these benefits and other aspects in the papers that have been provided to the committee.  </p><p> The value of the Irish Management Institute nationally and its significance to the business community has been recognised by the Government.  At the launch of the alliance in 2011, the Taoiseach noted that the development was significant and welcome for its potential to greatly improve the capacity of Ireland's companies to compete internationally.  Similarly, the T&aacute;naiste, at the launch of the merger in January, emphasised the need for Ireland to have the capacity to develop the requisite calibre of business leaders to guarantee long-term economic success.  The university shares these views and believes that this acquisition will be of real benefit to University College Cork, the Irish Management Institute and the State as a whole.  </p><p> In summary, I would like to put the following on the record.  No taxpayer or Exchequer funds of any kind were used by the university to acquire the Irish Management Institute.  The acquisition is totally aligned with the university's strategic objectives and national priorities for lifelong learning.  In my own career I have been associated with many universities, including the University of California, Duke University and the University of Maryland.  All are institutions that operate to the highest standards of governance.  In my short time at University College Cork, I can assure the committee that UCC also operates to those very high standards of governance and accountability and that this acquisition was fully compliant with those standards and with the Government's framework within which the university operates, and specifically with the powers of the university under the Universities Act 1997 and the powers vested in the governing body under that Act.  The acquisition by University College Cork was fully disclosed to the Higher Education Authority in advance of the transaction close.  The Higher Education Authority fully supported the transaction and recognised the benefits it would bring for students and business education in Ireland.</p><p> I wish to assure the members that University College Cork has not misled the committee with regard to the acquisition.  Additional information was sought by the committee following our previous appearance in March.  This was provided on 13 April and 9 May.  We have also provided the committee today with supporting appendices and schedules.  These will provide additional reassurance on the transaction. </p><p>  I am accompanied today by the bursar and chief financial officer, Mr. Diarmuid Collins,  the corporate secretary, Mr. Michael Farrell, and the finance officer, Mr. Cormac McSweeney.  My colleagues and I are happy to address any questions that the committee may have on the IMI transaction.</p></speech>

He is attending on his own here today and we appreciate his attendance.  I invite him to make a brief opening statement.</p></speech>

I will not read out the document I sent in but I will briefly say that I am here today to acknowledge that we have a responsibility as a public body to ensure that we spend money properly and transparently.  I acknowledge that I now take responsibility for many of the issues that arose within the university before I took up the post.  I will now outline some of the things we have done to address some of these issues.</p> <p>  Before I start I would just like to say that the University of Limerick is an outstanding institution with great staff and students.  One of my keen objectives as we go through this process is to make sure that the reputation and credibility of the institution is preserved.  Since taking office I have taken a number of measures to address some of the issues.  Among the things that I am very keen to ensure we do properly is our duty of care to those staff members who have been caught up in the issues in question, particularly the whistleblowers who have currently either been put on paid leave or have left the institution. </p> <p>  The other thing I am keen to address is the issue of severance payments, particularly with regard to the information that has been given to this committee, to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Department of Education and Skills.  I have to say at this early point that we are continuing to collect and analyse the information.  I would say, however, that I think the severance agreements made were unacceptably high.  </p> <p>  I will outline some of the things we have been doing since I took up office.  As the committee is aware, one measure was to initially call for an independent review of the University of Limerick.  Richard Thorn has been appointed to that role and we have given him every assistance that we can.  Within the institution we have appointed Professor Mary O'Sullivan to provide direct liaison with Dr. Thorn.  We have also been undergoing a review of the structure of the senior management team and there is currently an ongoing restructuring of that team, looking carefully at the finance department and at human resources in particular.  The audit and risk committee also initiated an internal review of some of the matters raised both by RTE and by the PAC, particularly looking at conflicts of interest, the issue of people going out of the university to take degrees elsewhere, and the matter of the severance payments.  </p> <p>  To conclude, I want to be clear that I am determined to take whatever action necessary once the review has been completed.  I believe that this is on course for the end of September.  As I mentioned earlier, I am particularly concerned with protecting the reputation of the institution.  It has terrific support from its staff and students and from the community.  They have worked hard in the past to ensure the establishment of a university for Limerick and for the mid-west region.  It is very important for all of us that at the end of this process the university is put on a firm footing to further develop its academic programmes to provide education, training and research in the region.</p></speech>

I will not rush to judgment on what has happened because given that there is concern about the information that has been provided to public bodies and given that we need to have complete clarity on what has been said and done within the institution I am determined to get the information - to get it independently - to review the information and then to take whatever appropriate steps are required.</p></speech>

Could I just note as well, a Chathaoirligh, that it was you who said, on the same programme that there was a severe lack of corporate governance shown by these governing bodies of these organisations and when they did come before us - which was a number of institutes &ndash; they did not tell the full truth.  They were your words, Chairman.  A number of allegations have been made by the programme as well that we did not get full information.  That is what we need to examine here today with Professor O'Shea, Mr. Collins and Professor Fitzgerald.  Professor Fitzgerald has at least acknowledged that incomplete information was given by representatives of his organisation and I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I will start with Professor O'Shea.  In his opening statement he said no taxpayer or Exchequer funds of any kind were used by the university to acquire the IMI.  Was any taxpayer money used or any funds from his organisation used to pay for or discharge borrowings, working capital or liabilities?</p></speech>

Schedule 3, which is a transaction overview, sets out the transaction itself.  It is included in the papers.  It addresses in particular the points that the programme made and the points that we made at the last session here on 30 March.  We purchased the IMI Sandyford campus, just over 13 acres.  That was based on a professional valuation.  The sum of &euro;20 million was used.  We advised the committee at the last meeting and subsequently in writing to follow up that it was funded via borrowings so again there was no public moneys involved.  No Exchequer moneys were provided to UCC for us to acquire that asset.</p> <p>  The third bullet point is consistent with what we said previously, and there is supporting documentation in our papers under Schedule A confirming that.  IMI, with that &euro;20 million discharged two charges that were on that campus.  The charges in effect were mortgages.  The IMI had developed a residential aspect to its offering that had been supported and financed by AIB, so with an element of our &euro;20 million proceeds with which we bought the campus the mortgage was released, discharged and paid back.</p> <p>  In 2012 &ndash; this is a key point &ndash; because when we looked to acquire the IMI previously the existence back then of a pension liability prevented us going ahead.  We did not want to take on a pension liability of a private entity and we paused at that time.  We continued with the alliance and revisited it when that was resolved.  It was resolved in 2012.  That is confirmed in the documentation attached in the accounts in the report we got from Mercer's pension expertise and in our due diligence with PwC.  That charge was also paid with the &euro;20 million from UCC.</p></speech>

The university underpins the borrowings.  We leased the campus back.  The asset was leased back to IMI, so now we in UCC have the asset and it is leased back to IMI.  The lease payment, the income we get in UCC then goes to pay the borrowing that we have back to Ulster Bank.  We bought the campus and leased it back and the lease payment from IMI into UCC, which is new income that we have never got before, goes to service those borrowings.</p> <p>  For us, if we compare where we are now and where we were pre the acquisition, the university has an asset that is appreciating - 13 acres at a cost of &euro;20 million.  That is the reality.  Other recent sales of assets adjacent to Sandyford show it is worth arguably more than that.  So we have an asset that is appreciating.  We have a business that provides executive communication that we did not have before, and we have a better ability to deliver on lifelong learning, which was one of the key objectives set out for the university in the Universities Act.  Our ability to do that now, in particular in the business space, is far better enhanced.</p></speech>

Our interim chief executive, Anne Looney, did so over the weekend with the then president of UCC, such that the paperwork was completed early that Monday morning.

A total of 40 documents were concluded on the Monday morning of 21 November when this was completed.  That is the complexity to which we were referring and there was no advance notice.  The control of the company was signed over from the members of the IMI to UCC, there was an asset purchase and a lot of legal documentation was negotiated over a two-year period.  It was difficult to get across the complexity of that in the space of ten minutes.  It does not mean anything inaccurate was said.</p></speech>

In my mind we need to have a good look at governance within the institution, such as the area of conflicts of interest.  It is not about whether an individual thinks there is a conflict of interest but what a third party would think was one.</p></speech>

I will ask some of the questions that Deputy Cullinane asked already, but I have them made out in order so I am not going to change them.  I am going to stick to them.  The PAC was told that the IMI was not in deficit.  The financial statement for the IMI the year ending 31 December 2015 stated it was in a deficit to the tune of more than &euro;900,000.  Was UCC aware of the deadline and what way did this influence the sale price?</p></speech>

Accounts for 2016 are not completed yet.  The key point is that the price we paid for the campus asset, which is 13 acres of an asset, was based on our independent valuation that was prepared for us by Lisney.  It valued the campus-----</p></speech>

The key benefits for us in UCC are that we are developing and investing in a business school.  UCC has not had an arm of executive education to date.  It will have after the acquisition of IMI.  We will now have an element of our offering that is executive.  We will have undergraduate, postgraduate and executive education.  That was a gap in our offering in business education.  It allows us to meet one of the objectives of the Universities Act.  It positions us better to take in international students.  The Minister launched a document back at the beginning of the year targeting an increase of 25% in international students over the next three years.  Having the IMI helps us better meet those targets.  As I said, it will give us the offering of executive education.  One of the key things for us is that the IMI, with its membership organisation, the level of members, council members-----</p></speech>

The IMI needed &euro;21.8 million.  Therefore, there was a difference of &euro;1.8 million.  I have a breakdown here.  There is &euro;8.1 million to AIB, &euro;13.3 million to set its contractual commitment to defined benefit of pensions, and &euro;400,000 to pay the pension trustees.  What specific campus upgrading works required &euro;1.8 million in order to begin with work in autumn 2016?  Has work started, been tendered or agreed?  If so, when did this happen?  I will ask the three questions again.  How was the &euro;1.8 million figure for the campus upgrade arrived at and when was it agreed?  How did the IMI have access to &euro;1.8 million when UCC repeatedly told the PAC that it required money for working capital?</p></speech>

There are also some supporting documents.  Included in those is document A5, which is a schedule of the planned capital investment refurbishment programme in the IMI.  The &euro;1.8 million will be spent on exterior works on the car park, lighting, access - I am not going to go through all of it - classroom upgrades, interior upgrades, WiFi upgrades that are needed, online learning platforms, ceiling tiles, bathrooms and roofing.  The IMI has a planned programme of investment by which to spend that post-acquisition.</p> <p>  To go back to the point of how the IMI settled and discharged the two charges over the campus, as the Deputy mentioned, UCC paid &euro;20 million.  Therefore, the IMI had that &euro;20 million.  If we look at the IMI's 2015 accounts, the IMI itself had its own cash.  As an entity, by the time the transaction was completed, the IMI had about &euro;1.7 million to &euro;1.8 million of its own cash itself.  Between the IMI's own cash resources and the &euro;20 million it got from UCC, it was able to discharge the two liabilities or charges - the AIB one the Deputy mentioned and the charge that was given to the pension trustees, as well as the &euro;400,000 that was for professional fees.  That did include an element of contingency and not all of it was needed in the end.  The money we gave and the IMI's own cash resources were able to pay those monies.  The investment is set out in document A5.  It was also the intention and view of UCC, once we required the asset - remember that it is our asset as we bought it and are leasing it back - that it was probably a bit tired and needed investment.  The IMI would not have had the resources to invest in it over the years.  It was always our intention to refresh that asset.  The planned investment is &euro;2.5 million over two years, &euro;1.8 million in year one-----</p></speech>

Like the witness said, the money was borrowed to pay off the debt.  UCC told the HEA that it was self-financing.  This meant that it did not have to go through the approval process set out in the borrowing framework.  How much of these lease payments will the IMI pay to UCC each year?  On what basis were these lease payments calculated?  Are they on commercial terms?  How will the IMI afford lease payments of at least &euro;1.7 million a year, and up to &euro;2.7 million depending on the allowances they are egging on for, given that its largest ever operating profit was less than &euro;1 million?  It had a combined operating loss over the last decade of &euro;10 million.  That is interesting.  It would not service its existing loan or pay its settlements to the pension fund.  What contingency has UCC in place to repay the loan if the IMI is not able to generate the consistent profit necessary?  Has the UCC agreed to subsidise or pay the IMI for any services or contribution towards this cost as part of its ongoing activities?  They are important questions.  I ask that they be answered.</p></speech>

I will try to address those now.  As part of our assessment of the IMI, we would have undertaken a full due diligence assessment of that.  We looked at the IMI and lifted the bonnet on its performance, as such.

At this stage, one of the key risk mitigation aspects of a governing board decision was to acquire the asset of IMI.  I am not saying that we were taking a punt.  We totally believe in the IMI and that it will be a success.  It is on an upward trend.  When it resolved its pension liability back in 2012, for the IMI, that was really the path to sustainability.  It no longer had that liability on its balance sheet.  It was on an upward trajectory since then, back growing revenues and back in profits.  The market for executive education is predicted to grow by &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million and the IMI has the greatest market share.  The key assurance-----</p></speech>

Our assessment was to assure the governing body and UCC that the investment would pay off and, were it not to pay off, that we have some fallback.  With the purchase of the 13 acre campus, UCC now owns an asset that is appreciating.  We know from further down the road that sites such as one in Donnybrook recently sold for some &euro;107 million for an asset half the size.  Our site was &euro;20 million and is an asset that is appreciating.  Were there to be some hiccup along the road in the future a part sale of a piece of that campus could be sold or further leased on to recover any investment or downside that we could make.  This asset gives us, in our view, a real mitigation of any risk going forward.</p></speech>

At our last committee meeting I asked a question and I was not satisfied with the answer I got.  Two professors were sent on a sabbatical - I think it was to Australia, I do not have the details in front of me - and it cost a lot of money.  I asked a question about this.  I was told that they went to do a degree course or something.  It was extravagant money.  Two people were released from their jobs in the university and sent to Australia, which was paid for by the University of Limerick.  I thought this was the strangest arrangement I ever saw and with the costs involved, I thought it was jobs for the boys or money for the boys.  Is it a normal arrangement in universities to send off two people, to pay for their costs, to cover all the costs and give them funding to get further education, in Australia of all places? There was not much further one could have sent them.  Is that normal practice and is this still ongoing practice at the University of Limerick?  Incidentally, the RTE programme did not take that too lightly when they showed that.</p></speech>

The first issue is that on RTE they spoke about two people who were sent on externally delivered, continuing education programmes.</p></speech>

This is quite common in the system throughout the world, not just within Ireland.  People periodically go on sabbatical.  It means they leave their posts to go and work in another institution or research in education.  It would be expected that they would bring back new skills to their universities.</p></speech>

I am talking about the payment to send the two people abroad.  I am sorry that I do not have the figures.  I had them in front of me at the last meeting but not today.  I was more than surprised when I saw the costs of this.  Would it be normal practice and would it be good governance by the university to send people abroad in this way?  Experience and further education would be gained and they would bring it back but is this normal practice?  Should those people not go on their own if they want to further their education?  Should they not go under their own power and not have the university and the taxpayers of the State subsidising it?  I find it strange.</p></speech>

Just to let the Chairman know, he is quoted in this matter.  It strikes me that there is a world of a difference in the experience of the two whistleblowers, the two women who came forward and whose evidence is actually very upsetting.  It was seen on RTE.  I am sure Professor Fitzgerald saw it.  I have no reason to believe that he was anything but moved by what they had to say.  They are suspended.  Their lives have been turned topsy-turvy, their reputations traduced, their health impinged upon, because of this experience, for coming forward in good faith, and yet the HR director, Tommy Foy, who misled the Department, is still <i>in situ</i>.</p></speech>

That is entirely not my point.  Professor Fitzgerald knows the point I am making.  When staff, particularly in very senior positions, are found - it is not a question of a mistake or messing up - to have deliberately misled anybody, but particularly a Department, I would have thought there are consequences for them, that there are procedures to deal with that and one is not left weeks or months on an audit where it gets consumed into some kind of paper trail.

I am sure Dr. Thorn is taking full note of what is being said here.  He will look at the transcript.  As Chairman of the committee, it is an extraordinarily disturbing situation, which the Committee of Public Account will have to deal with it in its own way, that information provided by a third level institution, the University of Limerick, is contradicted by information the same institution provided to the Department of Education and Skills.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has also stated that he has not received complete information on these issues either.  It is a wholly unsatisfactory response from the University of Limerick.  Professor Fitzgerald is inheriting quite a situation.  We hope to assist him in any way we can in our strong recommendations when we come to publish our report in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I will not waste any more time on niceties, but I will certainly be polite.  I welcome Professor Fitzgerald and his detailed statement.  It is the first time we have had someone before the committee who has given a detailed statement of what he or she has found and what he or she is going to do.  Perhaps it is because he is new.  If he does what he has said, it will perhaps be a turning point for the third level institutions.  I will wait and see, but I certainly welcome the seven pages and what he has identified.  With regard to the University of Limerick, UL, although feelings do not really have a place at this committee, on a human level, what was Professor Fitzgerald's feeling when he watched the RTE programme?</p></speech>

Professor Fitzgerald has spoken about preserving reputation.  I believe that reputation is earned, just like respect is earned.  I welcome without hesitation what Professor Fitzgerald has said, but preserving the reputation of the university is immaterial to me at the moment given what has been highlighted.  I have had the privilege of going to university.  I regard it as a privilege.  It is very important for Limerick and the area, but reputation is earned and it is earned by a university that is open and accountable with money which primarily comes from the taxpayer.  I see Professor O'Shea nodding.  I am worried and very concerned about the general comment that this is not public money.  We have been through this with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The universities get substantial public moneys.  They are co-mingled with other moneys which, it seems, are separate from the student foundations and trusts, which are not open and accountable.  We will be coming back to trusts and foundations that are not consolidated with accounts.  Generally speaking, the presidents, who all happen to be male, feel that these should not be subjected to public scrutiny at this committee and that the charities are the appropriate thing.  I will come back to that.  What strikes me, and it has already been said by one or two of my colleagues, is the matter of whistleblowers, what they have gone through and what has been said about them.  One of them, who featured on the television programme, said that she just cried and cried, knowing it was a whitewash.  The contrast is stark, is it not?</p></speech>

The wonderful, and I say this publicly, Comptroller and Auditor General and all his staff are also struggling.  RTE is also trying to help uncover these matters.  Would Professor Fitzgerald agree this should not have to happen and that we would not need this tortuous process and "RTE Investigates" to highlight problems if an institution were functioning properly?</p></speech>

It has been quite shocked by what it has heard.  It has instigated a number of actions, such as the internal review of the institution.  It has also had the internal auditors look at some of the specific issues which have been raised.  I do not believe for a moment that the governing authority is, as it were, sitting on its hands about this.  It is being very proactive in trying to understand what happened.  We are very early in the review process.  One of the things we are looking at, and at which I know Dr. Thorn is looking, is what the governing authority knew and what decisions it made, dating back to 2006.</p></speech>

Mr. Collins answered "No" and I will come back to that answer.</p> <p>  The IMI was in trouble in any event and we also have University College Cork.  Let me get this clear because I looked over Deputy Cullinane's very careful questioning.  The entity known as the Irish Management Institute had nothing to do with University College Cork except that it had been working in collaboration with UCC over the years providing joint courses and accreditation.  UCC made a decision to acquire or take over the IMI and did so at no cost.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

To me, it is incredible how much money has been spent on the premises at Lapp's Quay.  I would not say that property management is UCC's strongest suit, to be honest.  I have witnessed the evolution of UCC and I admire some of the stuff that has happened in respect of the campus.  The latter is now very concise, to be fair, and it is unique in that.  However, some of the property transactions that have taken place over the years were questionable.   I hate to think that UCC is in any way into property speculation.

Perhaps that is not quite the word, but they really want to maintain their independence.  On some level I can understand that, but it does not mean that they are above scrutiny.  One of the things that jumped out to me on the &quot;Prime Time&quot; report which I had been aware of to some extent was the degree to which the University of Limerick almost went to war with the <i>Limerick Leader</i>.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a role in oversight, but so do the media.  Does the witness know how much money was spent on that, and what led to the decision to do that instead of addressing the issues?  Shooting the messengers appears to have been the tactic.</p></speech>

I do not have the exact figure but I can provide it.  It is around &euro;60,000.  I am not sure what led to that decision.  The decision was wrong.  I believe that the institution felt under pressure.  It took some time to convince the institution that it should withdraw the suit, and at that stage they realised that it was a bad decision.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear the witness say that he would not have taken that approach, and that is certainly something that should be reviewed or included in the future.  The issues should be dealt with rather than the messenger.</p><p>On the last occasion that the witness was before the committee we spoke about the IMI.  The Committee of Public Accounts sits in public and what is said here is on the record.  Language is very important.  The impression was given that, &quot;we took something over at no cost&quot;.  It is really important when witnesses come in here that that kind of thing is qualified upfront and that the members do not have to piece it together later.  It gives the impression that something is being handed over for nothing, when in fact there was a very significant liability here in terms of pension costs.  That undermines the credibility of what is said here, and we have to go back subsequently and piece things together.  Would the witness accept that he should have approached this matter differently on the last occasion?</p></speech>

I agree that it is always helpful to provide as much information as possible, but when one is speaking extemporaneously it is difficult.

People are losing faith in institutions, whether it is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, religious organisations or the likes of the banks, and the universities sector has certainly played a role in undermining public trust.  One of the things all of these have in common is that they were previously regarded as institutions which could have been trusted.  Rebuilding that trust will be important for all of the witnesses who come before us.  They should be very cognisant of that when they come before us in future.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Their consolidated accounts have been presented to us.  A few phrases have been used in the course of this morning's meeting in particular.  IMI is a 100%-owned subsidiary of UCC.  It is part of the college.  While it has a separate legal identity, it is part of UCC.  If anything goes wrong there, is it ultimately UCC's problem because it is 100% the parent company.  Is that agreed?  Yes, we are agreed on that.  In effect, it is part of the UCC consolidated group.  The phrase "new income" was used several times this morning in relation to the income from IMI.  The income is from the university to the university, however, and I have difficulty.  In the consolidated accounts, it is not as if IMI has one set of income and UCC has another.  In the consolidated accounts, is that money flowing from one part of the group to the other part deconstructed or taken out?  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General say?</p></speech>

When people talked about the IMI, the public's understanding was technically the company and the campus.  However, Mr. Collins is saying the company cost nothing but the campus cost &euro;20 million.  What was in the company if there was none of these assets?</p></speech>

It has taken all the assets out of the company and left the name.  That is actually what the witnesses are telling me.  The Irish Management Institute has done what I would call "a Clerys job" here.  The wealth and assets of the organisation were taken to one side and the company was just a name.  It is just like Clerys.  Do the witnesses get the point I am making?  I do not want them to comment on Clerys.  We are making a comment.  It seems to be that sort of issue of taking the assets out of the company and just leaving the company.  Hence, Mr. Collins can say UCC bought the company for nothing because there was nothing to buy there besides the name.  That was disconcerting to everybody watching.  They could not rationalise what was being said because UCC knew the hairs it was splitting and did not make that clear.  We have a better understanding of this idea that UCC says the IMI cost the taxpayer nothing.  Of course the company cost nothing because there was nothing there.  However, somebody had to raise a loan.</p> <p>  I come back then to the situation of the public funding.  We are told UCC is down to 47% of income coming from public sources.  Is that according to the most recent figures?  It is generally in that bracket.  The last figures available, which I have just seen on the website as the meeting was progressing, are from the 2014 accounts.  I just Googled it and I did not see the 2015 accounts.  It is just for example because the witnesses came in to discuss the 2014 accounts.</p></speech>

Research was a significant source of income but State and semi-State companies provided &euro;55 million of that.  The EU provided &euro;13 million of that.  I am going from the university's accounts here.  That is &euro;158 million, or in the region of 50% of UCC's income.  As such, it is substantially funded directly by the State.  The witnesses are saying it might now be 40%.  Ultimately, what troubles us a little - and we are trying to get to the bottom of the actual cost - relates to page 19 of the document presented here, in Appendix 9, namely the last paragraph, which is boxed.  We will get it on the screen there now.  We are back to this issue of saying no Exchequer moneys were used in the acquisition.  We accept that.  It was bank money that was used to acquire it.  If something goes wrong, however, it could ultimately fall back to the college to pay for it.  On day 1, the bank paid for it, but if things do not work out, it could fall back to UCC.  I am just looking.</p><p>I will read to the witnesses the last paragraph in their own note that they provided to us.  It is not on screen.  It states:</p><blockquote>The university has acquired an appreciating asset.  Were UCC to consider at some stage in future recovering its investment, recent land sales adjacent to IMI would suggest that any future sale of the campus would yield a return to UCC in excess of the amount paid.</blockquote> <p>We now hear the university justifying the price it paid on the basis that: &quot;Sure, we are going to have a property boom.  Values are going to go up.&quot;  That is UCC's Appendix 9 to us today.  When Deputy Alan Kelly asked, UCC said it had no intention, but it in its documentary evidence, it is a consideration because it has highlighted in a big, black box what would happen at some stage in the future if UCC were to consider it.  As such, it is a possibility.</p><p>They have somewhat hedged this &euro;20 million cost against the fact that the properties will rise in value anyway.  Do the witnesses not see how we find that a little disconcerting for a third level college?

All the indicators we have - our market assessment, its market share and its upturn in performance - show it is not a basket case.  It is improving revenue and bottom line profit.  As part of the governing body decision to invest in the IMI, acquire the campus and invest &euro;20 million, it wanted to have, as part of a risk assessment and risk mitigation, some comfort that were it to go wrong, we would have an option to recover that investment.  That is one of the reasons UCC bought the campus.  It now has the asset; the IMI does not.  It is the UCC's governing body's future call and decision either to invest in that asset again or divest from it were the IMI in UCC not to be a success.  As part of the formal consideration of the impact of an acquisition in our accounts, we have to get a fair value assessment of the asset post-acquisition and we know from that market value assessment that the value today is greater than what we paid.</p></speech>

It is Dr. Thorn and Professor Fitzgerald?  I apologise for getting the title wrong.  I am pleased that the witnesses are here because it is important that as a committee and as a sector that we begin to look forward rather than going over the entrails of the past.  As the witnesses will be aware, this is round three for the University of Limerick regarding very serious allegations brought forward by whistleblowers, with perhaps the most serious allegation being that there was a whitewash.  That is the essence of what the whistleblowers assert.  As we now know, they have been suspended for two years.  I want to talk to Dr. Thorn about his role and so on.  Our time is limited so I am sure he will assist and we will try to be brief in our interactions.</p> <p>  Could Dr. Thorn tell me who approached him and appointed him to take on this review?</p></speech>

I will state it very directly.  If there is anything in Dr. Thorn's professional dealings that compromises his willingness or ability to look at all these matters dispassionately and thoroughly, then we have a problem.  It would be a problem in any scenario but it is a much bigger problem because the nub of the accusation against the university and its processes is one of whitewash, but Dr. Thorn has told me that is not the case and I take him at his word in that.  I ask because the questions had to be asked rather than to cast an aspersion on his character.  I want Dr. Thorn to understand that.</p><p>If Dr. Thorn recalls, I quoted from an article in the <i>Limerick Leader </i>earlier regarding the whistleblowers and the length of their suspension.  The Chairman is quoted in it and so too is Dr. Thorn, where he says that he will not be seeking to speak to Professor Don Barry, the previous president of the University of Limerick. </p></speech>

To date, we have been gathering substantial amounts of information.  That information has been analysed.  We are in the process this week, in fact tomorrow, of determining who we want to speak with.  We have already offered invitations to around 25 people who have made submissions and on the basis of our work tomorrow I will make a determination about who else I want to speak with.  It is quite probable and possible that I will want to speak with Professor Barry.</p></speech>

He is examining things such as governance, culture, the turn of events, HR processes.  It is a fairly extensive piece of work that is being carried out so how on earth could there have been a question in Dr. Thorn's mind over whether or not he would speak to Professor Barry?</p></speech>

When I read that, it really troubled me that Dr. Thorn was wondering if he would or would not speak to Professor Barry.  The article in question is much more definitive.  It says that he would not be looking to speak to him.  When I went and had a look at Dr. Thorn's profile and saw that he had had an involvement with a college associated with the university, that troubled me even more.  I cannot speak on their behalf, but if I was one of the whistleblowers who had been through the experience that they have been through, I would want to know who Dr. Thorn is and would want to be satisfied about his bona fides and his objectivity and absolute impartiality.  I would be concerned on that score.  I want to give Dr. Thorn the opportunity to place on record his absolute impartiality, objectivity and the fact that there are no conflicts of interest in carrying out his task, for the whistleblowers in particular but also for the staff and students of Limerick and the greater region.  I would be obliged if he would do that.</p></speech>

It is disingenuous to say that.  I will take back the word "disingenuous" because that is upsetting Mr. Collins.  I will stick to the facts.  The university got a loan from Ulster Bank but it got that on the basis that it is a public body.  It is a recognised university that is 50% funded by the taxpayer.  In the past, the taxpayer provided even more funding.  On the basis of its record and on the basis of public money, the university is able to secure loans.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The witnesses are nodding.  Representatives of every institution have nodded, as the representative of UL nodded earlier about issues prior to his time.  I have his opening statement.  The witnesses have given me reassurance that in respect of employment matters, the guidelines are always complied with.

Beyond that basic information, we cannot go too far because we are party to a confidentiality agreement in relation to that settlement.  However, the payment that has been made has been long-standing.  It was a prerequisite of UCC's governing body's approval of the acquisition that the legal case be settled.  The university would not take on the IMI if there were any outstanding legal cases.  That legal case was settled and the payment that continues to be made to the person concerned is from IMI revenue.</p></speech>

It is not a pension in so far as it is not linked to the performance of the pension asset and it is not paid by the pension trustees but by the IMI.  We do not know what the performance of the pension asset will be, but were that asset to go into decline, this individual would still get paid that separate payment.

The morning session took quite a bit of time, and then the voting session in the D&aacute;il took much longer than expected.  We will proceed with this afternoon's business.  We will continue with our follow-up on the third level education sector.  For this session, we are joined by Professor Brian Norton, Dr. Noel O'Connor, Mr. Colm Whelan and Dr. Philip Cohen from Dublin Institute of Technology; and by Dr. Brendan Murphy and Mr. Paul Gallagher from Cork Institute of Technology.  We are also joined by Ms Colette Drinan, director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, in substitution for Mr. Seamus McCarthy.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Drinan to make a brief opening statement on Cork Institute of Technology, since representatives from it were not here at the last meeting.  Then I will ask Professor Norton and Dr. Murphy for opening statements, if they have statements.</p></speech>

The institute's consolidated income for the year amounted to &euro;97 million, of which State grant funding accounted for &euro;37 million.  Tuition fee income of nearly &euro;31 million included fees of &euro;5.6 million paid by the State and student contribution income of over &euro;18 million.  Research grant income was &euro;15 million.  A percentage breakdown of income is shown in the diagram on-screen.  Expenditure in the year was nearly &euro;98 million.  Approximately 68% of this was accounted for by staff costs.  A detailed analysis of expenditure is given in note 12 of the accounts.  The institute incurred a deficit of &euro;1.2 million for the year, and had an accumulated deficit of &euro;1 million on 31 August 2015.</p></speech>

Such arrangements represent a very small proportion of DIT provision and are entered into where there is clear student demand and where, for reasons of resources, we cannot deliver the programme in-house.  Students registered on such a programme are recognised as full DIT students with access to services, from the medical centre and counselling, to sports, clubs and societies. The DIT commercial modern music degree, delivered through the British and Irish Modern Music Institute Dublin, BIMM Dublin, is an example of such a programme which has run very successfully for five years.  The future delivery is currently under public tender.<br/><br/>We also provided further information concerning the library subscription service, Swets UK.  This company had been procured through a national public tender in 2012 but went into bankruptcy in 2014.  DIT has provided an additional document to the committee that relates to an investigation undertaken by DIT and conducted by an external consultant, Ernst &amp;amp; Young, EY, into the processes that gave rise to the payment by DIT to Swets UK.  The issues raised in this report are also addressed in the final management report, which was submitted in July 2016 to this committee.  I regret that the EY report was not specifically included.  There were press reports this morning in <i>The Irish Times </i>that the report was not provided to this committee, but we have a receipt from the secretariat for the Committee of Public Accounts dating to 31 May 2017 that it was received.  I would like that to be in the record for the avoidance of doubt, since there seems to be a public view that it has not been submitted.  It has been.</p></speech>

For example, they included annual rental for DIT buildings, utilities and energy costs, catering contracts, audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and library resources.  These payments now go through the levels of formal approval required by our finance system for all payments under our authority to bind.</p><p> A loss of &euro;718,000 was incurred by DIT as a result of the Swets UK bankruptcy.  We subsequently procured the required services through another supplier at a cost of &euro;760,000.  While the cost is higher, the terms of the new contract do not require full prepayment and therefore reduce the exposure to potential commercial failure.  DIT has been excluded from IReL, the Irish Research electronic Library which is funded by the HEA and to date has only been available to universities.  Access to this resource would reduce our exposure to the viability of commercial provision.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we yesterday received notification that a process is under way to grant DIT access to it.</p><p> The scale of the loss incurred by the Swets bankruptcy reflects the scale of the library service in DIT, which accounts for approximately 6% of our annual non-pay expenditure.  The service provides access to relevant and current texts, research and related findings for our student population of 20,500 who are pursuing courses at levels from apprenticeship to PhD and our academic staff of over 1,200.  The library's extensive resources include 286,000 books, 18,500 dissertations and updated subscriptions to approximately 35,000 online journals, periodicals and databases to support students across a wide range of activities and disciplines and support our research activity.</p><p> We currently operate six libraries, which are located in Aungier Street, Kevin Street, Bolton Street, Cathal Brugha Street, Rathmines and Grangegorman.  Their dispersed nature adds to costs.  This will be alleviated by the development of a single library on the new single DIT campus.</p><p> I am delighted to say that despite some recent setbacks, by late 2019 DIT will have 10,000 students on campus at Grangegorman.  There are currently 1,200 students, researchers and entrepreneurs on campus and it is already making a very significant contribution to Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  Over the next five years, the development of the campus will assist in transforming this part of the city through contributing to the renewal of neglected areas and creating opportunities for educational access, community engagement and economic vitality.  Served by the new cross-city Luas line, it will change the map of Dublin.</p><p> Finally, I would like to briefly mention technological university legislation.  Since the publication of the Hunt report on higher education in 2011 and its adoption as national policy, DIT has been working closely with our partners in IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown towards creating a technological university for Dublin.  We have successfully gone through stage three of the four-stage application process.  We understand that the proposed legislation to enable us to move to stage four may come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the very near future.  We ask members to support this legislation in order that, building on our combined strengths, we can create our new institution to serve the Dublin region.</p><p> I thank members for this opportunity to answer any questions they may have.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to do so fully and frankly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.1052" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#NN00200"><p>I thank the chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for 2015 and the KPMG reports conducted into anonymous allegations made in 2014.  I am joined by the vice president for finance and administration, Mr. Paul Gallagher.  Given that it is our first appearance before the committee, perhaps I could outline what CIT is all about.  It is one of the largest, most progressive and successful institutes of technology in the country with approximately 11,000 higher education students, 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT&rsquo;s Bishopstown campus comprises 38 ha, including major sports facilities, research centres and the Rubicon innovation centre.  The CIT Crawford College of Art and Design and the CIT Cork School of Music are both based in the city centre, and the National Maritime College of Ireland is based in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, close to the naval base in Haulbowline.  CIT is a major national provider of STEM education and research.  Its annual income and expenditure is approximately &euro;100 million and research activity constitutes 20% of its total budget.  CIT, in partnership with IT Tralee, has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.</p> <p>  CIT enjoys a national and international reputation for the quality of its education and research and the professional capabilities of its graduates.  It leads Irish higher education in the recognition of work-based learning and prior learning and the development of joint degrees, which is done in conjunction with UCC and universities in Europe.  The quality of its education programmes and research is overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  Its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees: audit, finance and strategic development.  Its internal audit, while tendered for on a sectoral basis, operates on an independent basis in each institution.  It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the HEA has a regulatory oversight of the institutes of technology.</p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a very challenging financial environment since 2008, with significantly increased higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT has continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges as may be seen in our 2015 financial statements.  CIT incurred deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015.  I apologise because the figure of &euro;126 given in the briefing in this regard should read &euro;126,000.  The representatives of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be glad to know that we both agree that the deficit was &euro;1.2 million rather than &euro;1,216.  It is amazing that one can read something and miss a vital detail.  A break-even position was recorded in the 2015 to 2016 academic year and, following an extensive review and planning process in conjunction with a HEA process, forecasts for the next four years demonstrate the ability of the institute to remain in a sustainable financial position.  The forecast for the academic year 2016 to 2017 is in line with expectations.</p> <p>  The reason for the deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 relate, in the main, to the STEM and apprenticeship areas.  In terms of STEM, the funding model has negatively impacted on the weighting of funding in this area following the introduction of the flat-rate student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum.  In terms of apprenticeship, CIT had approximately 100 staff working in this area in 2008 and carried the cost of maintaining these staff during a period of collapse in provision.  Fortunately, the area of apprenticeship is now experiencing significant growth and is contributing directly to the recovery in CIT&rsquo;s financial position.</p> <p>  CIT has always been prompt in the submission of its financial statements to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  With a year end of 31 August and deadline for submission of 31 December, CIT has consistently submitted its accounts in late October or November.  CIT's last set of financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016 are expected to be signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General this month.  No outstanding issues of a high rating are expected.</p> <p>  The committee has indicated that it wishes to revisit the issue of the KPMG report.  This report relates to two anonymous letters received by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 in regard to CIT.  As for the first anonymous letter received in March 2014, a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice, the audit committee, again with the agreement of governing body and via the independent legal advisers Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.</p> <p>  KPMG&rsquo;s engagement was structured on a phased approach to ensure that the audit committee could retain oversight of the investigation while ensuring KPMG had sufficient freedom to complete its work.  KPMG&rsquo;s remit was to investigate the allegations as presented and was not limited to the handling of the process by CIT.  Indeed, KPMG noted in its report that it did not note any material limitations of scope as part of the review which prevented it from completing the scope of work as set out.</p><p>The phased approach included a review of the anonymous letters and management responses; a corporate governance review and review of internal policies and procedures and CIT&rsquo;s compliance; a review of expenditure documentation in CIT and its subsidiaries; consideration of whether each allegation had been addressed; and production of a comprehensive report of findings. </p><p> The results of the KPMG review were as follows: 32 of the allegations contained insufficient evidence to allow further review; 35 were responded to sufficiently at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; 52 were deemed repetitious to other allegations in the same letter; and 56 allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and of those 56 allegations, 47 were deemed to require no further action as they had been adequately addressed by the institute; three were considered to contain no evidence and therefore needed no further action; and six allegations were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. </p><p> In respect of the second anonymous letter received in December 2014, another 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appeared to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review, which determined that two of the allegations had been previously addressed by KPMG and did not require any further action; three were sufficiently addressed at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; one was deemed repetitious to previous allegations; and 15 of the allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and those 15 allegations were then deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute. </p><p> In summary, the outcome of the KPMG independent reviews was that of a total of 196 allegations, 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. </p><p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee was considered by the governing body at its meeting on 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations, all individuals and-or agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute&rsquo;s executive. </p><p> During the course of the extensive KPMG reviews, a small number of issues were found aside from the 196 allegations contained in the anonymous letters.  As is the case with any audit report, these matters and management responses were considered by the audit committee and controls were changed or strengthened as appropriate.  A full copy of the audit committee&rsquo;s final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body also provided the HEA with a full written account of the process undertaken to address the matter.  The matter was also addressed at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 and extracts from the relevant statements of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are attached in the appendix provided today.  All attest to the satisfactory manner in which CIT dealt with the matter. </p><p> We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions it may have on these and other matters. </p></speech>

Did he watch the "RTE Investigates" programme?  Was there anything in it that surprised him or on which he would like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.1056" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian Norton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062200002#OO00400"><p>As I said in the opening statement, two aspects need to be clarified.  The impression was given that the loss from SWETS UK was of two amounts.  The bankruptcy loss was &euro;718,000 but the service that was subsequently procured was a budget amount that applied to that.  There was only one sum of money lost yet the impression was given that there were two.  Additionally, the impression was given that the review by Ernst &amp;amp; Young had identified sums of money that were not properly approved through our processes and that somehow, some money had gone amiss.  The approval process in its transaction had not been appropriate and we amended that subsequently.  However, those monies were budgeted for, approved and procured.</p> <p>  The other observation I would make is that the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report itself had been provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA and fully discussed with the latter.  This was alluded to in the covering report we supplied to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is to the regret of our governing body and my own personal regret that we did not provide it here.  We did not do so because the issues and what we have done about them were covered in the management report we provided.  Again, there is a suggestion that in not providing the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report we were not giving the full information to the committee or that we were misleading the committee.  I can assure the members that this was not the case.</p></speech>

Subsequently, we received the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report.  I have just dug out the transcript of our meeting from 6 April.  Professor Nolan told us that the service had been contracted for the previous 15 years.  I asked if the controls would be as robust as if a new service was being contracted.  Essentially, the response was that the kind of due diligence carried out would have been as if it had been a first-time contract.  It is very interesting to compare that transcript to the content of the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report.  The system that it seems to have gone though really consisted of somebody in the library signing off on it.  It was assigned at director level and did not go through the Agresso system, which would have provided checks and balances at either end.  This was a very large amount of money.  It looks to me like due diligence was not performed as I was led to believe it was when I asked the question on 6 April.</p></speech>

It should have done and we have amended our process to ensure that this happens in future.  In respect of the exact due diligence that we undertook previously, I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Colm Whelan.</p></speech>

The references in the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report are to the effect that it did not go through our standard workflow process in Agresso.</p></speech>

The tender exercise was concluded in 2012.  It resulted in a contract for a three-year period and in the course of that three-year period, Swets UK and its parent company failed.  The loss came from the failure of Swets UK and our exposure to that company in the magnitude of the pre-payment we had made.</p></speech>

I hope they have.  We got some information about that the last time the witnesses appeared before the committee.  It is a very large amount of money and if anything could have been done to prevent it I think it is incumbent on us to make sure it is scrutinised.  There seems to be quite a small number of very large payments that go through annually.  I think 60 or 70 is the figure mentioned.  Why would something of this size not be signed off on?  Why would it not have been signed off on at the appropriate levels in advance so that all the checks and balances kicked in?</p></speech>

I stress that it is not to say the amount was not scrutinised and known.

It would have been self-evident that it should be the report provided to us.  It is after the event.  It would have been very helpful to us while going through this if we could match it against the much longer report that was internally generated as a consequence of this report.  Having an independent pair of eyes on this is what we wanted.  I have a question mark in my mind about managing the fall-out from this on the information that was provided to us.  I do not know if Professor Norton agrees with me on that but that is certainly what it feels like.  What management arrangements have been put in place on due diligence, specifically for very large amounts?  Are the witnesses just sticking with the rules that were already in place?  Are there other controls?</p></speech>

Anything I sign comes with a recommendation from a director to sign it having checked all due diligence beforehand.  We are all in a clear workflow process and all major contracts come to us in a leadership team meeting and are signed off there.  There are very thorough policies on double checking all the due diligence on all major contracts and making sure we look at multi-annual values, because it can creep into higher values by looking at a particular year's value.  We look at both contracts that come to us and contracts we pay out.</p> <p>  Is there anything else I have missed?</p></speech>

It was set up many years ago at the behest of the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to provide computer services to the institutes of technology, ITs.  It was hosted by DIT as DIT's legislation enabled it to host a subsidiary company and I understand the legislation for the other institutes of technology did not allow that to happen.  The company is funded directly by the HEA and has a board which is chaired by the president of another institute of technology, usually in rotation or a senior figure from an institute of technology, and has a membership drawn from representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the institutes of technology, including DIT.  It is a body that provides services across the sector.  Now I will hand over to Dr. O'Connor.</p></speech>

Accounts for the company have been approved by the board of An Cheim and by the auditors for the company, the Comptroller and Auditor General, earlier this month.</p> <p>  A full overview of the wind-down is contained in the statement of internal control in the accounts which will be posted by the end of this month on the Oireachtas website, and they relate to 31 August 2016.  With the permission of the committee and in the spirit of absolute transparency, I will go through some of the summary of the statement of internal control.  The company was established as a shared service support to the institutes of technology.  The main focus of the company was to deliver on a range of technology related systems, management information systems, MIS, to support human resources, student records, library management and finance needs across the ITs, for approximately 100,000 students and 7,000 staff.  It covered everything from registration, examinations and data management to all staff related systems.  The company was incorporated in 2006 with its own board of directors and a chief executive officer, CEO, with an annual budget from the HEA.  In 2013, as part of the consolidation of State agencies and also to provide an opportunity for greater synergies within the wider higher education sector, it was agreed to transfer the services of An Cheim to a new company, EduCampus Computer Services Limited, to be formed as a subsidiary of HEAnet and to wind down An Cheim.  There was a logic to that and it was a wise decision.</p> <p>  The process of gaining all the necessary governance approvals to establish EduCampus with charitable status and to transfer An Cheim services and assets to it was undertaken through 2014 and 2015.  A key objective of all parties was to ensure the continuity of service for core business applications across the ITs.  Accordingly, the smooth transfer of activity, staff and resources from An Cheim to EduCampus was seen as being very important.</p> <p>  On 1 October 2015, the HEA transferred all funding of activities from An Cheim to EduCampus and all suppliers and clients of An Cheim were informed.  Five of the eight An Cheim staff transferred to EduCampus and three returned to DIT.  The CEO of An Cheim remained as CEO to direct the contract novation process and to wind down the company.  An Cheim retains-----</p></speech>

Dr. Love is kidding me.  This is a rapid-fire round, but this is just wrong.  I am sorry but that is my opinion.  It is not a reflection on the witnesses individually.  Can I just say how wrong I think this is?  The HEA is going to have to start over in respect of CIT and do it all over again.  That is my belief.</p> <p>  I am stuck for time so I will move on.  As this is a rapid-fire round, I would appreciate it if the witnesses would write to us because they are not going to get to answer all of the questions.  I have to give a fair time to answer.  The amounts for professional fees, travel and subsistence are very high.  Can the witnesses provide a spreadsheet for the past five years on the amounts of money involved and set out why they were so high?  On the document that was sent in, how could a document redacted to that extent have been accepted?  How does one know what is behind the blacked-out portions?</p></speech>

This is a judgment call.  We are guessing here.  I have a number of questions in respect of which the witnesses might write back.  How much has been spent on PR firms in the past five years?  Were any pictures or portraits commissioned in the college during Dr. Murphy's tenure and, if so, how much did they cost?  He might also get his organisation to write in about the terms of the retirement package he will be receiving.  I would also like to know about the subsidiary accounts of the student services company which are not auditable by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Will Dr. Murphy agree to an independent review and audit of those accounts for the past five years?  He can come back to us in writing.</p></speech>

For my few minutes, DIT is off the hook because my focus is on CIT.  At the outset, I have a proposal as a new member who was not here the last time CIT was before the committee and there was a possibility to consider some of these matters.  With the onset of the election, it was impossible for the previous committee to continue its work and we now only have a two-member overlap in the membership of the current committee.  As such, I propose that the KPMG report, the whistleblower report or whatever was provided to the last committee be provided to all members of the current committee.  While we are doing a report on our hearings of the last few weeks, I propose that we schedule an early meeting after the recess to recommence the consideration by the new committee and perhaps do a complete job.  Due to the calling of the election, the previous committee was not in a position to do that.</p></speech>

If they were implicated, how could they be party to that and concurrently be heads of an organisation within which the terms of reference were set?  There is an inherent governance problem there.  Maybe legislative change is needed to ensure that when these types of things happen, they can be dealt with.  Representatives of the Garda have been attending this committee this week.  I am sure the witness saw some of it.  Without prejudice to the outcome of the issue, there is a problem with people investigating themselves.  Everyone might be innocent but there is a problem.  To say that there was a robust process, the boxes were ticked, everything was gone through and nothing was found is fine.  Maybe the outcome would be no different if the terms of reference were set by the HEA or the Department of Education and Skills and the review were carried out independently.

I am criticising them, not the witness specifically, although he does not escape all criticism.  Those bodies should not have accepted that.  It was inappropriate governance for them to accept a set of guidelines set by the witness's organisation.  People, however innocent they may be, who were potentially implicated by a whistleblower's report were party, albeit with a couple of degrees of separation, to setting the terms of reference.  That is wrong and it stinks to high heaven.  In terms of people's innocence and good standing, it does nothing for the good name of those implicated that the HEA had a look and concluded that it looked great.  In their interest, we will start again in September.  One thing that jumped out and bothered me was that, as Deputy Kelly said, a portrait of the witness was painted.  I have seen it and it is very good.  Is there an art college in CIT?</p></speech>

All these organisations were well paid to do work for the institutes.  I want a ten-year look-back, broken down by year, institute and what work each organisation did for the institutes and how much they were paid.  It strikes me that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Perhaps Mr. Love can explain why the HEA exists at all if all this money is being handsomely earned by these organisations?  He has mentioned self-regulation, self-investigation and self-examination by the institutes on several occasions today and sees that as a good thing.  Ireland does not have a good history of self-examination or self-investigation.  The HEA exists for a reason.  Why does it exist and why does Mr. Love, a well-paid public servant, head up that organisation?  What is his role in regard to the process when complaints are made and examined?</p></speech>

To answer his second question, our functions are threefold: first, to fund the system and allocate State funding to the institutions in a transparent and clear manner; second, to provide oversight, and I will return to that topic in a moment; and third, to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister, assist with policy development and so on.  Our second function, oversight, has been beefed up significantly since the Hunt report in 2013 in terms of helping to develop the system, technological universities, clusters and so on.  I do not want to give the committee the impression that we think the only reliance should be on self-investigation.  It is a good thing that we get the level of governance and capacity to assess things at a considerable level in an individual institute------</p></speech>

Why does the HEA not have the in-house capacity and experience to do that work itself?  Why is further money being spent on these organisations?  The institutes are hiring and paying them over and over again.  That the organisations benefit from being hired by the institutes must have some impact on their work.  I am not satisfied that that is truly independent.  That view is shared by some other committee members.  There is a practice of outsourcing of governance and oversight and that is not good enough.  Mr. Love has said he will revert to the committee with the breakdown.  However, I am concerned that that is what I am hearing from him today and it is also my experience from dealing with these matters over recent months in this committee.</p></speech>

I can think of one quite recent one in relation to the HSE internal audit into Console.  That entire document was presented to the committee.  We decided to note it and not to publish it because it was not our document, and not one syllable ever leaked.  Others, outside of the Oireachtas, who had copies of that document chose to put it into the media.</p> <p>  I would ask - this is a comment across the board for all Accounting Officers - if documents are being sent here in a redacted manner in future that Accounting Officers consult with the committee secretariat regarding the use of the document.  I fully understand there was a belief that we would be publish it and I can understand that concern, but that need not always be the case.  We can make arrangements and we have successfully done that and protected the identity of those included, and specifically chose not to publish a report.  That is a general comment to all Accounting Officers.</p></speech>

We did indicate in the correspondence there had been an internal review.  We did not supply the internal review because the report dealt with all the issues in that internal review, but in our covering letter we indicated such a review existed and that was supplied to this committee in July of last year.  We also supplied the report to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the HEA.  So there was no attempt to conceal it.  As I said earlier on in my response to Deputy Catherine Murphy, I do not want to use the word again and be tedious, but I think we should have provided it.  We provided it to everybody else but we felt that the report we provided - because we were not asked for a report; we were asked to answer the specific questions - answered fully all those questions that we were actually asked in the request from the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

This committee is going to produce a report on the third level institutes.  The HEA's role in examinations and investigations should form part of it.  The committee needs to consider whether it is satisfied with the use of these external companies and the handsome money they are paid to do work, and whether that is truly independent, given that the institutes themselves pay and write the cheques.  Hopefully, when that work is done we might tease out some of these issues with Dr. Love and his team.</p></speech>

That comes out of the Hunt report.  We have started down that road and we need more and we will do more.  I want to stress that even where we have an oversight and the capacity to go in and investigate, we should not let institutions off the hook for the capacity for a certain capability of that themselves.  It is important that they have that capacity through their audit committees and otherwise.  Yes, we should sit above that and be capable of going in when necessary.  That is a culture that we want to improve in the institutions.</p></speech>

I will return to CIT.</p> <p>  The issues regarding DIT have been well rehearsed.  I want to welcome DIT to Grangegorman.  It is within a stone's throw of where I live.  The campus is stunning and I wish the DIT well there.  It will be a big opportunity for the inner city and for educational opportunity in our neighbourhoods, which is much needed.  I would like to talk with them about that at some stage.  I hope they will take this in the spirit in which it is intended, because it is mildly critical, but I do not find its staff very engaging with the community.  It is a problem and I will talk to Professor Norton about it on another occasion.  I have been very frustrated in trying to make it happen and I hope he will hear that message.</p> <p>   It was December 2015 when Dr. Murphy was here last, so it was on the brow of a general election.  Does he remember I asked him what was going on?  He had a whole series of anonymous allegations that came in two waves.  I felt at the time he had been a little dismissive; he wondered who was to get into the mindset of someone who would bring forward these allegations and I suggested to him that perhaps he might look at the culture in CIT and what was going on.  It is quite something for people to come forward, albeit anonymously, with such a comprehensive critique of the organisation for which Dr. Murphy is in charge.  I do not know if Dr. Murphy is still active or has he retired?     </p></speech>

When Dr. Murphy was before the committee the last time, 10 December 2015, we asked questions about staff retiring and then returning to work.  Interestingly, after Dr. Murphy's appearance, we received a letter from the Cork colleges branch of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI.  In that letter, the information which Dr. Murphy gave to this committee was contradicted.  Does he recall the evidence he gave to the committee on the previous occasion?</p></speech>

The question was put.  Dr. Murphy was asked if people had retired and come back to work and he said:</p><blockquote>Up to this academic year, we did not.  However, in the context of industrial action by the Teachers Union of Ireland, under which it basically instructed its members to engage in no overtime whatsoever, there have been a number of cases in which, because of the specialised nature of the expertise being sought and the difficulty of operating at short notice ... we have had occasion to look to retired staff.  A note I have in front of me says that four lecturers who were retired have been brought back on a part-time basis.</blockquote> <p>He then went on to elaborate on this topic.  The TUI told us that his response is contradicted by information that CIT provided to the teaching union under a freedom of information request.  That response said that 15 retired staff members have been re-engaged by CIT.  There is quite a discrepancy there, is there not?</p></speech>

It is like being ambushed in a sense.  I do not wish to do that.  If I just stay general for a moment and then I will ask my three or four specific questions.  I have noticed over recent engagements that we are dragging things out of institutions.  The HEA is reliant on the institutions to be more or less self-managing.  We have all these independent outsiders coming in, such as EY.  At the same time, every single third level institution tells us that it has no money.  We need money for all these third level institutions.</p> <p>  For me, the worst thing, and the most worrying thing, is the blurring of the boundary between industry and education.  It is jumping out.  A question was asked earlier in respect of some company, the name of which I did not quite catch.  One of my colleagues asked whether it paid rent, as they were based on the campus.  The answer was vague, that it does not pay rent because it is not really based there.  They pay dividends.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, which is not here today, has a foundation which operates from an office in the university but which does not pay rent.  There is all this language around the situation being very good for the institutions.  In the guise of education, we are being told what is good for us with very little accountability.  Regarding the two institutions here today, I presume there are no foundations or trusts in question.  Is that right?</p></speech>

It is a net contributor of philanthropic gifts to DIT.  If it were a policy decision that it should pay rent, we would obviously abide by that, but it is of net benefit to DIT.</p></speech>

If I take the case of NUIG, its foundation does not pay rent, as Professor Norton is saying of DIT's foundation, because they give money.  They give money under conditions, however.  We do not know what the conditions are.  I am just taking it as an example.  It builds many buildings as opposed to looking at poverty or putting in a professor of Irish, a vacancy which has existed for a long time.</p><p>The money is coming with conditions and with a corporate tinge because we have a list of who is on the foundation in New York.  I will come back to this separately in respect of all the foundations on another occasion.  Goldman Sachs, Coca Cola and so on make contributions with no discussion over control.  All we are being told is the DIT has no control over the foundation.  The relevant question is what control the foundation has over education in those colleges.  That is just a comment.</p></speech>

The DIT foundation is a small operation.  It operates to the benefit of DIT.  The gifts come directly to DIT and the foundation has a particular function for particular activity.  It follows all charity commission guidelines.  Its accounts are audited and they will be consolidated with those of DIT so there will be full disclosure.</p></speech>

The president and I, as directors and senior members, sit on the foundation board.  In our case, the board is working towards the new code of practice for foundations and charities.  All the accounts are on the website.  Everything is accessible.</p> <p>  On the point relating to restricted and unrestricted funding for certain projects, there has been a strong emphasis in DIT on a balance around scholarships for students, targeting disadvantage and channelling the funding obtained through the foundation towards improving participation in higher education.  A good example of that recently, albeit with a corporate element, is the new access apprenticeship programme trying to improve gender in apprenticeships.  It is entirely funded through the foundation.</p></speech>

I look forward to getting more information on it.  That contrasts with the Galway foundation, which is the richest foundation in the country.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Dr. Murphy regarding his college.

In Portland Row it was fine art and in Temple Bar it was photography.  We have the building in Mountjoy Square on a long-term lease and we want to continue to use the property.  It is close to our campus in Cathal Brugha Street but we do not provide libraries at all our sites.  We only provide libraries at six sites and students move between them.  We have a range of access programmes in Mountjoy Square and the students there use the library in Cathal Brugha Street.  We keep this under review, because if there is a particular need for a subset of library stock, we will provide that.</p> <p>  There are a number of access programmes, such as mature access programmes as well as more traditional programmes, which are offered as taster programmes for a range of things.  These exist in Mountjoy Square and other campuses.</p></speech>

There are two distinct programmes in Mountjoy Square.  One is a mature student access programme targeting students aged 22 or over, of whom there are 100.  It is a very important one-year programme for individuals who want to come back into higher education.  There is also an international foundation programme targeting students coming to Ireland from abroad who have to make up a gap in their education before entering into higher education, very often involving adjusting to another country, city and language.  Both programmes run side by side and have been very effective.  The mature students access programme targets the Dublin city region and the north inner city in particular, and it is funded through philanthropy.  The students do not pay fees and can pick up their entire grant when they start third-level programmes.  Along with the international students, when they successfully complete the programme and meet the requirements they automatically move into mainstream undergraduate programmes.</p></speech>

There were six libraries and there are six libraries and we are still spending 6% of our non-pay budget on libraries.  There was no diminution in the resources available to those libraries and, historically, in the 130 years of the Dublin Institute of Technology students in DIT, which has many more than six sites, have moved to other sites to access library provision.  Increasingly, library provision is actually online.  That is actually what the Swets UK contract is for but Dr. Cohen can talk about the actual provision on Mountjoy Square.</p></speech>

It is the equivalent of the Health Service Executive telling the committee that it had not closed a health centre on Mountjoy Square but moved it to Grangegorman.  It is meaningless to tell people in Mountjoy Square that the facility has not been closed.  The centre that was on the square no longer exists and has moved miles across the city.

Just to be clear, in Mountjoy Square originally and in the surrounding areas, including Portland Row, there were nearly 1,300 students.  We had students in the department of photography in Temple Bar who had a lot further to travel to get access to a library.  Portland Row students had to do the exact same.  Those students have now moved up onto the campus and they are thrilled and delighted.  We would want the same level of service for those students, as the Chairman rightly said.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleague, can I just say that DIT has fully supported the mature student access programme.  We are getting no funding from the State for it.  We are funding that ourselves through our own philanthropy.  That is a huge commitment.  In both cases, we have put in designated full-time co-ordinators to work on those programmes.  We have two individuals, which is very unusual, we have 1,000 access students spread across the rest of DIT and we have 1,200 students with disabilities spread across the rest of DIT.  We are hugely committed to this.  I accept entirely that what is happening in Mountjoy Square is not ideal.  We are desperately trying to balance the fact that, through no fault of our own but through a legal challenge, all of those students who should be moving into brand new facilities, that move has been pushed back to September 2019.</p></speech>

That has remained pretty much constant and has not changed up or down.  We have maintained that even though financial pressure on the institution, etc., made that challenging to do.  We are committed to providing a full library service to all students.  I should say from my direct personal experience - I have the pleasure of meeting students regularly - students from all sites go to all other sites.  So, there will be students who are in Mountjoy Square who I will meet in Aungier Street or Bolton Street.  They use the other facilities and libraries.  They are not that far apart and that is the reality of the DIT experience.  Because they are often involved in clubs and societies with other students, etc., there is a lot of moving around.  That is just the reality of DIT.  They are not kinetic to a location in any way.</p></speech>

One is that we lost two amounts of money.  There was a budget for this.  We lost one amount of money which was budgeted for but that subsequently was spent on another contract.  There was one amount of money lost.  Secondly, certainly the inquiry that was done, which identified that there were procedures that should be tightened up, and they have been, but that does not mean that any of those items identified were not properly budgeted for or properly procured or indeed that we knew about them.  That impression was given which impinges on the reputation of the institute and a lot of hard work by a lot of colleagues in a time when we had an employment control framework and a moratorium on appointments, particularly at administrative level, which meant a huge reduction in administrative staff who were working very hard.  Speaking personally, the loss of Swets was heartbreaking.</p></speech>

The collapse of Swets UK, it continued, was unavoidable but the loss was very significant.  In the short term, it continued, the loss was absorbed by DIT's financial reserves and savings were made through postponement of some senior appointments and some areas of capital expenditure.  It added that steps were taken to ensure that services to students were not affected.  A couple of weeks later, we saw the Mountjoy Square library closing or, as Professor Norton described it, transferring miles away.  He will understand, therefore, that people took a wry view of that.

As I said earlier, we had provided the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report to the Comptroller and Auditor General and Higher Education Authority.  We had fully discussed it with the HEA.  It was the external review that is alluded to in the covering letter signed by myself that was sent with the report we sent last July to the committee.  With hindsight, because it gives an impression that things were being concealed, we should have provided it.  That is self-evident now but we were not actually asked for a report.  We were asked the circumstances and what measures we have taken.</p><p>The EY report does not discuss the measures we took.  What we have provided is the fullest report of the issues and what we have done about them.  That is actually what we were requested to provide.  With hindsight, frankly, I agree.  I have no problem in making sure that was supplied.  We had supplied it previously.  Incidentally, we supplied it over a year ago as an FOI request to RTE.  We have made no attempt whatsoever to conceal it but we should have provided it here.  I accept that totally.</p></speech>

I have one final issue to ask the witness about.  That is why I asked Mr. Love to give us an understanding of the presidents of the various third level institutions and whether their employment was full time or whatever.  Obviously, at the salary being paid, we would expect full-time service and not something else.  Professor Norton might talk to us about something that is public knowledge.  I think he is chairman of Action Renewables.  That is a Northern Irish company that was the principal adviser to people who applied for the cash-for-ash scheme or the renewable heat incentive.  The witness has stated he was not responsible for designing or delivering the scheme, which is undoubtedly the case.  However, I think his company processed at least 30% of all applications - that seems to be the accepted figure - under the renewable heat incentive.  Some people felt that that organisation - I do not know whether it has claimed some charitable status - should have advised the State in some way, because of that possible charitable status, that this scheme was not good for the people.  I think Professor Norton or executives of his company would say that it was not their job to do that, that their job was to assist applicants and that it would have been wrong of them to assist applicants to apply for funding under the cash-for-ash scheme while at the same time recommending to the Government that the scheme was not a good scheme.  The witness might talk to us about his commitment to the Action Renewables company, his involvement and any remuneration he receives from that company, because we have had this with the HSE and other organisations to which the State is paying full-time salaries.  We would like to be sure that we are getting a full-time commitment in return.  I ask him to talk to us about that.</p></speech>

Action Renewables is a charity established in Northern Ireland.  My technical expertise is in renewable energy.  I am involved in charitable work - it is a charity - in a private personal capacity outside of work to promote renewable energy.  I previously worked with the University of Ulster and had a link through that university to the promotion of renewable energy in Northern Ireland.  Action Renewables is, as I say, a charity.  Its activity is to develop and assist in policy measures and interventions with those who want to promote renewable energy, such as developing capabilities.  For example, the renewable energy training academy in Northern Ireland, which was an INTERREG activity, came through Action Renewables.  The all-Ireland grid study has enabled electricity that goes North-South throughout the island and it came out of a study done by Action Renewables.  It is about enabling measures for renewable energy.  If there are particular schemes that are introduced, and the renewable heat incentive was such a scheme, Action Renewables will advise those who want to avail of those schemes on how to do so.  There are a number of schemes.  There are schemes for photovoltaics, wind energy and others.   Around 20% of the applicants came to Action Renewables.  That is actually quite a small proportion of the overall whole.  It was a small part of the organised activity.  I chair Action Renewables as a charitable activity as part of the public good.  I receive &pound;2,000, which I donate to charity.</p></speech>

Perhaps it was in between the lines in that report.  The DIT relied on the due diligence that was carried out at the time of the procurement exercise.  That resulted in a three-year contract, and we continued with the practices that we had had for several years in terms of deciding what to purchase and when to prepay.</p></speech>

I apologise.  I would make a couple of observations.  In a national procurement one is more vulnerable to that sole supplier failing.  It also tends to take other suppliers out of that marketplace and so it can entrench monopolies.  I would also say that subscription-based models are increasing.  On what is referred to as "the cloud", that is, software as a service, we are moving from buying the software and having it as something that can be put in a machine to subscribing to it and paying for it beforehand.  If we take those two tendencies together, there is an increased risk of exposure to the system of major contracts that require----</p></speech>

I would make the point that I had concerns that that is going to happen, and the witness has just said that it will happen.</p> <p>  The witness said in his opening statement that one area that received attention was the delivery of DIT programmes through third party providers.  It was said that this is in keeping with national strategy and will increasingly become a feature into the future.  I understand that a language institute has been contracted to deliver core modules on the international foundation programme and that the company is owned by an English language course provider.  Whatever is done in terms of partnerships is something that must be evaluated by the college, but how does that impact on the people who are directly or potentially employed?  I have been told that people are now on a year-to-year contract rather than on a longer-term contract or are employed on foot of the outsourcing of some of the teaching elements.</p></speech>

We offer an international foundation programme.  People take a foundation programme to gain the qualification to join a regular level 7 or level 8 programme.  Part of that may be a gap in their English language ability, which needs to go to a particular level to meet the necessary entrance requirements.  To do that we need to draw on English language teaching provision which is IELTS accredited, so it actually meets the accreditation requirement for the relevant qualification they need to pass at the relevant level to gain entry.  That provision goes through the whole year, including the summer.  We do not have colleagues who deliver that type of provision.  Indeed, our colleagues deserve their summer holidays.  It goes through the entire year.  We went out to tender, to procurement, and we have a supplier of that service.  The nature of the foundation programme is about the gap in what students have and what they need to progress.</p> <p>  We get different intakes, and the nature of that will change.  We do not know whether English language ability is going to be a feature in the future, so we could invest in a large amount of infrastructure and then find that the next year involves no requirement for it because the school systems in those countries have improved.  It is contacted and it goes through the whole year.</p></speech>

Using academic staff within the institute to deliver such programmes would not be the most cost-effective way of delivering them.  What has worked to date has been a very strong partnership with the third party.  The staff in question are located on site as a part of the team.  What has happened is that the company that has been providing the service to date has been bought out, and we are looking at the implications of that ourselves.</p></speech>

Increasingly we are seeing, not just in DIT but across the university sector, that people are being employed on short-term contracts.  We are hearing that people are being given one research hour for one contact hour, which hardly adds to the credentials of the university sector.</p><p>While it might be cost effective in the short term if people are not on long-term contracts and their hours are reduced its sustainability does become a problem.</p></speech>

We all want a sustainable programme team.  We want to ensure that we have continuity, that what we have learned from working with a group last year is transferred to the group this year and that the programme evolves and develops.  To date, we have achieved that.  There has been a very strong emphasis on trying to create that strong partnership and ensuring we have that continuity.  We will have to work with this new company to explore how we can ensure that the quality is maintained and that we do not have any slippage in terms of staffing.</p></speech>

Very extensive questions were put to the president of Waterford Institute of Technology.  The issue centred around potential conflicts of interest.  At all times, as Dr. Love knows, there were never any allegations of wrongdoing by any individual but issues of concern were certainly raised in regard to the extent and number of conflicts of interest.</p> <p>  I should disclose to the committee that I met Dr. Love and presented him with a synopsis of a number of protected disclosures that I received from people inside and outside Waterford Institute of Technology that back up many of the questions I put.  I also suggested terms of reference for a review.  What we were looking for was what Dr. Love described in the past as a "deep dive" to examine not only the single issue that the internal review in Waterford considered but also all the wider issues.  Can Dr. Love explain to this committee what is planned, the terms of reference for this review and who is conducting it?</p></speech>

These issues will also be examined in respect of other spin-out companies from the TSSG.<br /><br />- Having considered the above issues, assess whether the WIT internal review identified and appropriately considered all issues of relevance to the development of IP and spin-out and subsequent sale of FeedHenry;<br /><br />- Having reviewed the issues set out above, the reviewer will consider the matters of concern that have been raised and prepare a report that shall make findings and/or recommendations for TSSG, Waterford Institute of Technology, relevant national agencies and government departments.  This might include issues related to IP policies and procedures, governance, HR, financial and other administrative processes and procedures.</blockquote> <p>We have appointed Mr. Michael McLoone to be the investigator.  The investigation is kicking off next week.  We are targeting the end of October for delivery, and the HEA is providing the support, etc.  We are also hoping to borrow information from another rolling governance review that emerged from this committee when I was here in March and April.  It is on the general implementation of intellectual property policy across our higher education sector.  We are going to select Waterford Institute of Technology as one of the institutions that should be able to borrow the expertise related to this review appropriately.</p></speech>

Rather than just considering the process, one needed to consider how it was applied.  That is the important part because there was one critical element of the policy in Waterford to be born in mind.  It refers to one having a conflict of interest or business relationship with an individual and to where one reports to an individual.  Therefore, it is very important that that be part of it.  One can say the process is robust but it is a matter of how it is applied and works.</p></speech>

DIT, under the national qualifications framework, offers qualifications from level 6 to level 10.  Here there is level 5 work in English language tuition, which involves students gaining competence in the English language to be able to pursue another course, whereas our language provision in our school is at levels 6 and 7.  These are advanced levels in the language.  It is not core to what we do, not in the sense the Deputy described.</p></speech>

It is a level 5 provision in basic English language tuition in which we would have to invest substantially.  It is very different from what our model is.

To some extent, it is not the realm that we want to move into, but we would definitely like to put on record that staff engaged as a part of the programme teams on the international foundation programme, in the particular case, are staff whom we regard as part of the programme team.  They are making a very important contribution.  They have done so to date.  It has been very successful.  We have looked at progression rates from the international foundation programme into our mainstream education and they are the exact same as our normal progression rates at undergraduate level.  Those are students who are coming in from abroad.  There  is a huge amount of energy and resources going into it.  The teams involved have been in place for some time.  I accept the Deputy's point in that we want that to continue, and we have to sit down with the new providers to see how we might achieve that.</p></speech>

The definition is also used in section 2 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquires, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.

It is important there is full transparency and accountability for an office that would have an oversight role for tens of millions of euros of procurement funding, namely, taxpayer's money.

At present the functions are formulated with reference to the public service bodies as a group.  As currently drafted, the putting in place of the first delegation would give the office the power to start providing shared services to all public service bodies.  To address this, section 9 (2)(a) will be amended to read: &quot;whenever an order in respect of a public service body is in force, the Office shall have the following functions in respect of that public service body.&quot;.  It goes on to say that this requires further amendment of paragraphs (1) to (13) to remove references to public service bodies, where appropriate.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 is a technical amendment to Schedule 1.  The advice of Parliamentary Counsel is to include the national shared services office in the schedule of the public sector bodies.  Staff officers and civil servants are in receipt of their own salaries.  A further addition to Schedule 1 may be required later and with the consent of the committee this will be considered by the Department officials on Report Stage.  As I said, the amendments are technical in nature.</p></speech>

In my view it is important the public is satisfied that there is sufficient oversight in regard to the spend on such matters.  The Chairman of this committee will understand, as a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that it is important for the Committee of Public Accounts to be able to scrutinise the spending of taxpayers' money, which is one of its core functions.  If the spend by this organisation on consultants and advisers was not subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts, that would be a mistake.  We need to recognise that confidence in how public money is spent is at an all time low for genuine understandable reasons.  The possible misuse of taxpayers' money is an issue of public controversy.  Where we have the expertise inhouse in the Civil Service that is where most of the work should be done.  Some advisory work is necessary at times but it should be at a minimum and when consultants and advisers are used, the contracts should be subject to proper scrutiny, not just by a Minister but by Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The intention of my amendment is simply to ensure that the spend by this new office on consultancy and advisers' fees is subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts. </p></speech>

Section 17 of the National Shared Services Bill 2016 provides that the CEO is accountable to the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts, because it will be subjected to audit.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Deputy Cullinane said; he is correct.  While the amendment is well meaning, I will not be accepting it because the points he made have been captured in the Bill already.  I do not disagree with any of the points he has made.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, many of the appointments are seen as political appointments.  Even if they are not, they are seen as short-term appointments, with a maximum duration of three years sometimes.  We have to avoid those appointments going beyond their remit of three years.

There has been much public commentary on these issues.  There has to be oversight by this committee and specifically the chief executive has to answer for the pay and allowances to the committee.  If they are subject to review by the committee, they can be held up if the chief executive does not make a convincing argument for the pay and allowances.  If the chief executive wants to increase pay and allowances that should be subject to review by the committee.</p></speech>

While I do not have a difficulty <i>per se</i>with that, remuneration for board members as proposed in the Bill forms a wider part of the Government's public service pay policy and is set in the context of the relevant qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the board members as they apply across the entire public sector.</p><p>Government pay policy is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who will be best placed to establish remuneration rates for board members for the body as for other bodies established by legislation elsewhere.  It is not clear that the committee would be the best place to consider and review, in isolation from wider Government policy and practice, the remuneration rates established by the Minister for a particular body as proposed.</p><p>The biggest concern is precedent and where it would stop in respect of other bodies and whether the remuneration of the board members of every public board and body would be established by the sectoral committees within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee could very well be ground to a halt.  It is the reserve of the Minister on that basis.  It is also noted that section 17(8) states: &quot; In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&quot;  Accordingly, it would appear incongruous for the committee to review remuneration rates established as part of Government pay policy without having the benefit of the background, reasons, context and policy.  I do not disagree with what the Deputy is trying to do but not only would it set a precedent for other boards but it could establish a precedent for difficulties or perceived difficulties in the wider public sector.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment but I completely accept the tenet of what the Deputy is trying to do.</p></speech>

The chief executive would have leeway and in this amendment we are trying to limit that leeway because we do not want to see someone appearing before this committee for exceeding public sector pay or allowances in respect of salary caps.  We have seen instances of this.  We want to make sure there is oversight beyond the Minister, by a sectoral committee, and this committee would be the place for that.  It seems prudent that this committee would have some level of scrutiny in advance and not be looking back when there is a problem.</p> <p>  I accept what the Minister of State says about it setting a precedent for other areas.  Maybe we need to consider how this issue is dealt with in its entirety because the Minister of State accepts there have been problems in this area.</p><p>Given the Minister of State has said he is not in a position to accept the amendment, I have no choice but to withdraw it.

This arrangement will greatly assist in the processing of certain cases, such as parental leave.  In order to process statutory and contractual entitlements such as parental leave, pension payments, survivor's pension and so forth, the NSSO is required to view and verify certain documents such as birth, death or marriage certificates relating to its customers, which would be normal practice.  Currently, the processes within the NSSO mean the original, long versions of forms must be sent to the office for verification before these important entitlements can be granted.  Many process delays occur when the customer fails or is unable to submit such forms on time, meaning that vital payments are sometimes delayed.  The protection of sensitive data such as that contained on these forms is obviously of utmost concern and consideration to the NSSO.  The customer will always be kept aware of any process before anything is done with the documentation.  This is a workable element of the legislation and it is required in order for people to access their entitlements.  The amendment is technical in nature.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Mental Health Act 2001, to incorporate certain provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015 relating to treatment of patients under the Mental Health Act 2001, to improve the provision of mental health services, to promote the rights of persons subject to the Mental Health Act 2001, and to provide for related matters.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy James Browne, the sponsor of the Bill.  I also welcome the attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and congratulate him on his appointment, and welcome his advisers, Mr. Gerry Steadman and Ms Lorraine Doyle.</p> <p>  I note that there are only three proposed amendments and that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 have been grouped and will be discussed together.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-22a.1968" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017062200002#B00500"><p>Section 2 of the Bill substitutes a new definition of voluntary patient which explicitly includes a reference to the need for such patients to actually consent to such admission.  Currently, the definition of voluntary patient in the Mental Health Act 2001 states that a voluntary patient is not subject to an admission order.  In other words, a person is a voluntary patient if he or she is not an involuntary patient subject to detention.  This definition makes no reference to consent.  In order to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and in line with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, it is necessary to amend the definition of voluntary patient to include a specific reference to the need for a person to consent to admission.</p> <p>  However, this change cannot proceed on its own without any associated changes being introduced.  The suggested definition of voluntary patient would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment.  Such persons would be those who lack capacity and, therefore, cannot provide consent.  While they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill as to warrant admission as an involuntary patient.  As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, as they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the 2001 Act, they also could not be detained.  Such patients are often referred to as the "compliant incapacitated".  Before any new definition of voluntary patient which explicitly refers to capacity, we need also to include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.</p><p>In this regard, my Department is currently working on deprivation of liberty safeguards, intended to allow persons without capacity to be lawfully admitted to residential care and to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  It is essential that the change to the definition of "voluntary patient" occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty.  Work is under way on these safeguards and my Department is in discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality about including these provisions in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I assure Members here today that this is a priority change for my Department.  The fact that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet commenced allows us time to finalise the necessary changes as without such commencement, and the roll-out of the decision support service, the planned deprivation of liberty measures cannot begin.</p><p> Where this important change is concerned we agree that it is a necessary change, but we ask Members to press the pause button because we need to finalise the deprivation of liberty safeguards in tandem with this change, otherwise we will be legislating to deny certain people inpatient psychiatric treatment.  This, obviously, cannot be allowed to happen.  It is my intention to revisit this provision on Report Stage.</p></speech>

My Department does not object to this proposal, which mirrors very closely a recommendation of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Under the current section 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 the best interests of the person are identified as the principal consideration in any decision to be made concerning the care or treatment of a person.  This section has, over the years, led to an over paternalistic interpretation of the Act.  This is no longer seen as appropriate and is not in line with modern human rights standards.</p> <p>  The expert group review of the 2001 Act, which was published in 2015, recommended that the principal consideration of best interests should be removed from the Act and replaced by a list of guiding principles.  These are the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health with the person's own understanding of his or her own mental health being given due respect; autonomy and self-determination; a presumption that the person is best placed to determine what promotes or compromises his or her own dignity; bodily integrity; and least restrictive care.  This list is effectively the same as the principles listed by Deputy Browne in his Bill and my Department can agree, subject to possible minor changes on Report Stage, to the proposed provision.</p> <p>  I would ask Members to allow us some further leeway to examine what other possible linked changes might be necessary to ensure that the provision as it stands does not have any unintended consequences.  It is my intention, therefore, to revisit this on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In this case it relates to children not adults.  There is one significant change.  While the intention is to add guiding principles, as is proposed for adults, with regard to children we would seek to retain the reference to "best interests".  There is agreement that this is the way to proceed where children are concerned.  The expert group review on the Mental Health Act 2001 also recognised that in the context of children there is a need to refer to "best interests" and it is noted that paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that in all actions concerning children that are undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration.</p> <p>  The guiding principles as laid out in this section of the Bill differ slightly from those recommended by the expert group review and I would appreciate the opportunity to examine more closely the wording recommended before we agree the final text.</p> <p>  I must stress once again that I have no difficulty with the principle behind the change, but the individual principles themselves may need to be tweaked to make sure we get them absolutely right.</p> <p>  While I accept the thrust of the provision it is my intention to once again revisit this on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This provides that a person's capacity should be construed functionally.  This is broadly in line with what the expert group review recommended.  I have said previously that while what is being proposed is reasonable it cannot come in to effect until the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has actually commenced.  There is now agreement that the Mental Health Act 2001 needs to be amended insofar as consent and many other matters are concerned.  My officials and I need more time to ensure that a change of this nature does not require any other consequent changes to the Act that also need to be made at the same time.</p> <p>  Because the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet commenced we have time to examine this provision in more detail and I want to confirm that it is my intention to revisit it on Report Stage, with a view to introducing further linked amendments that, after examination, I may deem necessary.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to remove any possible ambiguity that the consent of a voluntary patient is required for necessary treatment. </p></speech>

Deputy Browne has tabled an amendment to his original wording, separating out consent for a voluntary patient and consent for an involuntary patient.  The intention behind the amendment seems clear in that it expands the existing section 57 of the 2001 Act to ensure that the consent of a voluntary patient is also required for treatment.  My Department and I have no difficulty introducing this clarity and the expert group review of the 2001 Act went further in suggesting that the right of voluntary patients to refuse treatment should be explicitly stated.</p> <p>  Section 2.18 of the expert group review examines in some detail the issue of consent to treatment.  My officials would like more time to examine if other related amendments suggested by the expert group should be introduced at the same time as this proposed amendment.</p> <p>  We need to be mindful of any unintended consequences of the amendments we are considering today.  It is important that before we nail our colours to the mast when amending text that we are certain of the effects of the changes proposed.  We must also factor in consideration of the effects of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 on the Mental Health Act 2001 in this regard.</p><p>It is for these reasons that it is my intention to revisit this amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>
