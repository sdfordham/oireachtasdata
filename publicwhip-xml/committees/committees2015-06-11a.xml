Many non-governmental organisations have provided extra capacity in the expectation that the funding will be forthcoming to enable them to provide services.</p><p>They have hired out capacity there in terms of space and so on and in some cases recruited extra staff on the basis that the funding for the extra purchase of supplies would be made available.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, following up on our meeting on 7 May 2015.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Item 3A.2 is correspondence from Ms Clare McGrath, chairperson of the OPW, regarding the chartered surveyors' submission to strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Item 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 5 June 2015, from the HSE following up on the meeting on 23 April 2015.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Item 3A.4 is correspondence, dated 5 June 2015, from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Heath, regarding an investigation into abuse of people with disabilities in a foster home in the south east.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Item 3A.5 is correspondence, dated 5 June 2015, from Mr. Noel Waters, the acting Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, with an update on the criminal justice (fixed charge processing system) working group.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Item 3A.6 is correspondence, dated 5 June 2015, from the HSE following up on our meeting on 23 April 2015.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  I now come to individual correspondence.  A number of issues have been responded to and they really require further comment and discussion.  As we have two sessions today, I propose that we should revisit those items of correspondence again next week when we have time to do so.  Some correspondence relates to the OPW.  There are HSE issues regarding the foster home that was being investigated.  I express my absolute dismay that the garda&iacute; who have come back to me directly have said that there may not be prosecutions owing to insufficient evidence and so on.  I find it absolutely appalling and it needs to be discussed again by the committee.</p> <p>  In the course of the replies from the HSE there are issues about those who were employed to investigate and the committee needs to revisit the matter.  The correspondence mentions that the HSE spends &euro;40 million on legal fees and we need to investigate that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#B00500"><p>The committee has dealt with the foster home issue.  We need to remember that the Garda investigated all this in the early 1990s and no prosecutions resulted.  The fear I and other committee members had was that it would be repeated.  For that reason there was an imperative on Government to take the review or investigation process very seriously.  That was what the committee was asking the Government to do.  I believe the Government is about to make a definitive decision not only on the course of action the Department will take, but also on the policy issues that arise from the contents of the report we will submit to it.  Perhaps we should hold off for a week or so.  I always had the fear, which I expressed, as, I believe, did the Chairman, that it was going to be very difficult for the Garda because of the timeline involved and because most of the individuals who were affected were non-verbal.  Some of the people involved have died since these issues arose.  However, we need to wait a little longer because those decisions are being made right now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#B00600"><p>That is why I am saying we will revisit this batch of correspondence, which covers a considerable amount of ground.</p> <p>  In individual correspondence, there is correspondence from Mr. Tom Boland, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, regarding the GMIT investigation of plagiarism.  It is to be noted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#B00700"><p>While the correspondence received is detailed, it probably asks more questions than it answers.  For instance, it cost &euro;1,500 a day for the two investigators.  I doubt Sherlock Holmes would have cost that much.  There is no conclusion in sight and the review could continue like a runaway train.  The last point was that there was an argument between the investigators that required further legal action between the two of them before the report could be published.  That was also an extra cost on the taxpayer.</p> <p>  I know officials from the Department of Education and Skills will appear before the committee this morning, but I am not sure we will be able to cover this.  The report received back poses many more questions than it answers.  They would probably want to come in to explain it again and to give some detail.  How did they come up with the &euro;1,500?  Why there was no interim report?  Why was there no deadline?  At the very end it states that the college's procedures for dealing with plagiarism were fit for purpose.  It cost us &euro;436,000 to find that out.  So many more questions need to be asked about this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#B00800"><p>We are dealing with this item of correspondence now.  The second response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is similar.  The correspondence the Deputy mentioned refers to &euro;436,000 and it raises many other questions.  We need to have a further discussion on it.  As with the previous correspondence, I suggest that items 3B.1 and 3B.2 should be discussed next week so that we set in train a process to deal with these matters directly with the Accounting Officers.  The Deputy is correct in terms of governance and money.  It is incredible that it would go on in the way it has.</p> <p>  Item 3B.2 is correspondence from Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Mahoney, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, regarding correspondence from Mr. Philip Cantwell.  This is to be noted and forwarded to Mr. Cantwell.  We will write to the Environmental Protection Agency as we agreed to do and will await its response.  We will note and publish 3B.1 and 3B.2 and will follow up with a further meeting next week.</p> <p>  Item 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 8 June 2015, from Deputy Sean Fleming.  It is evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts at the meeting with the Department of Finance.  This is to be noted.  Does the Deputy wish to comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#B00900"><p>Yes.  Since I wrote the letter, the Oireachtas has established a commission of inquiry.  When I wrote that letter it was quite clear from comments that the Minister for Finance had an issue and he wanted to correct the record of the D&aacute;il, which he did in person on Tuesday.  I wanted the same procedure to apply here rather than a letter coming in here.  The statement was given orally and I wanted the record corrected in person as well.</p><p>Since I wrote that letter, the Oireachtas has established a commission of investigation.  Now that the commission is <i>in situ</i>, does the Committee of Public Accounts have the ability to deal with issues that are the subject matter of the commission?  In light of the commission having been established, are we in a position at this stage to accept an appearance from the Secretary General to correct the D&aacute;il record on a matter which may be germane to the commission of investigation?  If it is deemed to be germane to the commission of investigation, I do not believe we could have that issue dealt with here today.  In that case it would be up to the Secretary General if he wants to inform the commission of the inaccurate D&aacute;il record or Committee of Public Accounts record.  That is a matter for him.</p><p>However, the terms of reference of the commission as approved by the D&aacute;il yesterday state that it is to investigate matters where there is a capital loss of &euro;10 million or other matters specifically identified by the commission.  The Government was very clear not to have the terms of reference so broad that the commission could go on for a long time.</p><p>The terms of reference are narrow and specific to a number of transactions.  In my view, taking into account that document and the specific terms of reference, the only matters being considered by the commission of investigation are those in respect of which there was a &euro;10 million write-off and other matters that may be identified by the commission.  There is nothing in the terms of reference preventing any arm of the Oireachtas discussing matters surrounding the relationship between the Department of Finance and IBRC.  The only matters included in the terms of reference in respect of the Department of Finance are those relating to each transaction under investigation, whether the Minister for Finance or his Department were kept informed, where appropriate, in respect of the transactions concerned and whether he, or the officials on his behalf, took appropriate steps in respect of the information provided to them.  As I said, the terms of reference are very specific to particular transactions.  In my view, the terms of reference do not preclude a discussion in the Oireachtas, including at this committee, any other committee or in the D&aacute;il Chamber on all relationships between the Department of Finance and IBRC during the period in question.  The terms of reference are very narrow and specific.  The Government did not want to broaden the terms of reference to include all matters.  </p><p> Reference was made during our last meeting to the relationship framework and the revised relationship framework which the troika in 2011 requested the Government to complete.  IBRC wanted that done.  As far as I am aware, there were umpteen drafts of that framework.  These issues are not included in the terms of reference nor is the matter of the monthly board pack which dealt with matters other than the specific transactions provided for in the terms of reference.  In my view, all matters, other than those specific transactions, can be discussed in the Oireachtas and everywhere else, including by this committee.  </p><p> The Secretary General of the Department of Finance should be put on notice that during his appearance before the committee to correct a particular matter he will be requested to discuss all other matters in relation to IBRC.  We did not complete our consideration of the Vote during the last meeting, in particular in relation to matters that are not specific to the commission.  I do not think it would be appropriate for the committee to allow the Secretary General to simply appear before it, correct the record and then leave.  If officials from the Department of Finance are to appear before the committee to discuss an issue in relation to our last meeting, they should also be asked to discuss all matters surrounding the relationship between the Department and IBRC that are not specific to the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061100002#C00200"><p>The issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the second half of this meeting.  Prior to commencement of that part of the meeting, the committee will hear legal advice from our parliamentary legal advisers.  Following the request from members that the Department of Finance officials would re-appear before the committee to correct the record, and the desire of the officials also to do so, it was made clear to them that during their appearance before us today, apart from correction of the record, they would be asked a wide range of questions about issues not related to the inquiry.  Arising from that, the Department wrote to the committee indicating that it had taken legal advice on the matter and would not be able to answer questions relative to the inquiry.</p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Fleming said but, because there is a difference of opinion and we must ensure we are right in what we are doing, we will seek legal advice before commencing the second part of this meeting.  I ask members to wait until then to raise the issues of concern to them in relation to this matter.</p></speech>

My view is that once we do not stray into the specifics of the inquiry, we can deal generally with all other aspects.  However, that is a matter subject to the legal advice we receive when we come back.</p></speech>

A similar note has been included in each certificate since the establishment of NAMA, because of the manner in which it is structured and funded.  </p> <p>  No. 4.3 relates to the National University of Ireland Maynooth, which draws attention to a number of matters, including the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which is a standard for the universities and non-consolidation of the results of the foundation of the university.  The university does not consolidate those with the results of the university group.  The report draws attention to the fact that the foundation had net assets of &euro;3.4 million at the balance sheet date.</p> <p>  No. 4.4 relates to the National Museum of Ireland.  Nos. 4.4 to 4.8 relate to a number of VECs.  Nos. 4.9 to 4.11 are three financial statements for the National Gallery of Ireland.  Members will recall that up to 2014 there were two basis of accounting for the National Gallery of Ireland.  It has an appropriations account but it also prepares consolidated financial statements because it has a number of funds and so on.  There has been a difficulty in producing those financial statements.  I draw attention to the fact that its accounting does not take into account the requirements of financial reporting standard, FRS, 30 for heritage assets that would have required it to recognise on the balance sheet the cost or value of heritage assets it acquired since 1 January 2011.  The gallery does not follow that practice but it does provide a note on the nature and scale of its fine art collection.</p> <p>  Nos. 4.12 and 4.13 are the financial statements for the Medical Council and the North-South Language Body, both of which received clear opinions.</p></speech>

We discussed similar complaints from another individual during previous meetings.  The case about which I am speaking now is a separate case.  This issue needs to be addressed.  When the correspondence received yesterday has been circulated, we will address it in the context of our examination of NAMA's annual report and financial statements for 2014, in respect of which we need to examine various transactions.</p> <p>  Another issue highlighted in the National University of Ireland Maynooth accounts is the non-compliance with procurement guidelines.  The same applies in regard to the HSE and many other agencies that come before the committee.  One wonders what needs to be done to bring them in line with the guidelines or who has oversight in this regard.  Is procurement in this area the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p></speech>

When we carry out reports and put them before the various Departments, and it happened again last week, we must remind the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to remind the Accounting Officers to reply to us.  They are either serious about the job or they are not.  If they are not serious about it, they should go or they should not be paid as much as they are, quite frankly.

There is a very high level of engagement in the course of planning and carrying out the audit and reporting back any issues which we discover.  The director of audit attends at least part of almost all the audit committee meetings.  It is a very rigorous engagement.  I will come back to the Deputy with more detail on it.</p></speech>

To guide whatever discussion we have with it rather than speaking in generalities and broad brush strokes, it would be very useful to synthesise the precise instances where various Departments and agencies have strayed from appropriate procedures and practices.  One of the big problems in procurement functions is total confusion in the system as to the appropriate level at which the procurement function is managed and who signs off on it.  It still seems to be quite loose and casual.  There are also issues of excessive expense and we could usefully look at patterns of winning contracts and how open the procedures are.  Are they sufficiently robust to allow diversity of providers in various functions?  This would be useful if we are to have the office in again in order that we can have quite a pointed discussion with it.</p></speech>

We have discussed the possible sale of Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium to defray the rather extravagant expenditure on Limerick stadium which is now &euro;19.5 million in debt.  A going concern and a profitable operation, which is Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium, must be sold for one that is a loss-making operation.  Next week, we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Can we ensure that item will be on the agenda?  The Indecon report on the greyhound industry made a number of recommendations but it appears that the only one the Department seems to be acting on is the sale of Harold&rsquo;s Cross, a profitable and really the working man&rsquo;s and working woman&rsquo;s stadium in Dublin as distinct from the Shelbourne Park stadium which is very much the high end of the greyhound racing industry.</p></speech>

Grants are payable in respect of tuition and other fees and as a contribution towards an eligible student&rsquo;s living costs.  In addition to funding, the Department has overall responsibility for ensuring students receive the support to which they are entitled on a timely basis.</p> <p>  Up to and including the academic year 2010-2011, there were three means-tested grant schemes for third level students and a separate means-tested scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The schemes were administered by 66 agencies, namely the 33 local authorities and the 33 vocational education committees.  The Student Support Act 2011 enabled the consolidation of the four schemes into a single unified statutory scheme.  The Act also enabled the Minister to designate one or more public bodies as a grant-awarding authority for the consolidated statutory scheme.  The Department issued a call for proposals from statutory agencies interested in taking on the role.  City of Dublin VEC, now City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, was selected in April 2011 as the single national awarding authority for student support.  Plans were made for CDETB to take on the administration of the scheme for all future new applicants for grants, commencing for the academic year 2012-2013.</p><p> The ETB established a separate internal unit named Student Universal Support Ireland, or SUSI, to administer the scheme.  SUSI was expected to deliver a better service to grant applicants through streamlined processes, greater consistency in dealing with applications, faster processing due to economies of scale and the implementation of an online applications system.  However, many of the expected benefits of the new centralised process did not materialise in 2012 to 2013.  In fact, significant operational issues emerged for SUSI in its first year of operation resulting in substantial delays in the processing of claims and payment of grant support, which caused serious difficulties for many students and their families.  I am happy to note that the initial problems were dealt with by the end of its first year of operation and that the performance of SUSI was much improved in the 2013 to 2014 academic year.</p><p> The operational issues that occurred in 2012 to 2013 were comprehensively documented in a consultancy report commissioned by the ETB and prepared by Accenture.  That looked mainly at SUSI's internal processes and the management of the implementation project.  In general, my office's examination does not revisit those issues.  Instead, it reviews how the overall reform of the system was managed from initial planning through to the go-live date of SUSI's online application system.  It considers in particular the extent to which the serious operational issues in 2012 to 2013 were a consequence of the earlier planning process.  The funding and administration costs of SUSI are also reviewed.</p><p> The process of moving from 66 awarding authorities to a single grant authority required detailed planning and commitments across a range of areas to ensure systems and processes were fit for purpose, that sufficient and experienced staff resources were in place, and that the new arrangements were adequately communicated to students.  Based on its own detailed proposal, the ETB was recommended as the awarding authority in April 2011 and it commenced preparation for the implementation of SUSI.  The proposal envisaged that the system would go live by March 2012 to handle new grant applications and payments for the 2012 to 2013 academic year.  While the onus was on the ETB and SUSI to implement the plan, there was regular reporting to the Department on the development and delivery of the project.  However, the ETB was only formally appointed as the statutory awarding authority in May 2012.  In my view, certain elements necessary to ensure successful project delivery were not adequately planned.  This resulted in key risks not being identified, key planning assumptions not being tested, and a final implementation plan not being put in place until April 2012.  There was no formal monitoring of delivery of milestones by the project implementation group, nor were there any formal escalation procedures in the event of adverse outcomes.  These weaknesses in planning contributed to the serious operational issues that arose after the system went live in June 2012.</p><p> One of the expected benefits of centralisation of the grant administration was the possibility of data sharing with other State agencies, primarily to reduce the onus on applicants to provide to SUSI documentation and information already held by public bodies.  Such data sharing arrangements were not in place for the 2012 to 2013 academic year.  Delays in securing all the required documentation were a significant problem for SUSI and these contributed in turn to delays in deciding on applications and commencing payments.  In addition, when data sharing operations were eventually put in place, the ETB identified that in 2012 to 2013, 790 students already in receipt of the back to education allowance from the Department of Social Protection had also received grants from SUSI to which they were not entitled at a cost of approximately &euro;1.9 million.  The ETB also discovered a number of other categories of overpayments in 2012 to 2013 totalling a further &euro;2.2 million.</p><p> Redeployment is a central feature of public sector reform.  It offers the potential to increase effectiveness across the public sector through better utilisation of resources and knowledge transfer.  In sanctioning SUSI, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stipulated that required staff be sourced through redeployment.  However, after six months of engaging in the process, only 13 positions from an expected 36 had been filled through redeployment.  Temporary staff had to be contracted in urgently to deal with applications and, in the end, it took 17 months until an adequate level of redeployment happened.</p><p> The Department is responsible for ensuring there are adequate arrangements for the administration of the student grant scheme.  However, when SUSI was launched, it did not put in place a formal service level agreement with the ETB incorporating relevant performance indicators.  This was only done in February 2013 to specify performance indicators for the 2013 to 2014 grants.  Following a tender process, the ETB outsourced the provision of document management and contact call centre operations for SUSI in December 2011.  However, it departed from good procurement practice in a number of areas.  Although the outsourced provider commenced service in January 2012, the contract with the service provider was not signed until February 2013, which was 13 months later.  Furthermore, no penalty mechanism is specified in the contract with the service provider to cover the event of a failure to provide the contracted level of service.</p><p> Up to June 2013, there were appeals of decisions by over 11% of applicants with a rate of 74% turnover of initial decisions on appeal.  This raises concerns about the quality of the initial assessments and the level of quality control.  In fact, what had happened was that staff were moved from quality control duties to front-line claims assessment in response to greater than expected demand, and this may have reduced the overall quality of decision-making on applications.  I further note that the funding mechanism for SUSI, coupled with the delays in processing applications and making payments, resulted in the ETB holding very large bank balances at the end of 2012.</p><p> The administration costs of SUSI for the year ended 31 December 2012 totalled &euro;7.16 million.  However, because of operational difficulties at various stages in the process, significant administration costs were also incurred in early 2013, which related to the first year of operation.  These were primarily outsourcing costs.  From commencement of SUSI up to March 2013, these totalled &euro;5.9 million compared with a budgeted amount of &euro;1.8 million.  The achievement of potential economies and efficiency gains was part of the business case underpinning the proposal to establish a single awarding authority.  However, the projected benefits were not quantified and the baseline cost and operational performance of the existing system had not been identified.  As such, it is not possible to evaluate whether the projected benefits have been fully realised.  Both the level of staffing allocated to SUSI and the level of outsourced services are significantly higher than originally envisaged.  While there have been reductions in the overall number of staff employed in VECs and local authorities, the extent to which this is attributable to SUSI is not known.</p></speech>

As requested, I forwarded an advance briefing to the committee and will keep my opening remarks as brief as possible.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report clearly outlines the circumstances surrounding the planning and implementation phases of this project, which was designed to integrate a number of means-tested schemes and centralise administration from 66 awarding authorities to a single, unified authority.  The report analyses the key issues relevant to the establishment of SUSI and identifies in particular the factors which ultimately resulted in a period of delays in 2012 to 2013 which caused distress for many students.  I express my sincere apologies for the difficulties encountered in the opening months of SUSI's operation and for any distress or inconvenience caused to grant applicants and their families.  Equally, the report notes the much improved performance in 2013 to 2014.  That improvement has been built on and consolidated in 2014 and 2015.  The Department of Education and Skills has given careful consideration to the content of the report and the recommendations for the Department arising from it.  The Department is committed to implementing the recommendations and has made substantial progress in that regard.  Specifically, the Department has revised fundamentally its approach to change management planning and governance through the establishment of a programme office within the Department to support the implementation of major projects under the public service reform plan.</p> <p>  The planning and implementation of the reform of the administration of student grants took place in a very difficult and different economic environment.  There was little scope to put in place the dedicated additional resources now recommended for projects of this size and scale.</p><p>New applications for student grants were increasing at an unprecedented rate, while the capacity of local authorities and VECs to deal with the increase was diminished by the impact of the public service moratorium.  Government decided that a single agency solution should be implemented and the Department drew on the expertise and experience of existing State bodies in developing and implementing that solution.</p><p> Despite the absence of detailed baseline information and the very real challenges experienced in securing key inputs, particularly staff, the Department worked hard with the CDETB, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others to address and resolve these problems.  When the processing difficulties arose in 2012, additional resources were immediately deployed to ensure that these were resolved as quickly as possible and to ameliorate the impact on students.  By January 2013, the number of grant applications processed by SUSI was already 18% ahead of the equivalent figure in 2012.</p><p> The two subsequent years of operation have seen very substantial improvements in SUSI's delivery of service.  In line with the 2013 Accenture review, SUSI has streamlined and simplified its grant application processes and improved its communications, stakeholder management and the customer experience.  In particular, improved data sharing arrangements with other Departments and agencies have facilitated more accurate verification of information, and significantly reduced the burden documentation for applicants.</p><p> The Department has strengthened SUSI's resourcing, programme governance and organisation.  It has provided for an augmented management structure and increased staffing capacity within SUSI.  It has put in place a management framework agreement with the CDETB to steer ongoing service improvement in SUSI.  Key performance indicators and service metrics are in place to ensure that service delivery is on track and at critical requirements in areas such as funding, risk control and compliance are being met.  The arrangements for implementation of the management framework agreement include regular structured engagement between the Department and the CDETB through monthly operations review meetings and quarterly business reviews.</p><p> Over the past two years, SUSI has dealt successfully with significant increases in the overall number of new and renewal applications, while improving the quality of its service on an ongoing basis.  Figures submitted in advance briefing to the committee indicated that despite a doubling of the number of applications, processing performance is now better than at any time over the past ten years.  The provision of an integrated grants processing system for SUSI, under the public sector reform shared services initiative, with a target implementation date of March 2017, will provide an even greater scope for both cost efficiencies and service improvements into the future.</p><p> The experience of restructuring the administration of student grants and the establishment of SUSI hold out valuable learning for other major reform and public service transformation projects.  The lessons for public sector reform have been identified and assessed in a recently published implementation case study report that was carried out for the Department by the Centre for Effective Services.  The report has been disseminated through the reform and delivery office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It has also been forwarded to the committee.</p><p> The Department will continue to work with the CDETB, SUSI and all of the relevant stakeholders to ensure ongoing improvement in the administration of student grants and the continued delivery of a high level of service to grant applicants.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Alan Murphy, Head of Operations at SUSI and Ms Mary McGrath, assistant principal officer, CDETB Budgets and Finance.</p> <p>  The City of Dublin Education and Training Board was selected by the Department of Education and Skills as the preferred deliverer of the transition from 66 grant awarding authorities to SUSI, as a single national authority.  From the selection of the CDETB in April 2011, to the planned go-live date for the new service in May 2012, there were just 13 months in which to meet the challenge of transforming the student grant delivery model for Ireland.</p> <p>  In taking on responsibility for this task on a public service and not-for-profit basis, CDETB had a track record as the deliverer of major projects in the education sector.  In particular, and as one of the largest and high-performing former awarding authorities, we had developed and rolled out an online grant application system and back office processing systems to many other authorities.  We thus had the relevant experience and expertise to perform strongly in the transformation of student grant administration under a single national authority. </p> <p>  Given the particular complexities of the existing regulatory system of student grants in the Irish education sector, there was no reliable baseline for how a single grants awarding authority might perform at a national level.  Ultimately, our experience and expertise and the optimism of our proposal were insufficient to overcome the significant unforeseen challenges of limited time, and of securing the resources necessary to ensure the timely and effective delivery of the project, in the early months of SUSI's first year of operation. </p> <p>  As the special report has clearly identified, the implementation phase of the project during 2011 and 2012 was characterised by a series of delays that exposed planning and resource deficiencies and, ultimately, led to uncertainty, difficulty and distress for many students and their families.  I apologised for this at the time and I do so again today.  We moved quickly at the time to rectify the situation.  We have worked very hard at all times to improve and enhance our services to students and other stakeholders. </p> <p>  Notwithstanding the acknowledged under-performance in terms of service delivery in SUSI's first year, the key change objectives of the overall transformation were met.  In particular, the transition from 66 individual authorities to a unified national service; the migration to a fully online grant application system; the outsourcing of appropriate functions; the substantial automation of application and document processing; the electronic payment of maintenance grants to all students in monthly instalments; and, a seasonally flexible staffing model were all achieved in SUSI's first year.  In its subsequent two years of operation, SUSI has continued to build on this achievement through a programme of continuous service improvement, both internally and externally.  The challenges and achievements of our early experience, and the lessons learned from the project as a public service delivery transformation, are the subject of a recently published implementation case study which I understand has been submitted to the committee. </p> <p>  The CDETB has noted the conclusions of the special report.  The board has accepted and implemented its recommendations in the areas of procurement, staff training and quality control.  As requested by the committee, I have submitted a briefing paper in advance of this meeting.  It identifies key issues for the CDETB and SUSI, arising from the special report.  My colleagues and I are available to advise and assist the committee in its consideration of the special report and on any matters arising for the CDETB and SUSI.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh anseo inniu.  Like all public representatives, I was very much aware of the initial difficulties at SUSI because it put a huge workload on my office, which was probably the same for every other Deputy in this place.  However, I recognise that the situation has greatly improved and now we rarely get requests for assistance on this front.  When do people get their grants at this stage?  Can the chief executive outline how things have improved?</p></speech>

We receive notification of their registration from their college so, effectively, the majority of students are paid from October onwards.</p> <p>  Looking back in terms of what happened at the time, we had a huge amount of documents.  I am conscious that Deputies received a lot of complaints at the time.  One of the things we were really anxious to do was to link with other statutory bodies.  A number of those statutory bodies are particularly important for us such as the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the General Register Office.  We can now link up with those bodies within 24 hours.  In 2012 students had to get that documentation themselves which led to a massive amount of documentation.  We co-operate with other bodies but the three I outlined have been particularly important for us.</p> <p>  In terms of how we operate internally, we have streamlined the grants as students come to us.  We have a pre-assessment which is going on currently and we seek a minimum amount of documents from students.  Most students will only need two documents but in 2012 we could have sought between ten to 12 documents.    </p></speech>

I noticed that there was an appeals rate of 11% in the period covered by the report, of which 74% of appeals were successful.  Can the chief executive explain the situation?</p></speech>

Let me outline a number of issues that arose in the system in 2012-13.  For example, students who were eligible for a grant were automatically deemed to be paid at the adjacent rate, which was based on living within 45 km of the college, whereas in some cases they should have been paid at the non-adjacent rate, as they lived further than 45 km from the college.  We corrected this fault in the system relatively quickly.  </p><p> Cases in which the circumstances of students had changed or new information became available also gave rise to appeals.  Accenture examined the data which showed that change of circumstances and new information accounted for 40% of appeals.  We have now separated that segment in order that we deal with these issues separately.  </p><p> A number of other issues gave rise to appeals in the year 2012-13.  We asked students to provide the documentation we needed at the time of processing their applications.  As was stated, much of the documentation returned to us was incomplete.  A number of students produced documentation after the processing stage and it was then classified as an appeal.</p></speech>

Let me elaborate.  It strikes me that the company was able to change the contract on a number of occasions to suit itself.  There is a question about whether it was the most expensive contract; about the delay in signing the contract; about how the nature of the contract was changed, in that the timeframe for dealing with calls was varied, as well as a provision that when the number of calls exceeded a certain number, the service level agreement would not apply.  That seems to work in favour of the company, not in favour of those trying to use the service.  We are all aware that this was a major problem at the time.  Will Ms Stewart explain why that was allowed to happen?</p></speech>

Under the original contract, 100% of calls would be answered within 30 seconds, but that figure was reduced by agreement such that 80% of calls would be answered within 20 seconds.  We were concerned about costs.</p></speech>

Paragraph 4.33 states the ETB reduced the service level requirement in respect of calls answered in the contract call centre.  The original target, as we understood it, was 100% of calls would be answered within 30 seconds.  The arrangement that was put in place instead was that 80% of calls would be answered within 20 seconds and there was no specific target on the time it would take to answer the remaining 20% of calls would have to be answered.  That is what I have said in the report.</p></speech>

We were concerned that it would be very expensive to answer 100% of calls within 30 seconds; therefore, we reduced the timeframe to 20 seconds in respect of 80% of calls in an effort to try to save money.</p></speech>

Now the number is much closer to the figure we had forecast, but in that period the volume of calls was huge.  If we had continued with the agreement that 100% of calls would be answered within 30 seconds, it would have cost an additional &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

We had no database for doing that.  Once we identified an issue we moved quickly to deal with it.  There was a period of six to eight weeks in October and November of 2012 when that was very difficult.  As the graph indicates, the waiting time decreased in December and January.  The number of calls received was way outside what we expected them to be.  As people got concerned, they spoke to people in the call centre for much longer than we had forecast.  People were very concerned and we were very conscious of that.  We were working with Abtran to improve the service and ensure we got the best service we could.</p></speech>

I suppose that in the period of August and September, before people go to college, it was anticipated that call levels would be at their highest.  The number of calls received are illustrated, with grey bars indicating where calls were abandoned.  One might imagine with an abandoned call, the caller would return at a later stage.  They were running at a much higher level, at 10,000, 11,000 or 12,000 calls, in that period around November, when the delays in answering calls were occurring and there was longer engagement with callers.</p></speech>

There were issues around phone calls.  The Deputy can see that huge increase.  There were also issues around document management, as the number of documents was outside the number we expected.  We had to go back to students a number of times to get more documents or ensure documents came in.  We had an amount of e-mailing to do as well.  There was also the issue of integrating a range of systems, which cost more than we expected as well and we introduced an electronic document management system to ensure we were electronically recording everything received in Abtran.</p></speech>

Did the Department of Education and Skills use the correct front-line organisation to take charge of this, given the problems with estimates and costs and so on.  How did it decide on the City of Dublin Education and Training Board?</p></speech>

There are a number of different outsourced elements that were separately tendered by SUSI.  Abtran, in the end, succeeded in four of those processes.  We are talking about a different process being linked in cost terms, which is important.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the costing refers to particulars.  It was the most expensive for one of the four processes, which was document management.  The call centre was the other major element, and those two were combined into a single relationship with Abtran.  It was not necessarily the most expensive overall but the document management area was signalled in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p> <p>  The other elements for which Abtran was contracted was insourcing.  When it was recognised that there was not sufficient staffing coming in, an emergency procurement was undertaken by SUSI and Abtran won that contract.  A fully appropriate non-emergency tender was put in place for the insourcing and Abtran came through that as well.  That insourcing of staff was not envisaged as being something to be outsourced.  Insourcing occurs when one employs a company to provide staff to work in one's own offices.  There were a number of different elements in that respect but I wanted to provide that clarification on the relationship with Abtran and the number of different relationships in the outsourcing process.  There were a number of different relationships.</p></speech>

It was about the process we went through to decide on going with the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  We put in place a selection panel in November 2010 to agree procedures and carry out the selection process to identify a suitable public body.  The members of the selection panel, of whose names I have a note, were Pat McLoughlin, who was the chief executive of Irish Payment Services Organisation, Jim Duffy, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Finance with the responsibility the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, Gerry Kearney, a former Secretary General in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with significant experience in programme management, and also an assistant secretary in the Revenue Commissioners.  They were chosen by reference to their knowledge and their significant experience in the various elements.</p> <p>  In January 2011, we issued an expressions of interest invitation and we offered it to vocational education committees, VECs, local authorities an other public bodies.  We had got legal advice when the relevant legislation was under consideration that we could not legislate to outsource it completely and, therefore, we had to do this through a public body, but the public body could outsource elements of it.  We received ten proposals.  We looked at those proposals and they were evaluated against a number of headings - organisational capacity to perform the function, experience in dealing with comparable schemes and services, existing core management expertise and resources available to be deployed to the function, capacity to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits, and overall quality of the proposal for delivery of a central student grants function.  On the basis of the review by the independent selection panel at the initial stage of the expressions of interest, four of the ten proposals were shortlisted for oral presentation.  There was a question and answer session at the oral presentation and then they were assigned a ranking based on the relative strengths arising from that.  The City of Dublin VEC came through that process ahead of the three others, which were Pobal, Waterford County and City Councils and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  They were assessed as being the best in the each of the five categories for that.</p></speech>

It is important we get clarity on the cost involved with respect to Abtran.  Section 4.21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states:<blockquote><br /><br />Abtran received maximum points for each of the tender criteria, except for ultimate cost which was significantly higher in both tenders than the next best candidate.  However, Abtran indicated in its submission that it would be willing to apply a discount if it received both contracts.  Abtran ultimate cost proposal for the contract call centre was 43% higher than the second placed candidate and 84% higher for document management than the second placed candidate.</blockquote>Also, it was indicated that the original cost of this process would be &euro;1.8 million per year for both document management and outsourcing of staff.  I appreciate that there was a huge increase, that the planning process may not have been as good as it should have been, or that the foresight in terms of what was projected should have been better, and obviously there were problems from everyone's point of view, but in 2014 it cost &euro;3.6 million and &euro;638,000 in outsourcing, which adds up to approximately &euro;4.2 million.  Therefore, it is still running at more than double the projected cost.  I ask the witnesses in the Department and in the public procurement area why that is the case.</p></speech>

In terms of the cost now, as opposed to what was forecast, one aspect that is very clear in terms of grants is how short the timeframe is in terms of ensuring the students get their grants.  That forecast was indicative rather than based on baseline data, which we did not have.  In effect, we were trying to make a judgment call on that.  It has gone from a cost of &euro;118 per application to a cost of &euro;83 currently, so there has been a fall in the cost.</p></speech>

The Department really was only able to quantify staff, plus a nominal overhead.  What we have seen since we set up this authority is that there is a much larger demand for call contact with our call centre.  That scenario simply was not foreseen, and basically accounts for the forecasting error on our part at the outset.  That was a driver of calls.</p> <p>  Since we opened, and since we started to manage the system, in the first year, as the Deputy said, the documents represented a very heavy cost, because we collected documents for everything.  We have minimised that now by only requiring, on average, two documents per student.  The cost of document management has decreased dramatically within the overall cost of outsourcing.</p></speech>

The figure rose in the second year - I am talking about financial years - to &euro;2.7 million, and for the last year it cost &euro;979,000.</p> <p>  Apart from the factor of forecasting and the decline in the number of documents, what has really driven increasing costs is the fact that we are dealing with more students.  In our first year we dealt with 70,000 and in this coming year we will deal with 115,000.  All of those students will call.  Having managed to reduce documents in our first year, and continuing to do so year-on-year, we must take on the challenge of reducing the requirement for students to call us.  The increasing number of students - handling their calls and dealing with the work involved - is a driver of cost.  Also, there are things we can do to provide them with information through other channels in order to make sure they do not need to call us - through our website, through outreach services and so on.</p></speech>

People want to know how their applications are doing.  We have provided an online tracker for students which enables them to go into their account and see the date on which their application was received and what we have done with it.  The main driver of calls are queries on application status.  Later in the year there are calls about payments.  There are questions such as, "Will I receive a payment?" and "When is the next payment run?".  I regard those calls as ones that we can make go away if we provide students with information through the other channels.</p> <p>  As well as a tracker for the application stage, we have provided a payments card so that students can see when payments are scheduled.  We have peaks around that.  Having collapsed the documents part of our business, we are working very hard to do the same for the calls side.  They were an unforeseeable scale of business.</p></speech>

We estimated that the cost in the local authorities and VECs, as they were at the time, was around about &euro;10.5 million per annum.  There was also a big demand for development of their computer systems.  The key aim has been to get these costs down.  SUSI has taken nearly all of the renewals from the local authorities and ETBs, although not all.  The operating cost of SUSI is now &euro;8.9 million.  That means there has been a reduction from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;8.9 million.  Yes, there has been investment in the interim.  We hope, over a number of years, to get the &euro;8.9 million figure lower.  The aim was to move from a cost of &euro;10.5 million, with a demand for extra resources, down to a running cost below &euro;8.9 million a year.  That is our aim over a number of years.  Obviously additional investment was needed in the first year.  Some of that investment was needed for systems, and we need more investment in systems.  Some of it was a result of the way in which the processes were set up, the particular peak in applications and documents and all that happened in the October-November-December period of the first year.</p></speech>

All Government Departments and State agencies are aware of it, so it is well documented what the procedures should be.  In regard to this particular case, it is clear that there was probably an underestimate of the level of costs in the beginning, in terms of staff costs and the document management piece, which I think was referred to as a forecast error.  The issue was compounded by the fact that there was a significant increase in the number of student applications.  That is just the harsh reality of what actually happened.  I take comfort from the fact that there has been a significant improvement.  There is a piece of work that local authorities did that they no longer have to do, and that is outside of the costings here.  We are trying to get a handle on the matter ourselves within DPER.</p> <p>  Lessons have been learned.  The report compiled by the Centre for Effective Services is very useful.  It is an acknowledgement that this is part of the political world.  There came a point at which my Department had to give sanction to increase costs, because it simply had to.  We had to acknowledge the fact that there were errors by both Departments in terms of what the appropriate cost should be.  We had to react to that situation.  It does mean that there is a level of flexibility required in these situations.</p></speech>

There are a number of elements from which we have learned a lot.  We are implementing it in terms of the major shared services projects that we have at the moment.  The one that is most advanced is the shared payroll service for the education and training boards.  The first thing that involves is putting a full project management arrangement in place and then having a full baselining as we work it through.  Those are operating in line with revised guidelines which have come from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have two or three major projects like that.  That is the most advanced one, and the next most advanced is our own financial services project for the ETBs.  We have a similar project which is at an earlier stage: potentially, shared service payroll in the higher education sector.  It means that we have to get all the information first, understand fully what is happening and then move on to see what the options are and what the cost aims would be.  In terms of the figures I gave earlier on cost savings, we have those for those projects so that we know what the intended eventual spend is.  On this project, we did not have an opportunity to do a baseline because there was a need to advance quickly with it.  We assumed that the processing that the City of Dublin VEC was doing, which was among the best in the sector, could just be multiplied, but we did not realise the impact of having a single national service and the impact of all the services coming together.  Some of our external reviews identified that we did not recognise the impact of scaling up.  We have learned a lot of lessons in that regard.</p></speech>

Let us move on.  What happens when students are paid their grants twice or when people receive grants they should not have received?  I am happy to see that the interlinking with different Departments has eradicated a lot of in which people received grants they should not have received.  How is this matter progressing?  Will people be fined if they receive a grant erroneously?  Are grants recouped?  Are students asked to return the grant?  What is the situation?</p></speech>

In 2012-13, there were three particular overpayment issues.  One was the back-to-education allowance, which is a social welfare allows that students received up until 2010 as well as their maintenance grant.  In fact, some students who were in college in 2013 would have continued to receive that allowance.</p><p>In 2012-13, students should only have been paid either a maintenance grant or the back-to-education allowance.  When they applied for the grant in the early stages, they may not have been clear about whether they were going to get the back-to-education allowance or not.  We identified that as an area of high risk, and after the event we went back to look at this because it was an area of high risk.  It was very unclear in the documents coming in and out what the status of students was in relation to the back-to-education allowance.  We made a number of errors in identifying that.  The result is that there were a number of overpayments in this area.  That cannot occur now because of the direct links with the Department of Social Protection.  In the cases in question, we now know who is in receipt of the back-to-education allowance and who is not.  The only possibility - I never want to say we might never have something - is that there might be a time lag between our process and that of the Department of Social Protection, but it would be very short by comparison with what happened in 2012-13.</p><p> We also had a group of postgraduate students who were asked whether they were independent.  They were independent at that time but we should have made sure that they were independent at the time of their entry to college rather than at the time they were commencing their postgraduate studies.</p><p> The third group in respect of which there was a difficulty comprised non-Irish or non-EU nationals.  There is a set of grant eligibility rules for six distinct categories for people coming into the country who have the right &mdash; for example, a humanitarian right &mdash; to remain.  They may be refugees or may be married to an Irish citizen.  They are entitled to a grant but there are other groups that are not entitled to a grant.  In the first year, individuals in some of those groups were given the grant.  We found it righted itself in the sense that a number of them became eligible during the year in that they became Irish citizens or their situation was regularised, although it was not at the time of the grant.</p><p> We have made a proposal to the Department.  We obviously stop payments but we have made a proposal to the Department on overpayments in the cases in question.  The issue was identified a year later.  We then had to go in and look at every single student and everything that had happened with every student in question.  We had to talk to the students and get information back from them.  We have made a proposal in those particular cases that we would not recoup the payments that were made.  In normal circumstances, we recoup payments.  In the usual circumstances, we have managed to reduce that to a very small number of students for 2014-15, but we continually keep an eye on it.  We have a system in place.  If, for example, somebody is assessed and is very close to the limit, there is a red flag attached to him or her so that he or she may be reassessed in the following year.</p></speech>

One of the things about student grants is that if one is with the Department of Social Protection and one is overpaid, there is a way in which one is directly related to the body one is dealing with and, effectively, the money can be got back.  We lose a lot of students after the first year so we are not in a continuous relationship with them.  That causes some difficulty in getting the money back.</p></speech>

We have received a submission from City of Dublin ETB and we have sought clarity on whether there was any fraud.  It has confirmed that there was not and that it was not a case of error on behalf of the applicant but more a case of error in the SUSI processes.  Also, the board has asserted that it was a once-off occurrence.  We are looking at the legal issues involved and we are obviously concerned with the impact across the public sector, so we have to look at those issues.  If we were to come to a view - we have not - that any of the sums should be written off, we would have to agree it with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, we are looking at those issues at the moment in relation to those first years.  Ms Stewart has referred to the subsequent years.</p> <p>  We have got to remember that quite a low proportion of students are in receipt of a maintenance grant so, quite often, these are partial or full payments for fees.  In a sense, there is a slight difference.  However, anywhere a mistake was made there has been a correction going forward.  Even if SUSI has a continuing relationship with somebody, that individual is not actually given any cash if SUSI is only paying his or her fees.  It is only paying the student charge, which is &euro;2,750 at the moment.</p></speech>

Obviously we learned a huge amount from 2012-13.  We have subject matter experts.  We have people who have expertise in particular areas of the grant.  We have moved towards a higher proportion of more permanent staff so that we have a continuous staff with a lot of experience.  We have particular areas where we might have difficulty.  In the first year, we had 100% of people to train from the beginning.  Even with our seasonal build-up, that would now be running at around 30%.  Therefore, the balance is a more experienced staff.  In terms of our training, people get individual training, hands-on training and mentoring.  They are part of a team, and they have a team captain and a team leader.  About 40% of all assessment work is quality-assessed.  There is a whole range of supports in place, largely built out of that initial experience, again with a view to trying to get it right.</p></speech>

Many of my questions have already been asked.  One point on which I would like to focus is appeals.  Deputy Collins referred to the set-up situation.  I am a little bothered by the responses.  Was no research done before all this started?  When this was just an idea - was no research done?  Was no forecasting done?  Did we not know how many students would come into the system in the future?  Did we look at how many staff were working in the various VECs around the country that were dealing with this situation prior to the takeover?  Was the call situation not examined in advance?  Why were there so many calls all of a sudden?  There were not that many when responsibility was with the VECs.  I appreciate that there are larger numbers of students coming through.  Was no forecasting done?  If it had been a private business, we would have looked at that in advance.  Why were the expectations regarding what was going to come out of the process so wrong?  I cannot get my head around that.  Was it always planned to outsource all of the activities?  Was that never costed?  It seems Dublin City ETB decided it was the best man for the job and would put in for it, say whatever it took to get the job and then worry about how to do it afterwards.  That is how it looked to me.  I was on a VEC and I was not happy at the time that responsibility was taken from the individual VECs.  I make no bones about that; I said it at the time.  There is an awful lot to be said for local knowledge and having somebody local at the end of a telephone line when a situation arises for a student.</p> <p>  That brings me to the appeals process.  I would like to know how the appeals process is run.</p><p>I have a situation, for example, in which a person applied and was turned down.  He appealed the decision, was turned down again, and then appealed it to the Department of Education and Skills.  He had mental health issues at the time, which is why he was not able to do it.  He was told his appeal was outside whatever length of time he had, and that was why he was turned down, yet he was outside the time because he had mental health issues.  The guy is trying to get himself to a better place and is being refused.  That is wrong.  There should be somebody who can help that gentleman and get him through this instead of giving him a flat "no".  I will make no bones about it: if the case had been with Westmeath VEC, now called Longford and Westmeath ETB, somebody would have looked at the situation and said, "this guy deserves a chance".  </p><p> I would like someone to go through the appeals process with me.  Mr. Burke said earlier that there has to be a level of flexibility in different situations.  To my mind, that is not just true for the different departments but also for the student.  This guy is trying to make good for himself and is being turned down.  </p></speech>

Yes, we did significant work, but we did not do sufficient work in terms of looking in advance of actually engaging City of Dublin ETB to undertake the work.  There was business process re-engineering work and we looked at student grants as one of the areas.  We looked at possible business improvement techniques that could be undertaken.  There was some work done but, unfortunately, with all of the cutbacks, that unit in the Department of Finance was actually closed down and its work diminished.  There were difficulties and it was a very difficult time.</p> <p>  We did trial an online application facility with a number of the VECs, which was rolled out to 24 of them by the 2011-2012 academic year.  That aspect was working well.  Similarly, we trialled payment by electronic funds transfer but, when we were looking at what public body would undertake the process, we made the decision, building on the information we had, that they would look at having experience themselves or, talking to others with experience, that they would make a call to develop a proposal.  That is why we worked it through with City of Dublin ETB.  We would recognise that was deficient, and that is one of the lessons we have learned.  We were overly optimistic about the potential for that to realise the scale of the system.</p> <p>  When we look at the different evaluations that have been undertaken, such as those by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Centre for Effective Services, they identify that we did not put sufficient resources into the management of SUSI initially, into communicating with stakeholders about expectations.  There was an expectation of a really effective service, but it was never the intention to be providing a perfect service in year one.  It was very much building on the previous services that were in place.</p> <p>  As I have outlined already to Deputy Collins, we do think there will be significant cost savings over a number of years with a centralised system.  There is a huge number of benefits in having standard application of processes and so on, in that we can be much more confident that decisions are being made in a consistent manner across all applications.  We can also have much better management information to help decide and advise on possible changes in the future.  We are confident that we are on the right track with this but we fully accept that there were deficiencies in the planning processes.</p></speech>

Not everybody in this world fits into a standard box.  One cannot generalise or categorise people.  What happens to someone who falls outside of the standard applications process, such as the guy I am talking about?  That is where I am coming from and is why I believe that having this in the Dublin city ETB instead of a local situation was wrong from the beginning.  I accept it is where it is now but there has to be some other way of looking at it instead of just standardised applications, because not everybody fits that.</p></speech>

I think that is very important and that is what I am referring to, the standardised means testing.  The system of entry to higher education is a matter for the institutions and we do have a separate fund which we give the institutions, which is for discretionary use in particular cases.  We do not think that any discretion should be exercised centrally and nationally.  We believe discretion should be exercised in the local case where somebody is in dire need of financial support.  That helped a lot in the initial year of SUSI and we are aware of that.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to have room for discretion in the application of a means test but there are always areas where it is difficult and challenging for SUSI to make calls.  The independence issue, for example, is one of those.</p></speech>

We have a section that deals with exceptional circumstances.  We have a particular subject matter expert.  We are willing to talk to Deputy McFadden afterwards about that individual case in terms of the detail.  We are conscious that, in dealing with a large organisation, people can feel that they might get lost.  We do not always know everything that happens.  We also have a complaints section and we try to deal with the individuals.  We are very conscious that there is a separate story for everybody in SUSI.</p> <p>  To be fair to us, we would in City of Dublin VEC, like the other VECs around the country, share the belief in students and in doing as well as we can for them.  We do have an exceptional circumstances expert.  One of the problems sometimes is we do not always know what the problem might be or somebody might not tell us.  We have identified that there----</p></speech>

We try not to go into the formal appeals process if there is a problem arising and we think we can sort it out.  I mentioned the internal review earlier on.  I am not sure why that suddenly appears to be so rigid.  There is also the student grants appeals board and the Ombudsman.  We do not hold people really tightly to the appeals deadline but maybe there was an exception or something happened in that case.  I do not know the answer but we will revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am finding it difficult to comprehend the explanations that are being given this morning, relative to what I perceive to be the reality.</p> <p>  This started in 2005 and I can go back prior to that because things had to be established before they started taking off.  Stakeholders were consulted.  There was preparation of a proposal for the Minister.  This is all leading to policy, I know, but the fact is that it did not drop out of the sky in 2011.  In preparing for the legislation, people were getting signals that there was going to be a huge change.  It was obvious.  In 2006 and 2007 there was a review of resource requirements and business processes through the joint-departmental system, the Irish Vocational Educational Association, IVEA, the steering group and so on.  There were more consultations, partners and stakeholders were involved and I am sure alarm bells were ringing for lots of people, especially members of the VECs, that change was about to happen.  Then we had the Student Support Bill in 2008 and, in 2009, the pilot migration of student grant payments to electronic funds transfer.  In 2010 the decision was made to centralise the student grant administration.  At that point, this was an operation being set about by the Department.  What role had the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in it at that stage?</p></speech>

We had an IT infrastructure and a HR infrastructure in place.  We had a capacity and capability in the assessment of grants and we had been involved in a number of pilot programmes, one an online programme, putting grants online.  We had developed our own assessment system.  We had developed an electronic funds transfer system as well.  Up to that point, many grants were paid manually and by cheque.  We also had ideas about how we would like to develop the system and the kind of things we would like to put in place.  One of the huge benefits that is beginning to become very clear now is that if one is interested in equity of access and equality, there is a huge amount of information coming through in grants - who gets grants, where they get them, what kind of grants they are getting and what are the changes in grants.  We were really interested and enthusiastic from that point of view.</p></speech>

I know how the students and the parents felt.</p><p> I cannot get my head around what happened in respect of outsourcing and insourcing.

In regard to outsourcing and Abtran, we knew that we wanted a call centre and that we needed document management.  We also knew by November that we needed insourcing.  We prepared tender documents on all of these issues and we carried out an assessment in the four areas I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

It is very easy in retrospect to decide that we should have stopped.  While we did not have a benchmark against which to measure service performance in 2012 and 2013, we had a benchmark against which to measure performance in January 2013, which was slightly ahead of the combination of all of the VECs and local authorities at the time.  We know what the performance was during September, October and November, while not knowing the baseline before then.  The group involved would have been the people involved in the planning groups and we have been asking the question, as the Chairman has asked, whether we should have stopped and delayed by one year.  However, we must consider the context of the time and the demand to save resources and reduce numbers in the public service.  We needed to put a shared service in place with the aim of bringing that about.  Therefore, the option of delaying by one year was not considered.</p></speech>

It is a centralised service and discretion was never shown by local authorities, but we have had a challenging time and some self-employed people may have no income or may be marginally above the limit, making them ineligible.  Some students drop out after year one because of the costs of accommodation and other financial pressures.  Parents are under immense pressure if they are educating four or five children at third level and it is important that young people get the opportunity to study.  Could a student appeal a refusal under <i>force majeure</i>?</p></speech>

We try to be positive when students approach us and to help them achieve their entitlement.  It is not just about them passing through the scheme for better or worse.  When we are assessing students we try to get them over the line.  We can go back to them and ask for evidence that might get them over the line but that we would not ask for if it was not relevant.  We had a look at where students fell in the final outcome, whether above or below the line.  Within &euro;20 of the threshold there were more people who lay over the line, at 52 students, than lay under it, at just three.  The same applies at &euro;50 either side of the threshold, and that indicates that people are being facilitated by the means available to us under the scheme and by the way we explore what allowances may be applicable to them or what income may be deductible.  It shows that we are succeeding in giving students every chance to get over the line.</p></speech>

Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  I would like to welcome everyone to the 32nd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with key figures from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Liam O'Reilly, former CEO of the Financial Regulator.  Liam O'Reilly was assistant director general of the Central Bank of Ireland from 1998 and had been responsible for all of the Central Bank's financial supervision functions.  He was appointed interim chief executive at the Financial Regulator in November 2002, and chief executive in May 2003 until he retired in January 2006.</p><p>Mr. O'Reilly, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning.  Before we commence proceedings I wish to advise you that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  </p>  <p>               You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p> <p> Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p> <p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

First of all, I'd like to talk about principles-based regulation.  The approach of the Financial Regulator was that of a principles-based regime.  Such a regime was also the standard approach throughout Europe and was in line with the Basel capital requirements.  The approach was well known and enunciated by the Financial Regulator, and by Government, and publicly accepted.  It was the centrepiece of strategy of the Financial Regulator from the beginning.  The policy laid a heavy responsibility on the boards and senior managements of banks.  It demanded of them that they had high standards of corporate governance, a clear business risk policy, and risk controls in place to monitor and control that risk.  Resources in the Financial Regulator were based on that premise.  The Financial Regulator's main focus at the time was on determining the quality of corporate governance, including risk controls, within the bank.  An important aspect of corporate governance regime was that non-executive directors had a controlling role in the audit committee and remuneration committee.  The regime required direct reporting lines between both the internal auditor and external auditors to the board audit committees.  </p>  <p>         The Financial Regulator asserted its influence by requiring a financial institution to take remedial action as a result of findings of inspections or as a result of other issues that came to light or in some other way.  For example, issues might arise in the course of a review meeting with the bank during themed inspections, by a bank itself reporting a problem or by information supplied by the external auditor, the internal auditor or members of staff.  There was a view that taking over-aggressive action might cause reputational damage to a banking institution, with possible consequent contagion effects.  In general, the foregoing measures were seen as appropriate at the time.  The approach then adopted by the Financial Regulator in line with our principles-based approach was to expect a board would implement the necessary changes and in an expeditious manner.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that this system did not work.  More robust and intrusive measures should have been taken.  </p> <p> At the time, the Financial Regulator was of the view that enforcement action would be more effective if there were in place a set of legally based codes and if administrative sanctions were applied for breaches of such codes.  The appropriate legislation for administrative sanctions was enacted in 2004.  The use of such sanctions was viewed as a more effective and lower key way of keeping non-compliant institutions in line.  The system of codes was well developed in the consumer area and where a set of consumer codes were being finalised in 2005, towards the end of my tenure.  Administrative sanctions would apply to breaches of the codes.  A sanction could range from an official caution to monetary penalties or a disqualification of a service provider.   In the prudential area, it was planned that sanctions would be imposed on institutions in the event of breaches of corporate governance codes and other codes.  Updated requirements were being developed in relation to being a fit and proper person to hold a senior position in a credit institution.  Directors' compliance statements were also being developed.  These were to be implemented following an extensive consultative period. </p> <p> Resources in the Financial Regulator devoted to regulation were determined by the principles-based approach which was not as intrusive as the present system.  The idea was that the internal audit departments, risk committees and external auditors were to be leveraged to fulfil the role of the Financial Regulator.  The Irish principles-based system was endorsed by the IMF FSAP report published in 2006.  That report provided a favourable conclusion as to the adequacy and effectiveness of this system.  However, it is now internationally recognised that the principles-based regulatory system was flawed.  It failed, not only in Ireland, but worldwide.  As a result, regulatory systems are now more intrusive and aggressive.  Greater responsibility is being taken by financial regulators to ensure that adequate systems are in place to measure and mitigate risks.  The Basel II initiatives have also been completely revised to ensure that capital is adequate to cover for adverse and unforeseen circumstances.</p> <p> The interrelationship between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator: it was clearly set out in a memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator that macro-prudential stability was the primary role of the Central Bank and micro-financial stability, i.e. the soundness of individual institutions, was the role of the Financial Regulator.  Both of these parties were determined to make this system work.  This was our mandate under the law.  One of the most important elements for its success was to ensure that there was adequate information exchange.  To achieve this, the following mechanisms were in place: the CBFSAI board, chaired by the Governor, consisted of six Financial Regulator board members and five other board members.  The secretary of the Department of Finance was on the board.  </p>  <p>         All board papers of the Financial Regulator were circulated to senior management in the Central Bank and board minutes would have been made available to board members.  A paper entitled, &quot;Financial Regulator update&quot;, which reported on the activities of the Financial Regulator, was an item on the agenda of the monthly meetings of the CBFSAI board.  All pertinent areas of concern of the Financial Regulator were communicated orally to the board and board minutes on these items were recorded.  The offices of the Governor, the director general of the Central Bank, the CEO of the Financial Regulator and the prudential director were physically in close proximity to each other and day-to-day concerns would have been discussed as a matter of course.  The channels of communication were always kept open.  If any significant action was being contemplated, be it against a given bank or banks generally, such matters would have been brought to the attention of the Central Bank before implementation.<br/><br/>The effect of EMU on financial regulation: after the establishment of EMU, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the banking system operated in an environment characterised by a strong exchange rate and low inflation, low interest rates.  Cheap credit was available to the banking system from Europe.  The control of credit growth, through changes in domestic interest rates, was no longer possible.  Because credit was cheap, there was an over-reliance on short-term lending from the EMU interbank market.  Customer deposits is usually the more stable source of liquidity as a proportion of balance sheets continued to contract.  Increasing reliance was being placed on large, commercial depositors which, by their nature, would have been more mobile.  EMU was formed without the provision of mechanisms for measuring and controlling risks, arising from aggregate euro credit flows, in terms of their destination and-or a concentration in certain sectors.  Therefore, the inherent risk of a financial stability problem on a pan-European basis, due to the build up of credit risk in certain sectors or countries, was neither being monitored nor controlled.  This was a fundamental flaw of the EMU system at its inception.  It was thought that individual countries could look after their own regulatory affairs and markets would do the rest.  This flaw has now been rectified.  Without the use of the interest rate tool, Ireland depended on euro interest rates changing favourably, changes in fiscal policy and moral suasion to rectify the situation over time.  By way of a macro-prudential policy instrument to replace interest rates, two options had been mentioned in the Honohan report and in evidence to this committee: change general capital requirements to reflect the increase in risk and the application of sectoral limits on a mandatory basis.  Subsequent to my departure, increases in capital requirements were applied to high loan-to-value mortgages and speculative property development in May 2006 and January 2007, respectively.  However, in terms of their effectiveness, to quote from the Honohan report, &quot;The measures were in reality also rather modest in their likely [effect].&quot;<br/><br/>Concerns about credit growth: the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator regularly voiced concerns in its publications, quarterly bulletins, annual reports, financial stability reports, about credit growth and the increase in personal indebtedness, particularly in property.  Concerns about commercial property lending were also voiced.  The following are two examples of public statements made by the Financial Regulator.  On 29 July 2005, the Financial Regulator warned about 100% mortgages, saying that they had to be appropriate to each borrower.  Clearly such mortgages were not appropriate to first-time buyers.  At the time, 100% mortgages were a very low proportion of mortgages provided.  A warning also was given on 26 July 2005 in the Financial Regulator's press statement at the launch of its report for the period 2003-2004:</p><blockquote>There is an increasing debate about the rapid growth in credit in the economy and I want to address this area as a matter that could cause concern in the future.  Along with the Central Bank, we are concerned about the rapid rise in the level of indebtedness in the economy and are well aware that if conditions changed adversely, many people could be severely affected. ... It is the responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that their credit standards, provisioning policies and levels of capital are appropriate to provide not only for today but in the event of a future downturn in the market. ... In short, institutions should only advance loans where they are confident [that their customers are ... have an] ability to repay.  They have the responsibility to inform their customers about the risks they are taking on borrowing large amounts of money and that they retain some flexibility to cope with changes in their personal circumstances like unemployment and higher interest rates.</blockquote> <p> </p>  <p>         It is important to emphasise that, in making that statement, the Financial Regulator had no evidence that conditions might deteriorate to such a level that the banking system would succumb to a traumatic shock of the magnitude that occurred in 2008.</p> <p> The following were the factors which provided comfort.  There were demographic and other structural reasons for the need for increased activity in the construction sector and the increase in the level of credit necessary.  However, a view emerged that property was becoming overvalued and there was a need for correction.  At the time of my departure, that correction appeared to be in train.  Fiscal policy was moving in the right direction - through the removal of incentives in the building industry - interest rates in Europe were set to rise and house prices were stabilising.  The regulator had no serious or imminent concerns about the solvency of any particular financial institution.  As the IMF Article IV report emphasised, Irish banks had sufficient buffers of capital to meet any shock that faced the system.  Annual stress tests reinforced this view.  Moreover, the general consensus in the market was that the Irish banking system was well capitalised and the Irish economy was healthy and growing.</p> <p> General conclusions.  In hindsight, the principles-based approach to regulation had major shortcomings.  The Financial Regulator can no longer place the same degree of trust which it previously did in the boards and senior management of banks.  In future, the Financial Regulator must adopt a more intrusive and aggressive approach.  Moreover, the regulatory system did not appreciate the full extent of the credit exposures.  I deeply regret that these failures in the system were not recognised during my tenure in office.</p></speech>

The World Economic Forum has rated Canada's banking system the soundest in the world seven years in a row.  And, I think, in 2009 we were ranked 121 out of 123 countries - i.e., at the awful end of the scale.  Did you pick up anything in your Canadian studies of economics that would help you in seeing what the difference between the two rankings is?</p></speech>

And I found that the relationship was professional and there were pressures from day to day.  I was around during the currency crisis.  You can imagine what sort of, if you like, frenzy there would have been around that period.  My interaction with them during the time when I was in a regulatory position, I didn't ... I didn't notice any difference there at that time.  There were issues that were arising, like the Ansbacher issues, like ICI in 1986, like the Rusnak issue.  And these sort of issues, I think, had a wake-up call for most of the institutions.  In ... AIB, for instance, would have been one of those.  And there was a whole range of changes to corporate culture.  And I remember, particularly when we were involved in the overcharging issue and the issues of inappropriate deal allocations, that there was a whole programme of work that we required within AIB to improve that sort of culture.</p></speech>

So it was the director general of the Central Bank at the time involved himself, but that didn't mean that we were ... were not involved in discussions.  And I know that there were discussions about worries that if the Central Bank functions of lender of last resort, of money market operations, of providing liquidity ... if there was a separation between that and actual day-to-day regulation, it could have caused disruption problems in the event of the institutions being separated.</p></speech>

I think it was 32, I think, in 2000.  It had increased to, I think, 45 in the ... in 2005.  The principles-based approach was not one that was new to the Financial Regulator.  It was ... it was actually one that was continued on from the Central Bank culture, I would have thought.  And not alone that, but this was an approach that was being taken in all countries and the Basel accord and Basel requirements were setting out that that was the way that things were moving.  </p>  <p>         Indeed, the Basel II arrangements were going to be giving more autonomy to banks in determining how much capital they should hold by ... by stating that if you have your proper models in there, maybe you can reduce your capital.  So, unfortunately, there was a mistaken view taken at that time as to who should be regulating banks and to what extent they should be self-regulated as opposed to having a full intrusive, aggressive system in place.</p></speech>

For instance, it did approve of the principles-based regulation system at the time, it said that there had to be a lot of consultation between ourselves and the banks, and I must say during my term in office, it slowed down the the way in which we could implement things that we wanted to implement in a faster manner, and this whole idea of over-regulation was over-emphasised.  And that was all part of Government policy.</p></speech>

There were corporate governance issues early on, and those corporate governance issues we felt had been resolved by the appointment of a new chairman and two new directors, and as well as that, a chief operating officer.  And, unfortunately, within a year - the beginning of 2003 I think it was - the chief operating officer didn't, didn't stay.  He gave his ... his reasons at the time as he had personality differences.  Also, which we were aware at the time there were continuing corporate governance issues.  I suppose, the ... matters came to a head for us in early 2004, with the arrival of a management letter from the auditors of the institution, and concerns that we had as regulators at the time.  As a result of that, we instituted a detailed investigation of that institution and we hired a firm of auditors to do that job.  As a result of that, a set of proposals came from that institution, and the institution was required to carry out certain tasks.  As well as that, I have been hearing in the inquiry here that there have been no sanctions.  </p>  <p>         In that case, a sanction was applied to that institution and during the following year, we had two sets of audit firms within that trying to rectify the problem.  And at the end of my tenure, I thought that progress had been made.  Quite obviously, in hindsight, it wasn't enough.</p></speech>

But, so if Bank A was seriously problematic from 2000, "persistently problematic", says Honohan, from the year 2000 onwards and "prosecution ... was given detailed consideration", it says at the end of box 4.2, "but other less intrusive prudential measures were taken.  Ultimately, however, these proved to be ineffective."  So what else could've been done over those eight years-----</p></speech>

An example I've seen in the inquiry is the one of the night of the guarantee, where there was a worry that if any question was raised about any bank, it could have huge effects on the whole system.  It was that sort of attitude that was around, to a certain extent.  That's why we felt we would be better with an administrative sanctions system and I can talk a little bit later about that.

Another example, by the way, of actions that we took, were in the case of the AIB overcharging and other issues.  We've also forced institutions to carry out their own inquiries and pay for them themselves on our ... and we would have specified the jobs.

These limits ... we were in what was called the market paradigm period, where it was better to apply a price rather than to be trying to apply quantitative limits that can easily be got around, and I think the Honohan report did mention the fact that these sectoral limits could be too easily got around.  So the concentration at the time, I seem to remember, was on how exactly could you apply capital ratios to increase ... to measure the increased risk that would be involved in this lending activity.</p></speech>

I seem to remember Mr. Horan talking about, in his submission, that he had decided to go and make a change in capital requirements, without consultation.  And it was the right thing to do but there was a censure immediately from the industry for having done it.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, from the point of view of organisational structure, there were six Financial Regulator board members on the board of the CBFSAI.  So, there was an immediate crossover.  A second one was that there was a financial stability committee and I, as the CEO, was a member of the financial stability committee.  If there were weaknesses, I think that they were at an organisational level and I think that Professor Honohan mentions in his report that the ... there seems to have been a cultural issue generally.  And he didn't just single out the Central Bank of Ireland, he said it seemed to be a culture in every central bank that economists and accountants find it very difficult to talk to each other in the same language.  </p>  <p>         And I think if there was a lack, I think there should have been a financial stability unit, if you like, permanently attached to the banking department.  I ... I ... when ... in my time ... appointed an economist as a deputy manager in the banking department for that very reason.  But I think we needed much more organised structures and much more communication about issues so that if there was a recognised ... a recognition, in some sense or the other, of the issues that were arising as a result of the growth of credit, on one side, on an aggregate basis and then, on the other side, the individual banks, if that had been put together more, I think we would have been in a better position at the end of the day.</p></speech>

Well, there were two.  Really, the way it was applied in the end was capital requirements were ... were required.  And it seemed to be too little too late.  And I know that - I might as well mention it now - that in on the 15th ... or some time in August 2005, Con Horan came to, well through Pat Horan ... Pat Neary, came to me with a suggestion on this.  And I brought the idea to the director general of the Central Bank and the reasons for not applying it at that stage were that at that stage house prices were stabilising, interest rates were set to rise and property prices were stabilising.  So ... but, generally, it ... they were brought again very quickly after that and they were applied.  But, as Professor Honohan says, they were not ... they were not effective.  And I suppose, just on a theoretical basis, the biggest problem was ... and I think capital ratios were the way to go - increasing capital ratios or capital requirements.  The question was: what was the precise relationship between a 1% or an X% in the capital ratio and how it would affect credit?  And I don't think enough work had been done on that relationship.  And there would've been a danger, unless that work was done, that it would've ... it would've been either too easy or even ground the system to a halt.  And there was a question of how that should be done and that comes back to my point that, I think, if there had been a unit in between of economists and accountants and maybe call them financial accountants ... financial economists ... if that had of been there, it would have been useful.  As a matter of fact, the Larosi&egrave;re report says that the word "macro-prudential policy" didn't seem to enter the English language in any real way until after the crisis.</p></speech>

I was the head of a project team in 2004 which was dealing with this.  And in the case of the banking department, there is a document - and I think you have it in your ... in your store of documents provided by the Central Bank - there was a whole list of legislation that could have been turned into the codes.  Now, I've been told that the reason it wasn't been done was there wasn't enough resources to do it.  I think that was a pity.</p></speech>

I was building an organisation at the time.  We were putting together insurance, credit unions, consumer areas from the Director of Consumer Affairs.  There was a lot of work in putting together an organisation, unifying that organisation and making sure that they worked cohesively.  I felt I had done a good job in that area.  I felt by the way, when I left the regulator, I thought I left it in a good state.  Obviously, in hindsight, the issues were just an iceberg that I didn't see at the time.</p></speech>

And I just felt that there was a need to get out there and to try and get people to listen.  The major outcome of that was the forum of people that we got together every year, the executives of the banks and the economists in those banks.  And as the Honohan report says, there seems to be a kind of a different memory emerging as to what was being said, as to what was being heard but I remember saying at that meeting that if, somewhat like I said in public in 2005, "if a shock hits this system are you ready for that shock, have you adequate capital for it?"  And given the growth in credit and the growth in corporate credit at that stage even I think it was, that was in 2004.</p></speech>

Did this matter come up subsequently to April 2004, that there was a concern about systemic risk between both boards, between the joint meeting?</p></speech>

Minutes of the meeting of the IFSRA regulatory authority 2003 to 2004.</p><blockquote>Supervision agreed at the November ['03] meeting to put in place a ... Task Force to address [the issue] of corporate governance and commercial lending that had arisen following [the discussion] with former executives of an institution.  The results of this Task Force have not been seen.  [And it follows on that in] December 2004 meeting that work had now been completed on putting in place appropriate reporting of consolidated large exposures in another large bank.</blockquote>  <p>One of the criticisms that is ... that has come from some of the bankers was that, while they were aware of their exposure to individuals, the only people with the consolidated data with the authority to request the information on the large exposures of individuals across the banks and could have seen that multiple banks were exposed for multiple hundreds of millions, were yourselves.</p></speech>

I think it wasn't until 2007 that these issues began to be recognised and again I think it comes down to this whole idea of compartmentalisation, if you like, of work - where on the one side, you have economists working on aggregate data and on the other side, you have regulators dealing with individual banks.  There should have been something in the middle where there was a team working on the aggregate position and how it evolved.

I think that the major, the major change would have been a more intrusive form of regulation with more resources to carry out that intrusive regulation.  I think all the ... and I think I heard Cyril Roux talk about this yesterday, or maybe it was Mary O'Dea, you can have a lot of ... of sanctions, but the first thing to do is you have to have the information on which to base the sanctions.  But second of all, I think that the administrative sanctions should have been put in at a much earlier date for prudential supervision.  So, they would have been two things, and then the third thing would have been a much closer relationship between economists and financial regulators, sitting together, in a technical team, all the time watching how aggregate positions were evolving and how the aggregate risk was being recognised.</p></speech>

I think "constructive ambiguity" is a term used by central banks and it relates to the fact that if you are a lender of last resort, you don't want to be saying to banks, "We'll look after you in the end", because if you say that, then banks will behave as if they are going to get the money and take the risks as a result of it.  So constructive ambiguity, as far as I'm concerned, is about the ambiguity to ensure that you're not promising anything so don't depend on us to bail you out.</p></speech>

I just want to ask a question here because I noticed you mentioned the FX trading scandal or the overcharging in AIB, which was exposed to the public by very valuable reporting done by RTE in 2004.  There has been evidence given to other committees in this House.  I'm not sure ... I don't think you have ever been before them but given you're here under oath, was there ever a suggestion made to you in 2001 in a meeting and, in 2002, in a meeting, as has been suggested by an internal auditor of AIB, that there was an overcharging issue in terms of exchange in AIB going on at that time?</p></speech>

It says a whistleblower informed the Financial Regulator in, I think, it was May 2004.  The question I want to ask you just particularly is: did a whistleblower or an internal auditor from AIB make you aware of issues in terms of overcharging in this form in 2011 and 2012?  Because that is testimony that is out there in the public domain and I just want you to answer that if you can.</p></speech>

Can I ask you was it appropriate that the domestic financial institutions were regulated in the same manner as the international institutions?  I know this was touched on earlier.  In your view, were the regulatory institutions of the State focused on non-labelling of the IFSC as an offshore haven instead of ensuring the domestic banks were regulated in a sufficiently robust manner to mitigate against financial stability risks arising from the domestic sector?</p></speech>

I suppose that question has two parts.  One is the consumer area and building up a whole consumer infrastructure and, certainly, it took us a while to build up that structure.  In the case of insurance, we felt that it needed to be increased as well.  In the case of banking supervision, certainly, what was happening was that the staff were ... were ... needed to be very specialised and, as a result of that, it was very, very difficult to continue to maintain the level of specialised staff.  It's a constant battle to keep good people on board.  In terms of numbers, I can say that, in 2000, the number of people in banking supervision was 32, I think; in 2005, it was 46.  Was it enough?  That kind of begs the question of was the regulatory regime a success?  It would have been enough if principles-based regulation was a success.  It wasn't a success; it was a failure.  We needed more resources to do the job that eventually we recognised that needed to be done.  Just to say finally that it was a constant battle to actually get specialised staff.  I remember we'd just got an expert in Basel II in.  He worked in the Bank of England and he was gone within a year to another bank.  Competition was very, very tight to get specialised staff and to retain them.  So to answer your question: did we ever have enough staff?  I would say it was a constant struggle</p></speech>

Perhaps we could have ... we could have put in more people of the economist persuasion within this central unit that I'm talking about.  That would have helped a lot.

You're very welcome, Mr. O'Reilly.  Can I start by asking you, in relation to the banking crisis, and I suppose the fact it happened is the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of the use of supervisory powers but, in your view, essentially what went wrong and who was responsible, given the fact that banking supervision from 2003 to 2008 failed to prevent an unprecedented systemic crisis?  What do you believe are the essential factors that led to that crisis and what went wrong?</p></speech>

The second thing I think I could say is that the system itself was not ... was not conducive to digging down into ... into detail enough.  So the principles-based system didn't work.

No longer can you trust those, and if you have to do the job then, the resources is the issue and, certainly, the way we had set up our system we didn't have enough resources.  If we had had enough resources and, and applied ... I think whether it's principles-based or not, it's more about intrusive, aggressive, or, if you like, depending on boards too much.

Why did you not embark on more stringent intervention in light of this?</p></speech>

There were some micro issues and I think I've talked about them.  But I think that the major issue was that before EMU, if credit started rising, the Central Bank would've increased interest rates.  It wasn't there anymore.  And there was this whole quandary as to what can you do if you don't have the major instrument to quell credit.  And I think it took a while to actually realise that what was needed was what's called macro-prudential supervision, which was what instruments do you use now to quell credit and credit growth.  And we've talked about these capital ratios, sectoral limits, etc., and I think that the whole process of developing that and making sure you had the quantitative work done behind it, so that when you had an instrument, in certain ... for instance, in terms of interest rates, there would've been models that said if you increase interest rates by X, that's the effect on credit; if you increase capital ratios by Y, what is going to be the effect on credit?  And there was a need for that sort of work to be done.</p></speech>

I was conscious of the fact that there was a need for sanctions and there was a need for sanctions to be applied quickly.  Now I don't know what constraints Mr. Neary was put under but certainly there seemed to have been some sort of putting on the long finger of doing consumer legislation before prudential.  But, if I had been there ... but it's very easy to second guess at this stage, hindsight, but I would've hoped that I would've been pushing for the implementation of administrative sanctions for prudential supervision.</p></speech>

And it says, in bullet three: "He proposed roadshows so that CBFSAI's concerns could be communicated to senior management and boards of banks."  What's a roadshow?</p></speech>

You can't go down to, let's say, ploughing championships and start talking about these things, like you can with consumers.  So I would have said that, and the way I interpreted it, was that we needed to start communicating directly with chairmen and chief executives of institutions, and the ultimate piece that emerged ... and remember I was saying this to the financial stability committee, and they then had to work out some sort of strategy, and the major strategy that arose out of that was that we meet the banks, the chief ... the big executives in banks in the forum that we had, and the first one took place at the end of 2004, so that we could communicate our concerns.</p></speech>

And in that same year, and I'll take one bank that's come up in evidence, Bank of Ireland, they have changed their income multiples, they've changed their loan-to-value policies, they've introduced First Start mortgages, and they've introduced more flexibility for seasoned multi-property borrowers.  So they've done that in 2004.  And at the end of 2004, you're warning them about this problem building.  And then in 2005, they turn around and introduce 100% mortgages in response to moves by key competitors, First Active, Ulster Bank and PTSB.</p></speech>

And I said that the banks must make sure that the ... that the ... that there is an ability to pay, etc., etc.  So we were concerned, we were ... continued to be concerned.  I suppose the big problem all the time is: what instruments were we using to put a stop to this?  And, even in 2007, there seemed to be an awful lot of soul searching as to what could be done.  And moral suasion and capital ratios ... or capital requirements were the two things that were being mentioned and they had little effect.</p></speech>

And we entered into some discussions with them about that and eventually the management letter from PwC came in saying that they were quite happy with all their lending policies.  So we were still cynical.  We were still trying to convince banks.  There is still a question, and I agree with you: what instrument should we have been using?  Eventually the instrument that was used was to increase the capital requirements in relation to the 100% loan-to-mortgage and to commercial lending.  That would be 2006.</p></speech>

Thank you very much Mr. O'Reilly.   I just want to deal with a couple of matters there and one is in relation to loan-deposit ratios.  The targets now are in and around 120% and lower.

And I seem to remember around that time there were measures being taken by the ... by the regulator and, I think, they came into fruition eventually to have a whole new regime of liquidity management, which seemed to hold the banks in, well, good stead during that period.  The problem, I suppose, was that again the market paradigm seemed to be working whereby if you could get cheap credit, you should use that cheap credit.  The question of exposures, I suppose, was far from the mind because in some sense there didn't seem to be a consciousness at all that credit markets could freeze up and all of a sudden you're in trouble, and I think that that was a problem.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. O'Reilly.  For the purpose of an internal review, I'm going to document Vol. 3, page 40, which is effectively, it's a section 33AK document but it's ... it's in the aspect, really, of the internal view of the first crisis simulation exercise in 2005 that in a crisis scenario there is a limit in the type of information that can be provided by a principles-based regulator.  Can you comment on this and how was this reflected in the next exercise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.935" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#X01700"><p>Well, that was my last exercise, so I can't say what happened in the next one.  But the idea behind it was that a principles-based regulator, with the level of staff that they had, wouldn't be able to cope with the demands that there would be around at the time of a crisis.  And as a result of that there was a need to make sure that there were contingency plans in place to either get experts in, like, for instance, Merrill Lynch, or PwC, to make sure that we had people on stand-by, to be able to sit in banks who might be in trouble, and be there at the time of the crisis.  And I think that that was the fundamental idea behind saying that you need more in the time of crisis in terms of staff.</p></speech>

I suppose, what I really want in the context ... you received an internal memo in August 2005 where ... effectively during your tenure, where there was ... you could have had a very modest increase in the capital requirements for new high loan-to-value mortgages.  Now, this wasn't implemented until 1 May 2006.  So the question I'm asking is two questions: under principle-based regulation, what was to stop you - with your officers - going into the banks, looking at the process by which loans were granted?  Not the process ... so ... to look at the type of securities they had and so forth.  And furthermore, why didn't you implement this particular proposal during your tenure because it took nearly eight or nine months before it happened?</p></speech>

I discussed it with the director general of the Central Bank and, after the discussion, the general conclusion was that at that stage house prices were stabilising, interest rates were set to rise and the fiscal incentives that were in ... and which were actually inflating house prices, were all being reduced.  So, it just was a timing issue.  If you're asking me now, should we have done it earlier - yes.  But, as the Honohan report says, the actual measure was modest in its effect.  It really did have no effect on what happened afterwards, it didn't control the situation.</p></speech>

The major control was ... if you were saying "Were the management of bank controlling the situation?", I would say no because what we said was that the non-executive directors had a direct line to the internal auditors, we had a direct line to the non-executive audit committee and we ... and ... the internal auditors had a direct reporting line.  So, what ... that was a kind of a control in place.  It wasn't enough because, at the end of the day, it looks like non-executive directors, to a certain extent, were being led by management too much.  There was a need for much more intrusive regulation.</p></speech>

And the Central Bank were ... and that was the biggest bone of contention.  But there were some contrarians and we did have very robust discussions and we came to a consensus in the end.  But the contrarians were listened to and ... reflected, to a large extent, I would have thought, in the financial stability reports.  The problem, I suppose, was that the consensus was balancing risks, etc., that things were going to lead a soft landing whereas maybe certain contrarians were saying "Well, you know, you may say that but this could end in disaster".  But, certainly, the contrarians would not have been a majority or anywhere near a majority on the board.</p></speech>

And this would have been in the early 2000s.  It wouldn't have been during the Financial Regulator.  It was that the Central Bank could not lend to an insolvent institution.  So, therefore, if there was to be a saving of an insolvent institution, the Government had to be involved.  So, I certainly felt at that stage "We need to get the Department of Finance involved in this process as quickly as possible."  That ... that's the only one now in terms of crisis.  Otherwise, we would have been talking about progress in legislation.  For instance, there was an issue once about the building societies Act and this thing about, you know, demutualisation of building societies and there was an anxiety to see that that progressed.  The administrative sanctions legislation, we would have been up there trying to get it passed as quickly as possible.  And even in the case of the 2003 Bill, I remember being involved with the Department of Finance just talking about it.  So general business issues to do with the progress of legislation, I think, more than anything else.  Of course, as well as that, when our budgets started to go to the Department of Finance, we would have had an interaction with them then.  But just to emphasise on that side, there was never an issue about, you know, cutting budgets or anything like that.  It was more about how are we going to fund this?  Should we get it off from the industry first or should we divide it between public or private funding?  But these were the type of issues that we would have been talking about.</p></speech>

Just to say, in terms of ethos, what I found generally, when there was ... when there was a problem. it wasn't a problem ... there were some culture problems, no doubt about that.  And, for instance, in the case of, let's say, the Ruznak affair and the overcharging affair, there was an examination of conscience again and there was a new corporate governance structure put in place.  But generally, we found in institutions there was a very strong willingness to comply.  The compliance problems didn't occur generally as a result of misbehaviour by senior executives.  There were always problems within banks because someone did something wrong, either because it was a mistake or in the case of ... well, in the case of the tax issue, I think that that was a big issue and I remember saying at the time that if someone was to have found to have evaded tax, they were not to be made a fit and proper person for banking.</p></speech>

These were all filled in.  Then they were interviewed and it was in that process it was decided whether a person was a fit and proper person to become a director.  And those criteria were being updated.  There was a major weakness in the system and that was: what about follow-up reviews?  And I'm afraid ... and I think it's there now today, but once you became a director you know, how do you ... it's a bit like when you get in to a job, it's much easier to remove a person before they come in than when you have them in there.</p></speech>

In his book, called <i>Ship of Fools</i>, the ... I think he is now deputy editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Fintan O'Toole, quoted the Industrial Development Authority, the IDA, referring to a flexible and business focused tax and regulatory system in Ireland, and then quotes directly the IDA as follows:</p><blockquote>In 1998, the Regulator advised the banking licence regulations, its banking regulations, and it may now accept under certain circumstances applications from corporate entities to be licensed as banks.  In the case of most group treasury and asset financing operations, the Regulator has disapplied its powers of supervision.</blockquote>  <p>I'll repeat, &quot;...the Regulator has disapplied its powers of supervision.&quot;  Can you throw any light on what that means?</p></speech>

I am going to move towards the wrap-up here Mr. O'Reilly.

I am going to reference some documents and they are actually up in front of you in a moment.  This is from Vol. 3 and it is page 40.  What we have here is an aggregate summary, it's in relation to the financial stability report of 2004 and it's the very end of the page there Mr. O'Reilly, where it says &quot;A number of risks to financial stability were highlighted in the report ... Irish banks growth rate 4 times that of the European average ... Irish banks accessing substantial funding from non-Irish sources ... continued increase in house prices [and] tax policy in favour of home ownership.&quot;  Just moving on further, there is a summary of the actual final stability report of 2004 and that moves to page 45 of the same document.  I just want to bring your attention to the end of col. 1, which is the heading, &quot;Household Sector&quot;.  Bear in mind this is for 2004, again during your tenure.  The &quot;Private-sector indebtedness, measured as the value of debt to gross domestic product ... has increased substantially since the mid-1990s and it is now at historically high levels&quot;.  Moving down then to what would bethe third paragraph on the second column it says:</p><blockquote>First-time house buyers are now more heavily indebted by comparison with their peers in the early and mid-1990s.  Consequently, the repayment burdens of first-time buyers have not fallen with the decline [of] variable mortgage interest rates, which are now at historically low levels, as households are opting [I maybe question the word &quot;opting&quot; here] for higher mortgage debt ... income ratios, higher loan-to-value ratios and/or longer maturity loans.</blockquote>  <p>In layperson's language, this meant that the traditional way of buying a house over 20 years with three to four times one's income was now being pushed out in every conceivable way, 100% mortgages, loan-to-value ratios, the maturity levels over 35 years.  This is all happening under your watch and it is happening in 2004.  Can you give us an explanation as to how the standard, whatever about the standard banking model that was being referred to, I think by Deputy Higgins, and yourself earlier, where banks existed for 100 years, in a very short period of time, peoples' ability to buy a home had been completely refigured into a new model, all at additional cost?  Even though interest rates now were historically low, it was still costing more to buy a house.  Can you explain to us why that happened during your tenure?</p></speech>

And that was a worry that was being expressed there, that people wouldn't be able to afford houses.  The situation had developed, there's no doubt about it, and it's a question of how it developed.  I think that maybe we should not forget the incentive systems that were being provided for to buying the houses, as well as the easy availability of credit.  But I would also say that there was a competition going on between financial institutions, this is in hindsight, which was totally inappropriate for the time.</p></speech>

But really there was a product here being put out, that was a series of products, that if you were giving warnings to the consumer there did not seem to be any particular action and I'll maybe get further clarity on you.  At an institutional level, what were you doing to the institutions to go in to deal with exactly the type of problems you are talking about now?</p></speech>

The risk weight was increased, which was a disincentive.  </p>  <p>         But, you know, in all honesty, moral suasion was the major instrument and it was ineffective and I can't say any more than that.  In hindsight, I'm saying it was a mistake.</p></speech>

Mr. Brian Patterson was interim chairperson ... or, chairman of the IFSRA from November 2002 to April 2003.  He became chairman of the Financial Regulator in May 2003, a position he held until April 2008.  He was also a member of the board of the CBFSAI from May 2003 to April 2008.  Mr. Patterson, you're very welcome before the committee this afternoon.  </p><p>And before hearing from you, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In particular, there are ... or, sorry, in addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information that they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and that they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.

Thank you, Chairman.<br/><br/>In April 2002, I was asked to become the non-executive chairman of the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which we know as IFSRA, by the Minister for Finance, and with involvement also of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The authority was formally constituted in 2003 and I remained chairman until my term expired in April 2008.  Because it may come up later, Chairman, I should mention that as from October 2007, I was dealing with a serious illness.  As chairman of IFSRA, I was also, <i>ex officio</i>, a non-executive member of the board of the Central Bank.<br/><br/>In 2004, instead of the more cumbersome title Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, it was decided to adopt in everyday usage the simpler term, &quot;Financial Regulator&quot;, to mean the whole organisation, and that is the meaning I shall use here.  In this statement, I'll also use the term &quot;authority&quot; to mean the board of the Financial Regulator and &quot;executive&quot; to mean the CEO and his staff.  I'll also refer to the board of the Central Bank.  <br/><br/>My job was to manage the authority, that is, the board, and to ensure that its non-executive group of independent, senior people worked well together and worked effectively with the executive in developing and approving policies, strategies, plans and initiatives.  The executive&rsquo;s job was to manage the organisation and to report to the authority on the ongoing work of regulation.  <br/><br/>The first line of defence against a bank&rsquo;s failure and the responsibility for protecting its safety and soundness lies squarely with the bank itself - its board, its management, its risk committee, its compliance officer; the second line of defence is the bank&rsquo;s auditors; the third line of defence, at that time, was the Financial Regulator, responsible for the prudential regulation of individual banks; and the fourth line of defence was the Central Bank, which retained responsibility for systemic financial stability.  In the banking crisis which befell us here in Ireland, all of these defences failed for complex and interrelated reasons. <br/><br/>As well as setting up a completely new organisation, the Financial Regulator achieved much in developing its consumer protection mandate, in implementing very complex EU directives, as well as regulating insurance, credit unions and the many other areas under its supervision.  However, it clearly failed in its duty to uphold the safety and soundness of Irish banks.  As chairman of the authority, I accept responsibility for my part in that failure.  It's something I regret deeply.  Had I known then what I know now, things could have been very different.The authority and the executive of the Financial Regulator took their responsibilities very seriously.  They were diligent, hard working and, at all times, acted in good faith.  Contrarian opinions were encouraged.  So why did things go so wrong?  That is the question on which I'll try to shed some light, and to do so without in any way seeking to evade my responsibility.  I'll outline a number of reasons that, in my view, led to the ultimate failure of banking regulation.  I'll describe these briefly under two main headings - structure and practice. <br/><br/>Let me first deal with structure.  The interim regulatory authority was set up in 2002 following a long debate which followed the McDowell report about how it might best be structured.  The main issues were: one, which financial services should be brought into its remit; two, whether a new structure would be independent of, or be part of, the Central Bank; and, three, whether it should focus on consumer protection alone or be combined with prudential regulation.  The impetus for an integrated and separate regulator to cover the whole of the financial services industry came from a number of sources.  One, following the radical deregulation of financial services under Presidents Reagan and Bush in the US during the 1980s followed by the &quot;Big Bang&quot; deregulation of 1986 in the UK, financial services had become more deregulated, more complex and were converging across traditional sector boundaries, which, in Ireland, and for historical reasons, had been regulated by separate entities reporting to different Government Departments.  No. 2, it was believed that banks and other financial services were mis-selling to their customers and that stronger emphasis need now to be placed on consumer protection.  Three, the DIRT inquiry and a number of other matters in the 1990s had raised persistent questions as to how effective the Central Bank was in supervising the banks.  So it was believed that a more independent structure with a substantial focus on consumer protection was required.  However, there were strongly competing views as to how this should be done.  Following a lengthy debate, the structure that resulted was a complicated compromise.  </p>  <p>         The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority<b></b>would have responsibility for both consumer protection and the supervision of individual financial services providers, including over 50 banking entities plus 30 EU banks operating on a &quot;passport&quot; basis into Ireland, two building societies, 180 insurance companies, 3,400 funds, 4,000 intermediaries, as well as re-insurance companies, stockbrokers and the Stock Exchange, bureaux de change, licensed moneylenders and 430 credit unions who were vocally opposed to the new regulatory arrangements.  The organisation, with supervisory responsibility for over 8,000 different entities, had a lot on its plate. Of its approximately 350 staff, around 45 were initially allocated to banking supervision.<br/><br/>The authority reported to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Finance.  It had a degree of independence, but, at the same time, operated within the overall framework of the Central Bank in what was to be known as the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland<b>, </b>CBFSAI.  The Central Bank and its Governor retained responsibility for financial stability and had powers to direct the authority in that regard; it remained the &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; under EU directives; it was the sole point of contact with the ECB.  <br/><br/>The web of accountabilities was, to say the least, complicated.  Some observers described the new structures as unwieldy and unworkable.  However, early on, the Governor and I decided to try our best to make them work.  I should say at this point that the Governor and I had a good, professional relationship all the time through my tenure as chairman. In the initial stages, the challenge was to begin implementing the legislation, which at that point was still a Bill, and to build an entirely new organisation with staff who were then working in a number of different organisations and Government Departments.  The regulator inherited most of its staff from the Central Bank and so also inherited, and was effectively constrained by, the Central Bank&rsquo;s HR policies, systems, and culture, a culture which, in my view, was generally hierarchical, deferential, cautious, and secretive.  Accommodation and the critically important services of HR and IT systems were provided by the Central Bank.  The bank was not a strong performer in either of these areas and this did slow down our banking regulators in coping with change, of which there was a lot in the period, and in developing their crucial data analytics capacity. <br/><br/>The Financial Regulator was given formal legal status in 2003, although its sanctioning regime was not in place until nearly two years later, and its ... the new legislative framework for banking supervision, under Basel II, was not in place until 2006.  The authority had its own board of ten members, six of whom also sat on the board of the Central Bank, including myself as chairman and the CEO.  None of the authority - the board - had any experience in regulating banks.  There was some initial training for authority members in prudential regulation and financial stability.  In hindsight, there was not enough. <br/><br/>At the time, those outside the regulator often saw prudential regulation as being in opposition to consumer protection.  There was little or no acceptance that prudential regulation was, and is, in fact, the ultimate in consumer protection for depositors, for shareholders and, as we now know, for taxpayers. Some consumer groups even criticised the amount of resources the authority was then committing to prudential regulation, in so far as it used resources which, in their view, could have been better deployed to consumer protection.  Through all of this time, looking back, there&rsquo;s a theme of taking prudential regulation for granted. <br/><br/>As an example of this mindset, the legislation laid down that the consumer director was to be a statutory, <i>ex officio</i>member of the authority; surprisingly, the prudential director was not.  Early on we recognised this deficiency and we wrote to the Minister to put it on record that even though not written into law, we would treat the prudential director as if he were a full member of the authority, in the sense that he attended and participated in all meetings and received all board papers.  The Minister agreed.<br/><br/>The priority given to consumer protection was exacerbated in those early years by a number of high profile consumer issues, for example, foreign exchange overcharging, which absorbed much time and energy of both the executive and the new authority.  Many of the interactions with senior bankers on these issues were extremely robust.  During one heated discussion in my presence, the CEO of a large bank threw a bunch of keys across the table to our CEO and asked him if he wanted to run the expletive bank. <br/><br/>Part of the CBFSAI mandate was to develop the financial services sector, although not at the expense of safety, soundness and stability &ndash; a responsibility more recently removed in the 2010 Act.  While the regulator legally had no similar responsibility, it was widely believed that its remit included supporting the development of the industry.  Hence there was an effort to ensure that rules and regulatory practice did not have a disproportionate impact on the operation and development of the financial services sector, particularly in relation to the IFSC.  Following a fact finding visit to the US in early 2007, the CEO and I came to the view that the authority did not have sufficient visibility of what was happening in international financial markets and, in particular, in the US. On return, I suggested appointing an international adviser to the authority.  This idea, unfortunately, did not find enough support in the board of the Central Bank or of the authority and, in April 2007, I was forced to drop it.  Again with hindsight, an international adviser might have alerted us to the risks in the US financial markets at that time and how these would come in time to impact the Irish banking system. <br/><br/>Let me turn to the powers of the regulator.  There is some misunderstanding about the limits of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s powers in relation to the banks.  One, first, it had no powers, <i>per se</i>, of approval or disapproval over the banks&rsquo; products like 100% mortgages.  The regulatory framework was not designed around prohibiting products, but around imposing additional capital charges on more risky products.  Second, while it did regulate full subsidiaries of foreign banks in Ireland, it had no powers of prudential regulation over EU banks &quot;passporting&quot; as branches into Ireland, and which were regulated by their home supervisor.  The authority was very conscious that if, for example, the capital requirements on Irish banks were pushed too high, foreign banks which were already, or could move beyond our supervisory reach by switching from subsidiary to branch could have gained advantage over their Irish competitors.  This was particularly the case with some aggressive UK banks, attracted to the Irish market by increased margins.  Trying to regulate these foreign banks through their home supervisor was futile; the role of the ECB in supervision was, at the time, very weak, as was transnational co-operation between banking regulators. <br/><br/>The McDowell report had recommended that the regulator be given powers of administrative sanction so that it could challenge the banks more effectively, although most countries in Europe did not use sanctions as a core part of their prudential banking supervision.  However, the power to impose sanctions on the industry took a long time to materialise.  The legislation was not enacted until August 2004, and by the time statutory instruments and staff training were complete, sanctions were not available to the authority until late 2005, more than two years after vesting.  This lag in giving the regulator powers of sanction may have weakened the new organisation in the eyes of powerful, and dare I say, in the case of a few increasingly arrogant banks.  When eventually enacted, the legislation gave the authority powers to sanction without having to access the courts.  Internally, there were real concerns about legal and possible constitutional challenge.  If, in the early stages, the authority&rsquo;s sanctioning powers were to be struck down by the courts, it would have far-reaching consequences, and these concerns fed into a Central Bank culture which had already had in-built cautiousness and hesitancy.<br/><br/>Resourcing levels in banking supervision, as you've heard, were derived from the principles-based approach.  It's worth noting that in the new, post-crash regulatory regime, a more intrusive, inspection-based approach required a 170% increase in staff resources.  As you have heard, resources at the time were under considerable pressure.  As well as carrying out ongoing supervision, they had, at the same time, to implement a raft of complex EU directives, particularly Basel II.  Management in banking supervision did seek some increase in resources but there was a perceived need to keep a lid on costs and the procedure for getting approval for additional staff was extremely complicated.  Even when approval was obtained, the filling of posts was constrained by, first, the inability to attract enough external candidates at the right level and, second, by the capability of the Central Bank&rsquo;s recruitment function.  </p>  <p>         In relation to the first of these points, the regulator was constrained by the pay scales and HR policies of the Central Bank and its long-standing conformity to terms and conditions of the Civil Service.  And there were three consequences of this: number one, it was virtually impossible to offer competitive market conditions and to bring in, particularly at a senior level, expertise from outside, especially from the highly paid financial services industry.  For example, on the basis of figures which are in the public domain, the authority would never have been in a position at that time to recruit a Matthew Elderfield.  Number two, performance management systems and practices were very weak and number three, the organisation culture was formal and slow.  The authority was obliged to take its IT and systems development from the Central Bank.  Because of problems in this unit, it was a constant source of frustration and inefficiency to the whole organisation and to banking supervision in particular.<br/><br/>In summarising this part about structure, it's clear with hindsight that the Financial Regulator, as it was constituted, was not entirely fit for purpose.  A modern Financial Regulator needs a board with regulatory experience and skills.  It needs an enabling legal framework with strength to counter the naturally powerful influence of the banking sector.  It needs to be well resourced, to have a fast-moving capacity to develop its IT capability and to recruit expert staff.  It needs freedom of action and clarity in its legislative mandate that it's single-mindedly to prioritise the stability of the banking sector over other competing public policy goals.<br/><br/>Let me turn to regulation and practice.  As you've heard <i>ad nauseam</i>, principle-based prudential regulation was at the time perceived internationally as best practice.  It was the bedrock of EU banking supervision as enshrined in the Basel accords &ndash; to which the Irish Government was a signatory.  It had therefore to be embraced by the Central Bank and was inherited and continued by the new Financial Regulator.<br/><br/>In an era of deregulation and belief in free-market policies, principles-based regulation was based on the belief that one, the market should be allowed to operate freely; the regulator should not interfere in product design or pricing and had no powers to do so.  Two, responsible financial services providers were best placed to make decisions about their businesses and were required by government ... required to be governed by experienced managements and boards, backed up by risk committees, compliance officers and auditors.  Boards were required to comprise of persons who were &quot;fit and proper&quot; and who operated in a transparent and ethical way.  This would take, number four, place under regulatory oversight, with reporting, monitoring and risk-based inspections, backed up by strong enforcement.<br/><br/>As part of the EU push to develop the single internal market with a common regulatory framework, the Government had signed up to implement EU-wide, complex, data-rich, risk-based system of prudential regulation named Basel II<b>, </b>which was to complement the principles-based core principles of effective banking supervision<b>. </b>The regulator was required to adopt this system and to bring the Irish banks under its disciplines.  Implementation of Basel II, completed in 2006, fell to the Financial Regulator.  This work was extremely challenging, complex and detailed; it put a lot of strain on the Central Bank&rsquo;s systems development capacity.  Critically, it temporarily diverted a large number of banking supervisory staff from day-to-day supervision at a time when, as we now know, the seeds of the banking crisis were already germinating.  Ironically, the new Basel II framework did not prevent an EU-wide banking crisis and it was superseded in 2011 by a new accord, Basel III.<br/><br/>To strengthen its principles-based approach, in 2005 the authority set out to introduce a new fitness and probity regime for the directors of financial institutions.  There was, inevitably, strong challenge from the industry.  The authority sought legal advice, which was that constitutionally, no directors who were already appointed, could be reassessed and by implication potentially disqualified.  In other words, they were effectively grandfathered or grandmothered.  After the crash, the 2010 Act brought in extensive powers for the Central Bank to examine existing appointees &ndash; powers not available to the regulator before that time.<br/><br/>In a second move taken by the authority to strengthen its supervisory approach, in November 2004 the authority set out to use its discretionary powers under the Central Bank Acts to require compliance statements of directors in financial institutions.  The consequential consultation process ran into a barrage of resistance from the industry.  They deployed a range of arguments, including that this was inconsistent with the company law review group&rsquo;s report.  Following extensive lobbying and discussion, the Department of Finance wrote to the authority in November 2006 asking it not to proceed with the necessary consultation process, &ldquo;without first consulting the Department&rdquo; &ndash; a clear signal to us that this did not have Government support.  In retrospect, I believe we were mistaken not to have pressed ahead with this measure despite the extreme resistance that we faced.<br/><br/>Banking supervision collected data from the banks and carried out on-site inspections.  The principles-based approach focused on checking banks&rsquo; internal control systems and board minutes to assure the supervisors that their internal controls were operating.  Instead of, for example, random sampling of loan files to challenge bank managements' assertions, the inspection methodology left actual judgements of what was prudent to the banks' managements.  The dramatic rise in credit called for new information to be collected from the banks.  However, the Central Bank just did not have the IT change management capacity to specify that data need or to implement it quickly, while also implementing Basel II and doing everything else it was doing for the Central Bank and for the ECB.<br/><br/>Within an often crowded agenda, the CEO and the prudential director reported on their supervision responsibilities at the monthly authority meeting.  The prudential pack, which contained detailed data on an institution-by-institution basis, was a quarterly standing item on the authority&rsquo;s agenda and was discussed at length.  Solvency ratios of the banks under supervision were examined and were continually seen to be within the defined limits.  The pack included some details of major exposures of Irish banks including those to property developers.  These exposures were examined by the executive and were the subject of detailed discussion with the institutions themselves.  The executive assured the authority that all these loans had strong asset backing.  With the benefit of hindsight, the valuations on which this was based depended on some kind of soft landing.<br/><br/>Chairman, I've omitted the next sentence which was in my written statement as I realised after I had submitted it that it was not fully correct.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#HH00300"><p>The regulator had no powers to investigate the affairs of bank customers.  After the crash, it emerged, as we know, that some large developers had never been asked by their bank to provide a statement of affairs nor had the bank properly assessed their net worth.  In hindsight, the executive should examine ... should have examined this more closely and, if necessary, forced the banks to improve the standards of inquiry on which they based their lending decisions.  The prudential pack did not include micro-trend statistics which could've become the focus of discussion had they been present.  This reflected the view that the regulator was a micro-prudential supervisor only, with a mandate to ensure every individual bank had strong capital ratios, rather than to analyse if risk was building in the system as a whole.  <br/><br/>Much has been said on the subject of sector limits.  It is my understanding that the Central Bank had effectively relaxed these limits in the 1990s, prior to the setting up of the Financial Regulator, in order to encourage the development of the IFSC and in particular to facilitate the arrival of one large foreign bank which had a major sector exposure<i>.  </i>It was then felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same, a level playing field, in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an offshore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks.  Furthermore, sector limits are notoriously difficult to define and so were used more as guidelines than rules.  And as banking supervision got closer to the full implementation of Basel II, it became less and less tenable to give any weight to sector limits, which were to be superseded by the Basel II approach.  Nevertheless, and again in hindsight, while sector exposure was monitored by the executive, we paid insufficient attention to this indicator.<br/><br/>The regulator paid close attention to the Central Bank&rsquo;s stress tests, which were largely carried out in the banks themselves under supervision of the Central Bank.  As presented to the authority, they indicated that even under their most pessimistic scenarios, for example, slowdown in economic growth, rise in unemployment, the banks were well capitalised and capable of withstanding any external threats.  </p>  <p>         However, in hindsight they did not factor in, number one: the degree of reliance on international wholesale funding which, as events were to prove, was highly volatile - the banks were borrowing short to lend long; two, the risk of a calamitous collapse in property prices and the consequent impact on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets; and, three, severe economic recession, which impaired the ability of borrowers to repay loans.  The authority took great comfort from the results of these stress tests.  Had they shown a risk to any bank&rsquo;s solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and action would surely have followed. </p> <p> The annual financial stability report, as you have heard, was issued by the Central Bank in each of the years 2004 to 2007, inclusive.  The report was prepared by a joint Central Bank-Financial Regulator committee under the chairmanship of the then director general of the Central Bank.  The report was based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s economic analysis and most recent stress tests, plus input from staff in banking supervision.  Even though the magnitude of the risk was not properly understood, there was often disagreement in this committee about how strong the report should be in identifying risks to the banking system.  The report was finalised by the Governor and the board of the Central Bank.  As the clouds gathered, there were concerns that a strongly worded financial stability report could have resulted in the unintended consequence of causing the very collapse the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank were seeking to avoid.  However, the Governor had regular one-to-one meetings with the Minister and it was believed that he could be more direct in private than he could be in public.</p> <p> The authority was also given a false sense of security by a series of external reports: number one, audit reports on the regulated banks, which did not raise any concerns about liquidity or solvency; number two, the 2006 IMF financial sector assessment programme report, which gave the banks and the Financial Regulator a glowing report; number three, the PwC 2007 report, which again concluded that the banks were in good health and able to weather any storm; and, number four, the IMF report of September 2007, which found that the banking system is "well capitalised, profitable and liquid, and non-performing loans are low".  Again, the authority took great comfort from these reports.  They seemed to confirm what the internal processes and reports were saying, that is, that the banks were well capitalised, and could withstand any downturn or external shocks.</p> <p> To summarise this section on practice, the regulator was operating a system of principles-based regulation, which was internationally accepted as best practice at the time.  It was also embedded in the Basel II accord, a regulatory system to which the Irish Government was committed and which called for dramatic increases in data gathering from the banks.  Implementing Basel II challenged the Central Bank&rsquo;s IT capability and diverted banking supervision staff from normal duties.  None of the many internal processes or external reports that I have described raised serious red flags about the banks&rsquo; viability or pointed to any of the cataclysmic events that were to follow.  Had any of them shown a risk to the banks' solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and the authority would have been impelled to investigate and to take action.</p> <p> In conclusion, Chairman, the Financial Regulator had an overly complex structure with an extremely broad mandate, which emphasised consumer protection as the main priority, with constrained powers and limited resources devoted to banking supervision.  The complex entanglements with the Central Bank also limited the regulator&rsquo;s effectiveness in a number of ways.  However, shortcomings in the structure do not alone explain why the system failed.  The regulator&rsquo;s processes and reports and the findings of external scrutineers, any of which should have raised red flags or sent warning signals, all failed to do so.  As a result, the authority simply did not see the enormity of the risks being taken by the banks themselves and the calamity that was to overwhelm them through the speed and severity of the crash.  Had we known then what we know now, we would, of course, have acted more strongly and used whatever powers were at our disposal with the forcefulness required to rein in the banks&rsquo; lending.  But we did not know then what we know now.  And so, as a key part of the defence against banking failure, the Financial Regulator failed in its responsibility to uphold the safety and soundness of the Irish banks.  As a former chairman of the authority, that is something I will forever regret.</p> <p> Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

The Financial Regulator was responsible for the supervision and regulation of the individual banks.  The Central Bank was responsible for overall systemic financial stability; quite clear, okay?  Because the two organisations had this very complex dividing line, I think, looking back on it, that what happened was some of the accountabilities fell between two stools.  Easier to see in hindsight, but at the time I guess we didn't realise this.  And the financial stability report, which was where all this was supposed to come together, didn't actually do the business.  And I think it was for this reason: were there concerns within the boards of the regulator and the Central Bank about the degree of bank lending and the risks they were taking?  Yes, there were.  There were concerns, and they were often voiced.</p></speech>

We then, we had in the meantime engaged a Finnish expert from Finland who had been the former head of financial regulation in Finland; I can't remember his name offhand, and he became part of our selection process as an independent assessor.</p></speech>

And five members of the authority, plus him, making six in all, became a sub-committee of the authority to make the recommendation to the authority.  We interviewed ... I chaired that process.  We interviewed the four or five candidates on the short list; we split the group of six into two.  They both independently interviewed the candidates, we then came together to discuss what we had seen.  There was a lot of discussion, as inevitably there should be, and eventually a consensus emerged that in the case of Pat Neary, that he was the best person available to do the job.  That recommendation was made to the authority, which approved it unanimously and it was then given to the Minister for formal approval.</p></speech>

Was it the appropriate process?  You were setting up a completely new regulatory authority, why didn&rsquo;t you bring in someone from the outside?  Both were insiders, both were promoted from within the system.

The fact that there wasn't in-depth banking regulation experience on the board was why we brought the Finnish expert in to the process to give that voice, and I think he did that very effectively, that's the first thing.

In relation to performance assessment, the way this worked was that every year I had one-to-one meetings with members of the authority and I asked them what did they think of the performance of the executive and in particular the chief executive.  So I collected their views, added my own, obviously, and then I had a discussion with the chief executive of the day about his performance.</p></speech>

I ...  it took place in November of the year.  It was long after I had retired.  It was a one-off event.  I had never during my time, in ... as chairman, accepted private hospitality like that.  I had been at industry functions all right.  I&rsquo;d never accepted private hospitality from any of the financial services providers and nor would I have, even during my tenure, or around the time of my retirement.  This was seven months later and, therefore, for that reason, for myself, I was comfortable that that was okay to do, all right?  When I realised that the executives had also been invited, and they were still in office, I was less comfortable, although it did go ahead.  It had been ... incidentally, it had been organised some months before the guarantee, so it was in the diary for a long time.  Looking back on it, I ... it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate for the executives to be there and I think they&rsquo;ve said that in this committee and I regret that that happened.</p></speech>

Of course, they're important in banking supervision.  And with the benefit of hindsight, again we can see just how important they ... they were.  I said in my statement that my belief is that sector concentration limits were, in effect, relaxed in the 1990s in order to facilitate the development of the IFSC.  And I think that, sort of, became the conventional wisdom that sector limits were there all right and yes, they would be looked at and so on but they wouldn't be strongly policed.  And with the benefit of hindsight that ... that was wrong.  They should have been, and strong enforcement action should have been taken with the banks to bring that back into line.</p></speech>

But I ensured when I was in hospital that my ... the man who eventually was my successor, Jim Farrell, that he chaired the authority meetings and was available to the executive at all time.  And then when I had the second round of it, I put in place that system again.  I went to the Minister in February of 2008 and said that I was not ... I didn't want to seek reappointment and he wasn't maybe going to reappointment me anyway, but I certainly didn't want to seek reappointment.  So I put him on notice that as of April, he had to have a new chairman.  Did I fulfil my duties?  Not 100%.  Absolutely, I was ... I was ... I wasn't firing on all cylinders.

The first is that in relation to governance, organisation development, leadership, human resources, consumer stuff, yes, I had a lot of experience in those kind of areas.  In relation to banking regulation and banking supervision, I had no experience.  And when I was being asked to become the chairman, I pointed that out to the Minister.

Listen, we'll move on from that.  I don't think it's the burning issue here.  One of the statutory objectives of the Central Bank is the promotion of the financial services industry in Ireland.  In your view, was there a conflict between the objectives of the Financial Regulator and the responsibility for prudential supervision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05600"><p>I think, in hindsight, there is ... there is some conflict, yes.  And I think where that comes home to roost would be in, for example, when we were considering the additional capital requirements that you heard about from Con Horan ... when we were considering that, one of the things that ... that would have weighed heavily with the authority and, I guess, with the executive and also with the Central Bank, because they had to sign off on those would have been that by placing additional capital requirements on the Irish banks, we were setting them at a competitive disadvantage with the foreign banks which were operating in Ireland on a passport basis, yes?  And in that sense, the responsibility to develop and to nurture the Irish financial services industry would have ... would have come into ... into people's consideration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05800"><p>I don't think that was the reason, Deputy.  I think ... I think that principles-based regulation was around a long time before that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05900"><p>Well, maybe I'm not ... I'm not talking about principles-based, which obviously can be dubbed as right-touch ... light-touch regulation.  I'm talking about super light.  I'm talking about the fact that administrative sanctions, additional capital, which all happened within a principles-based regulation model.  But those didn't happen, as you outlined the reasons why some of them didn't happen.  Did that type of, kind of, super light regulation take place as a result of the impact that could take place as a result of the ... contrary to that could have an impact on the financial services centre?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#NN00100"><p>I don't see it like that.  I think they were, kind of, separate events.  Now, undoubtedly, a principles-based regulatory approach suited the foreign banks coming into the IFSC; I won't deny that.  But I don't think that was the genesis of principles-based regulation.  It was around for a long time before that.</p></speech>

This was suggested earlier on by the previous witness, that in relation to, for example, I think, its administrative sanctions that there was ... or sorry it wasn't administrative sanctions, it was concentration levels, that there was a two-tier type of regulation, that the firms in the financial services centre weren't getting the letters in terms of breaching concentration levels?</p></speech>

I think both the executive and the authority set out to have a level playing pitch and that the guys in the IFSC and the Irish banks would be treated the same.  Whether it actually transpired like that, I can't say.</p></speech>

So we have seen, as committee members, evidence, for example, of letters to and fro, to and from banks, from the Financial Regulator, that talks about the concentration levels.</p></speech>

So are you telling us that that approach was also adopted with financial firms in the Irish Financial Services Centre, that banks who breached those limits were also being written to by the regulator?</p></speech>

In your view, did the Financial Regulator have sufficient staff to carry out its tasks in relation to consumer protection and the introduction of the IFRS capital directive and its other statutory roles?</p></speech>

Did the consumer protection division have enough staff?  I think, yes, it did.  I'm sure Mary O'Dea would probably disagree with that but I think, from my vantage point, yes, they did have enough staff.  What was the second one?</p></speech>

There was a perceived need to keep a lid on costs, first of all, and there are reasons for that which I can go into if you wish ... perceived need to keep a lid on costs.  The process for getting approval for additional staff was quite convoluted and lengthy.  It had to go through a whole lot of filters so that by the time it came to the authority, it probably had been watered down quite a lot, and the authority's budget and remuneration committee would have interrogated the executive quite strongly on the need, as they should have done, on the need for additional staff.  The fact that we levied 50% of our costs on the industry was also a factor and industry watchdogs were forever waiting to pounce on us for increases in resources which would impact the size of the levy.  And then, to crown it all, even when approval had been given for extra staff, we were unable to recruit them and so the ... the members of the authority and the budget and remuneration committee were probably entitled to say, "Why are you looking for extra staff when you haven't even filled the posts that we gave you six months ago or a year ago?"</p></speech>

Indeed, he indicated that there may be a &quot;degree of euphoria building up in the property lending markets, and that the boards and managements of banks are being myopic about the potential risks.&quot;.</blockquote>  <p>That's in April 2004.

I don't think it was as specific as that.  I ... I think at that time my sense of it was that the economy was overheating and that this could have consequences.  I ... I do recall, at one of the joint board meetings, when the financial stability report was being discussed - and it may have been later than 2004, just to be clear - I remember saying something like that we didn't really understand why the economy ... all the variables that were at work in why the economy was growing as strongly as it was and why the housing market was growing as ... as strongly as it was and that, therefore, some confluence of events, I remember using these words, some confluence of events, which we could not foresee, might actually turn the whole thing on its head.</p></speech>

I'm gonna ... pressed for time so want to just move to this ... this area here.  Mr. Patterson, in 2006, Fitch placed the Irish banks on a lower rated category for macro-potential risks.  We know, from the evidence that was presented to Liam O'Reilly, that this was brought before the financial stability co-ordination committee in 2006.  The reference - for the secretariat - is in core book, LOR - Vol. 3, 42, but I'm not ... not going to go into quoting from it.  The report itself was covered in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 8 September 2006 and the newspaper reported that, according to Fitch, and I'm quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i>at the time, it says:</p><blockquote>Ireland has a high-quality banking system, but also runs an above average risk of a systemic failure.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Fitch note[d] that private sector credit as a percentage of [...] GDP will reach 190% in 2006.  When this is taken together with the rapid growth in private credit, 21.7% according to the survey, Ireland falls into the &quot;MP[1]3&quot; category, which is Fitch's highest measure of the risk to economic stability.</blockquote>  <p>Was the response of the Financial Regulator, and the Central Bank ... what was the response of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank to this downgrade by Fitch?</p></speech>

I don't recall the specific downgrade or, indeed, that ... that report, but I ... I guess it's part of the ... the overall level of concern that, as I've said earlier, was building inside ... inside the two organisations, about risks and about systemic risk in particular.  The ... the problem in all of this is that there ... there wasn't sufficient alarm in either of the two organisations to impel better action.</p></speech>

So if you were not empowered at one end to deal with what you saw as a problem, you could talk to the other hand and say "do you have actions that you can take?" and we know from our engagement with Mr. Hurley that there was a series of measures that the Central Bank could have used.  The reasoning for maybe choosing not to use them is a different debate.  But even in the interest, the situation of 100% mortgages, okay you're telling us that you didn't have the powers at the time but did you turn round to anybody who did have the powers and say do something about this?</p></speech>

What I referred to in my statement is that the authority didn't have legal powers to approve or disapprove products <i>per se</i>, but that doesn't mean it didn't have other powers.  And as I think I've said, the regulator had powers to try and curb and could have curbed the issue of 100% mortgages.  Now why did it not do so?  It didn't do so because number one ... I think there are a couple of reasons, number one, because the approach at the time was not to...  what's the word I'm looking for...  to become involved in products but the two things that the authority could do would be to police through consumer protection how they were sold.  Were they being sold inappropriately to the wrong people?  Because for some people, 100% mortgages would be okay.  Not a majority but for some people they would be okay.  To police how they were sold and also if the authority felt that the loan book was becoming risky, more so than it should be, then to impose additional capital requirements, which ultimately was done.  So that was the approach and that seemed to be again in line with the famous principles-based regulation.</p></speech>

Good afternoon Mr. Patterson.  Can I ask you firstly your views on the efficacy, it is bound to have been touched on by some of the previous questioners, but the efficacy of principles-based regulation and did those views change from the time that you were appointed chairman and through your time as chairman and subsequently?</p></speech>

That was heavily influenced by the fact that everybody was doing it, bar I think the US and maybe Germany and rules-based regulation did not work too well for them either.  So it was the generally accepted international best practice, all right, and as such I suppose it was accepted without enough question by everybody.  I became part of that groupthink, if you want to call it that.  Did my view change over the years?  No it didn't.  Did it change subsequently?  Yes it did, because we can now see clearly that number one, it wasn't up to the job.  The whole of Europe sees that now and has changed the way they regulate and also particularly I think in the case of Ireland, it wasn't backed by sufficient intrusion because you can have rules and you can have principles and you can have different levels of intrusion with both.  We had principles-based regulation with not a lot of intrusion and that wasn't correct.</p></speech>

Why do I think I was chosen?  I'm not trying to be smart but I guess you should ask them that.  I had experience in the private sector of boards and governance, I knew a good bit about consumer issues because the companies that I worked for had consumer markets.  I knew about organisation development and it was put to me that this is an organisation-building task.  We have to build a new organisation from scratch and you seem to know a thing or two about that so...</p></speech>

I want not to dwell on what has been asked previously but you highlighted in your opening comments about the absence of experiencing bank regulation from the membership of the board and you said that you suggested to the Minister that should be rectified and that that call wasn't implemented or was ignored.  You did however highlight the fact that, you said training was provided for the board members.  In hindsight this was not enough.  Who was responsible for that and what did training consist of?</p></speech>

As the months and years went by, we often had special briefings by specialists within either the regulator or the Cental Bank on specific issues, like EU directives and things like that as well, outside the formal board meetings but with the benefit of hindsight it just wasn't enough.</p></speech>

Can I then also follow on, on to page 4 of your opening statement where you stated under the heading of &quot;Resourcing&quot;, the final two bullet points there, where you said that performance management systems and practices were very weak and organisation culture was formal and slow.  Can I ask what did you do as chairperson to try and change those two particular difficulties, which seem to be more of, on the face of it at least, a managerial difficulty rather than resourcing <i>per se</i>?</p></speech>

I can't say I was wholly successful in that either.</p></speech>

First of all, I was a non-executive chairman.  That means I was in the building one or two days a week maybe.  I think to bring about deep-rooted culture change in an organisation which was fairly resistant to culture change is ... it takes a long time.  You can't do it overnight.  It would take ongoing and energetic leadership by a chief executive and a team of executives to makes that happen and I wasn't in that position.</p></speech>

I then want to turn to another quote from your opening statement and I think ... seem to have lost what page it was on, but I'll read it to you.  You said that "The authority was very conscious that if [...] the capital requirements of Irish banks were pushed too high, foreign banks which could move beyond our supervisory reach could [...] have gained advantage over their Irish competitors."  Did you see your role, and the role of the regulator, therefore, as more protecting the interests of Irish banks, rather than regulating their operation?</p></speech>

And, yes, that was an issue and it often came up in discussion - both in the board and outside the board - as to how you reconcile those two things.  And, as I mentioned, I think in response to Deputy Doherty, that when it came to the capital requirements that were imposed in 2006, that was an issue, as to how far we could push it without seriously disadvantaging the Irish banks.</p></speech>

I may ... I may have given the wrong impression here, Chairman, so forgive me if I did.  There were discussions about sanctions.  One particular bank, which I can't name, there were sanctions applied to them.  There were discussions about the capital requirements, obviously, which is a form of sanction, so yes, there were discussions about sanction.  I interpreted, I think it was Deputy Doherty's question, as to the extreme sanction and, I think, my answer was in relation to that; that there weren't, to my memory, discussions about the nuclear option or anything like that.</p></speech>

And yet our crash in the banking sector was 40% of GPD, a multiple times that of other countries.  Can you explain how we were so much worse than other jurisdictions with the same principles-based regulation?</p></speech>

I think it's because our crash was systemic.  I mean, in the UK another principles-based regulator, they had some spectacular banking crashes like RBS and Northern Rock, but they didn't bring down the whole banking system.  Because it's a bigger country, the banking institutions, presumably, are more broadly spread.  Ours was so concentrated and so intense, I think, that that accounts for the ... that unfortunate difference.</p></speech>

The banks were borrowing short to lend long.  And when the crash came, and I do believe that international factors played a part in stimulating that crash, that it ... it just ... it rolled through the whole system.</p></speech>

They used all kinds of arguments about setting the Irish banks with competitive disadvantage, "Here we go again", etc.  And having taken legal advice, my recollection is that the legal advice was that we would be unable to examine and potentially to disqualify existing directors; and this goes something, if I remember it, it was something to do with the constitutional protection to a right to earn a living, something like that.  And that, therefore, people already in ... in ... office, which is 99% of them, could not be brought into this new regime, and with that realisation, I think the regulator had to think again.  I do believe that later on a new regime was put in place.  Initially, it could only examine new appointees, but with the 2010 Act, as I understand it, they were able to go back and ... and question and reassess existing office holders.  That's the fitness and probity one.</p>  <p>  The directors' compliance statements: again the regulator set out to use the powers under one of the Central Bank Acts to require directors of financial institutions to sign these compliance statements.  And the industry, and it wasn't just the industry, I think IBEC and other organisations were up in arms about this.  </p>  <p>         And the barrage of resistance that we got to those was very substantial and I was aware there was a lot of lobbying going on at Government level and ultimately, the Department of Finance, as I said in my statement, they wrote to the regulator and said we weren't to go ahead with the consultation because we were required to do consultation on all of these things.  We weren't to go ahead with the consultation without seeking their permission, if you like, first.  Now, what happened in that event was, that there was coming down the track, from left field, a consolidation of financial services legislation because there had been layers and layers and layers of legislation and it got very complicated and the Department had planned to consolidate all this into a couple of updated Acts and the decision was taken to try and address it again through that process.  Yes. </p></speech>

But, particularly, that they were fulfilling their duties to manage the bank in a prudent fashion.  That's what would have been in it.  I remember one ... the chairman of one large bank wrote a letter to me which was about materiality and he argued strongly that because there was no materiality clause in this, that if he hadn't bought his dog licence or something, you know, that he couldn't sign it, which I thought was a bit crazy but however.

Welcome Mr. Patterson.  The stress tests that you describe in section 2.6 on page 7 of your presentation here today.  You say the authority took great comfort from the results of the stress tests.

There was a long discussion and I remember coming out of those meetings thinking "Wow, you know, it all looks okay".  And that would have been alongside other concerns that I would have had about some of the things that Senator D'Arcy spoke about, and here were the people who were intimately involved with the stress tests saying "We've looked at it this way, we've looked at it that way, we've turned all the dials up and the banks are still okay".</p></speech>

I think you've already answered that with my colleague, Senator D'Arcy.  Whatever version we were applying, at a 40% of GDP fiscal adjustment costs to pay for banks, I mean nobody else was doing that except Iceland, and you mentioned Germany, so did we take ... and I would put forward Canada, which is in the World Economic Forum ratings of financial stability and banking stability - it has won it outright for the last seven years - but were no other models except what seemed like a wrong interpretation of ... in Ireland ... ever considered by your board?</p></speech>

I think the problem, with the benefit of hindsight, is that while we adopted the European approach to regulation through principles-based there are two other elements missing.  We weren't intrusive enough, because you can have principles-based regulation with a heavy intrusion, and we didn't, and also our enforcement action was too little too late.</p></speech>

It ... it's hard to understand it in the ... in the light of what we know now.  I ... one possible explanation, and I was reflecting on this in ... in recent days, is that, because the financial stability report could not, by its nature - and I mentioned this earlier on - give ... give rise to ... to concerns, or panic, it had to be quite positive and quite optimistic ... because of that I ... I begin to wonder whether that didn't infect people's thinking.  So, you know ... you edit out all the ... the difficult bits out of the financial stability report in case it would spook the horses and then it's only a short step to saying well, that must be true.</p></speech>

These were properties which NAMA discounted by over 60%.</p></speech>

You're very welcome, Mr. Patterson.  Can I just start by asking you, apart from the publication of the financial stability reports over a number of years, how did the Central Bank and IFSRA ensure that the Government was at all times well informed about the macroeconomic situation and ... and trends?</p></speech>

There would have been a number of communications from the Central Bank to the ... the Minister, that the macro piece would not have been within the regulator's remit.</p></speech>

You said that, in your role as chairperson of the board, a non-executive position, you'd find yourself in the building or in the office one or two days a week.  Typically, how many hours work a week would being the non-executive chairman of the board involve?</p></speech>

In the early years I ... I was in there three, four, five days a week, for long days - I don't work an eight hour day.  And then, later on, it varied.  If there was ... if there was some issue happening that required a lot of ... a lot of my time, I would be in, but other days there wouldn't be.  It ... it varied a lot but ... and when I say one or two days a week, I think that was probably how it averaged out, I never measured it.</p></speech>

I was paid something like &euro;20,000, I think, as the director of the Central Bank, and &euro;50,000, as the chairman of the regulator, which came to, I know, &euro;70,000 non-pensionable and fixed.</p></speech>

Just on the issue of the powers that the Financial Regulator had, it strikes me that there is something of a difference between what you said verbally and what's in your ... your written report, and, you indicated a ... a change in your thinking.  Was that a very recent change in your thinking, that the ... that the Financial Regulator did have adequate powers to intervene?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00100"><p>Yes, it is fairly recent.  I ... when I was preparing for this hearing, obviously I did quite a lot of research and I listened to a number of the testimonies that have been made here.  I read a lot of stuff and I came to the conclusion that the regulator did have powers that it could have used and didn't, which only deepens my regret.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00200"><p>Sure.  Because your written statement in section 1.2, which starts on page 3, it makes a number of points about powers, that you didn't have ... that the regulator, sorry, didn't have the power, for example, to disapprove of specific products like 100% mortgages.  You make the point about foreign banks which are passported in here and you didn't ... the regulator didn't want to disadvantage Irish banks through the regulatory approach.  You talk about the delays in the administrative sanction regime coming online, as such.  And then at the very end, in your conclusion, you refer to "constrained powers".  So are you revising those points?</p></speech>

It was only subsequent to that that I really had to face up to the fact that, in truth, there were powers there that could have been used.</p></speech>

But, in preparing your statement ... and over recent months, you had the benefit of the official reports which were published and they dealt quite comprehensively with the issue of the powers available to the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and yet you kind of left the issue of powers hanging there in your statement.  It wasn't entirely clear.</p></speech>

That is a criticism I accept.  You're right that the Nyberg report, for example, does outline a number of powers.  I tended, when the Nyberg report was published, to not want to take that on board, but I have now.</p></speech>

The annual financial stability reports ... you make, I think, quite an important point that, in a sense, it almost had to be sanitised because of the risk of stoking fear or spooking the horses, as you put it.  But doesn't that go to the very heart of the integrity of the document?  I mean, you said earlier on that the financial stability report didn't reflect the concerns of board members.  Isn't that quite an extraordinary situation, that people who would have been reading that report and relying on that report, that it really didn't give the full picture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1780" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00900"><p>I don't think it did, no.  And ... and I believe now that the financial stability report is an inappropriate way of communicating any concerns there are about banks or the banking system for the reasons that you have summarised very well.  But at the time it was.  That was the way, at least publicly, it was done.  The real issue about integrity of the process is whether actions followed from it, not what was written in the report.  Because absent the report ... let's put that report to one side for a minute and say, yes, it had to be optimistic and not to frighten the horses and so on.  Nevertheless, the concerns that, I think, existed within the two boards and the executive could have found their way into stronger and more urgent action and they didn't.</p></speech>

People relied on that report.  Businesses might have made investment decisions on the basis of the Central Bank's assessment, that the fundamentals were strong, there would be a soft landing, that there are risks but they are manageable.  You know, individuals were reading the headlines in the newspapers and on the broadcast media where, you know, there was a strong sense from the Central Bank that, you know, everything's going to be fine.  People were relying on that and I put it to you, you know, was the financial stability report a fully honest document?</p></speech>

And, indeed, some of the analysis that was in the back of it, and I think Tom O'Connell referred to this yesterday, was showing a lot of the concerns.  But I remember being in the central board discussion about the final signed-off wording of the financial stability report and there were voices in ... in ... in-----</p></speech>

But I think, given the size of the problem that had begun to evolve in 2006 and 2007, if the Central Bank came out and said, "We're not going to publish a financial stability report this year", that itself would have set off the alarm bells because I think there comes a point ... let's see if I can describe this properly.  In the early days, the financial stability report probably had to reflect only mild concerns, and so maybe it was able to do that.  As the pressure cooker developed more and more pressure inside it, the financial stability report should have reflected greater concern but, paradoxically, it had to be even more constrained than it had been before because of the fear of bringing about a run on the banks.  So, it got ... you get caught in this kind of dilemma, that no matter what way you jump, you're in trouble.</p></speech>

So, presumably, this is then an analysis of the information that has been fed in from the banks and the regulator looking into the banks.  Okay, X then suggested that the Central Bank "had not convinced market participants that there may be "systemic risk" [that's in inverted commas, suggesting that that's the very word that was used] building up in the banking sector" and "indicated there may be a "degree of euphoria building up in the property lending markets and that the boards and management of banks are being myopic about the potential risks."."

Mary Burke from the Central Bank gave evidence here, "believing that the authorities did not want a stricter regulation regime for Irish banks because the IFSC could then be seen as an area with less regulation that might be compared to an offshore financial haven".  And, Mr. Patterson, you make almost precisely the same point in page ... oh dear, its all my stuff here ...in page 6 and 7 of your written statement, when you say "It was [...] felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same - in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an off-shore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks."  Is this the secret of the riddle?  That there was an international deregulation of the financial services, massive competition and that this ... did this then result in a race to the bottom that was reflected in this policy that was adopted by the regulator?</p></speech>

But my belief is that the source of the inaction, if that's what you call it, came more from the fact that the regulator believed it was following a principles-based approach, right, and that therefore the banks bore the responsibility for managing themselves and for not exceeding prudential risk, etc.  And the reference to a roadshow in the second part of that quotation, in my view, comes under the heading of "moral suasion".  In other words, we're going to go out and we're going to talk to the banks, we're going to point out to them what's happening and we're going to - to go back to what I said earlier - raise our eyebrows at them and say "You know, you shouldn't be doing this," and that the banks would then take corrective action.</p></speech>

The problem there, Mr. Patterson, is - we've said it to the previous witness - the evidence from the banks is that some of them had engaged in huge cheating at the taxpayers' expense.</p></speech>

Now ... with hindsight, that didn't work.  I'm not arguing that point.  It didn't work.  And the enforcement actions, which were available to the regulator, moral suasion, capital requirements, etc., etc., either didn't work ... the moral suasion thing just didn't work because the banks weren't listening, yes, whereas in old God's time, they probably would have listened.</p></speech>

Conditions to licences were used, I believe, only very sparingly, so there were a number of powers there that could have been used that weren't used.  But it all goes back to ... and I know you're fed up listening to this - it all goes back to the fact that the regulator believed principles-based regulation was the way to go.</p></speech>

I just wanted to clarify a couple of things briefly from your opening statement and from the testimony we've already heard today.  Just on page 3 of your opening statement, when you talk about the Central Bank's mandate, part of it being to develop the financial services sector.  And you say, ''While the Regulator legally had no similar responsibility, it was widely believed that its remit included supporting the development of the industry.''  So where did that belief come from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1870" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#FFF00400"><p>It was written into the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, all right?  So CBFSAI, that horrible acronym, had it as a legal responsibility, and the Financial Regulator, even though it had its own Act, operated under the aegis of the overall umbrella of CBFSAI.  And I think that was the main reason why it was believed that the Financial Regulator also had that responsibility.</p></speech>

We could have imposed additional, even more capital requirements than we did, although that would have run into some issues, like the anti-competitiveness issue and so on.  But we could have imposed more stringent capital requirements; we could perhaps have gone at it through the consumer code, right, that it was inappropriate to be selling these 100% mortgages, certain classes of people; we could have attached conditions, conditions to banking licences, that they couldn't ... which effectively would've banned them.</p></speech>

Just moving on then to, to page 4 and it's in page 6 as well of your statement.  You make two references to IT systems, and I'm just wondering ... you talk about problems in the IT unit and then later on you reference how these problems impacted upon your ability to conduct on-site inspections of the banks.  Are we talking about a simple IT problem, or are you implying something else here in terms of co-operation from the Central Bank?</p></speech>

We developed MOUs between the regulator and the IT unit.  I think the chief executive, what's the word I'm looking for, assigned a particular responsibility to one of the senior executives to pay close attention to this and to have regular meetings with IT to see how things were going.  So those things were attempts to try and speed things up and to move it more quickly but we were, nevertheless, a prisoner of the Central Bank's IT unit.

Where they discovered late in the day that net worth statements were very flaky.  They either didn't exist in some cases or they hadn't been independently verified and that some of the tests that the banks were believed to be applying to loan requests weren't being applied.  So in other words, the ground on which that was based was very shaky.</p></speech>

Thanks, Chair.  Just in relation to that process though, because in that five by five exposure test that was done into the big developers, it was found in one of the tests that one of the banks in terms of calculations of an exposure to one individual borrower, was out by a billion.  But it also noted that the - and I'm paraphrasing here - that the significance of that wasn't understood by the regulatory system..</p></speech>

And then just a final question in relation to your opening statement and again, it's on page 6 and it's in relation to the IFSC, talking about sector limit and it came up earlier.  You talked about, the Central Bank had effectively relaxed these limits in the 1990s, in particular to facilitate the arrival of one large foreign bank which had a major sector exposure.  It was then felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an offshore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks.</p></speech>

After 2004, when the IMF and the OECD and ECOFIN all clearly recommended a tighter fiscal stance and the building up of a cushion for the time when income from property-related transactions would fall, can you say why, in your view, the Central Bank's recommendations to the Minister didn't more forcefully alert this particular issue?</p></speech>

It actually relates to the interim financial stability report to the board of the Central Bank in the first half of 2006.  It says, this ... this document, this is one of our accumulated documents:</p><blockquote>.... raised the alert on the financial stability risk from private indebtedness, re-accelerating house price growth and strong loan volume growth of the Irish banks.  It also raised concerns on the strong rise of loans to commercial property-related non-financial corporates which had played a minor part in the commentary of former financial stability reports to date.</blockquote>  <p>Now people have talked about the appropriateness, or not, of financial stability reports in the ... that one seemed to me to be quite robust.

I think this is the problem, and we've touched on this a number of times this afternoon, that ...there ... inside the organisation there were concerns.  </p>  <p>         There were concerns in ... you've heard from one of the economists ... there were concerns in the executive; there were concerns in the board of the regulator; there were concerns in the board of the Central Bank.  The fact that those concerns didn't get aired raucously in the financial stability report, I think, we understand the reason why that couldn't be.  So, the real question to ask is why was the regulator and the Central Bank not then impelled to act.  It's in the absence of action that the problem lies.</p></speech>

I wouldn't go that far, Senator.  You've heard Con Horan talking about 2005 and 2006 and his efforts in 2005 to get additional capital requirements, which eventually happened in 2006, and, in fairness to the authority, they were right behind that.  There was no member of the authority saying we shouldn't be doing this and there were ... and I know there were some actions taken against bank X that we haven't talked about to try and deal with the governance problems there, including capital requirements.  So ... there ... yes, there were actions taken ... it wasn't that people did nothing.  I think the problem is it wasn't urgent enough and it wasn't enough.</p></speech>

Fifty because the belief was that the industry should pay at least a good chunk of it but not all of it and the reason for not levying 100% on the industry was to avoid what's called regulatory capture - that if the industry was paying for all of it, then we might fall under the stray too much.</p></speech>

And I would include in that the radical deregulation of financial services that happened in the US and the UK and which Ireland followed.  But I guess in more substantive terms, my judgment, there isn't a magic date when you say they rang a bell and said it's now started.

And this is Ireland and this is Dublin.  So people, you know, they attend industry functions and they bump up against people and so on and so forth.

But if you are talking about you know, a senior banker ringing up and saying will you need to meet in a pub and talk about something, I don't believe that happened.</p></speech>

I think that they're ... I've said ... I've said that the financial stability report, with hindsight, is an inappropriate vehicle for communicating issues around the banking system and that's why it's been stopped.  And I think that the people, including myself, who were responsible for signing off the financial stability reports, particularly in the years 2006, 2007, were in a real bind as to what you could say and what you could not say.  And as I said, paradoxically, the higher the level of risk, the more constrained you have to be, it kind of works in this way.  So from that point of view, they're not an appropriate vehicle for doing that.  The issue is whether or not those who could take action did take action and the answer is they didn't.</p></speech>

No, there's been ... there's been a lot of discussion about the responsibility of the Central Bank, the responsibility of the regulator, and to me you can parse it and ... and look at the legalities and the structure and everything, but the reality is both organisations shared the same building, they shared the same services, they had common employer, they were committed to working together, so that's not the issue.  The issue is, how was it that they collectively failed to act sufficiently?  That's the issue.  And the last thing I'd like to say is, in trying to shed light on why I think the system failed, I don't want to create any impression that I'm evading my own responsibility, because I've fessed up to that, and I still regret it and I will regret it all the days of my life.</p></speech>

Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m has appeared before the committee.  Investor-to-state dispute settlement, ISDS, is an important matter and I am happy to address that.  I will make introductory remarks and then give an overview of the current state of play on this part of the negotiations.</p> <p>  First, I should recall what is investment protection and ISDS.  Investment protection is a set of basic substantive rules comprising protection against discrimination, expropriation without compensation and unfair or inequitable treatment.  These types of rules are commonplace in international economic law.  The foundation, for example, of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, is its rules preventing discrimination.  ISDS is a dispute settlement mechanism which allows the effective enforcement of these rules and it only applies to these limited rules.  Investment protection and ISDS is not a new feature of international agreements.  There are at least 3,200 agreements in existence which have these features.  Some are larger agreements, where this forms a chapter and others are narrower agreements only dealing with this issue.  EU member states are party to approximately half of these agreements.  Ireland itself is party, via its membership of the EU, to one such agreement &ndash; the energy charter treaty.</p> <p>  Modern free trade agreements extend beyond border tariffs and include such behind the border disciplines.  If members look around the world today at the ongoing negotiations, they will see similar disciplines being negotiated in many international agreements.  When it came to TTIP, member state governments agreed with the Commission that the negotiations should also cover these matters.  Investment protection and ISDS was thus included in list of subjects mentioned in the negotiating directives handed to the Commission in June 2013.</p> <p>  Negotiations are currently suspended on this part of the agreement.  Concerns have been raised by the public regarding ISDS tribunals on the states&rsquo; right to regulate.  As a result of these concerns, the Commission suspended the negotiations on investment protection with the US in January 2014 and organised in 2014 a public consultation to collect views from the wider public on how the EU could further improve its policy approach.  In the consultation, the Commission presented the approach on investment protection and ISDS taken in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, CETA.  Negotiations there are complete.  This agreement introduced significant reforms on investment protection, which tackled a number of the problems which have been raised.  For instance, we clarified key legal concepts and made significant changes to the operation of tribunals.  We required full transparency, a mandatory code of conduct and other procedural changes, which are designed to ensure that the ISDS procedure is not abused.</p> <p>  The consultation brought to light four areas where further clarifications could be explored.</p><p>On 5 May 2015, Commissioner <font color="#2F2F2F">Malmstr&ouml;m, </font>made public a concept paper on investment protection and Investor to State Dispute Settlement, ISDS, in TTIP and beyond.  The concept paper outlines concrete ideas on how to reform investment protection and ISDS in TTIP and in other EU trade agreements.  The orientations set out in the concept paper respond to the four areas for further reflection identified by the public consultation and incorporates many of the views on this issue conveyed in recent months by the European Parliament, member states and EU stakeholders.  The paper sets out how the Commission will provide clarity on how the right to regulate is not undermined by these rules.  It will ensure a move away from the current <i>ad hoc</i>arbitration system to a more court-like system by assimilating the qualifications of the arbitrators under TTIP to those of national judges and the creation of an appellate mechanism in TTIP.  Commissioner <font color="#2F2F2F">Malmstr&ouml;m </font>has also put forward the concrete proposal that the EU should work towards the establishment of a multilateral investment court and appellate mechanism.  <br/><br/>The Commission&rsquo;s goal for TTIP and beyond is a reformed investment policy which ensures that the goal of protecting and encouraging investment does not affect the ability of the EU and its member states to continue to pursue public policy objectives.  The Commission is now discussing these proposals with EU member states and the European Parliament.  Following these discussions, the Commission hopes to be able to resume negotiations with the US on this matter.<br/><br/>I thank members of the committee for their attention.  The Commission very much welcomes the input of national parliaments on these matters.  I am aware that the committee is also working on a paper on ISDS.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Healy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for providing the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, with this opportunity make an input on this issue.  From our point of view, the economic research aspects are paramount.  Clearly, the debate around ISDS is very significant, particularly in light of yesterday's developments in the European Parliament which, I understand, will entail some delay in terms of deliberations on the entire TTIP situation.</p> <p>  Before dealing specifically with ISDS, I would like to highlight the context in which this discussion is happening.  It is significant that the results of research by Copenhagen Economics, CE, is positive in regard to the impact of TTIP but uncertain with respect to the scale of impact, particularly on jobs, GDP, wages and investment.  Another approach to measuring the impact of TTIP adopted by other researchers, including Jeronim Capaldo of Tufts University in the USA, using a different macroeconomic model found different scale of impact at the European level.  It is very likely, in the Irish case, that the relatively modest positive impact of TTIP claimed in the Copenhagen study would be negative, depending on the overall impact.  I must emphasise that because of the degree of uncertainty about TTIP, in particular in terms of what may be at stake in other areas that have social, environmental and labour law implications, it is important all of these factors are carefully assessed and weighed up.</p> <p>  In regard to ISDS, which is the focus of today's discussion and consideration, this is a complex area.  It is important that the interaction between national European and external arbitration is carefully considered because there is no experience of ISDS in this jurisdiction.  We are unique in that regard, which may very well reflect a reality in terms of the way property rights and investments are secured by national policy and legal interpretation.  In any case, this matter does raise complex questions in terms of the way that the Irish Constitution would operate and, possibly, also in terms of the jurisdiction of Irish courts vis-a-vis any external tribunal or mechanism.  A note of caution needs to be entered there.  </p> <p>  The other consideration is the practice of ISDS.  The concern expressed at many quarters and at many levels is that because the "I" in ISDS stands for investor there is, in that sense, an imbalance in terms of concerns, rights and interests, particularly those reflecting, broadly, of citizens, workers and various components of civil society.  It is opportune to return to the drawing board in terms of ISDS because this does appear to be the key issue in terms of amendments and concerns expressed in the European Parliament, leading up to yesterday's decision to postpone the vote.  </p> <p>  The key concern raised is in relation to public services provision in the areas of, for example, education, health and local government services.  Where these activities are carried out on a commercial basis, there is every reason to think that they could be liable to oversight in the way that ISDS operates.  In simple terms what this means is that unless an activity is listed there is a risk that it may be lost in terms of protection from challenge at international level.  The guarantees and reassurances in relation to various general economic interests and activities, particularly in the areas of education and health, failed to convince many commentators that the adoption of a negative list approach will not expose existing activities in local authorities, including water services, health services, education services to challenge in the future.  Those are areas that need to be addressed before there is a wider acceptance and comfort with the whole TTIP framework.</p></speech>

It is important this committee and others provide opportunities for discussion on the key issues around the EU-US trade deal.</p> <p>  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland is an Irish organisation.  It is the voice of US companies in Ireland and, increasingly, the voice of Irish companies who have invested and are trading in the United States.  The chamber supports a satisfactory and robust EU-US trade deal for a number of reasons.  The European Union and the United States are the two largest trading partners in the world.  Ireland is at the heart of that key trading relationship.  We think it makes sense that an examination would be carried out to ensure any unnecessary barriers to trade between those two huge trading partners are mitigated or removed in a robust and effective manner.  </p> <p>  It is true to say that the US business sector views Ireland as an exemplar in terms of trade and investment.  In terms of the history of the trading relationship between the United States and Ireland, currently the US is the largest export destination in the world for Irish goods.  US foreign direct investment in Ireland stands at $240 billion.  It exceeds combined investment in the BRICS countries.  US companies in Ireland employ 130,000 people directly and further support 100,000 indirect jobs.  Those people, producing great products and services in Ireland, represent 26% of our country's GDP.  This long relationship in some cases spans 100 years and in others spans 30, 40 or 50 years and has touched every community in our country.  We know how trade and investment with the United States can benefit our people.  This two-way relationship has never been as strong, which is very positive.  Irish companies currently provide between 80,000 and 100,000 direct jobs in the United States.  For the last year in respect of data is available, Irish US subsidiary companies generated $63 billion in sales and invested $2 billion in research and development in the United States.  As I said, this is very much a two-way relationship.  </p> <p>  As we meet today, the top ten ICT companies globally employ people in Ireland.  The top ten data, or born on the Internet, and social media companies employ thousands of people here.  Nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies, 75% of the top global financial services companies and the top ten med-tech companies are located here.  This is what trade and investment has meant to Ireland.  This is not only about the data I have mentioned but about the impact on our physical and digital infrastructure and the impact on our social fabric as a country.</p><p>We would support an EU-US trade deal, but not at any cost.  However, here will be a cost to our two economies if an effective deal cannot be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Mahoney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#D00200"><p>Chambers Ireland is the largest business network in the State.  With members in every geographic region and economic sector in Ireland, we are well positioned to represent the views of SMEs on TTIP and trade.</p> <p>  The transatlantic trade and investment partnership is a negotiation between two of the largest trading economies in the world.  There is tremendous potential here.  My colleagues outlined some of the potential for Irish SMEs.  I will speak about the benefit to Irish SMEs.</p> <p>  As a member of the European Chambers of Commerce, Eurochambres, we actively promote the interests of Irish SMEs at European level.  The European chambers are recognised as being a strong voice for SMEs and that is why they have been nominated as the SME representative body on the TTIP advisory group, and that is where we feed in our input to the negotiation process.</p> <p>  The trade agreement is predicted to go a long way towards reducing the cost of exporting to the Irish businesses, particularly SMEs.  Although tariffs between the EU and US are relatively low, Irish exporters still pay in excess of $300 million per year in tariffs to the US Treasury.  Efforts to reduce it, from an average rate of 3% to a zero rate, will have a significant benefit for companies, especially SMEs.  A relatively low tariff impacts larger companies much less than smaller companies.  The material impact of a low tariff percentage on an SME can be an inhibitor to it investing in the US market.</p> <p>  Where we see the real benefit for Irish SMEs is in the non-tariff barriers.  Regulatory divergence, such as complex certification procedures and duplication of standards, can be particularly burdensome to smaller firms.  If one needs to complete 20 or 30 pages of documentation to get some goods through customs, it is the same amount of documentation that needs to be completed for a large company as for an SME.  The resource strain on SMEs is considerable.  This is one of the main barriers we see to SMEs looking beyond the domestic market and moving internationally.</p> <p>  The fixed cost of these regulatory complexities are easily borne by large companies.  Our research shows that to get exports certified in both the EU and the US can cost between $5,000 and $10,000, depending on the product.  A large company can absorb that cost; a small company cannot.  Fundamentally, the benefits for us of TTIP will be on the mechanics of trade.  It will be on synchronising rather than reducing legislation, ensuring SMEs can access it on an equal footing and opening up markets.</p> <p>  The following is what needs to be done to ensure SMEs can benefit from the agreement.  We pushed fairly hard for a dedicated SME chapter within the negotiations that will set out how SMEs can access the benefits to be derived from the trade agreement.  This needs to be apprehensible by a small company.  It needs to stand out from the overall broader agreement.</p> <p>  There also needs to be serious motivation towards real regulatory co-operation.  If there is some sort of half-baked effort at regulatory co-operation, the benefits to the SMEs will not materialise.  The bigger companies can allocate the resources to meet a new standard, but if it is a halfway house, the SMEs will be left out again.  There needs to be a comprehensive agreement reached on regulatory standards.</p> <p>  We would be very much in favour of ISDS, especially for SMEs.  If such companies are taking a risk to invest or trade with another jurisdiction and if there is a change in policy of a particular US state, they will have no chance of pursuing that through the courts.  They need an ISDS mechanism to have access to justice and to try to recoup their investment.  We would have different views about how that ISDS might be structured but it is important, from the point of view of SMEs, that it includes an ISDS.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak and I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to share the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' view.  Congress is very concerned about the introduction of rights for companies to launch a suit for financial compensation if a government introduces rules that could have an impact on the company's profits.  We are also strongly opposed to the inclusion in TTIP, or indeed any trade agreement, of investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, and we would want to see the Parliament send a clear and unequivocal message that it should be removed.  This proposal is an affront to democracy in so far as it allows investors to sue governments in secret courts composed of corporate lawyers at which others do not have representation for compensation over national laws or rules that affect their activities.  This quasi-legal process is not subject to judicial review.  An increasing number of cases of this type are already in train and TTIP will give investors a clear and certain privilege over citizens.  We believe that it is unacceptable in principle for foreign investors to have privileged access to a separate dispute resolution system from everyone else, and we believe that existing court systems in Europe and the USA are perfectly adequate.  We also believe that the ISDS system would have a chill effect in relation to governments and could possibly delay, obstruct or impede policies being introduced in the public good because of fear of the ISDS system.</p> <p>  A careful consideration of the evidence and the issues at stake are of vital importance.  The ISDS has been the subject of much controversy in the past year, not least in those member states that have unpleasant experiences of the workings of that system.  We are not in a position to say whether ISDS or a similar type agreement would not be open to constitutional challenge in Ireland.  In the Irish case, we have no experience of ISDS arrangements.  We are seen as a golden pupil when it comes to such issues as investor-friendly conditions and tax treatment, and also because Irish courts have not been noted for their hostility to restrictive interpretations of the right of property and business interests generally.  Our judgment is that we should do what they did in Australia, that is, delete it.</p> <p>  On public services, some have argued that education and health services are exempt from TTIP.  Defining public services as an excise of governmental authority exempt from competition rules does not seem to apply here.  The fact is that health and education services are already spread between public and private providers, often on a competitive basis.  The risk is that TTIP could apply to existing arrangements and leave states and public service providers open to legal challenge via private tribunals.  A positive list in regard to public services would be far superior to a negative list.</p> <p>  We believe that adherence to the fundamental human rights set out by the UN's tripartite body for work issues, the eight core conversations of the International Labour Organization setting out standards and conditions at work, should not only be a key part of the sustainable development chapter of TTIP but should also apply to all elements of the agreement, and that adherence to the sustainable development chapter should be binding and enforceable.  Our fear is that multinational companies may be able to challenge collective agreements as barriers to trade and investment thereby accelerating a race to the bottom in employment standards.  The public procurement chapter in the agreement must protect and promote the provisions of the new European Union procurement directives, including specific reference to the social employment and environmental protection provisions and the right of public authorities to decide how they deliver works and services, including the legitimate right to provide them through in-house provision or public co-operation.</p></speech>

I have a simple question.  On the concern about TTIP expressed here and before the committee previously, what about a dispute resolution process?  Could we hear a little more about multilateral investment courts to which reference was made?  For example, we all would be concerned about the possibility of governments being sued.  I am not sure that it is so easy to bypass the national constitutions and move straight into that area.  I am not convinced that can happen.  Where a group of governments enters into an agreement, the governments have their respective constitutions to adhere to.</p><p>It is presumed they will have regard to these constitutions before entering into the agreement, as we have done in the case of membership of the European Union.  I seek clarification on that point. <br/><br/>To what extent can business and jobs in Ireland increase as a result of the TTIP?  We would be most supportive of an agreement that was beneficial to Ireland.  If, however, it was to transpire that some smaller industries or jobs would be displaced on a <i>quid pro quo</i>basis, we would have concerns about this.  I would appreciate comments of the delegates on that point.</p></speech>

This week the President of the European Parliament announced that a key vote on a report and amendments to the TTIP would not take place as planned.  This is seen as a minor victory for those who have genuine concerns about the proposed deal.  What are the delegates&rsquo; views of the postponement?  What do they believe will happen now?  Do they agree that it shows the European Union is very divided on the issues involved and that public outrage has stirred politicians?</p> <p>  Ireland has never agreed to, or implemented, investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanisms in trade agreements.  Why do the delegates who are in favour of them believe Ireland needs them now?  Do they not believe giving businesses special courts to sue governments sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the ability of governments to regulate and pass laws in the public interest?  Are they not worried that the ISDS is the means by which Canada has been sued because of its moratorium on fracking and by which Australia has been sued because of its public health measures on smoking and that in the 45 cases taken to date under this type of mechanism almost &euro;5 billion in public funds has been paid to investors?  </p> <p>  The lack of transparency surrounding the lobbying activity of corporate lobby groups based in Brussels is truly alarming.  Private interest groups overwhelmingly dominated the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP consultations, nine of ten lobby contacts during the preparatory phase of the negotiations were with companies and corporate lobby groups.  Do the delegates agree that more needs to be done to ensure transparency on the activities of lobbyists and that the public deserves transparency in respect of possible influence exerted over those who are supposed to act in our best interests?</p></speech>

We see this as a healthy and important exchange.  I have only recently become a member of the committee.</p> <p>  Why do the delegates think we have not reached agreement on the TTIP?</p> <p>  Mr. Redmond referred to Ireland&rsquo;s pharmaceutical industry, one of our stronger industries.  I understand further testing needs to take place in the United States, which is very costly.  Is it because there is a higher standard of testing in the United States than in the European Union?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Brown" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#E00500"><p>I thank members for their questions and comments.  I will answer them to the best of my ability.  </p> <p>  In response to the comment that the TTIP is an affront to democracy, once such agreements are negotiated, they will have to be approved by the European Parliament and, we expect, national parliaments.  There will be a democratic say at the end of negotiations on whether the agreements are acceptable.  We take a great deal of care when designing and negotiating these treaties to make sure they are consistent with constitutional requirements and at the same time consistent with the basic right to regulate.  The four substantive standards I mentioned in my presentation are written in such a way - the European Union intends in the TTIP context to further clarify this - that they will not undermine the right to regulate.  Genuine legislation adopted to pursue a health or labour goal or to implement the concept of collective bargaining applied on a non-discriminatory basis cannot be undermined via an ISDS because we design the rules in such a way to make sure they will not be undermined.  The cases mentioned by Deputy Sandra McLellan against Australia on plain packaging and Canada on fracking are pending and we will need to see how they play out.  The European Union&rsquo;s objective in drafting is to make sure we will be in a situation where the type of regulatory action taken, for example, on plain packaging, on which Ireland has also adopted legislation, draft language, in particular on the concept of expropriation, the key aspect here, will not be successful under the TTIP or our agreement with Canada and other such agreements.  The right to regulate, ensuring there is no impact on democratically decided legislation, has been very carefully constructed by the Commission.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman asked about the possibility of a member state being sued because of implementation of an EU directive.  Legislation has been passed through the European Council and the Parliament in recent years which has put a framework in place for this.  It has several levels of complication, but the basic manner in which it works is that if a member state was transposing an EU directive, the European Union would be the defendant and carry financial responsibility in the case, if any financial responsibility were to flow in that circumstance. </p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked about the establishment of a multilateral court.  The Commission views this as desirable and we want to work on the issue, but it will take some time to achieve.  There are other countries which are interested in pursuing this issue and we need to build negotiations with them.  In the meantime we want to make sure the improvements I mentioned in my presentation are already applicable.  They will be via the TTIP and will be added to the other negotiations on this type of issue.</p><p>We would hope that within a certain period they would be replaced by a multilateral system.  <br/><br/>Perhaps I can respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on the issue of transparency.  The Commission is very conscious of the importance of these negotiations and the concerns that arise.  We make ourselves available to all interested parties.  For example, on<b></b>investor states<b>, </b>I have had more meetings with NGOs and other entities than with corporate lobbyists.  We are subject to transparency requirements and citizens can request that we make public the records of all our meetings.  I understand that many people are concerned about this but I can assure the Deputy the Commission is very careful in terms of ensuring that what it is negotiating is something that is ultimately for the public good.  I will stop here but I am happy to take other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Healy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#F00200"><p>First, to address what happened and why it happened yesterday, my understanding is that the European Parliament has the right to veto TTIP but not to change any parts of it.  In the build-up to yesterday's planned discussion and vote, more than 100 amendments were proposed to a motion which would clarify the desired outcome from the point of view of the European Parliament in order for the European Parliament to endorse TTIP ultimately.  It appears that the situation became far too complex and far too wide-ranging and consensus just was not possible.  At the heart of that, it is certainly the case that ISDS was the major concern.  That alone, perhaps, demonstrates that this is a complex issue.  It is not quite so straightforward that certain things are off the table or certain things are impossible, because it is noticeable that there has been a shift in the debate in the past 12 months, particularly with the arrival of the new Commissioner.  Certainly the emphasis is very much on claiming transparency and that the form of ISDS would be different, more analogous to the comprehensive economic trade agreement, CETA, involving the EU and Canada, and that therefore the concerns that were expressed are without foundation.  The difficulty is that it is impossible to comment with finality or authority on any matter until we see the concrete final agreement and then subject that to various tests.  At this point, it is far from certain that the concerns have been addressed.  With regard to regulation on environmental standards and areas such as genetically modified organisms, for example, the assurances are in place but it is still not entirely clear what the final shape of any agreement will be.  There is obviously trading, negotiating and bargaining to be done in a very complex environment with different laws and regulations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the local authorities and local services.  That is an example of the uncertainty, because education and health are said to be excluded.  That is also a reference to the 1994 GATT exemptions, which already provide for general economic services.  Where a local authority is providing a service for which there is a charge, already there is a certain sense in which the market in a particular service or provision has been opened up in terms of commercial activity.  I am not certain that would not be liable to a contest, using even some sort of arbitration mechanism.  Many of those assurances that have been given in the case of the National Health Service in Britain have failed to convince, rightly or wrongly, many sectors of civil society in Britain.  It is significant that German and British MEPs appear to be among those with some of the biggest concerns about the implications of TTIP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Redmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#F00300"><p>I will respond first to Deputy Keating's question on the pharmaceutical sector.  He asked if there are different standards what will happen if the EU-US trade deal is successfully negotiated.  In my opening comments I referred to one of the remarkable results of Ireland's US trading relationship, which is nearly 250,000 highly skilled jobs.  We have tens of thousands of highly skilled people in the country who are working in pharmaceutical companies, med-tech companies and food and nutritional plants.  In many of those plants what is produced has to be produced to two very high and exacting but separate standards - those of the United States and those of the European Union.  EU-US trade is not saying that if one is higher than the other it will reduce the higher one or converge, because often the differences between the two sets of requirements are infinitesimal.  Because they are not recognising each other, they both want separate sign-off, validation and audit.  What the EU-US trade is seeking is to maintain those high standards but, where appropriate, that each would have recognition or due regard to the other standards.  If we are happy that the US requirements satisfy our requirements, we do not have to separately go in and inspect or audit.  That will mean that those Irish and US companies will have more money to invest elsewhere, rather than on unnecessary duplicate compliance.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked what concerns the American Chamber of Commerce may have about the EU-US trade deal.  In short, its concern is that it does not want a deal for the sake of it, so it should not be rushed, but that it wants a comprehensive deal.  Last week, US research published by Pew Research indicated that the majority of the citizens of the US are in favour of a trade deal.  I doubt that would be the case if European Union citizens were polled.  We would like to see - which is what today is all about - a greater awareness among EU citizens of what, ultimately, this trade deal is meant to be about, which in our opinion is a better answer for consumers and the SME sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Mahoney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#F00400"><p>I will respond to the question on jobs.  We are not saying we should advocate completely free trade for the sake of free trade.  We are adopting this in terms of a strategic trade policy.  It is somewhat trite, but we have to say that Ireland is a small open economy.  We cannot rely on protectionist or isolationist measures.  Our policy has to be to look to new markets and to open new markets.  The reality is that the vast majority of growth will come from outside the EU in the next ten to 15 years.  Therefore, we need to be looking for those markets and opening those markets for our companies.  We cannot stay insular.  There will be vulnerable sectors but it is important to remember that this trade deal will not be an overnight game changer as such.  There will be a period of years in negotiation and a period of years on implementation, which should give the economy time to adjust.</p> <p>  In terms of ISDS, we have a very simple view on it.  We believe that the Commission has been unequivocal in terms of its protection of the right to regulate in the public interest.  Where we see the opportunity and the necessity for ISDS is when a company invests its resources overseas and, either through appropriation or change of policy, or whatever is the case, the contract terms are breached.  It is a method of seeking recourse in the event of a breach of contract.  The point is somewhat lost when talking about two developed economies such as the EU and the US.  If we move to the next phase of investment in Asia or wherever else it might be, an ISDS provision will be needed in that contract to protect intellectual property and trade interests.  This needs to be the standard set now for all future trade agreements.  Similarly, we need to look below the federal level, the level of the State.  Quinn Energy is a terrific opportunity for Irish companies.  If an Irish company invests in any state and if in a couple of years there is a change in policy or there is a local election and suddenly the idea of keeping it local raises it head again, a large company may be able to go through the courts whereas a small company cannot.   We think that an impartial arbitration mechanism has to be contained within the agreement.  This relates to our concerns.  Our concern is that we will get a TTIP-lite, that in another year people will get tired of it, political capital will be expended and it will be the larger companies which will benefit from a halfway-house measure.  There has been so much invested in this that in order for it to benefit SMEs and smaller companies and to open markets, we have to go the whole way.  We would also echo the sentiment that we need to take our time on it.</p><p>We should not rush it through for the sake of passing it because the decision would be regretted for years afterwards.  A monitoring system should be put in place to ensure the provisions benefit SMEs.  Transparency is always good and the transparency register at European level is a positive initiative in this regard.  It suits policy makers, companies and small businesses to know who is lobbying on what issues.</p></speech>

Do ICTU's sister organisations across European share its views on the dispute settlement mechanism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#G00300"><p>I am not reassured at all.  I have heard nothing to indicate that there should be an ISDS mechanism.  In fact, I am even more scared by the response because it appears that somebody in a room somewhere will be deciding what goes into it.  There is no need for it.  Ireland has a perfectly good judicial system and we have the democratic mechanisms through the Oireachtas to make rules and regulations.  If anybody has a problem with the rules, systems are in place to deal with them.  I see no reason why one particular group would need a supra-national mechanism.</p> <p>  In my opinion, yesterday was a good day for democracy because it meant the parliamentarians in Europe had to listen and were not able to make a decision.  Some will argue that they dithered rather than making a decision, because the general view prior to the meeting was that the decision would pass, but I welcome that it did not.</p> <p>  In respect of jobs, ICTU represents hundreds of thousands of workers in this State.  We have every reason to be concerned about protecting jobs.  In many cases we work positively with employers.  Some of the best collective agreements operate in the chemical and pharmaceuticals industry.  It is not a question of broad brush strokes or going into a negative space.  The companies with which we negotiate include some of the best employers in this State.  However, if Europe and the United States agrees this trade agreement it will impact on the food industry and the number of people who are currently involved in preparing meat for exports.  Up to 90% of our beef is exported to Europe in one form or another.  The agreement will open that trade to America, which will be able to flood the European market with beef.  Ireland's exports will no longer be wanted and the jobs in those factories will be endangered.  What will the ISDS do for the workers when they lose their jobs?  I think the answer to that is "nothing".</p> <p>  The Copenhagen document is very sympathetic to TTIP but it does not hide the issue of displacement.  As my colleague from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland noted, foreign direct investment underpins 130,000 jobs in Ireland.  When Bausch + Lomb got into difficulties, we had to take an adult approach to reaching an agreement that would save jobs.  However, if this is opened to the rest of Europe, Ireland will no longer have preferential arrangements for FDI.  These companies will be able to take advantage of the cheap labour options in Eastern European countries, and the result will be displacement.  The Copenhagen response is that if we lose a factory employing 1,000 people in one region, we will make up the job losses somewhere else in the country.  That level of displacement will be damaging to the workers who lose their jobs and to the country's economy.  I would expect the SME sector to be concerned about that, given its linkages with larger companies in Ireland.  We take no comfort from the documentation or the reports that have been prepared thus far.  I remind the committee that the negotiations were conducted in secret until recently.  The negotiators did not like people asking questions about the process.  When we are asked in meetings of workers about whether the agreement will affect them, I cannot tell them there will be no displacement of employment and that an ISDS will look after them when they lose their jobs.  That is the basis for ICTU's concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#G00400"><p>I apologise for being unable to remain to hear all of the presentations fully, due to matters beyond my control.  Ms King neatly leads me to the question I wish to raise.  I do not have to remind her that during the recession, when construction went belly-up, the agricultural sector carried the economy through.  Between those directly employed on farms and those who work in food processing plants and other agri-businesses, the agricultural sector employs a considerable number of people.  Agricultural exports are at an all-time high and have played an important part in our current economic success.  There is tremendous optimism for the future of the sector in terms of its potential for the development of innovative value-added products and opening new markets.  Agriculture is vital for employment in this country and, while we have in many ways evolved from the pastoral society that existed in the 1950s and early 1960s, off-farm and related jobs in agriculture are at the core of our economy.</p> <p>  In what ways do the witnesses think  TTIP will impact on Irish agriculture and how well are we equipped to deal with it?  Will it create the appalling vista of job displacement described by Ms King?  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, 634 people work in Carton's chicken processing plant in Shercock.  Lakelands Dairies, Glanbia, Monaghan Mushrooms and Combilift are also big employers.  With few exceptions, all of these jobs are related to the agricultural sector.  If those jobs are threatened or displaced, how do we attract replacement industries to the region?  That is an appalling vista and I hope the witnesses can give me assurances to the contrary.  How else might matters work out and how can Irish agriculture be protected or, alternatively, how would we cope with non-protection?  Reference was made to the potential for gains in other areas, such as the car industry.</p><p>Would whatever gains accumulated there be greatly offset by the displacement of agri-related jobs?  The witness will know the point I am trying to make and I would be very interested in the response to it.</p></speech>

To what extent has there been an evaluation by each of the organisations present of the benefits or negative aspects possibly accruing to the European Union and to this country in the event of this agreement proceeding?  My other question relates to the extent to which the EU Parliament was influenced.  What were the reasons behind yesterday's decision for deferral, in so far as we know now?  Was it on the basis of information already in the public arena or on the basis of fear of the unknown?  I fully accept, emphasise and support the need to ensure that whatever agreement is entered into, we fully know what it entails and that we do not buy something that will have a backlash.</p> <p>  My final question refers to multilateral investment courts.  Is there any provision for bilateral dispute resolution?  There was a suggestion in some previous trade arrangements between the European Union and the United States that some agencies fared better than others and that bargaining positions were adopted in the course of negotiations which seemed to disadvantage, to some extent, the very sectors referred to by my colleague, such as the agrifood sector.  Given our dependency on that sector, we would have serious concerns.  The reason for our concerns would be that Europe is a big place and a powerful economy in engineering and sciences, in which sectors we are improving, but it is hugely important that we recognise that in the event of there being some unseen or hidden agendas, we would have a serious price to pay because we are still a member of the European Union, bound by European Union laws.  The extent to which that will be observed by negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic is hugely important to each of us.</p></speech>

I refer to Ms King's point about the courts.  Mr. Healy referred to the Copenhagen reports.  They would argue that agrifood benefits would be positive.  Does Mr. Brown accept that they would argue that exports of processed foods, for example, would increase whereas primary agriculture might decrease but that there would be more value added processing for export?  I ask Mr. Brown to comment and others to comment if they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Brown" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#H00400"><p>I thank Deputies for the questions.  I am a legal expert and not an economist so I will do my best to respond to some of the points.  However, I cannot promise to provide complete answers.</p> <p>  First, an important point about the issue of agriculture is that the Commission operates on the basis of negotiating directives given by the member states and which is often referred to as the mandate.  We report every week to a committee of member states at different levels.  The Irish Government is sitting at that committee.  All the negotiating documents we prepare are discussed in advance with the member states in this committee.  The proposals which are transmitted to the United States are then put on our website in order that everyone can see what we are working on and what we are proposing.</p> <p>  In the case of agricultural products, the mandate says that there should not be liberalisation of products which are regarded as sensitive.  When the Commission is negotiating on agricultural tariffs, the negotiating mandate gives us instructions on how we should handle this and how we should pay more attention to and offer less in certain sectors as compared with other sectors.  There is a balance to be struck.  I can try to alleviate some of the concerns by saying it means that in terms of US imports of beef into the EU, they will be whatever is negotiated in the agreement.  The Commission is aware of the sensitivity of this and therefore the actual access will be kept at a specific level.  The scenario referred to of a huge increase of US imports of beef into the EU, is unlikely.  I am not responsible for this sector but these are the issues that are very prominent in the minds of the EU's agricultural negotiators.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the reasons for the deferral of the vote in the European Parliament.  The Parliament was considering the whole range of issues that are subject to these negotiations.  It has access to all the documents that are shared with the member states.  The Commission and the Commissioner go very regularly to Strasbourg and the Commissioner was in Strasbourg this week to brief Members of the European Parliament.  They are fully aware of all the issues which are well-known and are public.  As another speaker touched upon, the reason for the deferral was largely that they were unable to reach a compromise which they thought they were in a position to put to the plenary session.  They decided that rather than vote in the plenary session without having reached that compromise, they would rather have further discussions.  The matter has been sent back to the relevant committee for further discussions.  When that committee will decide to move forward is a matter of speculation and I cannot answer exactly when that will happen.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman asked the reason for the need for an investor disputes resolution element.  This is a very important question and it was also touched upon by Ms King.  We need to be very clear that in the US legal system, international agreements like TTIP are not enforceable before the domestic courts.  If a European investor or an Irish investor has a problem in the US, it cannot turn to the local court or to the US Federal Courts and ask for the application of the TTIP agreement.  That is important because there are certain rules of non-discrimination which would be included in the TTIP agreement for the investment protection part that will not necessarily be found in US domestic law.  Therefore, the investor will be left with no defence and no means to enforce the agreement because it is not enforceable in US domestic law.</p> <p>  The fact that the US has a highly developed legal system, just as is the case with the EU, is frankly not a guarantee that either country respects international law.  For example, with regard to the World Trade Organization, there have been more complaints against the United States than against any other WTO member.  There have been almost 130 complaints over the past 20 years against the United States.  These complaints relate to allegations that the US has not respected its international obligations.  To be honest, the EU and the member states have had approximately 110 to 115 complaints so it is not the case that the US is particularly worse than the EU as that the simple fact of international economic life is that problems of compliance arise with these agreements.  This means that from our perspective if one wants to have these rules enforceable, if one wants to protect investment because of the sunk cost involved in investment which is different from trading goods, then one needs to have some form of international dispute settlement.  There is a traditional form of dispute settlement that is used for ISDS cases.</p><p>However, the Commission does not believe that is the way forward.  We must work much more on transparency in its work so that it can be more like a court, but we fundamentally believe that the international dispute settlement system is required.  Otherwise the rules we are negotiating will not be enforceable and they will not bring the benefits that colleagues representing the SMEs are hoping for from this agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Healy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061100002#J00200"><p>With regard to the Copenhagen Economics study, at a sectoral level, it is interesting that in assessing the impact of any trade agreement there will be winners and losers.  The expectation is that the gains will somehow outweigh the losses.  This has been generally true with the huge expansion in world trade over recent decades and our experience with the European Union, originally the European Economic Community.  Indeed, there were sectors and areas of the country that initially lost - fisheries would be an example - but somehow the aggregate gains were positive.  In some cases, people moved job and in other cases they were retrained or activities were reorientated.</p> <p>  In this case, the Copenhagen study clearly identifies the Irish beef industry as the potential weak link.  Notwithstanding the opening up of the US market in recent months, there are huge risks in terms of the imports Ms Patricia King mentioned coming from the US into the EU.  It is quite likely that the beef industry would take a hit.  On the other hand, dairy, and particularly products such as yogurt and cheese, could very well find an opening of new markets in the US.  There are already opportunities in the Asiatic markets and further afield.  More generally, Irish agrifood business is well positioned to compete on global markets.</p> <p>  It is important to drill down into these sectoral elements.  The solutions are not clear because in the estimations done by Copenhagen Economics it adopted a very unrealistic equilibrium assumption that a job lost in one place is replaced somehow by a job created somewhere else.  In that way, the model allowed for labour markets to clear, so that any excess in supply of labour would eventually even out through job creation elsewhere.  However, as I said at the outset, there are other ways of measuring this.  It is interesting that after all of the analysis and debate, the conclusions of Copenhagen are very modest.  They point to a likely or possible net job increase of approximately 10,000.  Every job created is welcome, of course, but if it is a case that 10,000 net new jobs are created once-off, that compares with an annual job creation figure at present of approximately 30,000.  It is a very good figure and hopefully employment will continue to grow at an annual rate of 2%, but the specific additional impact of TTIP is quite modest.</p> <p>  Also, when one looks at the calculated impacts on investment and real wages, we are looking at increases of between possibly 1% and 2%.  Again, it is strongly conditional on the assumptions behind the model.  When one looks at the direction in which the European Union is going one must ask: what are the key objectives, what is the vision for Europe economically and socially and how important and useful is something such as TTIP to realising these goals?  It appears that areas such as sustainability, economic and social inequality, social cohesion and raising European productivity levels, especially in the weaker economies, are the crucial goals from a policy point of view.  The actual impact of TTIP is quite unclear and it raises many questions, collateral issues and possible damage in other areas.  There are grounds for proceeding with caution and with sufficient time.</p> <p>  Frankly, we are probably facing a delay of a number of years.  I cannot see how this can be wrapped up, and there is no way it can be wrapped up, at the end of this year.  All of this must be carefully put together.  The challenge is to engage civil society far more in the debate and in looking at all the pluses and minuses.  It may be that, ultimately, critical evidence-based analysis must triumph over zeal, be it on the "Yes" side or "No" side of TTIP.  We must look at this much more critically.</p></speech>

First, it is important to state that Ireland does not have a preferential right to US foreign direct investment.  In fact, while the two way relationship is as strong as ever, the competition is as intense as ever.  The extent to which Ireland continues to be successful in attracting new projects here and in expanding existing ones is a testimony to the success of the workforce and the talent in the US companies here and the leaders of those companies in Ireland who compete extremely strongly with other territories around the world to bring that investment.  We have no preferential advantage in doing that.</p> <p>  I fully concur with Deputy O'Reilly's point about the critical role played by the agri sector during the five tough years of 2008 to 2012.  He will forgive me for also stating that US foreign direct investment in those five difficult years for our country exceeded that of the previous 60.  The US kept faith with Ireland through our tough times, because our fundamentals were sound and because of the longevity of the trading relationship.</p> <p>  Finally, there are differing studies about the benefits to Ireland and the European Union from negotiating a successful EU-US trade deal.  While mindful of the clich&eacute; that past performance is no indicator of future performance, Ireland is a great test case.  We can see how opening up to trade with our greatest trading partner, the United States of America, has transformed the lives and opportunities of our people.  I will conclude with that.</p></speech>

We are intimately acquainted with the companies mentioned such as Lakeland Dairies through our chambers in Cootehill and Cavan.  We have seen them grow over the years.  We are very much involved in supporting their growth particularly with regard to trade documentation and trying to overcome some of the barriers to accessing new markets.</p> <p>  We are looking at where our economy is and where it must be in the next five to ten years.  As we move up the value chain in agrifood, we are finding new markets, higher value added, greater benefit to the economy and more jobs.  That is essentially what informed our view that we must look at this in a positive light.  If one looks at entities such as Lakeland Dairies, the Kerry Group and the Irish Dairy Board, their product is viewed as being of the highest quality in the world.  Standards must be maintained.  We believe a strong, robust TTIP will ensure those standards are maintained and will keep the standards at a level that will keep the Irish value added product high in consumer demand.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  Informing our view as to why we support TTIP and on the research we have done, we looked at the effects in our European chambers.  Each country did an assessment of the structure of where the economy is and where it must go.  We are moving towards a high value added, service providing economy and the US public procurement market, in particular, lends itself to terrific opportunities for Irish SMEs in that sense.  We spoke with Irish SMEs in software service technology and pharmaceutical companies that provide ingredients into the bigger pharmaceutical companies.  Entering the value chain as well as the direct market is where we see the real benefit.</p></speech>

People do not work up these fears for nothing.  They are very real.  That message was sent loudly and clearly in the European Parliament yesterday.  Apart from the ISDS, to which we are implacably opposed, the impacts on the Irish economy and on jobs require far more in-depth examination.  The Copenhagen report did not do that job and therefore it must be expanded.  The time should be used.</p> <p>  In addition, the discussions and negotiations on this trade agreement have been marked by secrecy.  There must be a great deal more transparency so all the facts can come to the fore and people's fears can be allayed by virtue of what they hear, rather than being worked up based on what they are not hearing.</p><p>As such, there is a job of work to be done to get to that place.</p></speech>

As a matter of fact, if one looks at the discussions and discourse in the UK, one sees that many of the proponents of the UK remaining in the EU point to the EU's successful trade policy as one of the reasons the UK should stay in the Union.  Clearly, TTIP as one of the most prominent parts of the EU's trade policy at this moment in time will play out importantly in that debate.</p></speech>

Depending on the final outcome of the discussion on Brexit, the location of financial services but more generally pharma and IT services which underpin such a huge number of jobs in Ireland could be impacted profoundly by all of these factors.  Less important, perhaps, is the detail of how companies here trade with other jurisdictions than the overall level of political and economic stability in Europe.  It strikes me that the important emphasis needs to be put on a vision for Europe and understanding how a game changer can transform the European economy and society.  I fear somehow that in the absence of a coherent vision and strategy reminiscent of what underlay the European vision in the 1950s and 1960s, the emphasis has been put unduly on a narrow programme of structural reform aided by an opening up to trade and investment, as in the case of TTIP, without a sufficient emphasis on the social dimension.  This is having a profound effect on European debate.  Brexit is in some ways symptomatic of the lack of cohesion which needs to be addressed.  That is a wider problem perhaps to come back to at another date.</p></speech>

Our engagements with the committee have been valuable in the development of our work and we welcome further feedback from members today.  We view the opportunity to explain our assessments publicly as integral to the fulfilment of our mandate and important in fostering greater public awareness of the issues raised in our reports.</p> <p>  With me today are council members Dr. O'Sullivan and Dr. Kearney.  This is Dr. Kearney's first appearance before the committee following her appointment to the council in March 2015.  Mr. Sebastian Barnes, who is based in Paris, unfortunately cannot attend today.  The council secretariat is also present: Ms Doyle, Mr. Casey, Mr. Hannon, Mr. Howlin and Dr. Conefrey, head of the secretariat and chief economist.  The secretariat would like to thank the staff of the Oireachtas for their ongoing and useful co-operation.</p> <p>  I will cover our eighth assessment first.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  To begin with some good news, data over recent months have provided further evidence that the recovery in the economy has gathered momentum.  A notable aspect of the performance of the economy in 2014 was the expansion in domestic demand, the first such increase since 2007.  Crucially, the fruits of the economic recovery are gradually becoming evident in other areas.  Unemployment has dipped below 10% for the first time in seven years and Exchequer tax data for the early months of 2015 have been positive.</p> <p>  Assisted by the resumption of strong growth and the impact of the consolidation measures implemented since 2008, the general government deficit, excluding the impact of banking measures, has fallen from a peak of 11.7% in 2009 to 4.1% in 2014.  The deficit is expected to fall to well below the 3% excessive deficit procedure, EDP, ceiling in 2015.  The main objective of fiscal policy since 2008 has been to reduce the deficit and restore the State's creditworthiness in order to create the conditions for a return to growth in employment, income and living standards.  With economic recovery under way, we are entering an important phase in which fiscal policy must be used to ensure that a sustainable pattern of growth is established for the medium term.  Ireland's legacy of high debt levels following the crisis calls for continued vigilance to ensure that the debt-to-GDP ratio remains firmly on a downward path in the coming years.</p> <p>  An important accomplishment of recent years has been the institutionalisation of a new budgetary framework comprising EU and domestic components.  Consistency between the national and EU frameworks allows the two sets of formal rules and enforcement procedures to reinforce each other.  The monitoring, peer pressure and financial sanction procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact helps give credibility to the national rules while the monitoring and enforcement procedures of the national rules, including roles for the Oireachtas and the fiscal council, provide a degree of domestic oversight and ownership of the overall rules framework.  If respected, this framework provides an important safeguard against a return to the boom-bust cycle.</p> <p>  In the context of Ireland's new medium-term budgetary framework, MTBF, the spring economic statement, SES, provides a useful innovation in Ireland's medium-term planning by setting out the broad policy stance for 2016 in advance of the budget in October.  However, the implementation of the new budgetary framework shows weaknesses that could undermine its effectiveness.  As set out in our recent report, the weaknesses are evident in the budgetary plan for 2016 and in the medium-term projections for the public finances, which fall short of meeting what is required under the new budgetary framework in some key respects.</p> <p>  I will discuss the council's assessment of the outlook for 2016 as set out in the stability programme update, SPU.  Until Ireland reaches its medium-term objective, MTO, of a balanced budget in structural terms, the Government is required to lower the structural deficit by 0.6% of GDP each year.  SPU 2015 sets out a plan that lowers this deficit by just 0.3% of GDP in 2016, thus falling short of the requirement on a forward-looking basis.  The rule to lower the structural deficit is supported by the expenditure benchmark, EB, which sets a limit on allowable expenditure growth.  As described by the council in April, the original method for calculating the EB contained an anomaly.  This has now been corrected.  However, the Government has introduced a further adjustment for "tax buoyancy" that goes against the letter and spirit of the EB rule.  The council does not include this tax buoyancy effect in its calculation of the EB and, on this basis, there is a considerable risk of non-compliance with the rule in 2016.</p> <p>  The council is strongly of the view that Government plans should be based on expected compliance with the fiscal rules and that the reasons for any deviation should be clearly explained.  Rather than a plan that falls short of the requirements, an adjustment in line with the minimum improvement required under the rules would be appropriate in 2016 in light of Ireland's high debt levels and improved cyclical conditions.  Full compliance in 2016 would also signal the Government's commitment to the new budgetary framework now that the degree of external surveillance has eased with the ending of the troika programme.</p> <p>  A major theme of last week's report and the council's November 2014 assessment concerned the forecasts for the public finances in the medium term.  Proper medium-term fiscal plans are vital for a number of reasons.  They provide a comprehensive and realistic framework for the planning and management of public expenditure in the medium term by linking annual budgets to longer term fiscal targets.  Well-specified medium-term plans increase the predictability of the budgetary planning process by providing realistic estimates of revenue, expenditure, deficit and debt over a three-year period.  Medium-term planning is also important in providing a link between resource allocation and Government policy and priorities and can guard against a return to short-term incremental budgeting.</p> <p>  The budgetary frameworks directive requires the Government to provide medium-term projections of each major expenditure and revenue item based on unchanged policies as well as on the basis of envisaged policies.  SPU 2015 falls short of these requirements.  The post-2016 budgetary projections in the SPU are based on mainly technical assumptions for Government revenue and expenditure.  As a result, the forecasts show overcompliance with the fiscal rules even though stated policy in the spring economic statement is to target minimum rule compliance.  Tax forecasts assume no change in policy after 2016 while spending profiles do not adequately take account of underlying expenditure pressures.  The ratio of non-interest Government spending-to-GDP is projected to fall by more than 5% between 2015 and 2020.</p> <p>  Analysis presented in our recent assessment report demonstrates how such a sustained fall in Government spending would be challenging to achieve while maintaining current services and meeting demands for increases in public services due to demographic and other pressures.  A conservative illustrative scenario for Government expenditure that takes account of likely expenditure pressures is set out in the report.  The exercise indicates that Government primary expenditure as a ratio of GDP would fall by approximately 2% between 2015 and 2020.  As already noted, SPU 2015 in contrast envisages a much steeper 5% fall in expenditure over the same period.</p> <p>  Given these shortcomings, the deficit projections in SPU 2015 do not provide a useful picture of the fiscal position after 2016 and fall short of the requirements envisaged in the budgetary frameworks directive.  While it is not expected that specific revenue and expenditure measures would be detailed over the medium term, full acknowledgement of spending pressures, the overall value of intended revenue measures and, consequently, a deficit path should play a central role in medium-term projections.</p><p>A major weakness of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to fiscal policy prior to the crisis was that expenditure plans focused almost exclusively on the following year, with medium-term expenditure profiles seen as indicative and subject to change in later years.  With spending determined on an <i>ad hoc </i>year-to-year basis, this inevitably contributed to pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy.  Multi-annual ceilings were introduced to address serious expenditure management problems and represent a core component of the new domestic budgetary architecture.  This system is not working effectively because the Government has consistently made adjustments to the ceilings.  This undermines its value as an expenditure planning and control tool.  Moreover, the move to annual revisions to the allowable expenditure growth under the expenditure benchmark has removed the multi-year anchor from the domestic medium-term expenditure ceilings.  The Government needs to clarify how the system of multi-year ceilings will operate under the revised expenditure benchmark framework.  The domestic medium-term expenditure framework should be strengthened to ensure that multi-annual planning is a central element in the budget process.<br/><br/>To conclude, Ireland&rsquo;s post-crisis budget framework should help avoid boom-bust cycles and guide Government debt to safer levels.  It is therefore important that the framework is respected in fiscal plans.  Rather than being viewed as something externally imposed on Ireland, the new budgetary framework should be seen as something in the national interest to the extent it underpins sound budgetary policy.  Adherence to the budgetary framework during good times can help avoid the necessity for the type of painful budgetary adjustments implemented during the recent crisis.  In an uncertain growth environment, respect for the framework can improve the resilience of the public finances. <br/><br/>I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend today and we look forward to taking its questions and hearing the views of members.</p></speech>

There is a graduated set of sanctions that begin with a remunerated deposit.  It then becomes a deposit that does not bear any interest.  Finally, if there is continual non-compliance with the rules, there is the possibility of a fine of up to 0.2% of GDP.</p></speech>

The State still has major infrastructural gaps within housing, broadband and a lot of the infrastructure a competitive economy needs.

In other words, there was capacity within the economy.  Is that still the case?</p></speech>

As we note in the report, this framework should provide important protections so that we do not repeat the kind of mistakes that have been made before, in particular, mistakes that tended to get made in good times.  The budgetary framework is a combination of the European rules, mainly the Stability and Growth Pact.  There is also a domestic component to that framework.  We have our own Fiscal Responsibility Act.  In addition to that, we have a system of medium-term expenditure ceilings, more broadly, the medium-term expenditure framework.  The budgetary framework that I am referring to is a combination of European and domestic elements.  It has been very nicely brought together in a document called the Medium Term Budgetary Framework, which lays out all the different elements and how they interact.  We would like to see the basic framework being respected and the plans that the Government lays out being consistent with the requirements of that framework.  The plans that were laid out in the stability programme and Spring Economic Statement were not consistent with the requirements of the framework for 2016 and, even more seriously, a full and proper plan that was consistent with the requirements of the framework was not laid out for the period post-2016 .</p></speech>

The plans laid out in the spring economic statement involved an expansionary package of &euro;1.2 billion.  It said that the package could be between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.5 billion, but the plans themselves were based on a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion.  Our calculations suggest that to be fully in compliance with the various rules, the package would be somewhere in the region of &euro;700 million.  The precise figure may well change by budget time.  There are many moving parts to this.  Our concern is that, based on the Government's own best projections, it set out a plan that was not fully consistent with the requirements of the framework.</p></speech>

At the moment, as I said earlier on, we think there is a probably relatively small but shrinking shortfall relative to the potential of the economy.  If we did not have any other constraints, it would be appropriate to have a more expansionary policy.  Unfortunately, we do have additional constraints, including the very high debt level and the fact that we still have a deficit and are continuing to borrow.  We need to get that debt onto a downward path.  Balancing the different factors together - the need for cyclical stimulus is now reducing but we still have these issues with the high debt level - we think that a policy that is broadly in compliance with the fiscal framework would be appropriate.  I would not exaggerate the effect of the somewhat larger expansionary package the Government is planning from a purely substantive economics point of view.  However, one concern is that if one begins to disregard the framework at this very early stage, and we are not that long out of the crisis, there is a question of whether the institutional framework really will be strong enough to prevent us from making the kind of mistakes we have seen before.  We would, therefore, like to see the framework being respected.</p></speech>

The <i>per capita</i>spend on that side would actually be static or slightly falling.  Is that Professor McHale's assessment?</p></speech>

The Government projects that demographic pressures will add approximately &euro;300 million per year, which suggests that approximately half the expenditure increase would meet those demographic pressures.  In the report, we ran our own scenario which would suggest that the demographic pressures are somewhat higher than that, potentially close to &euro;500 million rather than &euro;300 million.  To this extent, the demographic pressures would come reasonably close to using up the &euro;600 million the Government has identified.</p></speech>

Is it the stability programme update, SPU, plan that we will have this continuing downward pressure on Government consumption?</p></speech>

There is a graph in the report that shows it has fallen to levels that have not been seen in the decades for which we have data.  This is not credible, given that it does not adequately take into account demographic pressures, nor does it take account of the underlying pressures in terms of the cost of providing Government services.  It is unlikely to happen.</p></speech>

That is perhaps not an issue on which Professor McHale might touch.  Deputies Pearse Doherty and Michael McGrath have previously mentioned the issue that Opposition parties would have an opportunity to put their budget proposals to some kind of unit to have them costed in advance of an election, or even annually, in order that we can have proper discourse rather than accusations that our proposals have been less thoroughly costed than others.  Debate could be on the policy rather than on the costing element.</p></speech>

Such a costing arrangement is a very good idea and would strengthen the overall budgetary architecture.  However, it would be a very resource-intensive activity and if it were done, it would be very important that it would be done well with much credibility for everyone involved in the process.  We would not have the resources to do something like it now and it would take a reasonable lead time to ensure the capacity was in place.  Potentially, given adequate resources, we could examine doing it in the future.  However, it would not need to be us.  An Oireachtas budget office would be an alternative.  It is a good idea, but it must be done right and adequately resourced.</p></speech>

These exchanges have proven to be very worthwhile, and IFAC has done the State some service since it was established, for which I am thankful.  It takes a certain amount of character and conviction to come here consistently and throw cold water on us all the time.  This is what Professor McHale needs to do.  It is important we continue to meet the financial architecture deficit reduction targets.  In terms of the overall framework within which we operate, the rules are very good for an economy that moves along seamlessly year after year.  However, for an economy such as ours, which has been through a very substantial economic shock and in which capital investment was paused very substantially for several years, has Professor McHale any sympathy with the view that economies need to catch up in terms of the infrastructure deficits that were not attended to during those years, particularly in the area of public expenditure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015061100002#F00900"><p>I agree that capital investment suffered very significantly during the crisis and took a disproportionate share of the hits to expenditure.  In terms of the long-term growth potential of the economy and providing key social services, there are disadvantages and deficits that have resulted from the reduced investment.  On the other hand, the overall framework is broadly suitable for Ireland as much as it is for other countries.  The framework has different elements to it.  Until now, we have been in the so-called corrective arm, which, as I noted in my statement, allowed the deficit to rise, not including the cost of bailing out the banking system, to 11.7% of GDP.  It is not totally rigid, but it allows countries' deficits to increase substantially when they go into recessions.  This helps protect expenditure, including capital expenditure, to a certain degree.  However, once the deficit goes above 3% of GDP, one has to start taking actions to ensure it does not completely spin out of control.  We did this, and it looks like we will get the deficit below 3% of GDP this year, which is an impressive achievement given that in 2009 we had a deficit approaching 12% of GDP.</p> <p>  Next year, all going to plan, we will move to the next phase, which is the so-called preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Then, we must slowly move towards a balanced budget adjusted for cyclical factors.  Certain adjustments will still be taking place, and expenditure will have to be kept below the underlying growth of the economy.  This should allow more room for expenditure increases, although I would not exaggerate the size of them, and it is to be hoped the kind of squeeze that has been taking place in capital spending will be lessened in the years ahead.</p></speech>

There is something highly ironic about the situation whereby I go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to discuss key infrastructural issues in my constituency that impact on the national and regional picture.  Professor McHale talks in abstract terms whereas we, as politicians at the coalface, deal with practical issues.  I live in Macroom which is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the Cork-Kerry road link.  The project to build a new bypass is ready to go, yet the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has told me that while he has the money to spend and there was never a better time, he does not know whether he can do it because we have all these rules that say "no".  The project has the most favourable cost-benefit analysis of any project on the NRA's books.  This is because of seven years of paused investment.  Regarding the N28, the relocation of the Port of Cork, the Jack Lynch tunnel, the Dunkettle interchange or any other project people around the country could list, Professor McHale's analysis is that we will never catch up, that while we have a level of capital investment now, we will never be allowed to make up for the seven years' lost time.  Bearing in mind this and the requirement to maintain some degree of social cohesion, it has been an admirable characteristic of the endeavour, although some might disagree, that we have tried to bring as many people as possible with us in the economic recovery and have a degree of fairness.</p><p>I come from the view that we run our household pretty tightly,  that we do not go mad.  I acknowledge the sins of the past, but there is a degree to which one must provide for repairs to  the leaking roof.  However, Professor McHale is saying that one must live with the continuous drip from the ceiling because one will never get around to repairing the household properly.  I think this analysis is consigning people to never making up for the lost years in meeting the requirement of a modern economy for broadband, proper infrastructure, health services, hospitals and schools.  At a political level I do not thing one can sell that message.  I think we have to sell hope as well as fiscal responsibility.</p></speech>

The creditworthiness of the State was one of the things we were concerned about most at our earliest meetings.  When we came into existence in the middle of 2011, Irish bond yields were 14%.  There was an implied probability that the Irish State was going to default of between 85% and 90% at the time.  It was in that context that we felt the adjustment may need to be reinforced to make sure that we did get through it.  Ultimately the adjustment has been successful.  It is important to remember that the mistakes that really led to the disaster that we went through were made in good times.  What we want to ensure is that we put an institutional framework in place that prevents us from ever doing that again.  It is hardest politically, and I understand that the demands on members will be greatest, when it seems that times are improving and people want to see investments that may have been postponed in the past, to take place.</p></speech>

If one looks at the stability programme update post-2016, there is no allowance for an increase in capital expenditure.  It is done on a technical basis pending the capital review, but nonetheless it is not in there.  If one thinks about the needs of those kinds of projects, the bypasses, bridges and so on and one looks at that in the medium term perspective, it should then inform one's decision about one's ability to cut the sustainable revenue streams to finance that investment.  It is important to distinguish between the deficit, the difference between the revenue flows and expenditure and the size of the gross flows.  To have a responsible fiscal policy and to have a manageable deficit does not mean that one cannot have government expenditure if that government expenditure is financed by sustainable revenue flows.</p></speech>

To cut a long story short, my interpretation of what the IFAC is saying is that the Government has been playing by the rules to date but all of a sudden it has stopped playing by the rules and the figures for its projections beyond 2015 do not add up.  Is that what the IFAC is saying?  The Government is now including projections for tax buoyancy and growth, which it cannot reasonably deduce from the figures?  Is IFAC saying that it is a pre-election stunt by the Government?</p></speech>

The Commission as well as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council look at the plans.  There is no sanction for setting out plans that are not in compliance with the rules.  The sanctions come in after the fact and so if we are talking about 2016, if the Government misses key targets by a significant margin in 2016, a judgment will actually be made about that in 2017, once the outturns for 2016 are in.  On that basis sanctions might be applied.  As we discussed earlier, there is a process before sanctions get applied.  In this report we are talking about the plans and the sanctions do not come into the discussions at this stage.</p></speech>

Even by budget time, these projections change, so for example, there is a projection for the size of the output gap as part of the projection for the structural balance that I spoke about in my opening statement and that could change.  The concern of the IFAC is that we need this framework to protect us from making the kinds of mistakes that were made before, particularly in good times and to set out a plan based on the Government's best projections both on the macro side and the fiscal side is not consistent with that framework.  We can set a framework that will make sure we do follow sustainable policies that do not create the kind of vulnerabilities that caused such problems before.  It is not a strong prediction that once all the figures are in that the Government will have missed these targets and will be sanctioned.  It really is whether we are going to take seriously the new budgetary framework as a means to ensure that we really pursue sustainable growth.   I know the Deputy in previous times when IFAC came before the committee has emphasised the importance of sustainable growth.  We really see this framework as a key contributor to making sure that we keep the Irish economy of an even keel and do not have a boom-bust cycle that caused such harm before.</p></speech>

I strongly fear that what we are looking at is a pre-election giveaway without much concern for the rules that previously were apparently sacrosanct for this Government and were the justification for just about every nastiness they inflicted on us.</p> <p>  Having said that I want to ask questions about the metrics and measures that the IFAC is using.  Are we constrained by what is actually a useful measure?  That is a slightly separate point that I will deal with later.  I want to be clear about what IFAC is saying about how the Government is diverging from rules that it previously adhered to and told us we had to adhere to and which puts us in danger of going outside the fiscal targets.  Am I correct that the three areas the Government is not taking into account in its projections are demographic pressures, that its growth projections are tenuous and will somebody remind me of the third area?</p><p>The third one is tax buoyancy.  Are those the three areas?</p></speech>

To take the middle one on growth first, we have endorsed the growth projections underlying the stability programme and, as such, we do not have a significant issue with those.  We produce our own benchmark forecasts which are a bit different, but certainly the Government's projections are within what we consider to be an endorsable range.  Once we look beyond 2016, the Government is over-complying with the fiscal rules.  The problem is not that it is not complying; it is actually bringing down the structural deficit by more than 1% of GDP per year and is well above the required level of 0.6%.  Our problem after 2016 is that the projections are not based on a plan.  For instance, we know the Government has a stated intention to have tax cuts post-2016, but those tax cuts are not built into the projections at all.  A matter that came up before and which Deputy Boyd Barrett raised again is that on the expenditure side we know there are underlying demographic pressures and other pressures on Government spending which are not built into the projections post-2016 or certainly they are not adequately built in.  It leads to the projection that non-interest spending as a share of GDP will fall by 5% of GDP over that period, which is not credible.  That is really what our problem is post-2016.  It is not non-compliance with the rules, but there is no proper plan based on proper projections, particularly on the expenditure side.</p></speech>

There is a more serious argument for saying that we do not have to overshoot the targets.  In fact, I was at a presentation given by Michael Taft earlier on an alternative fiscal framework for a progressive alternative economic policy.  He said there is absolutely no reason we should try to get to a surplus by 2018, as the Government plans, and that we could do it by 2020 with lesser adjustments.  That would give us considerably more space to spend and invest.  What does the council say to that?</p> <p>  The other interesting point Mr. Taft made was on the structural deficit as a useful metric and early warning system against possible return to boom and bust.  If one looks at the structural deficit for Ireland before the crash, it did not tell one anything about the possibility that a crash was coming.  In fact, one would think that everything was rosy in the garden.  He says it is a useless measure of whether something bad is about to happen.  One thing I have signalled to the witnesses that I therefore consider very worrying and which none of the metrics have picked up was at the centre of the last crash.  I refer to property and what is happening there.  Housing is a disaster that is going to get worse very quickly, not just from the point of view of those who need it but from the macro point of view.  The cost of accommodation is going through the roof, which has all sorts of knock-on effects.  Should we not be jumping up and down and screaming alarms, so to speak, over that fact?</p> <p>  Lastly, the council has a section on the statistical treatment of Irish Water in its report.  Can the witnesses summarise it briefly?  As I understand it, the council is saying that because of the huge subsidy that has been given to Irish Water and because the charges have been set so low, it cannot possibly cover its costs.  It will have to subsidise it with the &euro;100 and all this kind of stuff.  One effect is that the capital investment programme is not much.  It also affects our deficit.  Those subsidies increase our deficit.  Is it fair to say, judging from this, that for Irish Water to stop having an impact on our deficit and to cover its own costs, domestic charges would have to increase dramatically?</p></speech>

In terms of his first question, the Government projects currently that we will be back to structural and actual budget balance between 2018 and 2019.  As I have said, that is post-2016 and not based on a fully specified plan.  If there was minimum compliance with the fiscal rules, we estimate that one would reach structural balance by 2020.  As of now and certainly for 2016, we consider that minimal compliance would be an appropriate policy.  We do not advocate going beyond that and reserve judgment about whether it would be an adequate policy for the later years.  To the extent that it is an adequate policy, following the rules to do minimum compliance with them and getting to structural balance by 2020 would be an appropriate policy.  In that sense, there is no gap between what Deputy Boyd Barrett said Michael Taft was advocating.  Certainly, compared with the plans the Government has laid out, which involve very large reductions in the structural deficit post-2016, that would create more space.  However, we do not feel they are real plans in the sense that they do not take into account the planned tax reductions.  Assuming minimum compliance remains an appropriate policy, reaching structural deficit by 2020 looks appropriate at this stage.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right about the measurement of the structural deficit.  In the run-up to the crisis, the measures of the structural deficit and associated measures of the output gap were extremely poor.  In retrospect, we know that we were in an unsustainable situation with the economy operating well above its sustainable projection and the measures of the output gap did not pick that up at the time.  As the Deputy said, they essentially gave us nonsense measures of the structural deficit.  As such, one of the things we have been working very hard on at the council is to come up with better measures of potential output and, therefore, the output gap and, therefore, the structural deficit.  We are working on measures that take into account broader sets of imbalances in the economy, including imbalances in the housing market, imbalances potentially in credit markets, and factors relating to the size of the current account imbalance.  We had a very large current account deficit prior to the crisis, a sign of imbalance that was not taken into account at the time.  The Deputy's criticism about measurements of the structural deficit and other key aggregates is bang on.  To ensure we do not make those kinds of mistakes again, we must improve our ability to measure these things.  We and others are working very hard on that.</p></speech>

We are now starting to see that broaden out to the domestic sector.  It will take a number of years of strong domestic demand growth before people really begin to feel it.  Even though we are only at the early stages, having that turnaround from a contracting domestic economy to a growing one is very welcome.  We are also starting to see it show up in the labour market.</p><p>The Deputy will recall that the unemployment rate was over 15%.

That shows a certain lack of respect for the framework.  We should never do this to ourselves again.  There have been important institutional innovations, including the budgetary framework which we must now respect.

That is allowed for in the framework.</p></speech>

As she said, if one has a higher growth rate, one can have higher expenditure figure.  The advantages of the framework in making sure we pursue a sustainable policy are just as great for Ireland as they are for other countries.  In newer forms of the framework new flexibilities are being built in.  That means that if one's growth rate is lower or one operates well below one's potential, the adjustment one must make is reduced.  There are new allowances made for countries which are undergoing certain structural reforms that will have a positive long-term impact on their public finances which can be taken into account.  The framework is moving towards being more flexible.</p></speech>

We also all want the economy to grow, services to expand and people to have more disposable income.  The country can borrow money cheaply at a rate which is a long way from the figure of 14.5% in 2011 when we were headed towards default and we can achieve growth rates of over 4.5%.  In that instance, would it make economic sense to borrow money cheaply which we could use to grow the economy?  Obviously, a return on that investment would help to grow the economy further with the debt staying constant.  Does this scenario blend into the thought processes of the council?</p></speech>

If my colleagues and I had complete control over the design of fiscal rules, we would keep current and capital spending separate.  We would also apply the rules to current spending rather than capital spending.  In terms of capital spending, where one has opportunities to invest and where the cost of capital is well below the rate of return on a project, from an economic perspective, one should undertake these investments.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Creed mentioned the following but perhaps I did not realise it fully.</p><p>The concern is that when it is all lumped in together, one will be forced to cut capital spending when the actual projects themselves make sense on an economic basis.  I am sure my colleagues agree with me on this, but I think the ideal set of rules would make that distinction between current and capital.  Unfortunately, however, they are not the rules we have.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is obviously extremely important how that is calculated.</p> <p>  Another issue in Professor McHale's assessment involves contract manufacturing.

According to the external trade statistics, however, they had increased by 1%, the difference being contract manufacturing.  It is not the only difference, but it was overwhelmingly contract manufacturing.  Is it fair to say that the export figures, and therefore GDP, were massively bloated by the existence of contract manufacturing?</p></speech>

Certainly in the first half of last year contract manufacturing had a huge, positive impact on growth.  In the middle of last year we began noting that this was unlikely to continue and was likely to unwind.  We outlined in this part of the report the reasons it was likely to unwind.  It is really a timing issue.  Some of the offsetting import measures only came into play in the second half of the year.  Taking the year as a whole, contract manufacturing had no effect on overall growth.  It really affected the timing of growth.  Looking forward, we would expect the export and import signs to balance out.  There could be timing issues which could lead to some volatility in the numbers.  Overall, however, while it had a huge impact, it was very likely to unwind.  It was the point we were making last year and it did happen as we envisioned.  Contracting manufacturing, overall, should not be having a substantive impact on growth.</p></speech>

One could have multinational or Irish corporations here that are contracting the production of whatever products in China or elsewhere, which are exported elsewhere and have nothing to do with the Irish economy in reality.  If that contract manufacturing was stripped out and not counted, it would not make any difference in GDP figures.</p></speech>

The divergence between the export figure in the national accounts that the Deputy quoted, 18% versus what is in the trade statistics, will continue to be there.  It will call for a lot of care in interpreting growth figures in the national accounts.  The CSO has demonstrated for 2014 that eventually, within the national accounting treatment of this, offsetting royalty imports will occur and the net effect on actual measured growth will wash out over a period.  One will continue to need to exercise a lot of caution in interpreting growth export figures for Ireland.  They will be impacted by this activity, but the underlying growth numbers that the CSO produces should not give a misleading picture when they eventually settle down.</p></speech>

I have a real problem with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, or IFAC, in the sense that its role and the way in which it has been set up is part of the deliberate technocratisation of decision-making.  It is making economics not something that is political, but the idea that there is a right and wrong to it, whereas I think it is a matter for political debate.  Different economists have different views.</p> <p>  IFAC's pre-budget submission was honest and brutal in its assessment of the strategy of the establishment, the capitalist class in this country, and others.  It said that maintaining the fiscal discipline required to achieve large primary budget surpluses will become politically harder following a long period of fiscal consolidation and as crisis memories fade.  In particular, IFAC mentioned that those groups affected by austerity are against it.  Is that not an example of what Naomi Klein calls the shock doctrine, using the shock of a crisis to try to enforce pre-existing neoliberal, ideological and actual economic and structural change to economies?  Are the witnesses explicitly saying that memories of the crisis will be used to try to drive through change?</p> <p>  What about the idea that IFAC is really independent?</p><p>Although I do not doubt the personal integrity of the council members, their economic beliefs all come from a certain school of thought, even though there might be slight differences in their thinking.  In what sense are they really independent?  They are appointed by the Government, although the Government might not listen to them.  Why should they be in a position to say what is right and wrong?</p></speech>

We approach these problems as macroeconomists doing macroeconomic analysis.  We do not come to this with an ideology of trying to shrink government.  It so happens that no one on the council is pushing such an agenda.</p> <p>  We have been focusing on the fact that the Government's plans would see a substantial reduction in the size of government.  Given the underlying spending pressures from demographics and other areas, we think this should be taken very seriously.  Without putting things on an ideological or even policy footing, we believe it is important to recognise these pressures.</p> <p>  We have cautioned against tax cuts at this point.  We are certainly not coming into it with any ideological agenda.  What we do know is that if those in government do not get their macroeconomics right, if they make mistakes, it destroys people's lives.  That is what happened during the crisis.  If anything is driving us, it is to ensure it does not happen again.  I know it can sound very technocratic and, perhaps, to Deputy Paul Murphy's ears, ideological, when we talk about something like a budgetary framework.  We are pushing it because we know the kinds of mistakes that can be made by the political system.  None the less, we absolutely believe in democracy and recognise that these choices ultimately have to be made by the Deputies and Senators.  Given the kind of pressures politicians are under, they can make mistakes.  Sometimes having a technocratic body like ours pushing back a bit-----</p></speech>

Maybe Deputy Murphy has a view of the world in which those mistakes just do not occur but they are hardly unique to the Irish political system.  We can see that those mistakes sometimes do occur.  Ultimately, we do not make the decisions, nor should we.  They should be made by people who are democratically elected, namely, the Deputies and Senators.  It is to be hoped that having some advice, even if it is coming from a technocratic perspective, will ultimately lead to better decisions, better outcomes and better lives for people in that they are not affected by the incredible turbulence that has turned so many people's lives upside down over recent years.

We could probably sit here and philosophise on the overall economic crisis for quite a time.  There were economists of many different hues who sat on their hands for years and did not bring to anyone's attention the fact that 20% of our entire economy was based on the construction sector, for example.  They did not shout half loud enough when it came to needing to broaden the tax base and so forth.  I do not think economists have command of the truth any more than politicians.</p> <p>  The core point Professor McHale made was that the stability programme update 2015-2016 is not in line with the requirements of the domestic budgetary rule of the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact on a forward-looking basis.  I suppose it behoves me to point out for the record that, on a number of occasions, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recommended higher adjustments than the Government ultimately followed.  To date, the Government's strategy has, I think, proved correct.</p> <p>  Comments by figures such as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have focused on the value of social cohesion and the delivery of key public services.  There are aspects to the economy and economic measures whose importance cannot necessarily be fully measured.  Social cohesion is one of those aspects on which one cannot put a fixed price.  Organisations such as Social Justice Ireland and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made that point.  Society is more than the sum of its parts.  I do not think the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was ignored; it was listened to and other decisions were made.  Those decisions ultimately proved to be correct.</p> <p>  Professor McHale mentioned that the council was cautioning on tax cuts.  Earlier today or yesterday, the Small Firms Association, which is concerned that we are dropping in the competitiveness rankings, made the point that if we are to maintain competitiveness, one way to avoid pressure on wage inflation is to give tax cuts.  I would have different views on tax cuts.  I am just putting that point forward.</p> <p>  The professor also made the point that it would take years for domestic demand to recover, yet I was interested to hear him say that there could be higher than anticipated growth and that the output gap was likely to be closed, which would raise the prospect of the economy overheating.  I must admit, that left me somewhat breathless.  The idea of the Irish economy overheating after recent years is like shades of 2006 all over again.  Given that promoting domestic demand has been such an issue, how could we be looking at overheating?</p> <p>  Professor McHale raised a concern that, if incomes were to rise, households would prioritise eliminating private debt over consumption, which might be a downside for the recovery of the economy.  Given that, in its country-specific recommendations, the Commission highlighted the high level of private debt in the economy, would the professor not think it important for households to continue to decrease their private debt rather than to engage in consumption?</p> <p>  I want to raise three issues on the broader horizon.  One concerns the sale by the Government of its holdings in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  What are Professor McHale's views on the import of this sale for any statements he has made about the current Government strategy?  Second, what impact might the uncertainty in the eurozone over the ongoing Greek situation and the possibility of a Greek exit have on Ireland?  Are we in a position to withstand it robustly or might it produce a significant downturn in our economy?  Third, I understand there is a peer review of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council being undertaken.  Could the professor give us his views as to the operation of the council to date, specifically in international and European contexts?  Could he comment on the broader challenges to the organisation in the medium term?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the peer review was published today.  The review was carried out by an international panel, chaired by the former head of the Swedish fiscal council, Lars Jonung, and two other members.  They carried out an in-depth review of the operation of the council, in respect of which they held discussions with many of the stakeholders, including members of this committee, employers, media, unions and other bodies.  Overall, its assessment of the job we are doing was positive.  The panel made a number of particular suggestions, including in relation to our communications strategy.  For some amazing reason it was of the view that our publications are a little turgid, which I do not understand.</p></speech>

We have much to work on.  We will strive over the coming months and years to improve our overall performance.  We are grateful that the overall assessment was positive.</p> <p>  I welcome that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is seen as a pioneer among the new batch of fiscal councils.  Currently, all European Union countries have a fiscal council.  Even though the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is relatively new, in that it only came into being in 2011, it was one of the first of the new fiscal councils to be formed.  Some fiscal councils have come to visit us to see how we do things.  There is a great deal of interest in the way in which we organise things.  For example, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is the first of the new batch of eurozone fiscal councils to be peer-reviewed.  This has been done on a low-cost model, recognising that we have to apply austerity to ourselves also.  The UK council also underwent a peer review.  As we did ours at a fraction of the cost, there are many councils that are interested in the model we used.  We do see ourselves as a leader among, in particular, the smaller eurozone countries.  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding the assessment of the job we are doing, we believe we are doing many things well but there are certain things we could do better.  We have received useful specific advice of the things we can improve.  We are always open to suggestions from this committee and others in regard to how we can do things better.  We have heard some very substantive suggestions from this committee in the past about things that we can work on.</p></speech>

When people are plunged into the depths of unemployment and difficulty, this tears apart the fabric of society.  A budgetary framework to protect against the boom-bust cycles can help preserve social cohesion.  These two things are not necessarily in conflict, although I agree that many of the measures we use in economics, such as GDP, are limited in terms of what they are.  We do not pretend that these are perfect measures of human welfare and so on, but they are reasonable proxies of these things.</p> <p>  I regret that Deputy Murphy is no longer here.  The framework we are talking about, which we are asking the Government to adhere to, was brought about by the political process.  Not only was it voted upon and put into domestic legislation, but it was put to a referendum of the citizens of Ireland, who voted for the fiscal compact that brought about many of the newer elements of this fiscal framework.  We are not here to try to undermine the democratic process in any way; rather, we are trying to play our role in monitoring the frameworks that were endorsed by the democratic process that has been put in place.</p></speech>

At the same time, as pointed out by Professor McHale, the level of slack in the economy relative to what it can potentially produce if all resources are utilised is probably relatively small.  Also, the growth rates projected for last year, this year and the coming years predict a rapid growth in the Irish economy, so the situation could change quite rapidly.  Fiscal policy needs to be cognisant of that and ensure that it is appropriate given the cyclical position of the economy, which has not always been the case in the past.</p> <p>  With regard to debt reduction, the point made in the report, which, perhaps is not sufficiently clear, is not that households should not continue to reduce debt levels.  The household-debt-to-GDP ratio in Ireland is among the highest in Europe.  The deleveraging process is necessary so that repair of balance sheets can continue.  It is true that if households are going through the process of gradually reducing their financial debts, this could dampen consumption for a number of years.  Currently, the savings rate is high but it is projected to fall gradually.  It is undoubtedly true that as households gradually pay down high levels of debt, this will negatively affect consumption.</p></speech>

Our best guess is that, at least in the short term, we are reasonably well insulated.  Even though we do not have that much direct exposure to Greece, we are exposed to countries that are exposed to Greece and so we could get caught up in the turmoil that would follow.  The bigger issue is probably further down the road.  If things went reasonably well with the Greek exit, this would change the nature of eurozone membership in that as countries get into trouble there would always be doubt about whether they will be able to remain in the euro.  This could lead to disruptive speculation down the line.  It is something we hope will be avoided.  On the other hand, too great a concession to Greece could also have negative affects for Ireland.  One of the reasons we have been able to pull out of the crisis is the strengthening of lender of last resort supports within the eurozone.  Those lender of last resort supports are based on the idea, essentially, of conditional loans.  If those loans are turned into grants, essentially writing off the debts for Greece, or if the conditions are substantially weakened, the concern is that the stronger countries would not be willing to give support in the future.  The feeling is that it would not be credible that these would be conditional loans, because ultimately they would not be paid.  This could weaken the lender of last resort supports that have been so important in terms of pulling out of the crisis.  There are risks to Ireland even if there is no Greek exit, because substantial concessions are made to it.  On balance, the hope would be that the two sides can come to an agreement, that Greece remains in the eurozone, and, very importantly, that Greece gets back onto a growth path and puts its crisis behind it.  There certainly are risks involved.  My colleague Dr. Conefrey will respond to the question about the sale of bank shares.</p></speech>

In terms of how outsiders view the Irish economy, they took these contingent liabilities almost as seriously as actual Government debt on the balance sheet.</p><p>In addition to the positive news we have seen in terms of the decline in Government debt, we have seen a decline in the size of these contingent liabilities.  As we remarked in our November report, this is also an important part of the progress we have seen in the last couple of years.  The contingent liabilities have declined.  It has been pointed out that the potential exists for some gain to the State.  We have done some very aggregate calculations based on publicly available information and estimates of possible maximum gains to the State from recouping the funds invested in the banking system.  It would come to approximately 8% of GDP.  It would be a one-off reduction in the debt to GDP ratio.  It is welcome that these contingent liabilities have reduced in size.  It is now plausible that there could be a return to the State from their sale.  It would be a one-off gain that would shift the debt to GDP ratio lower.  In that sense, it would be important not to overstate it.</p></speech>

If we believe we know more about the value of AIB than the markets do, which is possible, we would want to wait.  Even though the markets can get things wrong, as saw in dramatic fashion coming up to the crisis, on the whole we have to be careful in betting against the market when it comes to valuing stocks.  That means we can be reasonably relaxed about when we sell.  If we sell now, we would get market value.  The best guess as to future market value is probably the current market value.  Therefore, I would not see it as an urgent priority to sell.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Sullivan's response to Deputy Creed's engagement was interesting.  One of the witnesses spoke about one of the things missing from this.  There is nothing in these rules to prevent the Government from increasing revenue if it seeks to increase expenditure.  The Mallow bypass is not being stopped by anybody else's rules, but by a Government determination of what to do with increasing revenue.  That goes for the whole infrastructural landscape around the country in areas like housing, broadband and roads.  I think that is an important issue.  I would like to get the witnesses' views on a number of external factors that are positive now but could be negative in the future.  The matters in question are making a massive input into the growth levels we are experiencing.  Factors like the level of the euro, the price of oil and interest rates would have a strong influence on growth levels.  Can the witnesses quantify proportionally, if that is possible, how strong these drivers are with regard to growth?  Can they forecast the likely behaviour of these drivers into the future?</p></speech>

Given the importance to the Irish economy of exports, particularly to the UK and elsewhere outside the euro area, the exchange rate is probably more important than the price of oil and the level of interest rates.  It has a very important bearing on how we project our forecasts for exports.  The exchange rate is one of the important drivers of potential Irish exports.  It is probably the most important of the three.</p></speech>

We know how big exports are in terms of economic growth.  As the euro exchange rate and the level of external demand are probably the two biggest drivers of that, they have a crucial bearing on determining Irish exports, which account for a very large share of GDP.</p></speech>

The level of demand in Britain and the United States and the exchange rate, both of which are outside the reach of policy drivers in this State, would be big determining factors in the health of the economy.</p></speech>

We know there were 11,000 or 12,000 completions last year, which is well below the ESRI estimate of what is needed purely on demographic grounds.  Such a level is approximately half of what the ESRI estimates is needed to meet sustainable housing demand in the long run.  On that front, we can definitely say the level of housing investment is below what is normally needed in the economy.</p></speech>

I understand the level of investment is to be cut from 1.8% to 1.5%.  We have had a conversation about infrastructural deficits.  In a healthy economy that is maintaining its capital stock and ensuring competitiveness in that regard, what is the percentage of GDP in Government investment that is logical?</p></speech>

Perhaps he might extrapolate further down the line in terms of longer-term concerns, such as pension provisions and the ageing population, both of which have been alluded to.  At the moment, we are taking a bit of a holiday with what is happening in relation to the oil market and so forth.  Where do we stand in terms of issues like energy provision in the longer term?  What is Professor McHale's view on what the longer-term concerns for the economy might be?</p></speech>

Until now, the council's analysis has focused on the near and medium terms.  We recently started a new work programme.  A new member of staff has joined us to work on a long-term issue.  This is our major project for the summer.  When we come back to this forum after we bring out our next report - we hope the joint committee will invite us again - we will be in a position to set out the results of that longer-term analysis.  That will give us a good sense of what the longer-term fiscal pressures are.  Longer-term issues such as energy sustainability really go beyond our mandate.  While we have views on these issues, we are not really experts on them.  The Deputy would be better off asking people who have significant expertise in those areas to comment on them.  We are beginning a major project on the fiscal side and we will be able to comment on that in the context of the next report.</p></speech>

The low interest rates that were favoured to try to move along the economy of central Europe - the core of Europe - were completely unsuitable for us.  Are we seeing the same pattern emerging again, with very cheap money being produced essentially to try to lift the stagnant core of Europe off the ground?  If so, it has the potential to wreak exactly the same havoc again in economies like ours.  That is my first question.  I will come back in with a second question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015061100002#O00200"><p>It is certainly something to which we have to pay careful attention.  One of the downsides of being a small country in a monetary union, where the interest rate policy is set for the union as a whole, is that it can be quite inappropriate for particular countries and certainly for smaller countries.  The Deputy is absolutely right when he says that during the boom phase, we had a monetary and interest rate policy that was inappropriate for Irish conditions.  At the moment, because Europe is still very much in a slump and is facing deflationary pressures, we have policy rates that are at very low levels.  Until now, it has been to our benefit.  As we discussed earlier, we are still operating below potential.  It is good to have that stimulus to the economy, particularly when fiscal policy has had to be quite contractionary for other reasons, such as debt sustainability and trying to regain our credit-worthiness.  It is something we are going to need to watch as we move towards a situation where the Irish economy may be getting back up to its potential.  If it seems we have a monetary policy that is unsuitable for Irish conditions, we may have to use fiscal policy as the only demand management tool that is available.  The Deputy will have heard the ESRI expressing concern that current fiscal policy might be stimulative, given where the economy is.  I reiterate that the use of fiscal policy for counter-cyclical demand management is very important when one does not control interest rates.</p></speech>

We want to protect against a cycle of boom and bust.  I agree with Dr. O'Sullivan's point that part of that is about having sustainable revenue streams.  I would not be quite as harsh on the fiscal council as Deputy Paul Murphy has been.  I have got to know its members better - that is why.</p></speech>

Housing, which is a particular bugbear of mine, is an example of that.  Obviously, property tax is a revenue source based on property.  We are now seeing how volatile property is.  I will not get into that argument now.  When I was speaking to a rural Deputy recently, he told me that developers down the country are sitting and waiting at the moment because property prices in the countryside are low.  They could apply to get money from the banks to build, but they will not do so because there is no profit in it for them.  They are going to wait and the banks are going to wait.  The banks would not give them the money now anyway, for exactly the same reason.  These developers are going to wait until property prices go through the roof.  They are waiting for the crisis to get worse from the point of view of people on the ground, and arguably from the point of view of the economy as a whole.  If we cannot house people, we cannot do much else.  If we do not have basic things like housing, it is going to be a real problem for our economy, never mind for the people.  Is it not the case that State intervention is the only way to address that?  I suggest the only way to protect itself against that sort of volatility is for the State to have adequate stock, or to intervene when the market is failing by providing what the market is not willing to provide?  That argument could be extended into a number of areas.  If the State does not have a significant stake in the economy, we are just sitting back waiting for the next storm to hit us.  If we are talking about protecting against boom and bust, we must realise the only way to do that is to provide for a greater level of State control over the economy.  That is necessary to ensure we are not subject to whatever storm is coming down the road.</p></speech>

As we are going to have a private housing sector, we need to make sure it is functioning well.  The Deputy laid out a scenario in which people's expectation of price increases leads to behaviour that just makes the problem worse.  In this case, the problem on the supply side is the failure to put houses on the market in the expectation of getting higher prices at a later stage and the problem on the demand side is that people who want to get in now because they expect prices to increase are pushing prices up.  We saw during the boom phase how that sort of behaviour can lead to a dysfunctional market.  It is very important that we avoid the boom-bust cycle in the housing market, just as we do in the economy as a whole.  The kinds of measures recently taken by the Central Bank when it set limits on loan to value ratios are very important in that context.  As prices go up, people need higher deposits.  This reduces their ability to bid higher prices for houses and stops that price cycle from developing.  If a possible boom in house prices is stopped from developing, the expectations that lead to the dysfunctional behaviour that has been described cannot get ingrained.  If people behave more normally, there will be a more normally functioning housing market.  Policies that make the private sector part of the housing market work and facilitate the necessary investments on the social side need to be pursued.  The Government and the private sector both have important roles.</p></speech>

The committee has identified this issue as a priority in its work programme.  Deputy McLellan is our rapporteur on the issue and she has engaged in significant work on our behalf.  The child care sector faces a number of challenges.  These include the increasing costs faced by families for child care; conditions, accreditation and training for child care workers; and increasing regulation and funding issues.  As part of our hearings, and including Deputy McLellan's report, the committee will prepare a report to be published in the autumn.  I welcome Ms Michelle Akerlind, Cork Early Childhood Centre; Ms Paula Grogan Ryan, Tipperary Early Childhood Ireland; Ms Evelyn Reilly, Maynooth-Kilcock Early Childhood Ireland; Ms Paula Donoghue, Clever Clogs Montessori and Daycare, Ballyconnell, County Cavan; and Ms June Tinsley, assistant director and head of advocacy at Barnardos.  They are all welcome to the meeting and I thank them for attending.</p><p>I apologise for being late in beginning but we had a great deal of private business to deal with. I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I welcome everyone again and I thank them for their presence and for the work they are doing.  I am conscious that we have two other meetings and, therefore, I ask witnesses to confine their remarks to five minutes.  I ask Ms Akerlind to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

We have three centres: one in Bishopstown, one in Ballincollig, and a workplace cr&egrave;che in Cork City Council.  When my business partner, Sarah, and I opened the doors of Cheeky Cherubs in 2005, we made a conscious decision to employ only qualified staff.  Ten years, on we have a highly motivated and dedicated team, with 18 out of our 30 practitioners having either a level 7 or a level 8 degree and the remainder having level 6.  We have our level 4 S&iacute;olta accreditation quality mark, and all members our team are trained in the methodologies of HighScope, Reggio Emilia, the Tuscan approach and Aistear.</p> <p>  As a private provider, I wear two hats at all times and all decisions are made with both hats on.  My first hat is as an owner and provider of high-quality care to children and families and liaison officer to all the bodies.  I interface with Tusla, the preschool inspectorate, environment health officers, Pobal, Better Start and the Department of Education and Skills.  My second hat is as an employer who must have the funds for payroll, dealing and negotiating with financial institutions, the constant tweaking of business plans and the massive stress that comes with that. I am also a HR manager.  I do not know any other educational body that is a provider and an employer.  We also have inspections from NERA, the Revenue Commissioners and other employment and business authorities.</p> <p>  By not funding this sector properly, we have provided that every individual takes his or her own path.  Some will take the quality route, but others will not, or cannot, due to critical financial constraints.  A vast discrepancy needs to be addressed to streamline quality.  Only quality counts for children, but quality costs employers like me.  We use our integrity and are very proud of the quality experience that children receive in our care.  The perception in the public domain is that we are earning an absolute fortune.  I get that and I understand why there is that perception.  We, as a private provider, are also an SME.  We are ten years in business with a waiting list as long as my arm.  We also have ten years' academic research behind us; we are the success story.  Why should we not have a healthy bank balance?  Sarah, myself and our partners jumped off a cliff together.  We work for ourselves to make a difference in a sector that we are passionate about and to earn a good living.  We should have been rewarded for those risks, but if I had opened a caf&eacute; ten years ago, my bank balance would be a hell of a lot better.</p> <p>  The capital allowances have helped keep our heads above water, but they ran out in 2014, and this year will be a game changer for us, personally, financially and professionally.  The advice of our financial advisers is to cut costs, not to hire such qualified staff, to reduce wages, and to cut back on non-contact time, continuing professional development and many other  resources.  That is what advisers say when a company is struggling, not when it is thriving, and there have been many weeks that Sarah and I have not taken home a wage.  I am one of the only people here who is not getting paid for my time.  No one picked up my hotel tab last night and no one is paying my mileage and expenses.  I am sure no one would swap jobs with me based on terms and conditions and recognition and rewards.</p> <p>  Ireland is well known for its highly skilled teaching profession.  They are well up there with their European counterparts and many have come into this House.  Why are we nearly at the bottom of the European table when it comes to early years investment?  Why do the UK and our European neighbours get it and we do not?  Why are we putting our children at such a disadvantage when it comes to competing for jobs in the European market in years to come?</p><p>Cheeky Cherubs has played its part but we have been let down.  We have huge mortgages and have not received any support or investment to date.  We are solely a private enterprise yet it appears perfectly acceptable to knock on our doors and have layers of inspection.  I have no issue with an inspection.  I have an issue with the excess layers of inspections.  Excess layers of inspection will not enhance or drive quality.  Instead it will create a distrust and a lack of respect for the sector.  We have no early years qualified inspector because the current inspectors are public health nurses.  I do not think the nursing profession would take kindly to an early years professional and educator inspecting them.<br/><br/>We pay a rates bill on time every year which has a direct impact on our team not receiving decent pay rises and recognition for their work.  This year our rates bill is just over &euro;13,000.  I have been informed that I cannot be exempt from paying it as I am not an educational institution which are the deciding authority's words and not mine.<br/><br/>I am tired of listening to comparisons between us and our European counterparts.  The curriculum in place in our centres is just as good as the curriculum in places like the Nordic countries and the UK, which have come up the ranks.  Their Governments see the value in what they do and invest in them but the Irish Government will not invest in me.  It is embarrassing when one says one works in the early years sector.  There are no pats on the back for the difference we make to the lives of young children.  Often there is a snigger or eye-rolling for working as a glorified babysitter.  How much do members pay their babysitters?  I suspect it is more than a level 7 or 8 early years practitioner earns.  Some people take the view that we only care for children so where is the value in that.  We expect to be valued as a profession but we are not at present.  <br/><br/>Our staff rates vary from &euro;9.50 to &euro;15 per hour, which includes a director's salary.  Many of our practitioners cannot secure care loans or mortgages.  I am always deeply frustrated and saddened when I complete the paperwork for members of my team.  It is not unusual for a staff member to work 40 hours week yet to need a second job in order to make ends meat.  <br/><br/><b></b>Children are not born on their third birthday and investment needs to happen much early in a child's life.  The ECCE scheme benefits children and their families but not Cheeky Cherubs.  Unfortunately, there is no funding for the provider.  The scheme fails to support working families who work 48 weeks in the year and from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.  I shall outline interesting statistics on UCC graduates who qualified last year.  As much as 42% of graduates went into primary teaching, 23% went into the early years sector and 35% did not pursue work in either sector.  <br/><br/>Last week I spoke to a lecturer in UCC who posed the following questions in a lecture theatre.  She asked for a show of hands by people who would go directly into the early years sector and 27% of those present said they were.  She then asked how many people would go into the early years sector if they were recognised like the primary sector and had the same status and pay.  The result was 83%.  Those findings speak volumes.  <br/><br/>Tax credits will not work and will not ensure quality.  Instead, investment needs to be provided to services that have proved themselves by investing time and money in their team and the children in their care which are services like ours.  Additional needs for children are not met and thus puts the team and centres under huge pressure.  The Government must step in and provide support to children with additional needs.  Early intervention works but it costs.<br/><br/>There needs to be planning for sustainability and included in these plans a focus, not just on the child, but on the practitioner.  Cheeky Cherubs has proven that by hiring qualified and motivated individuals and supporting them in the workplace with non-contact time, continuous professional development, enhanced annual leave and permanent contracts one can then do the real work of supporting the welfare and education of young children.  If the Government can find moneys for inquiries and tribunals then it can find money for the early years sector.  <br/><br/>The good news is that Cheeky Cherubs has an Irish model that is comprised of ten years' academic and hands-on research.  We have the tools and the training to drive quality and to motivate a team.  We have the whole package.  Like any other SME that pays its bills and taxes, the State will need to invest in us or our expertise will be lost.</p></speech>

Children are the very basis of our society.  They are the people who will shape our future and look after us in our old age.  Therefore, they deserve the best quality service.  I have worked in this area for over 20 years.  Five years ago I realised that the sector was becoming more professional so I up sticks and left my family in order to return to college.  I gained my degree in May 2012 and opened my preschool in a rural village in Tipperary in September 2012.  I rent a room from a primary school and employ two ladies.  Christine is qualified in child care level 6 and Deirdre has a qualification of child care FETAC level 5 and is studying for level 6.</p> <p>  We are one of the seven services in the country who was mentored to roll out the Aistear in Action project.  It forms our curriculum framework.  The way it benefits the children speak for themselves.  Children run into school, their eyes glow with excitement as they wait to meet their friends, and they are excited at the thought of deciding what work to do.  They spend their day working, playing, learning and socialising.  Aistear is a brilliant curriculum and works well.  This year we have also formally engaged with the quality framework called S&iacute;olta.</p> <p>  To conduct both initiatives, Christine, Deirdre and I have had to invest hours of work, attend monthly meetings, attend cluster meetings and have onsite visits.  The amount of paperwork involved has been staggering.  We have not been paid for any of this work but we did it because we believe that every child that passes through our service deserves that level of quality.  We believe it is their right.</p> <p>  Even with all the dedication and work that my staff put in, with their motivation and interest in the business, at the end of June they will have to go to social services for an income for the summer.  My staff are two qualified ladies who give unstintingly of their time.  However, I must tell them that regrettably I am unable to pay them for 14 weeks a year.  As a result, they have to approach social services and sign on.  As a private provider and self-employed person, I do not have the privilege of signing on and, therefore, I receive no money for 14 weeks a year.  I have been in business for three years.  At the end of this academic year I will not have any wages in June after I have paid my rent, taxes, employer's PRSI, my wages and also put money back into the business to keep it at the necessary standard.  All of that means I will not have any wages at the end of June.  While I agree wholeheartedly that we need Aistear and S&iacute;olta, and that high qualifications are essential, I am left wondering if qualified professionals should be asked to be at a loss financially.</p> <p>  I am here today because I believe that children are entitled to a quality and professional care and education.  I also believe that professionals who provide the service need to be acknowledged and rewarded financially.</p></speech>

I am the owner-manager of Kidz@Play playschool located in Maynooth and Kilcock, County Kildare.  It is a great honour for me to tell the committee that I shall celebrate 30 years of providing preschool education in the Maynooth area.</p> <p>  In terms of my own academic qualifications, 30 years ago I sought out whatever was available because I believed in qualifications.  Over the period of 30 years I have successfully achieved an honours degree in early childhood education and care.  I also secured the first presidential scholarship for a masters by research in the Institute of Technology, Carlow.  My topic was the impact of the ECCE and I recently submitted my paper.  My staff team is comprised of four personnel who have gained honours degrees and also staff who have attained level 6 qualifications.</p><p>In this presentation, I will draw on all that experience, my own, as well as the experience of running a preschool for 30 years.  I will share with members the reality of and some challenges associated with working in the early childhood education setting.  I must start with the positive because after 30 years, I must state it is the most dynamic, rewarding, challenging, busy, ever-changing and, not forgetting, fun career in which to be.  I could not mention many other jobs in which I could stand in onesies on UTV Ireland on national pyjama day to talk about the &euro;300,000 raised for Irish Autism Action or in which, having been dressed in a tiara by a child, I mistakenly could go to the bank while wearing it.  When we are asked why do we work in a sector that is so underpaid and undervalued, the answer is the children.  It is the children who embrace us and share with us their vision and view on the world.  They are the ones who hook us in through their play and are the ones who keep us going and make us so passionate about what we do, their care and education.</p><p> The early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme has afforded opportunities for all of Ireland&rsquo;s children.  It is a chance to make a difference in the lives of children by providing quality early childhood care and education and I acknowledge that the essence of the scheme is a good and positive thing.  However, there are many issues regarding the ECCE scheme which are endangering its effectiveness and functioning and which, unless corrected, will make it unworkable and I will set out some of them.  The capitation is not enough to do what we must do.  The Government set that capitation rate and although I have been in this sector for a long time, we were never consulted on how much it took to run it.  It is not fit for purpose; it is not paying me to do what I must do and I am not the only one.  The sustainability of my service and other services across the country and County Kildare, in which I am embedded, are dependent on an increase in capitation.  For those members who are not aware, my service receives the higher capitation rate because we are degree-led.  We get &euro;2,774 per child for 38 weeks.  Even if one omitted the closure of the service for the summer months, as an employer I still must pay for 42 weeks for my staff team to have their holiday legal entitlements.  The current model of the scheme covers 15 contact hours per week.  I have heard other submissions today and note the non-contact hours involve documenting, planning, reflecting, meeting parents and staff meetings, all of which are essential to quality services and yet this critical work is not being supported through the 15-hour-per-week model.  This current capitation must be stretched to do that.  There are other issues pertaining to the capitation that are not workable.  Members may not be aware of this but the scheme is not compulsory and if a child does not turn up for more than 20 days, the service must return capitation.  I was obliged to do this in respect of a child who took ill on holidays abroad and who was hospitalised.  I did not tell my staff team that week that they or the rent would not get paid because that child's 20 days were up.  There are other issues relating to the scheme that are not workable.  One anomaly is that national schools are not obliged to return capitation in respect of a missing child.</p><p> As for the children, they are benefiting from the scheme.  Research to date suggests this, as does my own research after 30 years.  However, the scheme is letting down some children.  Since the introduction of the scheme, increased numbers of children with additional needs are attending preschools.  While it is right and just that they should be in the communities in which they live, there is no support.  I cannot employ a special needs assistant, SNA, that the Government will fund.  As that is not available to me, for example, if a child is lucky to have a diagnosis, he or she may come with an SNA for two days a week but what about the other days?  We do not have that.  My point is this breaches their rights.  While they have an entitlement to the scheme, they have no right to participate.  Although Ireland has signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, their right to participation is not being considered in that regard.  Early intervention is key but investment is required and I must be able to access an SNA.  While this affects lots of children, for reasons of confidentiality I obviously will not discuss names.  However, in the case of one child in particular, an SNA is not being funded but yet, a taxi has been provided to the child in question to attend a unit 20-something miles away, which simply does not add up.  Another anomaly is that although schools have issues with SNAs, they can access an SNA, whereas we cannot.</p><p> As for disadvantaged children, the very essence of the scheme had its origin in the need to support disadvantaged children and its universality means that all children access it.  However, the Early Start programme, which is an intervention programme in designated disadvantaged areas, deems it necessary to give double the capitation to those children in preschools in the Early Start programmes that are in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, areas.  I suggest that it is not areas that are disadvantaged; it is children and there are hundreds of disadvantaged children in my preschool and in others nationwide.  I would like to be able to access additional funding for these children because the work we do with those children is different, as is the support for those families.</p></speech>

My concluding point is to recognise and reward the professionals.  I told members the staff profile and have permission to provide the joint committee with just two names.  Emma came to me as a student in transition year and obviously was influenced in her career.  She went on to obtain her honours degree successfully and she leads curriculum development in the Aistear in Action programme in my preschool.  She must work in a bar and sign on for the summer.  Sarah has been with me for ten years, has an academic qualification and was refused - not even considered for - a mortgage when she got married last year.  I will finish with a quotation from an American activist on the rights of children, Marian Wright Edelman, who said: "The question is not whether we can afford to invest in every child; it is whether we can afford not to."  I thank the joint committee.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Paula Donohoe from Clever Clogs Montessori and Day Care, Ballyconnell, County Cavan, and invite her to make her submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2342" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#G00500"><p>My name is Paula Donohoe.  I am a private provider from Ballyconnell, County Cavan.  I am very at home in the setting where I am working with 20 children on a daily basis.  This, I must say, is completely taking me out of my comfort zone but because I am passionate in my beliefs that we need to improve conditions for the children attending our services, the parents who avail of our services and the staff who work those services, I am appearing before the committee this morning.  As I am rather nervous, please excuse the shakiness.</p> <p>  My background is that I have a degree in Montessori.  I worked for 16 years in a Department of Education and Skills special school in Cootehill, County Cavan, where I was a teacher, before making the decision to open up a Montessori and day-care facility in Ballyconnell, which I did in 2008.  I am a relative newcomer to the area of child care but I have the best part of 30 years behind me working with children.  I first thank the joint committee for giving me this opportunity to have our voices included in this very important discussion with regard to child care and its future.  My hopes for today are that I can, as best as possible, represent the issues as they arise for us the providers, with particular reference to the private providers on a daily basis.  I wish to both highlight our issues and accompany them with what we believe may be viable solutions to issues we identify.  I wish to provide a practical and proactive response to this invitation.  I will discuss the issues as they arise under a number of headings.  We looked at sustainability, the ECCE scheme, special needs, Aistear and S&iacute;olta, grants and community child care subvention scheme, CCSS, funding, Garda vetting, registration, rates, PRSI, VAT and childminders.</p> <p>  As I am sure all members are aware, there is a huge sustainability issue in the area of child care facilities, with many of my colleagues struggling to keep their doors open, let alone actually take a wage for themselves.  We have seen far too many closures over the past number of years due to insufficient investment in this sector.  The sustainability issues arise from ever-rising costs we are facing such as insurance, which increased by 30% this year alone, running costs and ever-increasing wage costs, coupled with being obliged to take a decrease in our ECCE payment since its introduction in 2010.  This has left a lot of cr&egrave;ches and day-care facilities at breaking point.  As we try to ensure that all our services are run to the highest of standards with a huge emphasis on driving forward quality in the sector, we also are faced with ever-growing costs and what we consider to be a lack of investment in the area, which leaves us facing major problems.  The average cost of child care in the County Cavan region is &euro;150 per child per week for full day care.</p><p>We are well aware that this is a huge bill for parents and that they cannot pay any more.  What we are saying is that our Government, like its counterparts in most European states, needs to invest in child care and thus invest in the future of the of most important asset our nation possesses.  Research has repeatedly shown that investment in the early years benefits all in the future.  I do not think any Minister, Deputy or Senator can disagree with that but the important issue is whether we are willing to make the necessary investment.<br/><br/>I propose to discuss some measures which we feel will really help not only improve quality in the sector, but also alleviate some of the very concerning issues we are facing in the context of sustainability.  We recognise that the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme is a hugely important investment in our sector which has greatly enhanced the lives of many children and their parents since its introduction in 2010.  That said, we also feel this investment does not go near far enough towards facilitating the desired level of quality in our sector.  At present, we receive &euro;62.50 per week per child at the lower level and for those on the higher capitation - the latter only represent a very small percentage of preschools as a whole - the amount is &euro;73, which breaks down as &euro;4.16 hour or &euro;4.86 per hour at the higher level.  This is paid for a three-hour period only.  However, we in the preschool sector are aware that in order for quality to be present in the three-hour contact time with the children, many hours of non-contact time, including preparation time, setting-up time, team meetings and parents consultations, must take place.  The capitation is only paid for three hours per day and for 38 weeks per year.  It does not even cover arrival and dismissal times, which generally take between ten and 15 minutes before and after class finishes.  It in no way allows for any planning time or time required to compile records or learning journals.  It covers a bare minimum and nothing more at a time when there is huge pressure on to increase quality.<br/><br/>To help us in our endeavours to meet the higher standards, which, I must add, the sector has, in the main, been requesting for many, many years, we ask that the Government increase its investment in this particular programme so that we can reach those standards.  At present, the sector, both private and community services, is paying for all non-contact time, preparation time, etc., the community sector by means of fund-raising and the private sector by unpaid hours done by management and staff.  This cannot continue.  The Government cannot continue to advertise a free preschool year when, in fact, it is offering the minimum and the sector is providing the rest.  I speak for myself when I say that I currently do all my planning and record keeping at home in my own time.  All my learning journals, which are kept for every child in the preschool programme, are completed in the evening.  I am very positive that I am not alone in this practice.  Three hours a day does not allow for any team meetings, planning or otherwise.  If we were to complete all this work while the children were <i>in situ</i>, there would be very little time left for us to deal with them.  This work is done but for the most part it is completed in the private time of the room leaders.<br/><br/>Our proposals are that the Government should increase the capitation grant for ECCE at both higher and lower levels; increase the number of hours per day, from three to three and a half or four, so that the grant would be paid out for allowing realistically for time of arrival and dismissal and much needed non-contact time in order to facilitate team planning and record keeping; and increase the number of weeks per year over which the grant is paid out by at least another three to allow for preparation of materials, yearly planning, etc.  We are, therefore, asking that the capitation to be paid out over a 41-week period.  This would assist us owner-managers to pay staff their statutory entitlement of holiday pay, which, at present, we feel the ECCE scheme does not cover.<br/><br/>The issue of special needs is particularly close to my own heart.  It is a subject about which I am very passionate.  I do not wish in any way to take away from my fellow providers, who also feel this is an area into which we must make huge investment in order to try to address the specific need of the many children with special needs who are enrolling in preschools.  At present, children with additional needs enrol for their free preschool year under the ECCE scheme in the same way as other children.  We, as providers, welcome their inclusion.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs allows children with specific diagnosed needs to spread their free preschool over a two-year period, attending possibly two days per week in the first year and three days per week the following year, and pays the grant on a <i>pro rata</i>basis.  This is the only specific help a child or a service receives in recognition of the diagnosed additional need.  Special needs assistant, SNA, hours are not allocated in respect of the child and we do not receive any specific training regarding special needs.  SNA allocations-----</p></speech>

We are asking for SNA allocations, that every child who has an additional need be entitled to a second free preschool year, that proper specific training with regard to special needs should, in our opinion, should be mandatory for all of those working with children with special needs and that an expert in the area of special needs should be appointed in each county to work specifically with the child care sector.  We have many other proposals in respect of rates and VAT which we believe would assist, directly and indirectly, in dealing with the sustainability issues relating to the child care sector.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#H00700"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  As members may know, Barnardos has been a long-time campaigner for greater investment in quality early years services.  We run 42 projects across the country, working in areas of disadvantage, and in our early years services, every day we see children who are absolutely thriving as a result of the quality of interactions, relationships and activities they undertake.  We believe that helping a child to build his or her social, emotional and educational repertoire from an early age is a great leveller.  Quality early years services provide the foundations which enable children to escape a life of poverty and disadvantage and permit them reach their full potential.  We know there is a huge bank of evidence to verify the benefits of high-quality early care and education for all children from age two onwards.  These benefits are greatest for children who come from areas of disadvantage.  Children from the age of two onwards do better in high-quality care and education services than they do if they remain at home on a full-time basis.  Early care and education, when it is of high quality, produces widespread benefits for the child, their family and wider society.  It raises educational outcomes, enhances employability, reduces child poverty, improves health and prevents social problems.  We know this as a result of the many longitudinal studies that have been undertaken.  We also know, from an economic perspective, the cost-benefit analyses that have been conducted all show a huge rate of return.</p> <p>  On after-school care and activities, research has shown that participation in after-school programmes helps children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, eases their transition between primary and secondary school and lowers the risk of early school leaving.  Currently, the after-school care sector in Ireland is very disjointed and unregulated and care is often unaffordable.  There is need for a co-ordinated national strategy for this sector in order to enhance quality, accessibility and affordability.</p> <p>  With regard to the policy context, we know that Ireland has the highest fees for child care due to continued under-investment on the part of the State.  Ireland only invests 0.4% of GDP annually in this area in comparison to the OECD average of 0.7%.  We also know that services vary in quality and availability and that staff are underpaid.  In addition, childminders, who are the preferred choice of care for many parents, are largely unregulated.  We are aware that the Department spends &euro;260 million annually on many targeted schemes, as well as the free preschool year, and that it has recently beefed up the inspection regimes and imposed minimum qualifications.</p> <p>  Barnardos welcomes the 2015 country-specific recommendations of the EU Commission urging the State to act to address child care as a way of reducing child poverty and removing a major barrier preventing parents from taking up employment or training.  The recession has impacted on families with young children the most, leaving one in eight children in consistent poverty.  As Ireland emerges from recession and the public finances improve, it is imperative to seize this opportunity and ensure that wise investment choices are made.  Barnardos urges the committee to make brave recommendations that will guarantee a link between public funding and quality services, enhance availability and support those most in need.  On foot of the wealth of evidence that exists, we believe it is clear that investment in subsidised quality early care and education and after-school systems can deliver on all of these.</p> <p>  Barnardos would be vehemently opposed to the introduction of tax credits as a solution to make child care and after-school care more affordable.  In our view, such a move would be extremely costly and do nothing for improving the quality of the service.  From the perspective of parents, the amount of credit obtained would still fall far short of the fees being charged and would do nothing for those low-income parents who are outside the tax net or seeking to move off welfare.  It also will not stop fees being increased for support services with highly-trained staff.</p><p>Opting for policy that favours tax credits instead of investing in public services ignores the international evidence of ways to effectively tackle child poverty and address wider structural inequality.  </p><p> As we focus on budget 2016, the next general election and the centenary of the 1916 Rising, we owe it to today&rsquo;s children to create a better future for them and their children.  It is unacceptable that by the age of five, children from the poorest fifth of homes are nearly a year behind children from middle-income households in developmental outcomes.  There must be clear, decisive action to tackle this entrenched inequality.  The Minister for Finance announced in the spring economic statement that up to &euro;1.5 billion will be available for budget 2016.  Barnardos believes it is a mistake to split this money 50:50 between tax cuts and investment.  Instead, the majority must be earmarked for investment in public services including the development of a subsidised, quality early years and after-school care system.  Such a system would take a number of years to be introduced so Barnardos believes that some initial core steps should be taken immediately to commence this journey.  These initial steps would include reforming parental leave so that paid leave is available to parents to enable them to stay with their child for the first year of his or her life; extending the community child care subvention scheme by making subsidised places available in privately run early years services; introducing a new 100% subsidy for families with identified high levels of need, with access on the basis of referral from Tusla; and retaining the free pre-school year, improving it and moving towards the introduction of a second year.  For those families who prefer home settings, funding schemes should be set up for registered child minders so that they can meet quality standards.  Finally, in terms of after-school care provision, it is important that any public funding invested in this sector is met with a guarantee of quality.</p></speech>

There was no indication that they were nervous in delivering their presentations.  It is quite clear from what we have heard today that there is a serious issue regarding the sustainability of the child care sector going forward.  People are remaining involved in the area because of their passion, commitment and dedication and their love of their profession.  They place enormous value on playing a key role in an important developmental stage of a child's life.  That was very evident at recent rallies organised by the Association of Childhood Professionals, which were organised at times that would not discommode service users.  Those involved put their service users before themselves.  Their commitment has been undervalued and under-recognised and that is something that must be addressed.  I thank the witnesses for sharing their experiences with us today.</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses may be aware that I have already produced a fully costed strategy ---</p></speech>

A lot of what has been said at today's meeting is covered in my policy document, particularly with regard to the early childhood education scheme.  My document acknowledges that the capitation rate for that scheme is too low and calls for the cut implemented two years ago to be reversed.  We must acknowledge that on contact time and holiday pay, the State is only paying providers for 38 weeks of the year while requiring them to pay their staff for 42 weeks.  That is unsustainable and must be addressed.  After-school care has been discussed widely in the media this week.  The sector is totally unregulated and I would have worries and concerns about investing in an unregulated sector.  The sector must be regulated before any investment in it by the State.</p> <p>  On the issue of quality and inconsistencies across the board, I have grave reservations about the Department's role in this area.  The Department brought forward a registration process which was given legal effect 15 months ago in January 2014 but that has yet to be implemented.  The new regulations under which services are supposed to operate have yet to be publicised so providers are not aware of their obligations.  In terms of quality, that is where we need to start.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the issue of special educational needs was raised by the witnesses today.  Just before the witnesses arrived today the committee heard of correspondence from the Minister explaining that yet another interdepartmental group would be established to look into the issue, comprising the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.  That group is expected to report in September of this year.  While that is welcome, I will be forgiven for being somewhat cynical about it because we have spent the last four years highlighting what needs to be done.  We are all aware of what needs to be done: a new, targeted special educational needs fund must be rolled out on a national basis to remove any of the inconsistencies that currently exist.  Access to services should not be about where a child is from.  Geographic location should not determine whether a child with special educational needs can avail of a free pre-school year.  A recent report showed that 21% of service providers refused admission to children with special educational needs, which is an absolute scandal.  I hope the aforementioned interdepartmental group bears fruit but I am somewhat sceptical, given that we are still waiting for the national inclusion plan which was supposed to be published two years ago.  The time for plans and interdepartmental groups is finished.  We want to see real and tangible action now.  </p> <p>  One of the issues of concern raised today was the number of agencies that service providers must deal with, including Tusla, the Department of Education and Skills, pre-school inspectors, Pobal, Better Start and so forth.  I have been arguing for several years for the development of one comprehensive  inspectorate to inspect all aspects of the service, including environmental, educational and developmental.  That is all that is needed.  That would reduce costs and would be far better in terms of quality assurance going forward.  It always amazes me that the Government has identified the need for educational inspectors to inspect the service because of the educational component.  At the same time, however, if service providers apply for a rates exemption, they are told that they are not an educational facility.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  My party put forward amendments to rates legislation which went through the Houses recently to exempt pre-school services from commercial rates because they are, in effect, an educational facility.  Indeed, they are a very important educational facility providing educational services at a key stage in a child's life.  </p> <p>  I would also like to see the extension of the community child care subvention scheme.  The manner in which that is being dealt with at present is segregating children from better-off and less-well-off areas.  That must be addressed.  </p> <p>  There must be an incremental increase in investment in this area.  There must also be an increase in the provision of maternity and paternity leave.  There must be an increase in capitation to acknowledge and recognise the qualifications of those working in the service as well as non-contact time and holiday time.  Then, and only then, when all of the deficiencies within the service have been identified and addressed does the party that introduced the first free pre-school year believe that we should introduce a second free year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#J00900"><p>Finally, I wish to address the issue of tax credits.  I have been advocating the introduction of tax credits and many pre-school service providers have contacted me directly and congratulated me for doing so.  In that context, I sometimes wonder where the advocacy groups get their information from.  They have looked to Australia and argued that the introduction of tax credits drove up the cost of child care but a costs study by the Australian Government contradicts that argument.  The study shows that there was a significant drop in the percentage of disposable income spent on child care following the introduction of tax credits.</p><p>For me, the best way to get children out of poverty is by supporting their parents back into the workforce.</p><p> I will conclude now, and I appreciate the Chairman's leniency.  There are umpteen reports, especially with regard to one-parent and low income families, showing that the reason those who want to work cannot go to work is that the cost of child care is preventing them from doing so.  Sometimes it even pushes them out of the workforce.  I believe we must support those families.  The best place for a child's development is at home first, and to have economic security we must allow and support those parents back into the workforce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#K00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their insightful presentations, which were not only excellent but also provided some clear recommendations and solutions which will be very useful to us as we move forward.  I am sure the members of the committee will agree that without the input of witnesses and meeting people who are at the coal face our report would be worthless.  It is important that we know what they are thinking.</p> <p>  Yesterday, some of us attended the launch of "Picture Your Rights", a report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from Children Living in Ireland, compiled by children of all ages and supported by the Children's Rights Alliance and UNICEF Ireland.  The report stated that 1,148,687 children are living in this State and account for 25% of the population.  That emphasises the need to invest in children.</p> <p>  I also thank the witnesses for the work they are doing.  I am sure they are not thanked often enough, but parents are extremely thankful for the work they do.  As part of my work as special rapporteur I have conducted a number of outreach meetings around the country and met many providers from both the private and community sectors.  We have also met with parents and workers.  A common theme emerged from those meetings and it also came through in the presentations today, that what is needed is affordable, accessible, quality child care and a substantial investment in child care.  We would all agree on that.  The other main issues that arose are wages, terms and conditions and whether qualified professionals should be asked to be at a loss financially.  They should not.  There are also the issues of not being able to get mortgages and car loans, only being able to work 38 weeks of the year and having to sign on the dole.  That is absolutely unacceptable for qualified professionals.</p> <p>  I wish to tease out a number of questions.  Many other issues have been covered and will be covered by other members of the committee today, but a few have arisen on which people might have different views.  One is the concern of some regarding an emphasis by the Government on a degree-led workforce in child care.  Some people expressed the view that quality of care is often only gained with practical experience.  If a pay scale is introduced that only reflects academic skills, is this not unfair to those who have been working in the sector for years who have fewer academic credentials?  Perhaps the witnesses would give their views on that.</p> <p>  Another question arose with regard to the community employment, CE, schemes.  How can participants in the CE scheme be used fairly and in a way that does not replace regular employees?  Concern has been raised about the inconsistency of employment numbers of CE participants from centre to centre.  How do we strike a balance without displacement?  Also, is there an over-reliance on CE workers?</p> <p>  With regard to capitation, must all or part of the moneys be returned and paid back if missing the 20 days?  I am not clear about that.  Must it be returned for the entire year or is it just in part?</p> <p>  The subvention issue arose frequently.  Should everybody be able to avail of the subvention, both private and community, bearing in mind that in many areas people do not have access to community service providers?  I am anxious to hear the views of the witnesses on that.  On the issue of grant applications, how should this be improved and made more accessible to providers?  There is an issue with regard to private owners not being able to access grants.  Does that put them at a disadvantage?  Does it put the children who are attending their cr&egrave;ches at a disadvantage also?</p> <p>  I had a few questions about special needs but we have been informed that the Minister is examining this with the Department of Education and Skills and will report back by September.  There is a recognition that the current system is not fit for purpose.  I would welcome getting that report this morning, but we will have to wait and see what emerges from it.  Do the witnesses agree that two full years of preschool provision should be a right, regardless of how the time is split up?  There have been issues with regard to children with special needs perhaps attending two days and three days, but sometimes children are not identified or assessed as having special needs until towards the end of a year and might not be suitable for mainstream school.  Unless the parents can afford to send the children to preschool in the gap year, the children must stay at home.  Should a child with special needs have a right to get two preschool years, regardless of how many days they wish to attend?  In addition, it was pointed out to us that if attendance is split up into two days and three days, when the child goes to mainstream school they must attend for five full days immediately.  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p></speech>

It was also brought to our attention that the inspectors arrive unannounced and then expect a staff member to be free.  When they arrive to inspect, should a fully qualified preschool staff member be with them so they can fill in while the preschool frees up one of its staff members?  Should they come as a team so there is somebody who can fill in and the preschool does not have to worry about it?</p> <p>  I will not mention the rates but two of the witnesses mentioned tax credits.  Three of them did not mention them, so do they have a view on the matter?</p> <p>  Finally, money should follow the child regardless of location, and disadvantaged children live in many different communities and constituencies.  I presume all of the witnesses would agree with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#K00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It was very interesting.  Listening to them I realised, particularly in the case of the providers, how many of them are on the brink.  I can feel the joy and passion for the work they are doing, but I can also see the stresses.  I have seen that replicated in meeting many different providers.  Part of me wonders if it is because the sector is so dominated by females and whether that is a contributory factor to the reality of why we are discussing this issue and the value we put on the sector.  That is something we must take on board as policy makers.</p> <p>  I will go straight to the issues because we are all  under pressure for time.  Regarding the inspections, it would be interesting for committee members to understand the reality of the different types of inspections.  There is a real issue here for the State in that there are so many different bodies going to the facilities to inspect.  We must look at the costs for the State versus how it actually improves the quality outcome, and everybody in the room agrees that we want the quality outcome.  I have a huge issue with the fact that I see advertisements for public health nurses, who have no expertise in an area, at assistant director level.  I have no problem with the costs for the inspectors.  Let us give them a high cost, but let them go in and inspect settings where one is not being paid for that non-contact time, because if one takes somebody out of the room the ratios are broken.</p><p> There are some serious issues for the State to examine in the interdepartmental group the Minister is considering.  I appreciate that we have a focus on the providers, because they are giving us the reality, but there is a question for the State as to why we have Tusla, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, Pobal and all these other bodies trying to assert their role in a sector that is already overstretched.  We say we want quality, and some providers are making choices, as Ms Donohoe said, about cutting back hours and, therefore, cutting back on quality.  Outcomes will then be affected.  I am concerned about the capacity for the sector and its sustainability.  We must look at that.</p><p> The issue of additional needs was brought up.  I think it was Ms Reilly who said one of the only things that is happening is that we can do two days a week one year and three days a week next year.  As a former employer, I am trying to work out how one employs staff for two days a week this year and three next year, because it is one child, but there are ratios.  How is that a sustainable model, where one is only being paid for that time?  I cannot compute how that can be done and it is very serious to hear of staff, who are so qualified, earning more money in other sectors, whether in bars or chippers.  It shows where we are putting our value as a society.</p><p> The other issue I want to raise, regarding staffing, is laying off a very qualified person for 14 weeks.  The question I have relates to the number of weeks per year, because we jump at this idea of the second year.  Should we be looking first to extend the first year?  Is this something that parents want?  Is it something that children want?  Is it something that is good?  There are critical choices to be made.  Does the sector have the capacity to do that and how do we grow that and ensure that quality?  In anything the State does, we should be contributing to quality rather than overstretching the service.</p><p> My final point relates to the investment issue.  The great thing about the free preschool year was that we changed the discussion.  The discussion was, at last, about the outcomes for the child, and we moved the discussion away from whether the parents are working or not and what they choose to do.  We were actually saying that it is good for a child to get early education, in the same way that it is good for a child to go primary school and to secondary school.  That is my difficulty with trying to link it in any other way.  On the tax credit issue, the early child care supplement was tried in 2006 and it was withdrawn because prices went up immediately.  It did not actually improve outcomes for children.  I do not need to go to Australia for research.  We saw it here in Ireland.  It is clear that the answer is investment.</p><p> I welcome the remarks in Barnardos' submission about the first year of a child's life and the need to work on paternity and maternity leave and put emphasis on that.  That is something I have also heard from providers.  Nobody is asking that we go under the age of one.  In our discussions, we need to remember that critical first year of a child's life, and the State must do everything it can to support it.</p></speech>

On the tax credits issue, I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Troy from Barnardos' perspective.  There is an emphasis on supporting parents getting back to work and tackling child poverty, but in an era where we are trying to get value for money, tax credits are the most expensive option, so I do not believe that is the right route to take.  We must also bear in mind that the amount a parents gets in an annual tax credit might work out at approximately &euro;2,000 per annum and if the parent is paying child care fees of &euro;700 to &euro;1000 a month, it is nowhere near what is actually required.  It also does not do anything around childminders.  Chances are that those who are trying to make that transition from welfare to work are taking up a job that is outside the tax net, so they will not benefit from any tax credits.  As Senator van Turnhout said, the move from the early child care supplement to the free preschool year was a game-changer.  The emphasis was put on the child and the outcomes for the child.  This is an opportunity to continue that discussion by putting the emphasis on the services, knowing that it will improve the child, the sector, the family and, ultimately, wider society, as it will help tackle child poverty.  On the question of whether we have the capacity for a second free preschool year, I would personally like to see the quality of the present preschool year enhanced, because at the moment it is varied.  I do not think we can jump straight to that point, but I would like to see us get there.  We do not have the capacity at present without significant investment.  The providers here today have eloquently highlighted the challenges with the services being run, so we cannot jump there just yet, but we should be moving in that direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#L00400"><p>The free preschool year should not be elongated, because it would not benefit the children or the staff.  It is similar to primary schools: everybody needs a break.  A second free preschool year will require, along with the quality, major capital investment.  We definitely need the SNA hours, to be used wisely and with training.  Regarding the community childcare subvention scheme, without a doubt, the funding is for the child, not the service.  Why we are letting the funding be directed into a service rather than going with the child is beyond me.</p> <p>  A grant was announced recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, which ranged from &euro;500,000 to &euro;500.  We in the private sector could only apply for &euro;500.  There was massive discrimination.  It was hidden behind the idea of disadvantaged children, but we also know that the children in community services are not only disadvantaged.  There are many children who are not designated as disadvantaged.  We felt very left out and discriminated against and we would like all grants, as they were announced, to be given to all, so that there is a fairness to all children in all services.</p></speech>

We need a degree-led, professional workforce.  We are professional.  It does not mean that every single person must have a degree, but a degree-led graduate workforce is the way forward to acknowledge where we are and to give value for the children.</p> <p>  With regard to unannounced inspections, having had inspections since the very beginning there are not many jobs where a staff member is making Play-Doh and is quizzed on child protection policy while they are working with the children.  That is what happens when one is trying to be mindful of ratios and so on.  There are elements of all the inspections that should be announced, especially around paperwork.  I agree with unannounced inspections for quality control, but a great deal of paperwork inspection could be announced, so that the business has the paperwork ready and somebody ready to do it.  That is something for the committee to think about.</p> <p>  In terms of children with additional needs, for those members who may not be aware, at the outset of the scheme children with additional needs were afforded two full years.  That should be completely reinstated.  The idea of splitting one year of full preschool weeks over two years is unacceptable.  A parent said to me that her child's rights were not met.  She went on to school never having done five days.  That requires supports.  We as providers must be able to access SNAs if we feel we need them and the Department must pay for them.</p></speech>

I agree with Ms Donohoe regarding the grant application.  I started three years ago and have had no funding whatsoever.  It is all private funding, which adds to the cost, which is coming out of any money I have.  This year we were allowed &euro;500 when community services have received more.  Inspections involve taking a staff member off the floor.</p><p>We have a very good HSE inspector.  She is quite willing to sit and wait until the children have left to do the paperwork, which is great, so one is then going into non-contact hours again.  We are now working after school has finished and we are not getting paid for that either, so either way it does not work.</p><p> I wish to speak about the two years for children with special needs.  I have a little boy in my service at the moment whose mother is fighting for an assistant and I am also fighting for one.  The principal in the primary school is also fighting for an assistant for him.  We have failed on all counts even though we all know he needs it.  We did apply to extend his year, so he had two days last year and he has three days this year.  His mother has had to pay the balance for the rest of the five days.  She has brought him five days but she has had to pay the balance for both years.  I do not think that is right.</p></speech>

I agree with my colleague Ms Reilly about having a degree-led workforce, but there needs to be access to the degree on a part-time basis from all colleges and universities, and there also needs to be some financial support.</p> <p>  ECCE needs to be provided 48 weeks a year for full-day care for working parents.  I am a huge advocate of encouraging men into such a female-dominated workforce.  However, the reality is that we will not get men in the workforce unless wages are increased.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#M00400"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the excellent, informed presentations they put before us.  I welcome in particular Ms Paula Grogan Ryan, from my county, Tipperary.</p> <p>  I can identify with many if not all of the issues raised in the various submissions.  I am a member of the board of the Elm Park child care centre in Clonmel.  It is a purpose-built community child care facility with 65 places that was built about ten years ago.  We provide services from the baby room through to toddlers, waddlers and up to preschool age.  The staff are professional, and as we have heard in the presentations this morning, they have improved their skills at their own expense and in their own time.  Despite a lot of support from the county child care committee and Pobal, we, like the services we have heard about, operate on a shoestring budget.  We are under pressure on a daily basis to make ends meet.  It goes back to an acceptance that early childhood education is vital for young children and that there is a huge payback for the children themselves, their families, and wider society.  In monetary terms, for every &euro;1 that is put in the return is &euro;10.  Ms Tinsley from Barnardos put it very well in her submission.  She said early childhood care raises educational outcomes, enhances employability, reduces child poverty, improves health and prevents social problems.  We have all said that and we all accept it, but we need to go further and properly fund the service to create the outcomes we have spoken about.  We are nowhere near doing that at the moment.  We are funding on the basis of 0.2% of GDP when the European average is approximately 0.7%.  It is obvious that we need to increase the funding provided to child care services.</p> <p>  Everybody has raised special needs.  It is a subject that gives rise to considerable difficulties.  There are no special needs assistants and in many cases children are not even assessed.  Such children can lack social skills and motor skills.  Ms Reilly made the important point that initially a two-year service was provided to children with special needs and that should be reintroduced immediately.  As a minimal starting point, we should seek a reversal of the cuts that took place in 2011, which were implemented on 1 January 2012.</p> <p>  In terms of staff training, it is important to consider non-contact time, including preparation and training, which is all being done by the service at the expense of staff and the employer in their own time.  That is something that must be addressed, because it will not bring qualified professional people into the service and people will not remain if they are not properly trained and paid.  In very many cases, child care professionals are being paid at hourly rates very close to the minimum wage, which is really not sustainable for the service.</p> <p>  A host of other issues were raised.  In fact, there are so many challenges that it is difficult to identify priorities.  Is there a single item that would significantly enhance the service both for the children and for the service in general?</p></speech>

I will not play to the gallery.  Ms Grogan Ryan was not able to go through her very comprehensive submission.  I wish it could all be put on record.  I have been involved in education for 31 years.  I agree with Senator van Turnhout.  One of the reasons pay is so poor is that it is a female-led profession.  Men would not work for the money involved.</p> <p>  High-quality teaching, learning and care is of the utmost importance in getting the necessary outcomes.  We must put children at the top of the pyramid and all the rest of us must serve them.  The witnesses know as well as I do that we have come through an economic disaster in this country, but we are now at a stage at which the economy is improving.  We must work with the child care sector to ensure we have the best outcomes and services for the children without those involved being exploited.  Pay in the sector is appalling.  I know many owners of preschools, care workers and professional staff who cannot get mortgages.  I also know primary school teachers who cannot get mortgages in Dublin.  That is by the way.</p> <p>  The witnesses are fighting a winning battle.  Money was flung at buildings in the past and there was no thinking behind it, but now we have the Aistear programme, which is fantastic.  We are seeing children who have participated in it.  In recent years teachers have told me that children are coming to school much better prepared.</p> <p>  Experts might complain about what I say, but as a primary teacher and principal I know that one could nearly write the CV of a child within three weeks of their starting junior infants, and I am sure the child care professionals present can see that as well.  The necessary input is vital at an early stage of a child&rsquo;s life.  Parenting has not been mentioned, but it is so important.  Child care professionals are in a unique position to help parents guide their children, as I am sure they see the deficits in parenting.  Child care professionals are on the front line and have a way of getting to the parents.</p><p>I am going to stop talking.  I wish to be fair to Ms Grogan Ryan.  Deputy Seamus Healy asked for a wish list.  I was going to ask about this.  We have not got a magic pool of &euro;500 million or &euro;1 billion to invest, even though we know we need to invest.  Therefore, we need to proceed slowly and think about how to proceed.  What are the most important requirements, in order of priority?  I will do my best for the witnesses.</p></speech>

Having been in the private sector for many years, I am well aware of the issues associated with running any business.  Ms Michele Akerlind referred to rates of &euro;13,000 per annum.  That works out at &euro;250 per week, which is quite a lot of money.  With regard to the cost of providing services, I am not looking for exact figures but the percentages of the funding coming in.  No one has actually given a breakdown on the use of the money by percentage.  Providing it would be a useful exercise.  The &euro;13,000 in rates is going back to a State organisation.  Of the money coming in, what percentage is really going back to the State in the form of rates, PRSI or PAYE?  In real terms, the net cost to the State is far lower than what we are being told.  It would be useful for us to have an overall breakdown.  It is important for long-term planning.</p> <p>  The issue of rates is significant.  Insurance is also an issue that is arising.  It needs to be examined also.  We cannot bring about change overnight so there has to be a planned process.  Deputy Healy asked the witnesses to state their main priority.  What are the three areas in which the witnesses believe an immediate improvement could be made without the State incurring a huge cost?  That is an issue we need to examine immediately.  We also need to plan carefully in respect of where money is being invested and ensure we can develop the service while at the same time paying staff adequately.  Producing a breakdown by percentage would be a useful exercise that we could work on.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I am concerned about all the issues that have been raised.  The last thing I did before coming here today was to drop off my child for the last two weeks of his free preschool year.  There will be many tears shed at his graduation next week.  We are extremely grateful to the teachers involved.  They do an absolutely fantastic job for my son.  I have two other children who have gone through the process.</p> <p>  The issue of children with special needs has been significant in County Meath lately.  The Department of Health, which is apparently in charge of this in Meath, has acted disgracefully.  First there was the abolition, and then, a few weeks ago, there was a 25% cut.  I do not know whether the cut has been reversed yet.  The document we received today on addressing the requirements of special needs children really shows a Government that has been completely mixed up from 2011 until now and is acting utterly disgracefully in regard to children with special needs.  It states openly that no Department wanted to take the lead on this issue.  I find that absolutely extraordinary after the Government established a Department with responsibility for children.  Nobody wanted to take charge of this issue.  Come September, there will be a report.  Of course, we all know why there will be a report in September.  When will we get action on this?</p> <p>  In my second child&rsquo;s ECCE class, there was a child with Down's syndrome and there was a special needs assistant.  We live very close to the border of Louth.  I did not know the SNA service, even in the case of partial provision, was totally different in the next county and in some other counties around the country.  We really have to take action on this and roll something out across the country as soon as possible that will benefit children with special needs and the rest of the children in their class.  This messing has gone on too long, as is clear from the document we have received today.  I am appalled and shocked by it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#N00500"><p>I apologise for being late.  I was at another meeting this morning but I am thoroughly aware of all the delegates' submissions.  I do not wish to ask questions but I want to state that, in the past few weeks when preparing for the proposals we will be making to the public on the next five years, I have done a lot of research on child care.  As Senator Byrne stated, this arises from the issue that was so eloquently put by Mags Coogan and her team to the HSE in Meath in recent years.  The ECCE scheme is absolutely wonderful in principle - Fianna F&aacute;il is to be commended on it - but it is an awful pity it did not assign SNAs when it was established and when there was an obvious need for them.  Equally, it is an awful pity that we have not had the money to do so in a consistent fashion nationwide.  I commend the HSE in Meath for having the gumption to allocate money for it.  We all know it is not enough money, but at least the authorities are trying to address the situation.  We will work with them co-operatively to try to ensure there is more money.  There is a real need for SNAs to be assigned to children in this sector.  It is the only sector associated with our educational programme for those between zero and 20-something in which we do not support children with special needs.  It is glaringly obvious that this needs to be done.  I believe there will be provision in the Estimates this year, which is very welcome.</p> <p>  Let me make two other points.  We nearly want all staff in the sector to have PhDs coming out of their ears, yet we want to pay them as if they were flipping burgers in McDonald's.  That is wrong and needs to be addressed.  The capitation funding that has been offered has been cut in recent years but, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor stated, we are now in a position to start trying to unravel some of the financial emergency measures that were taken because the last Government put us off a cliff.  This is definitely one area that needs to be addressed.  The capitation improvements need to be examined, and sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  We need to resource staff to meet the improved standards and attain the qualifications we require of them in the health care and education sectors.  It is not just a matter of capitation.  The educational resources pertaining to the qualifications that we would like employees in the sector to have need to be in place.  Ms Akerlind is correct that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  We need to work with the universities to ensure they work in tandem regarding the resources and hours being worked in the sector to ensure we all go along this journey together and achieve what we want - namely, excellence in the delivery of education for preschool children.  However, we have to ensure we resource the sector to enable it to meet the standards it wants to meet and that we want for all children.</p> <p>  I hope the SNA issue will be sorted out by the Government this year.  I genuinely hope that, as money becomes available over the coming years, we will return to circumstances in which we pay staff to reflect the quality and standard of the care and educational resources they are providing to children.  I am not quite sure I care whether there are men in the industry, because the service being offered is superb.  I want to ensure the staff are being paid to reflect the quality of the service they are giving.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of points to make.  I met the child care service providers in my area and inquired specifically as to what they require in the upcoming budget.  I feel very strongly that children from disadvantaged families and backgrounds should receive an opportunity to get a second free preschool year.  There have been cuts in this regard in various areas.  The second year gives disadvantaged children in particular a better standing on the education ladder.</p> <p>  If the witnesses had a realistic wish list for the budget, what would they look for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michele Akerlind" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#N00700"><p>I will reply generally to some of the questions.  Senator Burke asked about the percentage of our income that is devoted to wages.  Eighty two per cent of our income is wages from the get-go, and that is not enough for our staff.  The balance covers every other aspect of the business.  That just gives the members an idea.  That is not unusual in regard to private practice.</p><p> As for my wish list of changes, the top priority would be support for professional practice in all aspects of training.  One cannot expect to have a quality service unless the people working in it have received quality training.  That involves funding centres with degree-led staff.  We need funding to pay staff wages.  That works in Australia and I do not see why it cannot work here.  Quality-driven centres should be rewarded for quality when it comes to grants.  If my facility does not have contraventions, I will not receive a grant, but a facility which does have contraventions will be given a few bob to fix the playground or whatever else.  That is not right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Grogan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#O00200"><p>As far as I am aware, when the ECCE grant was cut, the ratio of children to staff was increased.  Whoever made that decision does not work in child care, was not concerned with quality and not thinking of the children.  If I had a wish list, the issue of financial reward would be on it.  My staff are already giving of their time, doing hours for which they are not being paid.  At least if I am paying them, I can say, "You will have to stay a little later to do this."  The staff are already doing this, but they deserve a financial reward for doing so.</p> <p>  On inspections, I do not think there is any other group in the country that has been subject to six inspections.  If a member of staff has to stay late for an inspection, he or she should at least be paid for doing so.  We do not need this number of inspections; one should be enough.  What is happening, however, is that the Department of Education and Skills is actually introducing a new inspector role.  I am amazed people in our sector have not stood up and said, "Enough."  As I listened to the departmental representative speak at the Early Childhood Ireland convention about this new inspector, I could only wonder why nobody was shouting, "Stop."  As I said, only one inspection is needed.</p> <p>  It goes without saying we need to look after special needs children.  That is a no brainer.  We must look after them at preschool, not just primary school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#O00300"><p>On that point, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs wrote to the committee this morning to notify us that his Department was leading an initiative with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health to agree a model to address the requirements of children with special needs in mainstream preschools.  The communication states: "It is well recognised that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for preschool children with special needs is not satisfactory across the country and while some efforts have been made to resolve the matter, no model has been agreed".  The Minister has asked the committee to report in September with proposals and full costings for consideration as part of the Estimates process.  This discussion will feed into that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Evelyn Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#O00400"><p>I hope my wish list will address some of the questions members have raised.  Ideally, capitation for the ECCE scheme would be provided on a year-round basis.  More realistically, it should at least be provided for 42 weeks.  In addition, the capitation grant should be restored to its original level, even though that level is not adequate, and should include extra provision for non-contact time.</p> <p>  Another item I would include on my wish list is one that is key for children with additional needs, namely, that I should be able to access a special needs assistant without a formal diagnosis.  I have a child who came to me last August and only this week received his assessment of need.  His mother and my staff team have effectively functioned as his SNA.  Assessments of need are not being made in a timely fashion and when they are received, the resources are not available to implement them.  There should be recognition of my professional competence such that I am able to say a child needs an SNA and the provision of that SNA must be funded.</p> <p>  My third wish relates to children who are disadvantaged.  We are dealing with disadvantaged children in all of our services up and down the country; they are not confined to specific areas.  I live in the affluent university town of Maynooth but the children attending our service are from a mixture of backgrounds and some of their families need support.  My staff team is offering assistance to parents every day at the door, but we need time and support to do this.  In a context in which national schools receive support to help children who are disadvantaged, including through the Early Start programme, why should our sector not receive the same support?</p></speech>

Having put a lot of hard work into it, I hope it will have some contribution to make to the committee's report.  </p> <p>  My wish list would include, first, investment in the ECCE programme, as I said in my proposals.  Second, without a doubt, is investment in meeting additional needs.  My third wish relates to Aistear and S&iacute;olta, two immensely important framework documents being brought forward.  I implore the Department to ensure these initiatives are rolled out in a similar fashion to the way in which the new primary school guidelines were implemented, with mandatory whole-staff training.  That would help to drive forward quality.  My fourth wish is that preschool facilities be removed immediately from the rates net.  They are recognised as educational facilities across the board, with the singular exception of the Valuation Office.  The Equal Status Acts specifically recognise private preschool providers as educational facilities, but this is not reflected by the Valuation Office.  It is time for the issue to be addressed if we are to have a realistic prospect of offering a sustainable service.</p></speech>

We are coming out the other end of the recession, but we seem to be willing to accept that there are inherent stumbling blocks which prevent children from reaching their potential.  At the same time, however, we know the answer to tackling the problem of child poverty can come in the form of investing in early years provision, which helps to create a level playing field for children.  My request to the Government as we approach the budget and a general election is to take decisive action to tackle the fact that one in eight children is living in consistent poverty.  That is totally unacceptable.  My three wishes are to restore the capitation grant for the free preschool year, extend the community subvention scheme and introduce paid parental leave to facilitate parents to stay at home for the first year of their baby's life.</p></speech>

I am honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to become chairperson of the Dublin Dental University Hospital board.  I will introduce myself and outline the approach I intend to take as chairperson of the Dublin Dental University Hospital board.</p> <p>  I am 53 years of age.  I have been married to Cathy for the past 29 years and have three children, Jennifer aged 22 years, Phillip, 24 and Stephen, 26.  My hobbies include playing golf at Kilkeel Golf Club and sailing on Carlingford Lough.  I am a past pupil of Terenure College and the College of Commerce, Rathmines, Dublin.  I qualified as an accounting technician in 1982.  I qualified as a member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in 1990 and became a fellow in June 2013.  I have been employed on senior management teams for over 24 years, covering areas such as performance, corporate governance, audit, regulatory systems, human resources, information technology, risks and strategy.  I am a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies - Ireland.  I hold the position of chairperson of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and have been an active participant on its boards since 2009.  CIMA Ireland represents 5,000 members and 3,000 students on the island of Ireland.  Later today, in my capacity as chairperson, I will be presenting the award to the winning Global Business Challenge Team in the Institute of Technology Tallaght.  That is where I have to go next for a photoshoot and I am running a little late for it.</p></speech>

I have also spent approximately 50% of my time working in the Republic of Ireland and 50% in Northern Ireland.  I have managed budgets of &pound;5 million to &pound;3 billion and teams of five to 75 staff.  I have been employed in financial control positions since 1983, working with the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers Superannuation Committee, the British Broadcasting Company in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Newry &amp;amp; Mourne District Council, Moor Steel Engineering, Aubrey Fogarty Advertising, Printec International and Diageo Ireland.  I am employed in Navigator Financial Planning in Warrenpoint which provides financial strategies for a select group of clients.  I am also employed by Aviareto, the manager of the International Registry of Mobile Assets.</p> <p>  My main ambition as chairperson of the Dublin Dental University Hospital board is to be an active participant with the CEO and board in publishing and implementing the 2015 to 2018 strategic plan.  The Minister has asked me to pay particular attention to ensuring adherence to the eligibility provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, in the provision of dental services; taking account of the standards and procedures in place for the provision of dental services under the dental treatment services scheme and any equivalent scheme that may be put in place in the future as it is important to ensure there is equivalence of treatment for all those eligible for health service care provided in the State, regardless of setting; fostering collaboration between the two dental schools, the importance being their common remit in undergraduate training; supporting the Department of Health, as required, in the development of oral health policy; and educating and training a dental workforce in line with a new oral health policy to ensure the future oral health needs of the population are met.  I intend to include these points in our strategic plan and hope to receive board approval by 29 June, with the plan being supplied to the Minister shortly thereafter.</p> <p>  I will review the accounts for the year ending December 2014 and expect to have them agreed and presented to the audit committee, passed and signed off on by the board and with the Comptroller and Auditor General by the next board meeting.  In the next few days, following confirmation of my appointment, I expect to appoint a new vice chairperson, a new audit committee and a new performance committee.</p></speech>

I also convey our apologies to him for the late start of our discussion.</p> <p>  Mr. Nolan's CV is very impressive.  He has considerable experience in business and business management, all of which is well noted and appreciated.  Was there an open competition to become chairperson of the Dublin Dental University Hospital board or did the Minister him seek out to take up this role?  What was the genesis for the approach to him in the first place?  Perhaps it was an open contested position and that quite naturally, supported by his CV, he rose to the top.</p><p>If is was not, however, I wonder what it would have been that struck the Minister from Mr. Nolan's CV to look at this particular position in the dental hospital.  As we know, it is very close by to where we are meeting this afternoon.  I am not asking the question to be vexatious in any way at all.  It is just to get an understanding of it because the natural fit does not jump off the page.  All of the experience is noted and I have no doubt that that is perhaps the explanation - that Mr. Nolan will be applying all those resources in his new position.  As a lay person, I think of the dental hospital as something in another field from business.  I wonder what the linkage is, what the expected role would be, and what Mr. Nolan can tell us about the brief or remit he has in taking up this position.  </p><p> From the perspective of this committee, we want to see the dental hospital hopefully covering all areas of the preparation for, and provision of, required dental practitioners across all the different skill bases that the particular profession encompasses.  We want to see that develop and thrive.  Coming out of a period of contraction, we do not want to see stale or sterile accounting practices being applied that might in any way inhibit its future development and success.</p><p> If Mr. Nolan can elaborate on any of those points, I ask him to do so.  I wish him every success and good luck in his new position and I hope that we will have occasion to engage with him in the future.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Nolan explain what he thinks the Minister had, or has, in mind?  Has he briefed Mr. Nolan on that?

I wish him every success in it.  Can I flag up two issues with him in view of his presentation?  If I am out of order the Chairman may say so.  In his submission, Mr. Nolan said it is important to ensure that there is equivalence of treatment for all those eligible for health service-provided dental care in the State regardless of the setting in which it is provided.  It is an interesting quote.  I have on file a letter concerning someone who was assessed for orthodontic treatment on 11 May 2011.  The case is in the Cork area.  I received a letter from the HSE stating that the average waiting time is three and a half years.  If one adds three and a half years to May 2011 it would bring us to November 2014.</p> <p>  When I replied that the person had not been seen within that three and a half year period, I got another letter yesterday morning to say that three and a half years is an average.  I was told that if someone has a real emergency, they should get a report from a psychologist and the HSE might then be able to give it priority.  The case concerns a young person and I made the point that the delay was having a huge effect on the child.  After receiving that letter, I went through another source yesterday evening to find that the file for that person has been in an archive since 2009.  This is an appalling way for a service to be operating, although I know it is not in Mr. Nolan's area.</p> <p>  I have another document wherein someone made a submission to me about orthodontic treatment.  While a person needs to have an initial assessment by an orthodontist, a lot of the work orthodontists are doing could be farmed out to qualified dental surgeons.  An awful lot of work is staying under the control of orthodontists, which is unnecessary.  I know this is a learning process from Mr. Nolan's point of view, but does he think he can deal with these areas?  In view of his quotation that it is important to ensure that there is equivalence of treatment for all those eligible for health service-provided dental care, how does he see his own role in helping to alleviate the problem that currently exists, especially concerning orthodontic treatment and giving advice to the Minister on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Nolan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#R00900"><p>I will start with the first number of questions.  The process for the role was an open competition, advertised through the public sector.  I applied for the role because in the late 1970s and early 1980s I was a patient of the Dublin Dental University Hospital.  It is also why I am the chair of CIMA Ireland, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.  My son is studying for CIMA so I have decided to give something back.  It is the same with the Dublin Dental University Hospital.</p> <p>  As regards my CV, I have been chair of CIMA Ireland and chair of CIMA Northern Ireland on two occasions in the last five years.  I am used to dealing with boards and managing boards, but also getting boards to change.  In the last five years for CIMA Ireland, we have joined the North and South together.  In a contracting recession CIMA Ireland has not contracted, whereas all the other professional bodies have.  That has been done through partnership and active participation.  We look at the problem in a practical sense, asking what we can do as members to change.</p> <p>  As regards looking at the past and moving forward, we obviously have to address the example of having statistics for three and a half years and having average waiting times.  We need to examine extreme cases and ensure that we come back to a reasonable standard for all of Ireland.  It was the same when I started with CIMA five years ago, in Belfast, Cork and Dublin.  We now have Derry, Newry, Galway and most of Ireland is covered for its members.  One has to make that decision and go for it.  </p> <p>  In deciding on resources, we have to move them back in and let us see if they have an effect.  I will take the two examples the Senator mentioned and I will make it my business, over the next month or two, to see if we can address that matter.  </p> <p>  The role itself is on a part-time basis and is similar to the two other roles.  I have a role in Dublin on Monday and Tuesday and a role in Warrenpoint on Thursday and Friday.  This role will be on a part-time basis, roughly on a Monday night involving tele-calls with the CEO.  I do not expect it to take a huge amount of time but for the next couple of months it will, until I get up and running.</p> <p>  The strategic plan will have the seven points and the additional points I have been given today.  In every organisation when one is doing four-year standards, there are always exceptions.  From my experience in the 1970s when I came here first they told me to come back in two years time because it was growing.  In the dental industry, they do not want to do severe dental work until a patient reaches the age of 18.  At that stage, one's upper jaws will have stopped growing.</p><p>At times, that is an explanation that is used.  People want a certain service, but the consultant says "No, can we wait until you're finished growing and then we will take that on?".  I will check in this case.</p><p> Moving stuff from the orthodontist to qualified dental surgeons sounds great.  I do not know much about the dental hospital apart from what I have read, but one must have a certain amount of throughput for consultants and one needs specialists.  We have seen many examples in Northern Ireland and in the South where people have not had the numbers going through their hands as surgeons to be really qualified to do things.  Dublin Dental University Hospital will have the volume going through for its consultants.  When one goes and sees a consultant in the Dublin Dental University Hospital, one will be able to expect a service because they are seeing 15,000 patients a year.  That service should be much higher because they have the right volume.  We have seen that in a number of places up North and down South where units have been closed because there was not enough throughput going through the consultants.  It is the same for dental hospitals as it is for normal hospitals.</p></speech>

I take well Mr. Nolan's noting of the points that Senator Burke made.  I say to him only that the committee has addressed a number of issues within the whole dental field in the past 12 months in particular.  The whole area of regulation is very important to us.  We have significant issues around non-registered practitioners, a number of whom have been exposed across the State, including in this city in the recent past.  The Dental Council is apparently unable to effectively deal with this because it can only deal with those who are registered with it.  Somebody who establishes a practice but who is not registered does not come under its remit.  There seems to be a difficulty there in terms of the legislative provision.  I understand that there is a review of legislation in relation to dental practice across the board.</p> <p>  Finally, I note that we are also anxious to see dental technicians upgrade to clinical dental technicians in order to allow them quite properly to deal with members of the public rather than only with those who are dental practitioners; that is dentists.  It is also important that people who are not clinical dental technicians do not engage with members of the public as they are not entitled to do so.  There are, regrettably, several instances known of this practice taking place, which is unacceptable.  Regulation is critical and these are matters that will, perhaps, come before Mr. Nolan in this new position.  I hope the joint committee can be of assistance in highlighting or reflecting on any of these points to him at any time.  As I said earlier, I wish Mr. Nolan well in his new position.</p></speech>

It has been promised and I hope it is implemented within the four years.  It would bring the regulation part and clean matters up.  On clinical dental technicians, I note that the Dublin Dental University Hospital has a programme of training in place already for that.  The policing of unauthorised in-the-garage dentists is really a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which needs to pick it up.  As a very small organisation, we will not be able to find out in every garage in every town who is practising but not registered.  If we hear of it, we will do what is required at that stage.  However, the dental Act needs to be in place.</p></speech>

I was pleased to be asked by the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to become the chairman of St. James's Hospital.  Following a request by the joint committee, I welcome the opportunity to introduce myself and set out the main challenges and issues facing the hospital over the next period as well as to outline the future priorities for the organisation.  I will summarise the key points in my short presentation.  St. James's Hospital holds a unique position in the Irish health system.  It is the largest provider of adult acute services nationally and, through a commitment to excellence in clinical care and business processes, it has achieved the position of being, in effect, a national health-care campus.  The period of my appointment is a a particularly exciting time for the organisation as this position can and should be further enhanced as a result of the major capital investments planned and already taking place on site.</p> <p>  As to myself, I have worked in a variety of roles over the past 25 years, primarily in technology businesses.  I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in the late 1980s and spent the first years of my career working for the German engineering firm, Siemens, initially in the UK and then at its headquarters in Munich, Germany.  I returned to Ireland in 1996 and joined what was at that time a reasonably small, privately held Irish software business with approximately 40 staff called Iona Technologies.</p><p>Over the following four years we grew that business to approximately 1,200 staff, floated on exchanges in Ireland and the USA and achieved a market capitalisation of circa $1 billion.  At IONA I was responsible initially for delivering success through forging strategic partnerships and later for the product management of two of IONA's four market offerings.  I left IONA in 2000 to form my own start-up and built that business from zero through seed funding and early-stage angel investment and later venture capital funding rounds.  On that journey I hired a world-class multidisciplinary team, put the practices and work processes in place for success, mentored and guided the team through the earliest stages and took the business through product launch to closing our first customer revenues.</p><p> I have held a variety of roles over my career, including chief executive on more than one occasion.  I have served on the boards of a number of commercial and voluntary organisations, including, most recently, two six-year terms from 2002 to 2014 as a member of the board of guardians and directors of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  In that capacity I also served on the quality and risk sub-committee for six years, including two years as chairperson in 2013-14.  I am a former member of the executive council of the Irish Software Association, the representative body of Irish software businesses.  I am a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Marketing.  I am employed by Munich Re, a large German reinsurance business, where I currently act as the executive vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa of its automation solutions division.</p><p> At present I am also a director of Personally Speaking, an Irish-based speaker bureau that provides speakers to corporate events throughout the world, and a director of the Clanwilliam Institute, a centre for systemic therapy and practice in Ireland committed to making psychotherapy services available and accessible to all.  Personally Speaking is a commercial organisation while the Clanwilliam Institute is a registered charity.</p><p> In some ways I may have gone into more personal detail than committee members were expecting.  However, as I move to describe the challenges, opportunities and priorities of the hospital over the next period my hope is that this detail will help give the members of the committee the context to better understand why the Minister may have sought to appoint someone with direct industry experience of guiding an organisation through periods of extreme growth and organisational change, someone who can demonstrate an entrepreneurial attitude to the opportunities such change presents while recognising the value of, and delivering mutual success through, strategic business partnerships, someone who can lead businesses which essentially succeed or fail depending on their ability to attract and retain high-quality top-tier staff as well as someone with specific and significant experience of good hospital governance, including the importance of demonstrable effectiveness of the quality, safety and timeliness of the services delivered and the need for robust financial, corporate and clinical risk management.</p><p> With this in mind I will set out what I believe to be the guiding principles of my term as chairman of St. James's Hospital.  Fundamentally, I see my role as chairman to be no different to that of every other member of staff in the hospital, that is, to serve our patients and our community.  The board of the hospital must ensure that we see the patient or community at the heart of every strategic decision we make.  As chairman I will endeavour to build on the success and scale of St. James's Hospital and its many attributes, including its reputation for delivering safe and effective care.  A major hospital is in many ways an ecosystem.  There are many inter-connections and interdependencies which only become apparent when they are examined in detail.  I will not try to fix what is not broken.</p><p> St. James's Hospital must continue to attract and retain the best staff.  In health the quality of our care is dependent on the quality of our staff.  Health care is a people industry and the best are attracted to work with the best.  It is a virtuous circle.</p><p> I believe strongly in the integration of service delivery, research and education.  During my time on the Coombe hospital board I had the great fortune and privilege to serve alongside Dr. James Clinch.  He used to frequently refer to the three-legged stool.  Through Dr. Clinch's passion I have become convinced that the patients and community benefit directly from there being strength in each leg of the stool.</p><p> My background is in one of Ireland's most innovative industries.  My colleagues in St. James's Hospital will know that their chairman and board strongly support innovation and change to improve services.  Innovation and change must be constant if quality is to be maintained.  I will work with the hospital executive leadership to ensure that the culture of the hospital and its partners encourages novel ideas, rewards success and recognises that to succeed an organisation must cherish all attempts at innovation, including those that provide more of a learning opportunity than a success.</p><p> While I am clearly excited to take on this position at one of Ireland's health care success stories, the organisation's future still retains a number of challenges as well as opportunities.  First, there are significant challenges in providing highly specialist national services while, at the same time, meeting the secondary care needs of an aging and frequently deprived local community.</p><p> Second, the new national children's hospital is a critical national project and the successful development and integration of the hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus will be a complex and challenging process.  I am mindful and aware of the fact that St. James's Hospital is one of Ireland's clearer success stories of hospital integration and I believe it has the corporate memory to deliver on this vision.  Over the span of my career I have become convinced of the key role that information and communications technology investment plays as a key element underpinning successful integration on this scale.  A future with adult, children's and maternity care all available on the St. James's Hospital campus offers the unique potential of a care pathway capable of delivering whole-of-life care led from a single campus.</p><p> Third, and with more of a focus on opportunity, I will take a moment to discuss scale.  Today, St. James's Hospital is already an organisation of scale.  With the establishment of the new national children's hospital on campus this will become even more apparent.  With such scale comes opportunities to take an all-island shared approach to the provision of highly specialist services, such as the treatment of rare diseases, including rare cancers, where critical mass is key to best outcomes.  Such scale provides a platform to strengthen our partnerships with existing partners, such as our academic partner, Trinity College, Dublin, as well as to forge important new partnerships with commercial and philanthropic organisations.</p><p> It is important for the committee to understand some context within which this appointment will be made.  First, I mentioned earlier that this was an exciting time for the hospital.  I wish to draw the committee's attention to the fact that in addition to appointing a new chairman to the hospital board, the hospital is also appointing a new chief executive, Lorcan Birthistle.  Mr. Birthistle is a highly-experienced acute hospital chief executive with an excellent track record in the leadership and management of complex organisational change.  He will take up his post at the end of this month and I am looking forward to a close working relationship with him.</p><p> Second, today St. James's Hospital is already an exceptionally well-run hospital.  There is a strong senior management team in place with an enviable track record.  They are managing an organisation as it delivers safe timely care to a high-quality standard.  Along the way they are also acting robustly to mitigate the complex financial, corporate and clinical risks that exist in every health care environment.</p><p> St. James's Hospital is fortunate that over the years it has built a well-aligned highly committed team at all levels.  Every day, staff at St. James's Hospital display a can-do attitude and look to go the extra mile for the hospital and its patients.  I am looking forward to playing my small part in its future.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention during my presentation and I am happy to take any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

In respect of St James's Hospital, of course, the community is an all-island community.  I have had personal direct experience of St. James's Hospital although I am not domiciled within its immediate catchment.</p> <p>  The signalled development of the new national paediatric hospital at St James's Hospital is of course a very exciting project.  However, there remains, unfortunately, some body of opinion not reconciled to its selection.</p><p>While I am mindful of some of the views expressed, my view, having witnessed the demise of the project to develop the national children's hospital at the Mater hospital, is that we need to proceed with all speed to have the best international standard of care provided for children who will present at the new facility.  Members have met the development board, if it can be so described, and I have no doubt we will have a discourse on the project.  We join St. James's Hospital in looking forward to its realisation.  </p><p> Mr. Donnelly did not refer to the signalled intention to have a co-located maternity facility within the footprint of St. James's Hospital.  Does he wish to comment on that issue?  Co-location is extremely important.  A number of the maternity services have been earmarked for relocation or association with other major hospitals in the city.  </p><p> Mr. Donnelly was previously involved with the board of the Coombe hospital.  Will the Coombe hospital be linked to St. James's Hospital?  I am not certain if that is the case and perhaps Mr. Donnelly will indicate what knowledge he has in this regard. </p><p> Mr. Donnelly correctly described St. James's Hospital as a centre of excellence, which many people, including me, will confirm from personal experience.  I wish him well and hope his role in the years ahead will be personally satisfying.  I also hope he and his colleagues on the board of the hospital will work together and with all other opinion to ensure the delivery of what will be an exciting national project.  I hope, on this occasion, it will be delivered within the scheduled timeframe.  </p></speech>

His curriculum vitae is highly impressive and indicates he has been involved in health matters for approximately 12 years.  He has been involved in the Coombe hospital and appears to have garnered the expertise required to assume the role of chair of St. James's Hospital.  I have a global question for him.  What does he envisage will be the role of St. James's Hospital at the end of his first term as chair?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.2419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061100002#U00300"><p>I apologise for missing the beginning of Mr. Donnelly's presentation.  I wish him the very best in his new role.  My first oncology job was in St. James's Hospital many years ago and I have a large well of warm and sentimental good feeling about the institution.  It is, in the Irish context, a wonderful hospital.  While things in Ireland are not great by international standards, the hospital certainly punches above its weight and is a great place.</p> <p>  Mr. Donnelly has left a world of fairly rational and understandable forces in international business and is about to engage in a world in which the forces are less rational and the consequences of actions less predictable.  Moreover, there are not necessarily positive incentives in place for good behaviours on the part of the hospital.  For example, if it does things right and increases efficiency, it may well find itself having its funding reduced.</p> <p>  I hope that, as he steps forward into this job, Mr. Donnelly will turn his thoughts to an issue which has been close to my heart for 22 years and about which I am increasingly despondent.  I refer to the need for fundamental reform of the health system.  While I do not intend to personalise this issue, I work in an institution in which the board structure has not worked well.  We have seen considerable evidence of this recently.  The true stakeholders in the system need to become engaged again with the people who choose and run the board of an institution.  Having an absentee landlord mode for hospital boards, such as that in place in many hospitals where people no longer involved in the running of the hospital choose the entire board, is not a rational system.  The model in place in St. James's Hospital has worked better. </p> <p>  It is my dream that St. James's Hospital will some day be taken over lock, stock and barrel by Trinity College to become the TCD medical centre.  We have never got our heads around this type of model, which works extraordinarily well for major academic medical centres around the world.  I once hoped that at one stage my medical school, University College Dublin, would take a similar view towards its two large constituent hospitals, the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, by, as it were, liberating these hospitals from their current ownership and redirecting them to become the types of leading academic centres they should become.  We are not good at this in the health system.</p> <p>  I once stated, only half-sarcastically, that one sometimes gets the impression that the people who planned the Irish health system studied all the other international models of success and decided to do exactly the opposite.  If Mr. Donnelly has not done so already, I suggest he examine the five or ten largest and most successful medical systems in the world to see how their board structures work.  The place in which I was most involved in the United States, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was an entirely private, not-for-profit institution which was based on an ideal, namely, to cure cancer.  People served on the board for this reason and because they wanted to be part of the war on cancer.  In some cases, their lives had been touched by cancer, while in others they were co-opted because they brought expertise.  Many great donors were also appointed to the board.  It is necessary to examine alternative board models.  I would be interested in having a chat with Mr. Donnelly in a year's time to discuss his experience in the intervening period.  </p> <p>  Mr. Donnelly failed to mention that St. James's Hospital has been an ambitious institution which has sought to become bigger and better.  It aggressively campaigned to become the designated location for the national children's hospital and was ultimately successful in this regard.  I admire and respect it for that.  My position in the debate on the location of the national children's hospital continues to be that it was nearly impossible to obtain an medical opinion on the location of the hospital that was not, in some sense, biased by institutional loyalty on the part of the person making the statement.  I do not propose to debate the issue again.</p> <p>  At the time, I argued that we should all support locating the hospital at one site and that once a site had been chosen, we should all shut up and get on with it.  This is exactly the point we have reached with the national children's hospital.  The debates are over and it is time to get on with building the darn thing, rather than condemning children to additional years of substandard accommodation when their care is being delivered.  </p> <p>  This is not a loaded question but is being the chairman of the board of an institution such as St. James's Hospital a full-time job or will Mr. Donnelly pursue other jobs at the same time?  Is it a full-time vocation?  I do not understand how this works.  </p></speech>

His curriculum vitae is highly impressive.  I congratulate him on his achievements to date and wish him well in his new role.</p> <p>  I will raise two issues of great relevance to the health service.  Mr. Donnelly has acquired considerable experience in technology, an area in which health service has not been heavily involved.  I understand, for example, that 1,700 computer systems are in operation in the health service.  Since 1994 or thereabouts, the Danish health system has been trying to consolidate its information technology systems and has reduced the number it operates to 20, with a view to further reducing it to five.  In fairness to St. James's Hospital, it is reasonably advanced in terms of information technology.  Will St. James's Hospital be able to work with the Health Service Executive to try to provide a single system for the entire health service?</p><p>It would provide efficiencies across the board.</p><p> A major issue that we are addressing is that of litigation involving hospitals.  In a number of presentations made to the committee, there was a great deal of criticism about how claims were dealt with once they were lodged.  How will this situation in the medical profession change in the coming years?  This is a question of taking responsibility earlier than on the steps of the courthouse.  Regardless of how good a service St. James's Hospital provides, mistakes will be made and there will be claims.  That is the real world, but despite the fact that our approach to them has not changed in the past 25 or 30 years, the level of claims continues to increase.</p><p> These two issues are important and we need major changes in respect of them in the next five years.</p></speech>

I was going to welcome him to Dublin 8 but I do not need to do that because, as we all know, he has been involved with the Coombe hospital for a long time.</p> <p>  Mr. Donnelly is going to the St. James's Hospital's campus at an exciting and challenging time.  As someone who does not live far from it, I have always been intrigued by the comings and goings of the people there and the talents that they have brought.  There is no end of talent in the CV that Mr. Donnelly mentioned.  I stated "challenging time" because, as a local public representative, I can hear the rumblings in the camps about the new national children's hospital.  We should be standing on every rooftop and singing about how wonderful it is to have the national children's hospital in the Dublin 8 area.  It will not only enhance the campus, but also the wider community.  In the long term, local people will be able to work there, as many already do at St. James's Hospital.  I hope that Mr. Donnelly, as chairman of the board, will be able to enthuse and get as much information out there about the new hospital as is possible.</p> <p>  We are coming to a tricky time.  I listened with great interest when Senator Crown stated that we finally had a site and needed to get behind it to get the job done.  However, there are rumblings on the ground among residents.  We understand their concerns, which I hope can be dealt with carefully.  It is important for the complex's future, and particularly that of the national children's hospital, that there is someone like Mr. Donnelly within the campus who has a wide range of experience, including in business.</p> <p>  I hope that we will not have to climb every mountain to get the children's hospital over the line when it enters the planning process in July.  It is an opportunity to have expertise and state-of-the-art facilities and to avoid shifting children who are ill from one end of the country to another.  I am looking forward to it.  This committee visited the site.  Anyone to whom I have spoken about the new hospital or St. James's Hospital, including my family, had nothing but the height of praise for both.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Donnelly the best and hope that our paths will cross again, if not at committee level, then in our efforts over the coming year to get the hospital completed.</p></speech>

He asked about how much of a full-time job this role was.  That puts a context on my answers to all of the other questions, so I might take it first, if the Chairman does not mind.  This role is an unpaid, non-executive position.  It is far from a full-time role within the health service.  I have explored it and discussed it with my family.  I have the capacity and the time to deliver a non-executive commitment to the organisation.</p> <p>  Deputy Healy had what I hope was a slip of the tongue when he asked about-----</p></speech>

To step back for a moment, my background is in the software industry.  One can spend a great deal of time building software products and getting everything perfectly right, but by the time one has done that, whatever market one sought to address has gone.  I echo the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Senator Crown and Deputy Byrne in that we must shut up, get going - all of the terms that were used today - and move on with it.  There comes a time after we have made a choice to do that.  We cannot procrastinate.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about maternity services.  A maternity services review is under way.  To my knowledge, and I hope that I am not paraphrasing inappropriately or incorrectly, there is an assumption that some form of maternity services will move to or be established on the St. James's Hospital campus.  I believe that the review is considering what form that will take.  I do not want to prejudge it.  On the assumption that there will be maternity services on site in some form, it will provide us a unique opportunity to have a whole-of-life model of care and care pathway for our patients.  This provides interesting and major opportunities in terms of service delivery as well as education and research, for example, long-lived studies that are led from one campus and that our patients go through to various stages in their lives.</p> <p>  There is a link between the Coombe hospital and St. James's Hospital in that they share consultant posts.  It is through feet on the ground and other such bonds that the organisations are brought together.  It is great that the boards can talk and have a good relationship but it is when there are shared consultant posts, people working in both organisations and patients transferring from one to the other, which is a common practice, that linkages are really established.</p> <p>  Moving on from the referenced "first term" to where I see the situation at the end of the term, I would love to have successfully established and integrated the children's hospital.  Senator Crown referred to the organisation's ambition.  It might be overly ambitious to say, "to have successfully embedded maternity services also", without leaving a hostage to fortune.  I am allowed to have an ambitious vision.  I am also allowed to not achieve it all.  I would like to see both of these projects established.  They give scale.  There are a great deal of secondary benefits, for example, opportunities to establish linkages with philanthropic and commercial organisations that could be of great benefit to the patients and community and that, on a global scale, do not have the resources and cycles to deal with small local organisations but can support larger ones.</p><p>It gives us an opportunity to form a different scale of partnership which would be quite useful.  </p><p> Senator Crown raised several questions around the philosophy of board structure and the rationality of the organisation versus my position.  I am not leaving the rational world as he would describe it.  I hope to form a bridge between his version of the rational world and the irrational.  I know from the 12 years with the Coombe hospital that they are slightly different worlds and that there are differences between the two.  There are also commonalities between the two.  In particular, through the presence of board members with commercial experience and ongoing commercial experience not just in St. James's Hospital and the Coombe hospital but in other organisations, the opportunity to bring ideas from one world, as Senator Crown would say, to the other is growing and getting stronger.  Senator Crown referred to his personal experience in the United States working in successful academic medical centres.  There are already several group linkages of which with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is a key member.  One is Trinity Health Ireland which encompasses the academic teaching hospitals associated with Trinity College, Dublin, namely, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the Coombe hospital and Tallaght hospital.  There is also the wider group which is the Dublin Midlands Hospitals Group which encompasses those organisations together with Tullamore, Laois and Naas hospitals.  These are new groupages which are finding their feet.  It is not a bad time to have this philosophical debate but maybe not at the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital board level but at the group level.</p><p> To address Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s questions, I am acutely aware of the systems situation.  There are positives and negatives to having one unified system.  If one builds everything into one unit, it becomes hard to effect change and move it.  I concur with the Senator that the health service needs to get a grip on its use of modern technology.  Some work is already happening around that.  I am encouraged there is a central enterprise resource planning system in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital which is the same calibre of software which is used in most substantial organisations in Ireland and worldwide.  I am in the fortunate position to be entering a role in an organisation which is better prepared than many of the organisations to which he referred.</p><p> He also raised the valid point about the ability of the broader health service to deal with mistakes.  There were some good quotes in today&rsquo;s newspapers from a family who suffered a similar journey to what he described.  The father made some spot-on comments.  Mistakes happen everywhere in the world but when they happen in the health care system, they have grave consequences potentially for patients and their families.  There is some understanding that mistakes potentially happen.  The process that happens afterwards can be the most dispiriting for those who have suffered as a result of an error or an unfortunate happenstance.  I would welcome a review of how we deal with that in the health service.  It is unfortunate that we have a liability-mitigation culture in many ways.  Many of the clinicians who display those tendencies, unfortunately do so on management and legal advice.  It would be great to have a system where there could be more transparency without exposing the organisation to potential liabilities.  Unfortunately, in my small part of the world, I am not sure I will be able to single-handedly address this.  However, these are well-placed sentiments which I support entirely.</p><p> I hope Deputy Catherine Byrne does not mind me describing her comments as a reflection of local rumblings.  As she correctly pointed out, there is a division between positives and negatives felt there.  To be honest, it is a division between the perception of potential positives and potential negatives.  When there is change on any scale, there is always a little bit of apprehension.  This is an issue for us all as individuals.  It becomes more amplified in groups.  If we have a common concern and we talk about it, it becomes a bigger issue.  Over the course of this development, as things become more concrete and  more real, the people&rsquo;s apprehensions, and perhaps unfortunately their optimism about the upside, come closer to the centre.  As I said to Senator Colm Burke about the claims liability issue, I probably cannot do an awful lot about that. However, in this very specific case, I can do a lot about it.  What I can do is encourage the organisation to be transparent and open.  As we are transparent and open, we give a better understanding of what the opportunities will be for the local community and what impacts there are going to be.  Inevitably, there are going to be impacts.  As we take a national institution into our community, we have great sense of pride about that.  The pride is also centred around the fact we are doing our bit for the nation.  There will be a sense of that in the community.  The one thing I can do is to encourage the institution to be open and transparent.</p></speech>
