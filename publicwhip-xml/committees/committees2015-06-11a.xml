Can I ask members and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  I would like to welcome everyone to the 32nd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with key figures from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Liam O'Reilly, former CEO of the Financial Regulator.  Liam O'Reilly was assistant director general of the Central Bank of Ireland from 1998 and had been responsible for all of the Central Bank's financial supervision functions.  He was appointed interim chief executive at the Financial Regulator in November 2002, the chief executive in may 2003 until he retired in January 2006.</p> <p>  Mr O'Reilly, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning and before we commence proceedings I wish to advise you that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.</p><p>You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p> Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

First of all, I'd like to talk about principles-based regulation.  The approach of the Financial Regulator was that of a principles-based regime.  Such a regime was also the standard approach throughout Europe and was in line with the Basel capital requirements.  The approach was well known and enunciated by the Financial Regulator, and by Government, and publicly accepted.  It was the centrepiece of strategy of the Financial Regulator from the beginning.  The policy laid a heavy responsibility on the boards and senior managements of banks.  It demanded of them that they had high standards of corporate governance, a clear business risk policy, and risk controls in place to monitor and control that risk.  Resources in the Financial Regulator were based on that premise.  The Financial Regulator's main focus at the time was on determining the quality of corporate governance, including risk controls, within the bank.  An important aspect of corporate governance regime was that non-executive directors had a controlling role in the audit committee and remuneration committee.  The regime required direct reporting lines between both the internal auditor and external auditors to the board audit committees.</p><p>The Financial Regulator asserted its influence by requiring a financial institution to take remedial action as a result of findings of inspections or as a result of other issues that came to light or in some other way.  For example, issues might arise in the course of a review meeting with the bank during themed inspections, by a bank itself reporting a problem or by information supplied by the external auditor, the internal auditor or members of staff.  There was a view that taking over-aggressive action might cause reputational damage to a banking institution, with possible consequent contagion effects.  In general, the foregoing measures were seen as appropriate at the time.  The approach then adopted by the Financial Regulator in line with our principles-based approach was to expect a board would implement the necessary changes and in an expeditious manner.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that this system did not work.  More robust and intrusive measures should have been taken.  </p><p> At the time, the Financial Regulator was of the view that enforcement action would be more effective if there were in place a set of legally based codes and if administrative sanctions were applied for breaches of such codes.  The appropriate legislation for administrative sanctions was enacted in 2004.  The use of such sanctions was viewed as a more effective and lower key way of keeping non-compliant institutions in line.  The system of codes was well developed in the consumer area and where a set of consumer codes were being finalised in 2005, towards the end of my tenure.  Administrative sanctions would apply to breaches of the codes.  A sanction could range from an official caution to monetary penalties or a disqualification of a service provider.   In the prudential area, it was planned that sanctions would be imposed on institutions in the event of breaches of corporate governance codes and other codes.  Updated requirements were being developed in relation to being a fit and proper person to hold a senior position in a credit institution.  Directors' compliance statements were also being developed.  These were to be implemented following an extensive consultative period. </p><p> Resources in the Financial Regulator devoted to regulation were determined by the principles-based approach which was not as intrusive as the present system.  The idea was that the internal audit departments, risk committees and external auditors were to be leveraged to fulfil the role of the Financial Regulator.  The Irish principles-based system was endorsed by the IMF FSAP report published in 2006.  That report provided a favourable conclusion as to the adequacy and effectiveness of this system.  However, it is now internationally recognised that the principles-based regulatory system was flawed.  It failed, not only in Ireland, but worldwide.  As a result, regulatory systems are now more intrusive and aggressive.  Greater responsibility is being taken by financial regulators to ensure that adequate systems are in place to measure and mitigate risks.  The Basel II initiatives have also been completely revised to ensure that capital is adequate to cover for adverse and unforeseen circumstances.</p><p> The interrelationship between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator: it was clearly set out in a memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator that macro-prudential stability was the primary role of the Central Bank and micro-financial stability, i.e. the soundness of individual institutions, was the role of the financial regulators. Both of these parties were determined to make this system work.  This was our mandate under the law.   One of the most important elements for its success was to ensure that there was adequate information exchange.  To achieve this, the following mechanisms were in place: the CBFSAI board, chaired by the Governor, consisted of six Financial Regulator board members and five other board members.  The secretary of the Department of Finance was on the board.</p><p>All board papers of the Financial Regulator were circulated to senior management in the Central Bank and board minutes would have been made available to board members.  A paper entitled, &quot;Financial Regulator update&quot;, which reported on the activities of the Financial Regulator, was an item on the agenda of the monthly meetings of the CBFSAI board.  All pertinent areas of concern of the Financial Regulator were communicated orally to the board and board minutes on these items were recorded.  The offices of the Governor, the director general of the Central Bank, the CEO of the Financial Regulator and the prudential director were physically in close proximity to each other and day-to-day concerns would have been discussed as a matter of course.  The channels of communication were always kept open.  If any significant action was being contemplated, be it against a given bank or banks generally, such matters would have been brought to the attention of the Central Bank before implementation.<br/><br/>The effect of EMU on financial regulation: after the establishment of EMU, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the banking system operated in an environment characterised by a strong exchange rate and low inflation, low interest rates.  Cheap credit was available to the banking system from Europe.  The control of credit growth, through changes in domestic interest rates, was no longer possible.  Because credit was cheap, there was an over-reliance on short-term lending from the EMU interbank market.  Customer deposits is usually the more stable source of liquidity as a proportion of balance sheets continued to contract.  Increasing reliance was being placed on large, commercial depositors which, by their nature, would have been more mobile.  EMU was formed without the provision of mechanisms for measuring and controlling risks, arising from aggregate euro credit flows, in terms of their destination and-or a concentration in certain sectors.  Therefore, the inherent risk of a financial stability problem on a pan-European basis, due to the build up of credit risk in certain sectors or countries, was neither being monitored nor controlled.  This was a fundamental flaw of the EMU system at its inception.  It was thought that individual countries could look after their own regulatory affairs and markets would do the rest.  This flaw has now been rectified.  Without the use of the interest rate tool, Ireland depended on euro interest rates changing favourably, changes in fiscal policy and moral suasion to rectify the situation over time.  By way of a macro-prudential policy instrument to replace interest rates, two options had been mentioned in the Honohan report and in evidence to this committee: change general capital requirements to reflect the increase in risk and the application of sectoral limits on a mandatory basis.  Subsequent to my departure, increases in capital requirements were applied to high loan-to-value mortgages and speculative property development in May 2006 and January 2007 respectively.  However, in terms of their effectiveness, to quote from the Honohan report, &quot;The measures were in reality also rather modest in their likely [effect].&quot;<br/><br/>Concerns about credit growth: the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator regularly voiced concerns in its publications, quarterly bulletins, annual reports, financial stability reports, about credit growth and the increase in personal indebtedness, particularly in property.  Concerns about commercial property lending were also voiced.  The following are two examples of public statements made by the Financial Regulator.  On 29 July 2005, the Financial Regulator warned about 100% mortgages, saying that they had to be appropriate to each borrower.  Clearly such mortgages were not appropriate to first-time buyers.  At the time, 100% mortgages were a very low proportion of mortgages provided.  A warning also was given on 26 July 2005 in the Financial Regulator's press statement at the launch of its reports ... of its report for the period 2003-2004:<blockquote>There is an increasing debate about the rapid growth in credit in the economy and I want to address this area as a matter that could cause concern in the future.  Along with the Central Bank, we are concerned about the rapid rise in the level of indebtedness in the economy and are well aware that if conditions changed adversely, many people could be severely affected. ... It is the responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that their credit standards, provisioning policies and levels of capital are appropriate to provide not only for today but in the event of a future downturn in the market. ... In short, institutions should only advance loans where they are confident [that their customers are ... have an] ability to repay.  They have the responsibility to inform their customers about the risks they are taking on borrowing large amounts of money and that they retain some flexibility to cope with changes in their personal circumstances like unemployment and higher interest rates.</blockquote></p><p>It is important to emphasise that, in making that statement, the Financial Regulator had no evidence that conditions might deteriorate to such a level that the banking system would succumb to a traumatic shock of the magnitude that occurred in 2008.</p><p> The following were the factors which provided comfort.  There were demographic and other structural reasons for the need for increased activity in the construction sector and the increase in the level of credit necessary.  However, a view emerged that property was becoming overvalued and there was a need for correction.  At the time of my departure, that correction appeared to be in train.  Fiscal policy was moving in the right direction - through the removal of incentives in the building industry - interest rates in Europe were set to rise and house prices were stabilising.  The regulator had no serious or imminent concerns about the solvency of any particular financial institution.  As the IMF Article IV report emphasised, Irish banks had sufficient buffers of capital to meet any shock that faced the system.  Annual stress tests reinforced this view.  Moreover, the general consensus in the market was that the Irish banking system was well capitalised and the Irish economy was healthy and growing.</p><p> General conclusions.  In hindsight, the principles-based approach to regulation had major shortcomings.  The Financial Regulator can no longer place the same degree of trust which it previously did in the boards and senior management of banks.  In future, the Financial Regulator must adopt a more intrusive and aggressive approach.  Moreover, the regulatory system did not appreciate the full extent of the credit exposures.  I deeply regret that these failures in the system were not recognised during my tenure in office.</p></speech>

And I ... Mr. O'Reilly, you're welcome.  I echo the Chairman's welcome for ... to you earlier.  In a general question, you mentioned in your papers that you studied in Queen's in Kingston, Ontario.  The World Economic Forum has rated Canada's banking system the soundest in the world seven years in a row.  And, I think, in 2009 we were ranked 121 out of 123 countries - i.e., at the awful end of the scale.  Did you pick up anything in your Canadian studies of economics that would help you in seeing what the difference between the two rankings is?</p></speech>

So, I wasn't conscious at that time.  All I can say is that I would say that the ranking in Ireland plummeted from what it was in 2006 to where it was in 2009 as a result of the crisis.</p></speech>

You can imagine what sort of, if you like, frenzy there would have been around that period.  My ... my interaction with them during the time when I was in a regulatory position, I didn't ... I didn't notice any difference there at that time.  There were issues that were arising, like the Ansbacher issues, like ICI in 1986, like the Rusnak issue.  And these sort of issues, I think, had a wake-up call for most of the institutions.  In ... AIB, for instance, would have been one of those.

And I know that there were discussions about worries that if the Central Bank functions of lender of last resort, of money market operations, of providing liquidity ... if there was a separation between that and actual day-to-day regulation, it could have caused disruption problems in the event of the institutions being separated.</p></speech>

I think it was 32, I think, in 2000.  It had increased to, I think, 45 in the ... in 2005.  The principles-based approach was not one that was new to the Financial Regulator.  It was ... it was actually one that was continued on from the Central Bank culture, I would have thought.  And not alone that, but this was an approach that was being taken in all countries and the Basel accord and Basel requirements were setting out that that was the way that things were moving.</p><p>Indeed, the Basel II arrangements were going to be giving more autonomy to banks in determining how much capital they should hold by ... by stating that if you have your proper models in there, maybe you can reduce your capital.

There were corporate governance issues early on, and those corporate governance issues we felt had been resolved by the appointment of a new chairman and two new directors, and as well as that, a chief operating officer.  And, unfortunately, within a year - the beginning of 2003 I think it was - the chief operating officer didn't, didn't stay.  He gave his ... his reasons at the time as he had personality differences.  Also, which we were aware at the time there were continuing corporate governance issues.  I suppose, the ... matters came to a head for us in early 2004, with the arrival of a management letter from the auditors of the institution, and concerns that we had as regulators at the time.  As a result of that, we instituted a detailed investigation of that institution and we hired a firm of auditors to do that job.  As a result of that, a set of proposals came from that institution, and the institution was required to carry out certain tasks.  As well as that, I have been hearing in the inquiry here that there have been no sanctions.</p><p>In that case, a sanction was applied to that institution and during the following year, we had two sets of audit firms within that trying to rectify the problem.  And at the end of my tenure, I thought that progress had been made.  Quite obviously, in hindsight, it wasn't enough.</p></speech>

An example I've seen in the inquiry is the one of the night of the guarantees, where there was a worry that if any question was raised about any bank, it could have huge effects on the whole system.  It was that sort of attitude that was around, to a certain extent.  That's why we felt we would be better with an administrative sanctions system and I can talk a little bit later about that.

Another example, by the way, of actions that we took, were in the case of the AIB overcharging and other issues.  We've also forced institutions to carry out their own inquiries and pay for them themselves on our ... and we would have specified the jobs.

These limits ... we were in what was called the market paradigm period, where it was better to apply a price rather than to be trying to apply quantitative limits that can easily be got around, and I think the Honohan report did mention the fact that these sectoral limits could be too easily got around.

As I said earlier, from the point of view of organisational structure, there were six Financial Regulator board members on the board of the CBFSAI.  So, there was an immediate crossover.  A second one was that there was a financial stability committee and I, as the CEO, was a member of the financial stability committee.  If there were weaknesses, I think that they were at an organisational level and I think that Professor Honohan mentions in his report that the ... there seems to have been a cultural issue generally.  And he didn't just single out the Central Bank of Ireland, he said it seemed to be a culture in every central bank that economists and accountants find it very difficult to talk to each other in the same language.</p><p>And I think if there was a lack, I think there should have been a financial stability unit, if you like, permanently attached to the banking department.  I ... I ... when ... in my time ... appointed an economist as a deputy manager in the banking department for that very reason.  But I think we needed much more organised structures and much more communication about issues so that if there was a recognised ... a recognition, in some sense or the other, of the issues that were arising as a result of the growth of credit, on one side, on an aggregate basis and then, on the other side, the individual banks, if that had been put together more, I think we would have been in a better position at the end of the day.</p></speech>

Well, there were two.  Really, the way it was applied in the end was capital requirements were ... were required.  And it seemed to be too little too late.  And I know that - I might as well mention it now - that in on the 15th ... or some time in August 2005, Con Horan came to, well through Pat Horan ... Pat Neary, came to me with a suggestion on this.  And I brought the idea to the director general of the Central Bank and the reasons for not applying it at that stage were that at that stage house prices were stabilising, interest rates were set to rise and property prices were stabilising.  So ... but, generally, it ... they were brought again very quickly after that and they were applied.  But, as Professor Honohan says, they were not ... they were not effective.  And I suppose, just on a theoretical basis, the biggest problem was ... and I think capital ratios were the way to go - increasing capital ratios or capital requirements.  The question was: what was the precise relationship between a 1% or an X% in the capital ratio and how it would effect credit?  And I don't think enough work had been done on that relationship.  And there would've been a danger, unless that work was done, that it would've ... it would've been either too easy or even ground the system to a halt.  And there was a question of how that should be done and that comes back to my point that, I think, if there had been a unit in between of economists and accountants and maybe call them financial accountants ... financial economists ... if that had of been there, it would have been useful.  As a matter of fact, the Larosi&egrave;re report says that the word "macro-prudential policy" didn't seem to enter the English language in any real way until after the crisis.</p></speech>

I must say, the best set of proposals and the best way of dealing with it was the use of administrative sanctions.  And the administrative sanctions - I heard Mr. Horan's evidence on that ... the administrative sanctions system had been ... the actual law and the infrastructure had been built.  I was the head of a project team in 2004 which was dealing with this.  And in the case of the banking department, there is a document - and I think you have it in your ... in your store of documents provided by the Central Bank - there was a whole list of legislation that could have been turned into the codes.  Now, I've been told that the reason it wasn't been done was there wasn't enough resources to do it.  I think that was a pity.</p></speech>

And this is a meeting in April 2004, you were in your job 12 months:<blockquote><br /><br />X reported under Financial Stability Matters on recent discussions at the boards of ... CBFSAI and IFSRA.  He suggested that the CBFSAI had not convinced market participants that there may be &quot;systemic risk&quot; building up in the banking sector.</blockquote>Do you recall that meeting?</p></speech>

And I just felt that there was a need to get out there and to try and get people to listen.  The major outcome of that was the forum of people that we got together every year, the executives of the banks and the economists in those banks.  And as the Honohan report says, there seems to be a kind of a different memory emerging as to what was being said, as to what was being heard but I remember saying at that meeting that if, somewhat like I said in public in 2005, "if a shock hits this system are you ready for that shock, have you adequate capital for it?".  And given the growth in credit and the growth in corporate credit at that stage even I think it was, that was in 2004.</p></speech>

Did this matter come up subsequently to April 2004, that there was a concern about systemic risk between both boards, between the joint meeting?</p></speech>

Minutes of the meeting of the IFSRA regulatory authority 2003 to 2004.<blockquote><br /><br />Supervision agreed at the November ['03] meeting to put in place a ... Task Force to address [the issue] of corporate governance and commercial lending that had arisen following [the discussion] with former executives of an institution.  The results of this Task Force have not been seen.  [And it follows on that in] December 2004 meeting that work had now been completed on putting in place appropriate reporting of consolidated large exposures in another large bank.</blockquote>One of the criticisms that is ... that has come from some of the bankers was that, while they were aware of their exposure to individuals, the only people with the consolidated data with the authority to request the information on the large exposures of individuals across the banks and could have seen that multiple banks were exposed for multiple hundreds of millions, were yourselves.</p></speech>

I think it wasn't until 2007 that these issues began to be recognised and again I think it comes down to this whole idea of compartmentalisation, if you like, of work - where on the one side, you have economists working on aggregate data and on the other side, you have regulators dealing with individual banks.  There should have been something in the middle where there was a team working on the aggregate position and how it evolved.

I think that the major, the major change would have been a more intrusive form of regulation with more resources to carry out that intrusive regulation.  I think all the ... and I think I heard Cyril Roux talk about this yesterday, or maybe it was Mary O'Dea, you can have a lot of ... of sanctions, but the first thing to do is you have to have the information on which to base the sanctions.  But second of all, I think that the administrative sanctions should have been put in at a much earlier date for prudential supervision.  So, they would have been two things, and then the third thing would have been a much closer relationship between economists and financial regulators, sitting together, in a technical team, all the time watching how aggregate positions were evolving and how the aggregate risk was being recognised.</p></speech>

There was an issue that we ... we did always insist that the only way that we could promote the idea of the financial services centre was that we were operating a stringent regulatory system that applied to all.  And I insisted there that people went out, that's the only way we could promote it.</p></speech>

I think "constructive ambiguity" is a term used by central banks and it relates to the fact that if you are a lender of last resort, you don't want to be saying to banks, "We'll look after you in the end", because if you say that, then banks will behave as if they are going to get the money and take the risks as a result of it.  So constructive ambiguity, as far as I'm concerned, is about the ambiguity to ensure that you're not promising anything so don't depend on us to bail you out.</p></speech>

I just want to ask a question here because I noticed you mentioned the FX trading scandal or the overcharging in AIB, which was exposed to the public by very valuable reporting done by RTE in 2004.  There has been evidence given to other committees in this House.  I'm not sure ... I don't think you have ever been before them but given you're here under oath, was there ever a suggestion made to you in 2001 in a meeting and, in 2002, in a meeting, as has been suggested by an internal auditor of AIB, that there was an overcharging issue in terms of exchange in AIB going on at that time?</p></speech>

I am reluctant to get into this, but, you know,  in terms of my take on the situation was that I knew nothing about any overcharging issue that occurred and was uncovered in the investigation in 2004.</p></speech>

It says a whistleblower informed the Financial Regulator in, I think, it was May 2004.  The question I want to ask you just particularly is: did a whistleblower or an internal auditor from AIB make you aware of issues in terms of overcharging in this form in 2011 and 2012?  Because that is testimony that is out there in the public domain and I just want you to answer that if you can.</p></speech>

Can I ask you: was it appropriate that the domestic financial institutions were regulated in the same manner as the international institutions?  I know this was touched on earlier.  In your view, were the regulatory institutions of the State focused on non-labelling of the IFSC as an offshore haven instead of ensuring the domestic banks were regulated in a sufficiently robust manner to mitigate against financial stability risks arising from the domestic sector?</p></speech>

I suppose that question has two parts.  One is the consumer area and building up a whole consumer infrastructure and, certainly, it took us a while to build up that structure.  In the case of insurance, we felt that it needed to be increased as well.  In the case of banking supervision, certainly, what was happening was that the staff were ... were ... needed to be very specialised and, as a result of that, it was very, very difficult to continue to maintain the level of specialised staff.  It's a constant battle to keep good people on board.  In terms of numbers, I can say that, in 2000, the number of people in banking supervision was 32, I think; in 2005, it was 46.  Was it enough?  That kind of begs the question of was the regulatory regime a success?  It would have been enough if principles-based regulation was a success.  It wasn't a success; it was a failure.  We needed more resources to do the job that eventually we recognised that needed to be done.  Just to say finally that it was a constant battle to actually get specialised staff.  I remember we'd just got an expert in Basel II in.  He worked in the Bank of England and he was gone within a year to another bank.  Competition was very, very tight to get specialised staff and to retain them.  So to answer your question: did we ever have enough staff?  I would say it was a constant struggle</p></speech>

Perhaps we could have ... we could have put in more people of the economist persuasion within this central unit that I'm talking about.  That would have helped a lot.  But with a principles-based regulatory regime, the kind of staff that the regulator is looking for today, like people drilling down into loan books, etc., we didn't have them at the time and it wasn't seen to be needed because we were using this system.</p></speech>

I tried to, at times, moot the idea ... and we did it, at times, get seconded people from the ... from the ... from the private sector, from the banking sector.  There were issues of secrecy, etc., but we seemed to get over them.  And if we needed extra staff at the end of the day - and we did - we did employ firms of accountants to do special tasks for us, like in the case of the AIB investigation and in the case of other investigations that we carried out.</p></speech>

I ... the Governor never refused staff.  The way the matter operated was that staff requirements were set by the authority, and our budget was approved by the Minister.  That's the way that worked.

You're very welcome, Mr. O'Reilly.  Can I start by asking you, in relation to the banking crisis, and I suppose the fact it happened is the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of the use of supervisory powers, but, in your view, essentially what went wrong and who was responsible, given the fact that banking supervision from 2003 to 2008 failed to prevent an unprecedented systemic crisis?  What do you believe are the essential factors that led to that crisis, and what went wrong?</p></speech>

So, I would say that that certainly didn't help in getting a sense of readiness or a feeling of danger around the place, okay.  That's the first thing I'd say.  The second thing I think I could say is that the system itself was not ... was not conducive to digging down into ... into detail enough.  So the principles-based system didn't work.

I think it's the way you implement it, and the dependence that you place on the internal auditors and the external auditors of institutions, the risk committees of institutions.  No longer can you trust those, and if you have to do the job then, the resources is the issue and, certainly, the way we had set up our system we didn't have enough resources.  If we had had enough resources and, and applied ... I think whether it's principles-based or not, it's more about intrusive, aggressive, or, if you like, depending on boards too much.  So, I think, principles-based plus intrusive, aggressive plus resources, I would agree-----</p></speech>

They were developed during 2005 and the first codes were being introduced towards the of end of 2005 in relation to consumer codes.  What I'm saying is, there should've been a parallel attack on the prudential codes.  And, I suppose, one of the central ones that I was very disappointed never happened was the corporate governance codes, which I think would've been the centre of getting to grips with things.</p></speech>

Why did you not embark on more stringent intervention in light of this?</p></speech>

There were some micro issues and I think I've talked about them.  But I think that the major issue was that before EMU, if credit started rising, the Central Bank would've increased interest rates.  It wasn't there anymore.  And there was this whole quandary as to what can you do if you don't have the major instrument to quell credit.  And I think it took awhile to actually realise that what was needed was what's called macro-prudential supervision, which was what instruments do you use now to quell credit and credit growth.  And we've talked about these capital ratios, sectoral limits, etc., and I think that the whole process of developing that and making sure you had the quantitative work done behind it, so that when you had an instrument, in certain ... for instance, in terms of interest rates, there would've been models that said if you increase interest rates by X, that's the effect on credit; if you increase capital ratios by Y, what is going to be the effect on credit?  And there was a need for that sort of work to be done.</p></speech>

I was conscious of the fact that there was a need for sanctions and there was a need for sanctions to be applied quickly.  Now I don't know what constraints Mr. Neary was put under but certainly there seemed to have been some sort of putting on the long finger of doing consumer legislation before prudential.  But, if I had been there ... but it's very easy to second guess at this stage, hindsight, but I would've hoped that I would've been pushing for the implementation of administrative sanctions for prudential supervision.</p></speech>

You can't go down to, let's say, ploughing championships and start talking about these things, like you can with consumers.  So I would have said that, and the way I interpreted it, was that we needed to start communicating directly with chairmen and chief executives of institutions, and the ultimate piece that emerged ... and remember I was saying this to the financial stability committee, and they then had to work out some sort of strategy, and the major strategy that arose out of that was that we meet the banks, the chief ... the big executives in banks in the forum that we had, and the first one took place at the end of 2004, so that we could communicate our concerns.</p></speech>

And in that same year, and I'll take one bank that's come up in evidence, Bank of Ireland, they have changed their income multiples, they've changed their loan-to-value policies, they've introduced First Start mortgages, and they've introduced more flexibility for seasoned multi-property borrowers.  So they've done that in 2004.  And at the end of 2004, you're warning them about this problem building.  And then in 2005, they turn around and introduce 100% mortgages in response to moves by key competitors, First Active, Ulster Bank and PTSB.</p></speech>

And I said that the banks must make sure that the ... that the ... that there is an ability to pay, etc., etc.  So we were concerned, we were continued to be concerned.  I suppose the big problem all the time is: what instruments were we using to put a stop to this?  And, even in 2007, there seemed to be an awful lot of soul searching as to what could be done.  And moral suasion and capital ratios ... or capital requirements were the two things that were being mentioned, and they had little effect.</p></speech>

And we got a reply from the Bank of Ireland in February 2004 saying that they were complying with all policies.  And we entered into some discussions with them about that, and eventually the management letter from PwC came in saying that they were quite happy with all their lending policies.  So we were still cynical.  We were still trying to convince banks.  There is still a question, and I agree with you: what instrument should we have been using?  Eventually the instrument that was used was to increase the capital requirements in relation to the 100% loan-to-mortgage, and to commercial lending.  That would be 2006.</p></speech>

Thank you very much Mr. O'Reilly.   I just want to deal with a couple of matters there and one is in relation to loan-deposit ratios.  The targets now are in and around 120% and lower.  Why was this not a target during the 2002 - 2008 period, when it reached as high as 176% in Bank of Ireland and you think the level of loan-deposit ratios in the various institutions was appropriate during your tenure?</p></speech>

And I seem to remember around that time there were measures being taken by the ... by the regulator, and I think they came into fruition eventually to have a whole new regime of liquidity management, which seemed to hold the banks in well ... good stead during that period.  The problem, I suppose, was that again the market paradigm seemed to be working whereby if you could get cheap credit, you should use that cheap credit.  The question of exposures, I suppose, was far from the mind because in some sense there didn't seem to be a consciousness at all that credit markets could freeze up, and all of a sudden, you're in trouble, and I think that that was a problem.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. O'Reilly.  For the purpose of an internal review, I'm going to document Vol. 3 page 40, which is effectively, it's a Section 33AK document, but it's ... it's in the aspect, really, of the internal view of the first crisis simulation exercise in 2005 that in a crisis scenario there is a limit in the type of information that can be provided by a principles-based regulator.  Can you comment on this and how was this reflected in the next exercise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#X01700"><p>Well, that was my last exercise, so I can't say what happened in the next one.  But, the idea behind it was that a principles-based regulator, with the level of staff that they had, wouldn't be able to cope with the demands that there would be around at the time of a crisis.  And as a result of that there was a need to make sure that there were contingency plans in place to either get experts in, like, for instance, Merrill Lynch, or PwC, to make sure that we had people on stand-by, to be able to sit in banks who might be in trouble, and be there at the time of the crisis.  And I think that that was the fundamental idea behind saying that you need more in the time of crisis in terms of staff.</p></speech>

I forget the name of the document but it was a policy document about good regulation and one of them was you cut ... over-regulation was not a thing we should be doing.  And it was in that context ... and it would have been generally in the context of what would be principles-based regulation.  Now, would I ... would I do that now?  Should I have done it?

I suppose, what I really want in the context ... you received an internal memo in August 2005 where ... effectively during your tenure, where there was ... you could have had a very modest increase in the capital requirements for new high loan-to-value mortgages.  Now, this wasn't implemented until 1 May 2006.  So the question I'm asking is two questions: under principle-based regulation, what was to stop you - with your officers - going into the banks, looking at the process by which loans were granted?  Not the process ... so ... to look at the type of securities they had and so forth.  And furthermore, why didn't you implement this particular proposal during your tenure because it took nearly eight or nine months before it happened?</p></speech>

I discussed it with the director general of the Central Bank and, after the discussion, the general conclusion was that at that stage house prices were stabilising, interest rates were set to rise and the fiscal incentives that were in ... and which were actually inflating house prices, were all being reduced.  So, it just was a timing issue.  If you're asking me now, should we have done it earlier - yes.  But, as the Honohan report says, the actual measure was modest in its effect.  It really did have no effect on what happened afterwards, it didn't control the situation.</p></speech>

The major control was ... if you were saying "Were the management of bank controlling the situation?", I would say no because what we said was that the non-executive directors had a direct line to the internal auditors, we had a direct line to the non-executive audit committee and we ... and ... the internal auditors had a direct reporting line.  So, what ... that was a kind of a control in place.  It wasn't enough because, at the end of the day, it looks like non-executive directors, to a certain extent, were being led by management too much.  There was a need for much more intrusive regulation.</p></speech>

And the Central Bank were ... and that was the biggest bone of contention.  But there were some contrarians and we did have very robust discussions and we came to a consensus in the end.  But the contrarians were listened to and ... reflected, to a large extent, I would have thought, in the financial stability reports.  The problem, I suppose, was that the consensus was balancing risks, etc., that things were going to lead a soft landing whereas maybe certain contrarians were saying "Well, you know, you may say that but this could end in disaster".  But, certainly, the contrarians would not have been a majority or anywhere near a majority on the board.</p></speech>

I know that this wasn't during your time but not only ... that seems to me to be beyond, if you like, the Central Bank, that was asking another institution to change.

And this would have been in the early 2000s.  It wouldn't have been during the Financial Regulator.  It was that the Central Bank could not lend to an insolvent institution.  So, therefore, if there was to be a saving of an insolvent institution, the Government had to be involved.  So, I certainly felt at that stage, we need to get the Department of Finance involved in this process as quickly as possible.  That ... that's the only one now in terms of crisis.  Otherwise, we would have been talking about progress in legislation.  For instance, there was an issue once about the building societies Act and this thing about, you know, demutualisation of building societies and there was an anxiety to see that that progressed.  The administrative sanctions legislation, we would have been up there trying to get it passed as quickly as possible.  And even in the case of the 2003 bill, I remember being involved with the Department of Finance just talking about it.  So general business issues to do with the progress of legislation, I think, more than anything else.  Of course, as well as that, when our budgets started to go to the Department of Finance, we would have had an interaction with them then.  But just to emphasise on that side, there was never an issue about, you know, cutting budgets or anything like that.  It was more about how are we going to fund this?  Should we get it off from the industry first or should we divide it between public or private funding?  But these were the type of issues that we would have been talking about.</p></speech>

Just to say, in terms of ethos, what I found generally, when there was ... when there was a problem. it wasn't a problem ... there were some culture problems, no doubt about that.  And, for instance, in the case of, let's say, the Ruznak affair and the overcharging affair, there was an examination of conscience again and there was a new corporate governance structure put in place.  But generally, we found in institutions there was a very strong willingness to comply.  The compliance problems didn't occur generally as a result of misbehaviour by senior executives.  There were always problems within banks because someone did something wrong, either because it was a mistake or in the case of ... well, in the case of the tax issue, I think that that was a big issue and I remember saying at the time that if someone was to have found to have evaded tax, they were not to be made a fit and proper person for banking.</p></speech>

These were all filled in.  Then they were interviewed and it was in that process it was decided whether a person was a fit and proper person to become a director.  And those criteria were being updated.  There was a major weakness in the system and that was: what about follow-up reviews?  And I'm afraid ... and I think it's there now today, but once you became a director you know, how do you ... it's a bit like when you get in to a job, it's much easier to remove a person before they come in than when you have them in there.</p></speech>

There is clearly a limit to the extent that borrowers can sustain rates of credit growth that are substantially above nominal increases.

In the case of most group treasury and asset financing operations, the Regulator has disapplied its powers of supervision.</blockquote>I'll repeat, &quot;...the Regulator has disapplied its powers of supervision.&quot;  Can you throw any light on what that means?</p></speech>

I am going to reference some documents and they are actually up in front of you in a moment.  This is from Vol. 3 and it is page 40.  What we have here is an aggregate summary, it's in relation to the financial stability report of 2004 and it's the very end of the page there Mr. O'Reilly, where it says &quot;A number of risks to financial stability were highlighted in the report ... Irish banks growth rate 4 times that of the European average ... Irish banks accessing substantial funding from non-Irish sources ... continued increase in house prices [and] tax policy in favour of home ownership.&quot;  Just moving on further, there is a summary of the actual final stability report of 2004 and that moves to page 45 of the same document.  I just want to bring your attention to the end of col. 1, which is the heading, &quot;Household Sector&quot;.  Bear in mind this is for 2004, again during your tenure.  The &quot;Private-sector indebtedness, measured as the value of debt to gross domestic product ... has increased substantially since the mid-1990s and it is now at historically high levels&quot;.  Moving down then to what would the third paragraph on the second column it says:<blockquote><br /><br />First-time house buyers are now more heavily indebted by comparison with their peers in the early and mid-1990s.  Consequently, the repayment burdens of first-time buyers have not fallen with the decline [of] variable mortgage interest rates, which are now at historically low levels, as households are opting [I maybe question the word &quot;opting&quot; here] for higher mortgage debt ... income ratios, higher loan-to-value ratios and/or longer maturity loans.</blockquote>In layperson's language, this meant that the traditional way of buying a house over 20 years with three to four times one's income was now being pushed out in every conceivable way, 100% mortgages, loan-to-value ratios, the maturity levels over 35 years.  This is all happening under your watch and it is happening in 2004.  Can you give us an explanation as to how the standard, whatever about the standard banking model that was being referred to, I think by Deputy Higgins, and yourself earlier, where banks existed for 100 years.  In a very short period of time, peoples' ability to buy a home had been completely refigured into a new model, all at additional cost.  Even though interest rates now were historically low, it was still costing more to buy a house.  Can you explain to us why that happened during your tenure?</p></speech>

And that was a worry that was being expressed there, that people wouldn't be able to afford houses.  The situation had developed, there's no doubt about it, and it's a question of how it developed.  I think that maybe we should not forget the incentive systems that were being provided for to buying the houses, as well as the easy availability of credit.  But I would also say that there was a competition going on between financial institutions, this is in hindsight, which was totally inappropriate for the time.</p></speech>

But really there was a product here being put out, that was a series of products, that if you were giving warnings to the consumer there did not seem to be any particular action and I'll maybe get further clarity on you.  At an institutional level, what were you doing to the institutions to go in to deal with exactly the type of problems you are talking about now?</p></speech>

The risk weight was increased, which was a disincentive.</p><p>But, you know, in all honesty, moral suasion was the major instrument and it was ineffective and I can't say any more than that.

At our session this afternoon, we will hear from Mr. Brian Patterson, former chairman, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Mr. Brian Patterson was interim chairperson ... or, chairman of the IFSRA from November 2002 to April 2003.  He became chairman of the Financial Regulator in May 2003, a position he held until April 2008.  He was also a member of the board of the CBFSAI from May 2003 to April 2008.  Mr. Patterson, you're very welcome before the committee this afternoon.  </p><p>And before hearing from you, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In particular, there are ... or, sorry, in addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information that they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and that they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.

Thank you, Chairman.<br/><br/>In April 2002, I was asked to become the non-executive chairman of the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which we know as IFSRA, by the Minister for Finance, and with involvement also of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The authority was formally constituted in 2003 and I remained chairman until my term expired in April 2008.  Because it may come up later, Chairman, I should mention that as from October 2007, I was dealing with a serious illness.  As chairman of IFSRA, I was also, <i>ex officio</i>, a non-executive member of the board of the Central Bank.<br/><br/>In 2004, instead of the more cumbersome title Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, it was decided to adopt in everyday usage the simpler term, &quot;Financial Regulator&quot;, to mean the whole organisation, and that is the meaning I shall use here.  In this statement, I'll also use the term &quot;authority&quot; to mean the board of the Financial Regulator and &quot;executive&quot; to mean the CEO and his staff.  I'll also refer to the board of the Central Bank.  <br/><br/>My job was to manage the authority, that is, the board, and to ensure that its non-executive group of independent, senior people worked well together and worked effectively with the executive in developing and approving policies, strategies, plans and initiatives.  The executive&rsquo;s job was to manage the organisation and to report to the authority on the ongoing work of regulation.  <br/><br/>The first line of defence against a bank&rsquo;s failure and the responsibility for protecting its safety and soundness lies squarely with the bank itself - its board, its management, its risk committee, its compliance officer; the second line of defence is the bank&rsquo;s auditors; the third line of defence, at that time, was the Financial Regulator, responsible for the prudential regulation of individual banks; and the fourth line of defence was the Central Bank, which retained responsibility for systemic financial stability.  In the banking crisis which befell us here in Ireland, all of these defences failed for complex and interrelated reasons. <br/><br/>As well as setting up a completely new organisation, the Financial Regulator achieved much in developing its consumer protection mandate, in implementing very complex EU directives, as well as regulating insurance, credit unions and the many other areas under its supervision.  However, it clearly failed in its duty to uphold the safety and soundness of Irish banks.  As chairman of the authority, I accept responsibility for my part in that failure.  It's something I regret deeply.  Had I known then what I know now, things could have been very different.The authority and the executive of the Financial Regulator took their responsibilities very seriously.  They were diligent, hard working and, at all times, acted in good faith.  Contrarian opinions were encouraged.  So why did things go so wrong?  That is the question on which I'll try to shed some light, and to do so without in any way seeking to evade my responsibility.  I'll outline a number of reasons that, in my view, led to the ultimate failure of banking regulation.  I'll describe these briefly under two main headings - structure and practice. <br/><br/>Let me first deal with structure.  The interim regulatory authority was set up in 2002 following a long debate which followed the McDowell report about how it might best be structured.  The main issues were: one, which financial services should be brought into its remit; two, whether a new structure would be independent of, or be part of, the Central Bank; and, three, whether it should focus on consumer protection alone or be combined with prudential regulation.  The impetus for an integrated and separate regulator to cover the whole of the financial services industry came from a number of sources.  One, following the radical deregulation of financial services under Presidents Reagan and Bush in the US during the 1980s followed by the &quot;Big Bang&quot; deregulation of 1986 in the UK, financial services had become more deregulated, more complex and were converging across traditional sector boundaries, which, in Ireland, and for historical reasons, had been regulated by separate entities reporting to different Government Departments.  No. 2, it was believed that banks and other financial services were mis-selling to their customers and that stronger emphasis need now to be placed on consumer protection.  Three, the DIRT inquiry and a number of other matters in the 1990s had raised persistent questions as to how effective the Central Bank was in supervising the banks.  So it was believed that a more independent structure with a substantial focus on consumer protection was required.  However, there were strongly competing views as to how this should be done.  Following a lengthy debate, the structure that resulted was a complicated compromise.</p><p>The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority<b></b>would have responsibility for both consumer protection and the supervision of individual financial services providers, including over 50 banking entities plus 30 EU banks operating on a &quot;passport&quot; basis into Ireland, two building societies, 180 insurance companies, 3,400 funds, 4,000 intermediaries, as well as re-insurance companies, stockbrokers and the Stock Exchange, bureaux de change, licensed moneylenders and 430 credit unions who were vocally opposed to the new regulatory arrangements.  The organisation, with supervisory responsibility for over 8,000 different entities, had a lot on its plate. Of its approximately 350 staff, around 45 were initially allocated to banking supervision.<br/><br/>The authority reported to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Finance.  It had a degree of independence, but, at the same time, operated within the overall framework of the Central Bank in what was to be known as the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland<b>, </b>CBFSAI.  The Central Bank and its Governor retained responsibility for financial stability and had powers to direct the authority in that regard; it remained the &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; under EU directives; it was the sole point of contact with the ECB.  <br/><br/>The web of accountability's was, to say the least, complicated.  Some observers described the new structures as unwieldy and unworkable.  However, early on, the Governor and I decided to try our best to make them work.  I should say at this point that the Governor and I had a good, professional relationship all the time through my tenure as chairman. In the initial stages, the challenge was to begin implementing the legislation, which at that point was still a Bill, and to build an entirely new organisation with staff who were then working in a number of different organisations and Government Departments.  The regulator inherited most of its staff from the Central Bank and so also inherited, and was effectively constrained by, the Central Bank&rsquo;s HR policies, systems, and culture, a culture which, in my view, was generally hierarchical, deferential, cautious, and secretive.  Accommodation and the critically important services of HR and IT systems were provided by the Central Bank.  The bank was not a strong performer in either of these areas and this did slow down our banking regulators in coping with change, of which there was a lot in the period, and in developing their crucial data analytics capacity. <br/><br/>The Financial Regulator was given formal legal status in 2003, although its sanctioning regime was not in place until nearly two years later, and its ... the new legislative framework for banking supervision, under Basel II, was not in place until 2006.  The authority had its own board of ten members, six of whom also sat on the board of the Central Bank, including myself as chairman and the CEO.  None of the authority - the board - had any experience in regulating banks.  There was some initial training for authority members in prudential regulation and financial stability.  In hindsight, there was not enough. <br/><br/>At the time, those outside the regulator often saw prudential regulation as being in opposition to consumer protection.  There was little or no acceptance that prudential regulation was, and is, in fact, the ultimate in consumer protection for depositors, for shareholders and, as we now know, for taxpayers. Some consumer groups even criticised the amount of resources the authority was then committing to prudential regulation, in so far as it used resources which, in their view, could have been better deployed to consumer protection.  Through all of this time, looking back, there&rsquo;s a theme of taking prudential regulation for granted. <br/><br/>As an example of this mindset, the legislation laid down that the consumer director was to be a statutory, <i>ex officio</i>member of the authority; surprisingly, the prudential director was not.  Early on we recognised this deficiency and we wrote to the Minister to put it on record that even though not written into law, we would treat the prudential director as if he were a full member of the authority, in the sense that he attended and participated in all meetings and received all board papers.  The Minister agreed.<br/><br/>The priority given to consumer protection was exacerbated in those early years by a number of high profile consumer issues, for example, foreign exchange overcharging, which absorbed much time and energy of both the executive and the new authority.  Many of the interactions with senior bankers on these issues were extremely robust.  During one heated discussion in my presence, the CEO of a large bank threw a bunch of keys across the table to our CEO and asked him if he wanted to run the expletive bank. <br/><br/>Part of the CBFSAI mandate was to develop the financial services sector, although not at the expense of safety, soundness and stability &ndash; a responsibility more recently removed in the 2010 Act.  While the regulator legally had no similar responsibility, it was widely believed that its remit included supporting the development of the industry.  Hence there was an effort to ensure that rules and regulatory practice did not have a disproportionate impact on the operation and development of the financial services sector, particularly in relation to the IFSC.  Following a fact finding visit to the US in early 2007, the CEO and I came to the view that the authority did not have sufficient visibility of what was happening in international financial markets and, in particular, in the US. On return, I suggested appointing an international adviser to the authority.  This idea, unfortunately, did not find enough support in the board of the Central Bank or of the authority and, in April 2007, I was forced to drop it.  Again with hindsight, an international adviser might have alerted us to the risks in the US financial markets at that time and how these would come in time to impact the Irish banking system. <br/><br/>Let me turn to the powers of the regulator.  There is some misunderstanding about the limits of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s powers in relation to the banks.  One, first, it had no powers, <i>per se</i>, of approval or disapproval over the banks&rsquo; products like 100% mortgages.  The regulatory framework was not designed around prohibiting products, but around imposing additional capital charges on more risky products.  Second, while it did regulate full subsidiaries of foreign banks in Ireland, it had no powers of prudential regulation over EU banks &quot;passporting&quot; as branches into Ireland, and which were regulated by their home supervisor.  The authority was very conscious that if, for example, the capital requirements on Irish banks were pushed too high, foreign banks which were already, or could move beyond our supervisory reach by switching from subsidiary to branch could have gained advantage over their Irish competitors.  This was particularly the case with some aggressive UK banks, attracted to the Irish market by increased margins.  Trying to regulate these foreign banks through their home supervisor was futile; the role of the ECB in supervision was, at the time, very weak, as was transnational co-operation between banking regulators. <br/><br/>The McDowell report had recommended that the regulator be given powers of administrative sanction so that it could challenge the banks more effectively, although most countries in Europe did not use sanctions as a core part of their prudential banking supervision.  However, the power to impose sanctions on the industry took a long time to materialise.  The legislation was not enacted until August 2004, and by the time statutory instruments and staff training were complete, sanctions were not available to the authority until late 2005, more than two years after vesting.  This lag in giving the regulator powers of sanction may have weakened the new organisation in the eyes of powerful, and dare I say, in the case of a few increasingly arrogant banks.  When eventually enacted, the legislation gave the authority powers to sanction without having to access the courts.  Internally, there were real concerns about legal and possible constitutional challenge.  If, in the early stages, the authority&rsquo;s sanctioning powers were to be struck down by the courts, it would have far-reaching consequences, and these concerns fed into a Central Bank culture which had already had in-built cautiousness and hesitancy.<br/><br/>Resourcing levels in banking supervision, as you've heard, were derived from the principles-based approach.  It's worth noting that in the new, post-crash regulatory regime, a more intrusive, inspection-based approach required a 170% increase in staff resources.  As you have heard, resources at the time were under considerable pressure.  As well as carrying out ongoing supervision, they had, at the same time ,to implement a raft of complex EU directives, particularly Basel II.  Management in banking supervision did seek some increase in resources but there was a perceived need to keep a lid on costs and the procedure for getting approval for additional staff was extremely complicated.  Even when approval was obtained, the filling of posts was constrained by, first, the inability to attract enough external candidates at the right level and, second, by the capability of the Central Bank&rsquo;s recruitment function.</p><p>In relation to the first of these points, the regulator was constrained by the pay scales and HR policies of the Central Bank and its long-standing conformity to terms and conditions of the Civil Service.  And there were three consequences of this: number one, it was virtually impossible to offer competitive market conditions and to bring in, particularly at a senior level, expertise from outside, especially from the highly paid financial services industry.  For example, on the basis of figures which are in the public domain, the authority would never have been in a position at that time to recruit a Matthew Elderfield.  Number two, performance management systems and practices were very weak and number three, the organisation culture was formal and slow.  The authority was obliged to take its IT and systems development from the Central Bank.  Because of problems in this unit, it was a constant source of frustration and inefficiency to the whole organisation and to banking supervision in particular.<br/><br/>In summarising this part about structure, it's clear with hindsight that the Financial Regulator, as it was constituted, was not entirely fit for purpose.  A modern Financial Regulator needs a board with regulatory experience and skills.  It needs an enabling legal framework with strength to counter the naturally powerful influence of the banking sector.  It needs to be well resourced, to have a fast-moving capacity to develop its IT capability and to recruit expert staff.  It needs freedom of action and clarity in its legislative mandate that it's single-mindedly to prioritise the stability of the banking sector over other competing public policy goals.<br/><br/>Let me turn to regulation and practice.  As you've heard <i>ad nauseam</i>, principle-based prudential regulation was at the time perceived internationally as best practice.  It was the bedrock of EU banking supervision as enshrined in the Basel accords &ndash; to which the Irish Government was a signatory.  It had therefore to be embraced by the Central Bank and was inherited and continued by the new Financial Regulator.<br/><br/>In an era of deregulation and belief in free-market policies, principles-based regulation was based on the belief that one, the market should be allowed to operate freely; the regulator should not interfere in product design or pricing and had no powers to do so.  Two, responsible financial services providers were best placed to make decisions about their businesses and were required by government ... required to be governed by experienced managements and boards, backed up by risk committees, compliance officers and auditors.  Boards were required to comprise of persons who were &quot;fit and proper&quot; and who operated in a transparent and ethical way.  This would take, number four, place under regulatory oversight, with reporting, monitoring and risk-based inspections, backed up by strong enforcement.<br/><br/>As part of the EU push to develop the single internal market with a common regulatory framework, the Government had signed up to implement EU-wide, complex, data-rich, risk-based system of prudential regulation named Basel II<b>, </b>which was to complement the principles-based core principles of effective banking supervision<b>. </b>The regulator was required to adopt this system and to bring the Irish banks under its disciplines.  Implementation of Basel II, completed in 2006, fell to the Financial Regulator.  This work was extremely challenging, complex and detailed; it put a lot of strain on the Central Bank&rsquo;s systems development capacity.  Critically, it temporarily diverted a large number of banking supervisory staff from day-to-day supervision at a time when, as we now know, the seeds of the banking crisis were already germinating.  Ironically, the new Basel II framework did not prevent an EU-wide banking crisis and it was superseded in 2011 by a new accord, Basel III.<br/><br/>To strengthen its principles-based approach, in 2005 the authority set out to introduce a new fitness and probity regime for the directors of financial institutions.  There was, inevitably, strong challenge from the industry.  The authority sought legal advice, which was that constitutionally, no directors who were already appointed, could be reassessed and by implication potentially disqualified.  In other words, they were effectively grandfathered or grandmothered.  After the crash, the 2010 Act brought in extensive powers for the Central Bank to examine existing appointees &ndash; powers not available to the regulator before that time.<br/><br/>In a second move taken by the authority to strengthen its supervisory approach, in November 2004 the authority set out to use its discretionary powers under the Central Bank Acts to require compliance statements of directors in financial institutions.  The consequential consultation process ran into a barrage of resistance from the industry.  They deployed a range of arguments, including that this was inconsistent with the company law review group&rsquo;s report.  Following extensive lobbying and discussion, the Department of Finance wrote to the authority in November 2006 asking it not to proceed with the necessary consultation process, &ldquo;without first consulting the Department&rdquo; &ndash; a clear signal to us that this did not have Government support.  In retrospect, I believe we were mistaken not to have pressed ahead with this measure despite the extreme resistance that we faced.<br/><br/>Banking supervision collected data from the banks and carried out on-site inspections.  The principles-based approach focused on checking banks&rsquo; internal control systems and board minutes to assure the supervisors that their internal controls were operating.  Instead of, for example, random sampling of loan files to challenge bank managements' assertions, the inspection methodology left actual judgements of what was prudent to the banks' managements.  The dramatic rise in credit called for new information to be collected from the banks.  However, the Central Bank just did not have the IT change management capacity to specify that data need or to implement it quickly, while also implementing Basel II and doing everything else it was doing for the Central Bank and for the ECB.<br/><br/>Within an often crowded agenda, the CEO and the prudential director reported on their supervision responsibilities at the monthly authority meeting.  The prudential pack, which contained detailed data on an institution-by-institution basis, was a quarterly standing item on the authority&rsquo;s agenda and was discussed at length.  Solvency ratios of the banks under supervision were examined and were continually seen to be within the defined limits.  The pack included some details of major exposures of Irish banks including those to property developers.  These exposures were examined by the executive and were the subject of detailed discussion with the institutions themselves.  The executive assured the authority that all these loans had strong asset backing.  With the benefit of hindsight, the valuations on which this was based depended on some kind of soft landing.<br/><br/>Chairman, I've omitted the next sentence which was in my written statement as I realised after I had submitted it that it was not fully correct.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#HH00300"><p>The regulator had no powers to investigate the affairs of bank customers.  After the crash, it emerged, as we know, that some large developers had never been asked by their bank to provide a statement of affairs nor had the bank properly assessed their net worth.  In hindsight, the executive should examine ... should have examined this more closely and, if necessary, forced the banks to improve the standards of inquiry on which they based their lending decisions.  The prudential pack did not include micro-trend statistics which could've become the focus of discussion had they been present.  This reflected the view that the regulator was a micro-prudential supervisor only, with a mandate to ensure every individual bank had strong capital ratios, rather than to analyse if risk was building in the system as a whole.  <br/><br/>Much has been said on the subject of sector limits.  It is my understanding that the Central Bank had effectively relaxed these limits in the 1990s, prior to the setting up of the Financial Regulator, in order to encourage the development of the IFSC and in particular to facilitate the arrival of one large foreign bank which had a major sector exposure<i>.  </i>It was then felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same, a level playing field, in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an off-shore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks.  Furthermore, sector limits are notoriously difficult to define and so were used more as guidelines than rules.  And as banking supervision got closer to the full implementation of Basel II, it became less and less tenable to give any weight to sector limits, which were to be superseded by the Basel II approach.  Nevertheless, and again in hindsight, while sector exposure was monitored by the executive, we paid insufficient attention to this indicator.<br/><br/>The regulator paid close attention to the Central Bank&rsquo;s stress tests, which were largely carried out in the banks themselves under supervision of the Central Bank.  As presented to the authority, they indicated that even under their most pessimistic scenarios, for example, slowdown in economic growth, rise in unemployment, the banks were well capitalised and capable of withstanding any external threats.</p><p>However, in hindsight they did not factor in, number one: the degree of reliance on international wholesale funding which, as events were to prove, was highly volatile - the banks were borrowing short to lend long; two, the risk of a calamitous collapse in property prices and the consequent impact on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets; and, three, severe economic recession, which impaired the ability of borrowers to repay loans.  The authority took great comfort from the results of these stress tests.  Had they shown a risk to any bank&rsquo;s solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and action would surely have followed. </p><p> The annual financial stability report, as you have heard, was issued by the Central Bank in each of the years 2004 to 2007, inclusive.  The report was prepared by a joint Central Bank-Financial Regulator committee under the chairmanship of the then director general of the Central Bank.  The report was based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s economic analysis and most recent stress tests, plus input from staff in banking supervision.  Even though the magnitude of the risk was not properly understood, there was often disagreement in this committee about how strong the report should be in identifying risks to the banking system.  The report was finalised by the Governor and the board of the Central Bank.  As the clouds gathered, there were concerns that a strongly worded financial stability report could have resulted in the unintended consequence of causing the very collapse the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank were seeking to avoid.  However, the Governor had regular one-to-one meetings with the Minister and it was believed that he could be more direct in private than he could be in public.</p><p> The authority was also given a false sense of security by a series of external reports: number one, audit reports on the regulated banks, which did not raise any concerns about liquidity or solvency; number two, the 2006 IMF financial sector assessment programme report, which gave the banks and the Financial Regulator a glowing report; number three, the PwC 2007 report, which again concluded that the banks were in good health and able to weather any storm; and, number four, the IMF report of September 2007, which found that the banking system is "well capitalised, profitable and liquid, and non-performing loans are low".  Again, the authority took great comfort from these reports.  They seemed to confirm what the internal processes and reports were saying, that is, that the banks were well capitalised, and could withstand any downturn or external shocks.</p><p> To summarise this section on practice, the regulator was operating a system of principles-based regulation, which was internationally accepted as best practice at the time.  It was also embedded in the Basel II accord, a regulatory system to which the Irish Government was committed and which called for dramatic increases in data gathering from the banks.  Implementing Basel II challenged the Central Bank&rsquo;s IT capability and diverted banking supervision staff from normal duties.  None of the many internal processes or external reports that I have described raised serious red flags about the banks&rsquo; viability or pointed to any of the cataclysmic events that were to follow.  Had any of them shown a risk to the banks' solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and the authority would have been impelled to investigate and to take action.</p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, the Financial Regulator had an overly complex structure with an extremely broad mandate, which emphasised consumer protection as the main priority, with constrained powers and limited resources devoted to banking supervision.  The complex entanglements with the Central Bank also limited the regulator&rsquo;s effectiveness in a number of ways.  However, shortcomings in the structure do not alone explain why the system failed.  The regulator&rsquo;s processes and reports and the findings of external scrutineers, any of which should have raised red flags or sent warning signals, all failed to do so.  As a result, the authority simply did not see the enormity of the risks being taken by the banks themselves and the calamity that was to overwhelm them through the speed and severity of the crash.  Had we known then what we know now, we would, of course, have acted more strongly and used whatever powers were at our disposal with the forcefulness required to rein in the banks&rsquo; ending.  But we did not know then what we know now.  And so, as a key part of the defence against banking failure, the Financial Regulator failed in its responsibility to uphold the safety and soundness of the Irish banks.  As a former chairman of the authority, that is something I will for ever regret.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

The Financial Regulator was responsible for the supervision and regulation of the individual banks.  The Central Bank was responsible for overall systemic financial stability; quite clear, okay?  Because the two organisations had this very complex dividing line, I think, looking back on it, that what happened was some of the accountabilities fell between two stools.  Easier to see in hindsight, but at the time I guess we didn't realise this.  And the financial stability report, which was where all this was supposed to come together, didn't actually do the business.  And I think it was for this reason: were there concerns within the boards of the regulator and the Central Bank about the degree of bank lending and the risks they were taking?  Yes, there were.  There were concerns, and they were often voiced.</p></speech>

There was a lot of discussion, as inevitably there should be, and eventually a consensus emerged that in the case of Pat Neary, that he was the best person available to do the job.

In relation to performance assessment, the way this worked was that every year I had one-to-one meetings with members of the authority and I asked them what did they think of the performance of the executive and in particular the chief executive.  So I collected their views, added my own, obviously, and then I had a discussion with the chief executive of the day about his performance.</p></speech>

I ...  it took place in November of the year.  It was long after I had retired.  It was a one-off event.  I had never during my time, in ... as chairman, accepted private hospitality like that.  I had been at industry functions all right.  I&rsquo;d never accepted private hospitality from any of the financial services providers and nor would I have, even during my tenure, or around the time of my retirement.  This was seven months later and, therefore, for that reason, for myself, I was comfortable that that was okay to do, all right?  When I realised that the executives had also been invited, and they were still in office, I was less comfortable, although it did go ahead.  It had been ... incidentally, it had been organised some months before the guarantee, so it was in the diary for a long time.  Looking back on it, I ... it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate for the executives to be there and I think they&rsquo;ve said that in this committee and I regret that that happened.</p></speech>

Of course, they're important in banking supervision.  And with the benefit of hindsight, again we can see just how important they ... they were.  I said in my statement that my belief is that sector concentration limits were, in effect, relaxed in the 1990s in order to facilitate the development of the IFSC.  And I think that, sort of, became the conventional wisdom that sector limits were there all right and yes, they would be looked at and so on but they wouldn't be strongly policed.  And with the benefit of hindsight that ... that was wrong.  They should have been, and strong enforcement action should have been taken with the banks to bring that back into line.</p></speech>

I had a major operation.  I was expected to return to normal service in January but I developed secondaries and I had a year of chemotherapy, which included the dinner which was referred to.  At the time, I put in place ... there was no legal ... legal deputy chair position.  But I ensured when I was in hospital that my ... the man who eventually was my successor, Jim Farrell, that he chaired the authority meetings and was available to the executive at all time.  And then when I had the second round of it, I put in place that system again.  I went to the Minister in February of 2008 and said that I was not ... I didn't want to seek reappointment and he wasn't maybe going to reappointment me anyway, but I certainly didn't want to seek reappointment.  So I put him on notice that as of April, he had to have a new chairman.  Did I fulfil my duties?  Not 100%.  Absolutely, I was ... I was ... I wasn't firing on all cylinders.  But I believe that I put in place arrangements to make sure that the authority was in good hands.</p></speech>

The first is that in relation to governance, organisation development, leadership, human resources, consumer stuff, yes, I had a lot of experience in those kind of areas.  In relation to banking regulation and banking supervision, I had no experience.  And when I was being asked to become the chairman, I pointed that out to the Minister.  I was reassured at the time that consumer protection was going to be the majority of this job, and that prudential regulation was already in good hands through the executive and the Central Bank and that, therefore, I shouldn't worry too much about that.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  And that's what happened at the time.  You gave your reflections to the committee in relation to how a board should be constituted in terms of experience and skills based on hindsight, based on where you are today.

Listen, we'll move on from that.  I don't think it's the burning issue here.  One of the statutory objectives of the Central Bank is the promotion of the financial services industry in Ireland.  In your view, was their a conflict between the objectives of the Financial Regulator and the responsibility for prudential supervision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.988" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05600"><p>I think, in hindsight, there is ... there is some conflict, yes.  And I think where that comes home to roost would be in, for example, when we were considering the additional capital requirements that you heard about from Con Horan ... when we were considering that, one of the things that ... that would have weighed heavily with the authority and, I guess, with the executive and also with the Central Bank, because they had to sign off on those would have been that by placing additional capital requirements on the Irish banks, we were setting them at a competitive disadvantage with the foreign banks which were operating in Ireland on a passport basis, yes?  And in that sense, the responsibility to develop and to nurture the Irish financial services industry would have ... would have come into ... into people's consideration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05800"><p>I don't think that was the reason, Deputy.  I think ... I think that principles-based regulation was around a long time before that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.991" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#MM05900"><p>Well, maybe I'm not ... I'm not talking about principles-based, which obviously can be dubbed as right-touch ... light-touch regulation.  I'm talking about super light.  I'm talking about the fact that administrative sanctions, additional capital, which all happened within a principles-based regulation model.  But those didn't happen, as you outlined the reasons why some of them didn't happen.  Did that type of, kind of, super light regulation take place as a result of the impact that could take place as a result of the ... contrary to that could have an impact on the financial services centre?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.992" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#NN00100"><p>I don't see it like that.  I think they were, kind of, separate events.  Now, undoubtedly, a principles-based regulatory approach suited the foreign banks coming into the IFSC; I won't deny that.  But I don't think that was the genesis of principles-based regulation.  It was around for a long time before that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.993" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#NN00200"><p>Do you have a view in relation to whether there was a two-tier or a two-track type of regulation?  This was suggested earlier on by the previous witness, that in relation to, for example, I think, its administrative sanctions that there was ... or sorry it wasn't administrative sanctions, it was concentration levels, that there was a two-tier type of regulation, that the firms in the financial services centre weren't getting the letters in terms of breaching concentration levels?</p></speech>

I think both the executive and the authority set out to have a level playing pitch and that the guys in the IFSC and the Irish banks would be treated the same.  Whether it actually transpired like that, I can't say.</p></speech>

So we have seen, as committee members, evidence, for example, of letters to and fro, to and from banks, from the Financial Regulator, that talks about the concentration levels.</p></speech>

So are you telling us that that approach was also adopted with financial firms in the Irish Financial Services Centre, that banks who breached those limits were also being written to by the regulator?</p></speech>

In your view, did the Financial Regulator have sufficient staff to carry out its tasks in relation to consumer protection and the introduction of the IFRS capital directive and its other statutory roles?</p></speech>

There was a perceived need to keep a lid on costs, first of all, and there are reasons for that which I can go into if you wish ... perceived need to keep a lid on costs.  The process for getting approval for additional staff was quite convoluted and lengthy.  It had to go through a whole lot of filters so that by the time it came to the authority, it probably had been watered down quite a lot, and the authority's budget and remuneration committee would have interrogated the executive quite strongly on the need, as they should have done, on the need for additional staff.  The fact that we levied 50% of our costs on the industry was also a factor and industry watchdogs were forever waiting to pounce on us for increases in resources which would impact the size of the levy.  And then, to crown it all, even when approval had been given for extra staff, we were unable to recruit them and so the ... the members of the authority and the budget and remuneration committee were probably entitled to say, "Why are you looking for extra staff when you haven't even filled the posts that we gave you six months ago or a year ago?"</p></speech>

Not many people, if I recall, wrote anything about commercial property, and that was what caused the damage for Irish banks' profitability and caused them to require significant capital ... inflow injection from the State, not residential property.</blockquote>Do you concur with the view that it was commercial property not residential property that, ultimately, caused the banks to fail?</p></speech>

Indeed, he indicated that there may be a &quot;degree of euphoria building up in the property lending markets, and that the boards and managements of banks are being myopic about the potential risks.&quot;.</blockquote>That's in April 2004.

I don't think it was as specific as that.  I ... I think at that time my sense of it was that the economy was overheating and that this could have consequences.  I ... I do recall, at one of the joint board meetings, when the financial stability report was being discussed - and it may have been later than 2004, just to be clear - I remember saying something like that we didn't really understand why the economy ... all the variables that were at work in why the economy was growing as strongly as it was and why the housing market was growing as ... as strongly as it was and that, therefore, some confluence of events, I remember using these words, some confluence of events, which we could not foresee, might actually turn the whole thing on its head.</p></speech>

I'm gonna ... pressed for time so want to just move to this ... this area here.  Mr. Patterson, in 2006, Fitch placed the Irish banks on a lower rated category for macro-potential risks.  We know, from the evidence that was presented to Liam O'Reilly, that this was brought before the financial stability co-ordination committee in 2006.  The reference - for the secretariat - is in core book, LOR - Vol. 3, 42, but I'm not ... not going to go into quoting from it.  The report itself was covered in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 8 September 2006 and the newspaper reported that, according to Fitch, and I'm quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i>at the time, it says:<blockquote><br /><br />Ireland has a high-quality banking system, but also runs an above average risk of a systemic failure.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Fitch note[d] that private sector credit as a percentage of [...] GDP will reach 190% in 2006.  When this is taken together with the rapid growth in private credit, 21.7% according to the survey, Ireland falls into the &quot;MP[1]3&quot; category, which is Fitch's highest measure of the risk to economic stability.</blockquote>Was the response of the Financial Regulator, and the Central Bank ... what was the response of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank to this downgrade by Fitch?</p></speech>

I don't recall the specific downgrade or, indeed, that ... that report, but I ... I guess it's part of the ... the overall level of concern that, as I've said earlier, was building inside ... inside the two organisations, about risks and about systemic risk in particular.  The ... the problem in all of this is that there ... there wasn't sufficient alarm in either of the two organisations to impel better action.</p></speech>

Now, the purpose of the entity that was created in 2003 for better or for worse was to cover a whole load of areas and put structures in place where they would interface with one another.  So if you were not empowered at one end to deal with what you saw as a problem, you could talk to the other hand and say "do you have actions that you can take?" and we know from our engagement with Mr. Hurley that there was a series of measures that the Central Bank could have used.  The reasoning for maybe choosing not to use them is a different debate.  But even in the interest, the situation of 100% mortgages, okay you're telling us that you didn't have the powers at the time but did you turn round to anybody who did have the powers and say do something about this?</p></speech>

What I referred to in my statement is that the authority didn't have legal powers to approve or disapprove products <i>per se</i>, but that doesn't mean it didn't have other powers.  And as I think I've said, the regulator had powers to try and curb and could have curbed the issue of 100% mortgages.  Now why did it not do so?  It didn't do so because number one ... I think there are a couple of reasons, number one, because the approach at the time was not to...  what's the word I'm looking for...  to become involved in products but the two things that the authority could do would be to police through consumer protection how they were sold.  Were they being sold inappropriately to the wrong people?  Because for some people, 100% mortgages would be okay.  Not a majority but for some people they would be okay.  To police how they were sold and also if the authority felt that the loan book was becoming risky, more so than it should be, then to impose additional capital requirements, which ultimately was done.  So that was the approach and that seemed to be again in line with the famous principles-based regulation.</p></speech>

The whole of Europe sees that now and has changed the way they regulate and also particularly I think in the case of Ireland, it wasn't backed by sufficient intrusion because you can have rules and you can have principles and you can have different levels of intrusion with both.  We had principles-based regulation with not a lot of intrusion and that wasn't correct.</p></speech>

You did however highlight the fact that, you said training was provided for the board members.  In hindsight this was not enough.  Who was responsible for that and what did training consist of?</p></speech>

As the months and years went by, we often had special briefings by specialists within either the regulator or the Cental Bank on specific issues, like EU directives and things like that as well, outside the formal board meetings but with the benefit of hindsight it just wasn't enough.</p></speech>

Can I then also follow on, on to page 4 of your opening statement where you stated under the heading of &quot;Resourcing&quot;, the final two bullet points there, where you said that performance management systems and practices were very weak and organisation culture was formal and slow.  Can I ask what did you do as chairperson to try and change those two particular difficulties, which seem to be more of, on the face of it at least, a managerial difficulty rather than resourcing <i>per se</i>?</p></speech>

I then want to turn to another quote from your opening statement and I think ... seem to have lost what page it was on, but I'll read it to you.  You said that "The authority was very conscious that if [...] the capital requirements of Irish banks were pushed too high, foreign banks which could move beyond our supervisory reach could [...] have gained advantage over their Irish competitors."  Did you see your role, and the role of the regulator, therefore, as more protecting the interests of Irish banks, rather than regulating their operation?</p></speech>

And, yes, that was an issue and it often came up in discussion - both in the board and outside the board - as to how you reconcile those two things.  And, as I mentioned, I think in response to Deputy Doherty, that when it came to the capital requirements that were imposed in 2006, that was an issue, as to how far we could push it without seriously disadvantaging the Irish banks.</p></speech>

On page 1 of your presentation, you outlined a detailed, four line of defence structure against bank failure.

How did you come up with that construct?</p></speech>

It's in the bank's own interests, it's in the customers of the banks, the shareholders' interest, the taxpayers' interest, the whole society interest that those four lines of defence hold ... hold well.</p></speech>

So, what I'm trying to just nail this down, and then we'll go for coffee, was there a high-level discussion with regard to taking some sanctions at some level or other, at your level and across the board and we know that that didn't happen, so I just want to find out was it discussed and why was it not progressed out of that discussion, if there was a discussion?</p></speech>

I may ... I may have given the wrong impression here, Chairman, so forgive me if I did.  There were discussions about sanctions.  One particular bank, which I can't name, there were sanctions applied to them.  There were discussions about the capital requirements, obviously, which is a form of sanction, so yes, there were discussions about sanction.  I interpreted, I think it was Deputy Doherty's question, as to the extreme sanction and, I think, my answer was in relation to that; that there weren't, to my memory, discussions about the nuclear option or anything like that.</p></speech>

And yet our crash in the banking sector was 40% of GPD, a multiple times other countries'.  Can you explain how we were so much worse than other jurisdictions with the same principle-based regulation?</p></speech>

I think it's because our crash was systemic.  I mean, in the UK and other principles-based regulator, they had some spectacular banking crashes like RBS and Northern Rock, but they didn't bring down the whole banking system.  Because it's a bigger country, the banking institutions, presumably, are more broadly spread.  Ours was so concentrated and so intense, I think, that that accounts for the ... that unfortunate difference.</p></speech>

The banks were borrowing short to lend long.  And when the crash came, and I do believe that international factors played a part in stimulating that crash, that it ... it just ... it rolled through the whole system.</p></speech>

They used all kinds of arguments about setting the Irish banks with competitive disadvantage, "Here we go again", etc.  And having taken legal advice, my recollection is that the legal advice was that we would be unable to examine and potentially to disqualify existing directors; and this goes something, if I remember it, it was something to do with the constitutional protection to a right to earn a living, something like that.  And that, therefore, people already in ... in ... office, which is 99% of them, could not be brought into this new regime, and with that realisation, I think the regulator had to think again.  I do believe that later on a new regime was put in place.  Initially, it could only examine new appointees, but with the 2010 Act, as I understand it, they were able to go back and ... and question and reassess existing office holders.  That's the fitness and probity one.  The directors' compliance statements: again the regulator set out to use the powers under one of the Central Bank Acts to require directors of financial institutions to sign these compliance statements.  And the industry, and it wasn't just the industry, I think IBEC and other organisations were up in arms about this.</p><p>And the barrage of resistance that we got to those was very substantial and I was aware there was a lot of lobbying going on at Government level and ultimately, the Department of Finance, as I said in my statement, they wrote to the regulator and said we weren't to go ahead with the consultation because we were required to do consultation on all of these things.  We weren't to go ahead with the consultation without seeking their permission, if you like, first.  Now, what happened in that event was, that there was coming down the track, from left field, a consolidation of financial services legislation because there had been layers and layers and layers of legislation and it got very complicated and the Department had planned to consolidate all this into a couple of updated Acts and the decision was taken to try and address it again through that process.  Yes. </p></speech>

But, particularly, that they were fulfilling their duties to manage the bank in a prudent fashion.  That's what would have been in it.  I remember one ... the chairman of one large bank wrote a letter to me which was about materiality and he argued strongly that because there was no materiality clause in this, that if he hadn't bought his dog licence or something, you know, that he couldn't sign it, which I thought was a bit crazy but however.  But there was a lot of push-back.</p></speech>

Welcome Mr. Patterson.  The stress tests that you describe in section 2.6 on page 7 of your presentation here today.  You say the authority took great comfort from the results of the stress tests.  Who brought them to you?  Did a individual from the Central Bank bring them in to you?</p></speech>

There was a long discussion and I remember coming out of those meetings thinking "Wow, you know, it all looks okay".  And that would have been alongside other concerns that I would have had about some of the things that Senator D'Arcy spoke about, and here were the people who were intimately involved with the stress tests saying "We've looked at it this way, we've looked at it that way, we've turned all the dials up and the banks are still okay".</p></speech>

But I mean, your criticism of them today is incisive I think, in your statement today, what they left out.  So this was sort of a kind of a mumbo-jumbo that ... that was useless.</p></speech>

I think you've already answered that with my colleague Senator D'Arcy.  Whatever version we were applying, at a 40% of GDP fiscal adjustment costs to pay for banks, I mean nobody else was doing that except Iceland, and you mentioned Germany, so did we take ... and I would put forward Canada, which is in the World Economic Forum ratings of financial stability and banking stability - it has won it outright for the last seven years - but were no other models except what seemed like a wrong interpretation of ... in Ireland ... ever considered by your board?</p></speech>

I think the problem, with the benefit of hindsight, is that while we adopted the European approach to regulation through principles-based there are two other elements missing.  We weren't intrusive enough, because you can have principles-based regulation with a heavy intrusion, and we didn't, and also our enforcement action was too little too late.</p></speech>

I've lived most of my life in the private sector where those words wouldn't be used.  So I found it somewhat strange and I had to occasionally bite my tongue in going about my business.

There would have been a number of communications from the Central Bank to the ... the Minister, that the macro piece would not have been within the regulator's remit.</p></speech>

You said that, in your role as chairperson of the board, a non-executive position, you'd find yourself in the building or in the office one or two days a week, like, typically, how many hours work, a week, would being the non-executive chairman of ... of the board, involve?</p></speech>

In the early years I ... I was in there three, four, five days a week, for long days - I don't work an eight hour day.  And then, later on, it varied.  If there was ... if there was some issue happening that required a lot of ... a lot of my time, I would be in, but other days there wouldn't be.  It ... it varied a lot but ... and when I say one or two days a week, I think that was probably how it averaged out, I never measured it.</p></speech>

I was paid something like &euro;20,000, I think, as the director of the Central Bank, and &euro;50,000, as the chairman of the regulator, which came to, I know, &euro;70,000 non-pensionable and fixed.</p></speech>

Just on the issue of the powers that the Financial Regulator had, it strikes me that there is something of a difference between what you said verbally and what's in your ... your written report, and, you indicated a ... a change in your thinking.  Was that a very recent change in your thinking, that the ... that the Financial Regulator did have adequate powers to intervene?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00100"><p>Yes, it is fairly recent.  I ... when I was preparing for this hearing, obviously I did quite a lot of research and I listened to a number of the testimonies that have been made here.  I read a lot of stuff and I came to the conclusion that the regulator did have powers that it could have used and didn't, which only deepens my regret.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00200"><p>Sure.  Because your written statement in section 1.2, which starts on page 3, it makes a number of points about powers, that you didn't have ... that the regulator, sorry, didn't have the power, for example, to disapprove of specific products like 100% mortgages.  You make the point about foreign banks which are passported in here and you didn't ... the regulator didn't want to disadvantage Irish banks through the regulatory approach.  You talk about the delays in the administrative sanction regime coming online, as such.  And then at the very end, in your conclusion, you refer to "constrained powers".  So are you revising those points?</p></speech>

It was only subsequent to that that I really had to face up to the fact that, in truth, there were powers there that could have been used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00600"><p>Sure.  But, in preparing your statement ... and over recent months, you had the benefit of the official reports which were published and they dealt quite comprehensively with the issue of the powers available to the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and yet you kind of left the issue of powers hanging there in your statement.  It wasn't entirely clear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00700"><p>I accept that.  That is a criticism I accept.  You're right that the Nyberg report, for example, does outline a number of powers.  I tended, when the Nyberg report was published, to not want to take that on board, but I have now.</p></speech>

The annual financial stability reports ... you make, I think, quite an important point that, in a sense, it almost had to be sanitised because of the risk of stoking fear or spooking the horses, as you put it.  But doesn't that go to the very heart of the integrity of the document?  I mean, you said earlier on that the financial stability report didn't reflect the concerns of board members.  Isn't that quite an extraordinary situation, that people who would have been reading that report and relying on that report, that it really didn't give the full picture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#BBB00900"><p>I don't think it did, no.  And ... and I believe now that the financial stability report is an inappropriate way of communicating any concerns there are about banks or the banking system for the reasons that you have summarised very well.  But at the time it was.  That was the way, at least publicly, it was done.  The real issue about integrity of the process is whether actions followed from it, not what was written in the report.  Because absent the report ... let's put that report to one side for a minute and say, yes, it had to be optimistic and not to frighten the horses and so on.  Nevertheless, the concerns that, I think, existed within the two boards and the executive could have found their way into stronger and more urgent action and they didn't.</p></speech>

People relied on that report.  Businesses might have made investment decisions on the basis of the Central Bank's assessment, that the fundamentals were strong, there would be a soft landing, that there are risks but they are manageable.  You know, individuals were reading the headlines in the newspapers and on the broadcast media where, you know, there was a strong sense from the Central Bank that, you know, everything's going to be fine.  People were relying on that and I put it to you, you know, was the financial stability report a fully honest document?</p></speech>

And, indeed, some of the analysis that was in the back of it, and I think Tom O'Connell referred to this yesterday, was showing a lot of the concerns.  But I remember being in the central board discussion about the final signed-off wording of the financial stability report and there were voices in ... in ... in-----</p></speech>

But I think, given the size of the problem that had begun to evolve in 2006 and 2007, if the Central Bank came out and said, "We're not going to publish a financial stability report this year", that itself would have set off the alarm bells because I think there comes a point ... let's see if I can describe this properly.  In the early days, the financial stability report probably had to reflect only mild concerns, and so maybe it was able to do that.  As the pressure cooker developed more and more pressure inside it, the financial stability report should have reflected greater concern but, paradoxically, it had to be even more constrained than it had been before because of the fear of bringing about a run on the banks.  So, it got ... you get caught in this kind of dilemma, that no matter what way you jump, you're in trouble.</p></speech>

So, presumably, this is then an analysis of the information that has been fed in from the banks and the regulator looking into the banks.  Okay, X then suggested that the Central Bank "had not convinced market participants that there may be "systemic risk" [that's in inverted commas, suggesting that that's the very word that was used] building up in the banking sector" and "indicated there may be a "degree of euphoria building up in the property lending markets and that the boards and management of banks are being myopic about the potential risks."."

Mary Burke from the Central Bank gave evidence here, "believing that the authorities did not want a stricter regulation regime for Irish banks because the IFSC could then be seen as an area with less regulation that might be compared to an offshore financial haven".  And, Mr. Patterson, you make almost precisely the same point in page ... oh dear, its all my stuff here ...in page 6 and 7 of your written statement, when you say "It was [...] felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same - in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an off-shore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks."  Is this the secret of the riddle?  That there was an international deregulation of the financial services, massive competition and that this ... did this then result in a race to the bottom that was reflected in this policy that was adopted by the regulator?</p></speech>

No, I don't believe that was the cause of it.</p><p>I've been following your logic all along and I agree with you that the response to the analysis of the risk is inadequate, to say the least.  But my belief is that the source of the inaction, if that's what you call it, came more from the fact that the regulator believed it was following a principles-based approach, right, and that therefore the banks bore the responsibility for managing themselves and for not exceeding prudential risk etc.  And the reference to a road show in the second part of that quotation, in my view, comes under the heading of "moral suasion".  In other words, we're going to go out and we're going to talk to the banks, we're going to point out to them what's happening and we're going to - to go back to what I said earlier - raise our eyebrows at them and say "You know, you shouldn't be doing this," and that the banks would then take corrective action.</p></speech>

I couldn't find the speech unfortunately, but you're quoted as saying in relation to the bubble and the crash, "We were all responsible"... this writer said that you said, "We were all responsible," he said, several times in a speech that extolled, among other things, that ... a democracy that allows a change of government without military coups ... I think we're all grateful for that.  But do you really believe that - that ordinary people were responsible for the bubble?</p></speech>

I just wanted to clarify a couple of things briefly from your opening statement and from the testimony we've already heard today.  Just on page 3 of your opening statement, when you talk about the Central Bank's mandate, part of it being to develop the financial services sector.  And you say, ''While the Regulator legally had no similar responsibility, it was widely believed that its remit included supporting the development of the industry.''  So where did that belief come from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-11a.1406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Patterson" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061100002#FFF00400"><p>It was written into the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, all right?  So CBFSAI, that horrible acronym, had it as a legal responsibility, and the Financial Regulator, even though it had its own Act, operated under the aegis of the overall umbrella of CBFSAI.  And I think that was the main reason why it was believed that the Financial Regulator also had that responsibility.</p></speech>

Just further down on that page and responding to what Deputy McGrath raised with you in relation to your powers ... so that first point there that you have no powers<i>, per se</i>, of approval or disapproval over the banks products like 100% mortgages.

We could have imposed additional, even more capital requirements than we did, although that would have run into some issues, like the anti-competitiveness issue and so on.  But we could have imposed more stringent capital requirements; we could perhaps have gone at it through the consumer code, right, that it was inappropriate to be selling these 100% mortgages, certain classes of people; we could have attached conditions, conditions to banking licences, that they couldn't ... which effectively would've banned them.</p></speech>

Where they discovered late in the day that net worth statements were very flaky.  They either didn't exist in some cases or they hadn't been independently verified and that some of the tests that the banks were believed to be applying to loan requests weren't being applied.  So in other words, the ground on which that was based was very shaky.</p></speech>

Thanks, Chair.  Just in relation to that process though, because in that five by five exposure test that was done into the big developers, it was found in one of the tests that one of the banks in terms of calculations of an exposure to one individual borrower, was out by a billion.  But it also noted that the - and I'm paraphrasing here, that the significance of that wasn't understood by the regulatory system..</p></speech>

And then just a final question in relation to your opening statement and again, it's on page six and it's in relation to the IFSC, talking about sector limit and it came up earlier.  You talked about, the Central Bank had effectively relaxed these limits in the 1990s, in particular to facilitate the arrival of one large foreign bank which had a major sector exposure.  It was then felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an offshore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks.</p></speech>

I was just looking at your report for 2006, it's a summary of the annual report of Financial Regulator, and I see yourself there and the team, there's 13 of you in total.

The members of the authority, and there are some executives there in that group photograph again, it did have people who had experience of the financial services industry.  We'd a banker, we'd a chief executive of an insurance company, we had one individual, I think he had retired by then actually, who had deep knowledge of financial markets, so there was a level of understanding about financial services<i>per se</i>, yes?  What was missing, other than in the executive, was experience of financial regulation, and what was also missing was an international perspective.</p></speech>

After 2004, when the IMF and the OECD and ECOFIN all clearly recommended a tighter fiscal stance and the building up of a cushion for the time when income from property-related transactions would fall, can you say why, in your view, the Central Bank's recommendations to the Minister didn't more forcefully alert this particular issue?</p></speech>

So let me get that on the record.

It actually relates to the interim financial stability report to the board of the Central Bank in the first half of 2006.  It says, this ... this document, this is one of our accumulated documents:<blockquote><br /><br />.... raised the alert on the financial stability risk from private indebtedness, re-accelerating house price growth and strong loan volume growth of the Irish banks.  It also raised concerns on the strong rise of loans to commercial property-related non-financial corporates which had played a minor part in the commentary of former financial stability reports to date.</blockquote>Now people have talked about the appropriateness, or not, of financial stability reports in the ... that one seemed to me to be quite robust.  There's strong suggestions in there about house price growth, private indebtedness, and commercial property.</p></speech>

You've heard Con Horan talking about 2005 and 2006 and his efforts in 2005 to get additional capital requirements, which eventually happened in 2006, and, in fairness to the authority, they were right behind that.  There was no member of the authority saying we shouldn't be doing this and there were ... and I know there were some actions taken against bank X that we haven't talked about to try and deal with the governance problems there, including capital requirements.  So ... there ... yes, there were actions taken ... it wasn't that people did nothing.  I think the problem is it wasn't urgent enough and it wasn't enough.</p></speech>

Fifty because the belief was that the industry should pay at least a good chunk of it but not all of it and the reason for not levying 100% on the industry was to avoid what's called regulatory capture - that if the industry was paying for all of it, then we might fall under the stray too much.</p></speech>

I'm just going to wrap up with a couple of questions and then invite the two leads in, Mr. Patterson, and I just want to go back to some matters and that is that clear concerns were expressed by the regulator about the risk of asset growth at some banks before the onset of the crisis.  Did the CBFSAI examined the possibility that this might be a systemic problem?</p></speech>

So, in that regard, it would seem that clear concerns were expressed by the regulator about the risk of asset growth at some banks before the onset of the crisis.</p></speech>

Not when the crisis was visible and in full flow.  It is like a house collapsing.  Sometimes the crisis begins when the house is actually being built because it's not being constructed properly.  When do you think the crisis was embedded?</p></speech>

And I would include in that the radical deregulation of financial services that happened in the US and the UK and which Ireland followed.  But I guess in more substantive terms, my judgment, there isn't a magic date when you say they rang a bell and said it's now started.  My judgment would be that it was some time around 2006, 2007.</p></speech>

How was the relationship?  I think my experience of the relationship was ... was pretty few and far between.  I didn't have a lot of contact with the banking institutions.  The chief executive and I met the chief executive of the major banks probably once or twice a year for a working breakfast.  And incidentally, at the end of those meetings we always asked the, the bankers is there anything that we should know about that you're not telling us?  And they always said no, it's all fine, thank you, can we go now?  And the second part of the question, Chairman was this voiced by staff?</p></speech>

Secondly, is it fair to say that based on the fact with the principles-based regulation put the Financial Regulator third down the line of protection, that, and the fact that the board of the Financial Regulator had no-one with financial regulatory expertise, so you couldn't actually oversee the quality of work being done by the executive?  That in substance, legally, the Financial Regulator was required to regulate the banks but in substance the banks were regulating themselves and controlling their own risks.  In substance now, not legally, in substance.</p></speech>

I think that they're ... I've said ... I've said that the financial stability report, with hindsight, is an inappropriate vehicle for communicating issues around the banking system and that's why it's been stopped.  And I think that the people, including myself, who were responsible for signing off the financial stability reports, particularly in the years 2006, 2007, were in a real bind as to what you could say and what you could not say.  And as I said, paradoxically, the higher the level of risk, the more constrained you have to be, it kind of works in this way.  So from that point of view, they're not an appropriate vehicle for doing that.  The issue is whether or not those who could take action did take action and the answer is they didn't.</p></speech>

No, there's been ... there's been a lot of discussion about the responsibility of the Central Bank, the responsibility of the Regulator, and to me you can parse it and ... and look at the legalities and the structure and everything, but the reality is both organisations shared the same building, they shared the same services, they had common employer, they were committed to working together, so that's not the issue.  The issue is, how was it that they collectively failed to act sufficiently?  That's the issue.  And the last thing I'd like to say is, in trying to shed light on why I think the system failed, I don't want to create any impression that I'm evading my own responsibility, because I've fessed up to that, and I still regret it and I will regret it all the days of my life.</p></speech>
