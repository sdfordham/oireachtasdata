    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Comer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#N00200"><p>It is always good to have an opportunity to address people of influence, particularly on matters pertaining to our industry and business.  Approximately 18,000 Irish dairy farmers supply 6 billion litres of milk annually, with the capacity to grow further, if their solvency is not hindered by the current milk price.  With all this expansion and milk production, there are large borrowings at farm level, and all the associated anxiety that results from the trough in the milk price in global markets.  This is having a major impact at ground level in the confidence of our members to invest further and to fulfil the ambitions of Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025, and all they envisage doing for the overall economy, particularly the rural economy.  As we know, agriculture reaches into every parish across the country, and if it is not nurtured well and if the policies do not ensure we maintain the Irish family farm model, it will be a great loss to us all.</p> <p>  Irish farmers are selling milk below the cost of production.  Our scientific body and others estimate that the cost of production is approximately 28 cent per litre.  Glanbia pays 24 cent per litre.  It does not take Pythagoras or a mathematician to work out that this is not sustainable, by any stretch of the imagination, into the future.  In the past year, the average price was probably above the costs of production and the price of milk solids is high.  However, major anxiety is building in rural Ireland about what the price of milk will be next February and March, when the cows calve down and the solids are poor.  Farmers will probably receive less than the base price of 24 cent and could receive approximately 22 cent or 23 cent per litre for milk.  This will not last, even in the short term.</p> <p>  My organisation has always been concerned about how we could mitigate this volatility.  We are producing a product that is oversupplied in global markets, and correcting it might not be a simple matter.  In the long term, can the Irish family farming model survive in an unregulated global market?  Policies are deficient in equipping farmers with the tools to mitigate the volatility that has the potential to cause insolvency to individual farmers across the State.  There is a three-pronged approach.  Each farmer must become as efficient as possible within the farm gate.  Everything else is outside the control of the farmers, and they must look to national and EU governance to provide them with tools to offset some of the ruinous volatility.  The intervention price is structured around 20.4 cent per litre, and it is not acceptable.  The concept of the intervention price was to implement a floor price close to the cost of production.  While it was probably close to the cost of production when it was first implemented, the cost of production has spiralled upwards since then, while the intervention price has remained the same.  This is a significant deficit, although the concept is still as valid as ever.</p> <p>  There are issues around aids to private storage, APS, or private storage aid, PSA, as some call it.</p><p>I compliment the Commission and the Commissioner for improving the terms and conditions around PSA.  While modifications were made to it, there are still issues around the PSA for cheese where the allocations are not adequate for Ireland.  We have only got 1,835 tonnes of cheese in there and we need to have better tonnage.  In relation to cheese, in particular, it is hampering to some degree.</p><p> One must ask if there is a better way of doing business.  One wants to be careful with the words used, but as a sector, both in Ireland and across Europe, we must ask ourselves if there is a better way of dealing with a crisis.  In my view, with all the information available to us, and all the technologies available to analyse markets in the future in terms of the milk market observatory at European level, it would not have taken a genius to forecast at least a year ago that we would be in this position.  Why did we wait for the crisis to develop and then go looking to the Commission and the taxpayer for funding to offset some of the crisis?  To my mind, that is poor in terms of policy.  We must explore better tools than those currently in place, such as export refunds.  There are moral implications to export refunds.  In my view, export refunds will never function again because they will not be tolerated morally across the globe.  Then one has got the APS and after that, one has intervention.  With all the governance and all the policies, all the huffing and puffing - for sure, everyone is well meaning and I am not casting aspersions on anybody - the reality is the end product is not fit for purpose in helping us as farmers maintain a supply chain that will serve consumers well in terms of the family farm in the future.  Perhaps we could have provided an incentive so that some of this production would not have happened, particularly in the eastern bloc countries.  Six months ago, funding could have been used as an incentive to those producers, especially in the eastern bloc countries, not to be producing milk at 16 cent or 17 cent a litre.  Of course, the influences include the Chinese economy and the Russian ban, but we need to have better policies in place that help offset some of the turbulence that certainly is out there.</p><p> In farming or, indeed, any business, net margin is the only important figure.  We have reached a stage, in Europe and globally, where our costs are certainly not within our control.  There are few global companies dealing in fertiliser, which is one of our biggest costs.  It appears a cartel has developed.  There is very little competition.  Traditionally, when oil prices were coming down, fertiliser prices followed them down.  It did not happen this time and one would have to ask why one of the biggest costs on farms - second or probably equal to feed costs in terms of meal - has not come down at all.  In fact, it has gone in reverse and all the indications are that it will go up further.</p><p> Second, there are interest rates.  We have clear statistics that show definitely that the extra cost in interest in a year on Irish borrowings, pertaining particularly to Irish farms compared to our competitors across Europe, would be in the region of &euro;80 million.  Irish farmers are paying &euro;80 million more per annum in interest than our counterparts across the European Union.  When one benchmarks that against how much talk there was about the superlevy fine of this year and other years, that exceeds those particular figures.</p><p> The Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, made us a lot of promises and commitments on "legislation" - I use that word because in the past week or two it has been diluted somewhat in some of the commentary from the Commissioner himself - to deal with the power of the multinationals.  As individual business people, as is the nature of farming across all of Europe, it is almost impossible to compete with the power of the multinationals.</p><p>Some multinationals that operate in this country have a turnover in excess of &euro;32 billion or &euro;33 billion, to take Tesco as an example.  They can structure and organise in a way that does not suit primary producers.  The clear evidence is that, irrespective of the price of beef or milk, the primary producer has been taking a smaller percentage of the final retail price, year in, year out, since the 1970s.  This is a point we have to address and committee members all have a responsibility as legislators to grapple with it.  Our percentage of the final retail price has been decreasing.  Whether milk is at 25 cent or 50 cent per litre, we are getting a smaller percentage.  That is not happening by accident.  It is happening because we are individuals who are easily manipulated and extremely vulnerable because of the fragmentation in the way we have to do our business with the growing power of the multinationals.  Some measure must be put in place to guarantee fairness in margins.  The price to the farmer in the last year is on record as having reduced by 35%, while the price to the consumer has come down by 2%.  Something is happening.  We need to be cognisant of that.  We do not need to be afraid of it and we cannot shy away from it.  We have to find ways of dealing with it, and we have to call it as it is.<br/><br/>EU state aid rules have to be looked at as well.  There is scope to make policies more fit for purpose for individual member states, rather than a<font color="#FF0000"></font>broad brush policy across the EU 28.  The farm management deposit scheme was cited.  This was a good scheme.  The concept was well-received by the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, but they said they might be hampered by state aid rules.  There should be an examination of these rules.<br/><br/>What is coming from Europe at the moment is market-oriented policy.  That means that the only way to cure low prices is by a round of insolvencies at the primary level, to curb production to match demand, or an extreme weather event.  These two variables make it almost impossible for us, as business people, to second-guess markets.  We find ourselves in a position where there is a three-year lead-in from the decisions we make today to when that product is ready for the marketplace.  We have to guess where the markets will be in three years' time and when we have produced the product, it is extremely perishable.  We are vulnerable on both fronts.  It is not like other commodities.  We make no apologies for saying that we need to think outside the box in terms of honing a specialised policy on food production.  Everybody in the world has an interest in food production and it is of critical importance.  Consumers are more astute and tuned-in than they are given credit for sometimes.<br/><br/>In respect of the funds coming from Europe, our proportion of the &euro;400 million left over after &euro;100 million went to marketing would be &euro;13.7 million.  We were given indications by senior politicians, who will not be named, that this would be matched at national level.  We hope that will be followed through.  In that case, our preference would be that it would be brought to the farmers who are in most need as soon and as directly as possible, as in a single payment per farm.  Some kites are currently being flown about it being skewed towards young farmers.  The ICMSA is very clear that it would certainly like to see young farmers and would encourage them from every angle.  However, from an analysis of the crisis that has developed at farm level, it is very hard to differentiate between somebody who has just turned 40, and has young children and more dependants, and a young farmer.  We should not put one farmer against the other.  There should be equity in the distribution of the funds, whatever the final figure might be.<br/><br/>GLAS was available for dairy farmers in the past in REPS.</p><p>That is almost useless to dairy farmers.  Technically they can access it, but in practical terms it is not functional.  I do not know of any dairy farmers who are currently in it.</p><p> I cannot go without mentioning the beef forum.  There are 1.2 million dairy cows in Ireland that all have a calf and they all end up as culled cows.  Because of that, we say that we produce over half the beef in the country.  The beef forum was reasonably good in terms of the commitments given, but we were disappointed that the commitment to have a full review of the grid was not honoured even though there were clear commitments there.  There was a clear commitment to get every animal from a quality assured farm a quality assured bonus.  That did not happen.  There was also a commitment to deal with the 30-month age limit, but that was not addressed.  In 2016, there will be 150,000 extra head of stock in this country but we will find ourselves in the same position as last year if we do not take note of those extra animals and make sure that we have followed through on some of the commitments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#Q00200"><p>I thank Mr. Comer for his presentation.  He has suggested a European intervention price of 28 cent per litre.  Would he consider the intervention price as the number one remedy that would protect farmers from volatility?  Would he agree that it should be based on average European production costs?  The system we have now was fixed back in 2003.  Do we need a system that moves with the production costs, because input costs vary all the time?  A fixed intervention cost is not effective.  There are arguments made against it that it influences the market.  However, if the intervention price were the same as the world market price there would be no need for an intervention price because it could be sold at that price anyway.  I am interested in that.</p> <p>  If the Minister does not add to the European intervention, I understand that it works out at about &euro;697 per farmer.  If one considers the scale of the losses incurred by farmers, &euro;697 is a token contribution.  It is a drop in the ocean compared to those losses, and for someone in significant difficulty it will not have an impact on their finances.  We need to be realistic about this.  If a farmer is losing &euro;30,000, there is not much point in thinking that &euro;697 will save him.  Should the money be given to every dairy farmer or should there be a system of targeting the money at those who are really vulnerable?  The common call seems to be to give it out to every dairy farmer, whether they are in financial crisis or not.  For a farmer who is doing very well, maybe not this year, but who is generally in a very stable financial situation with very low borrowings and very good productivity, &euro;697 is just a little Christmas bonus, whereas it will not rescue someone who is in significant difficulty.  That is the case that has been made.  Some cows produce up to 9,000 litres of milk, but if the average cow produces 5,000 litres of milk and a farmer has 60 cows, the turnover will be very small.  I am interested in that.</p> <p>  I am glad that Mr. Comer is focused on the retailer issues.  This committee issued a report on this.  The price issue and the dominance of the multiples is probably the biggest issue faced by European agriculture into the future.  I have said this since I became the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture.  The Commissioner has taken that issue up and we need action on it.</p><p>The first thing is to show up what is happening because, as Mr. Comer has pointed out, the farmer is getting a smaller and smaller percentage of what the retailer gets.</p><p> Would it be helpful if the Commission were to decide that as long as this crisis persists, there would be no payback of the superlevy and it would be deep frozen until prices pick up again?  A trigger price could be set at which repayment would begin, but it would be optional to repay and the money would not be sought until a 28 cent per litre figure was achieved by the EU.  They would not look for money back until the price went over that.  Would that be helpful to farmers who are paying back for excess production of milk in a rather bizarre fashion?  Would that be something simple Europe could do without any significant cost to Europe because it would only defer the collection, not write it off?  There seems to have been some principle made of collecting that money, which is small beer in the European context but is still a fair bit of money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#R00200"><p>I thank Mr. Comer for his presentation.  A number of matters were discussed at the committee before the abolition of the milk quota.  It was said that it would be a utopia, a big boost and a benefit to producers, yet now we have an international oversupply, which inevitably was going to happen.</p> <p>  As regards the drop in prices in this country, Mr. Comer says the base price is down to 24 cent per litre at the moment.  He has indicated that for the first half of next year the price will be in a similar position.  How does the cost of production in this country compare with other EU states?  Is it affecting them as badly as it is affecting producers here?</p> <p>  Given the power of multinationals and big retailers, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned, they are able to manipulate the market for their own benefit.  What can this committee do?  We have had these people in here but their responses have been disingenuous.  Is there anything further this committee can do about that to try to force a more equitable playing pitch?</p> <p>  In his written presentation, although not in his oral one, Mr. Comer states that the European Commission appears intent on abandoning product price supports and letting the market dictate developments.  What is Mr. Comer basing that comment on and could he elaborate on it?  If that is the case it means that given their production costs, it will be far easier for farmers in less developed countries to survive than it will be for ours.</p> <p>  Mr. Comer mentioned the beef round table last year and said that little has been achieved since many key issues, including the review of the beef limit, have not been addressed.  Is the round table a talking shop or has it had any positive impact on farming in general and farm producers in particular?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Comer's view that the fall in oil prices has not been reflected in fertiliser prices, although it is the main commodity.  Is that price determined nationally or internationally?  There is also a knock-on effect on feed prices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#R00300"><p>I welcome the ICMSA delegation.  This is all about cashflow as far as I can see and we are in a perfect storm with price reductions.</p><p>The superlevy for this year and the next three years for those who are in that situation has caused and will continue to cause that particular difficulty.  There are 18,000 milk producers in the country.  Will the witnesses give the committee a breakdown of those who are new producers and existing producers and those of the 18,000 who may have borrowed substantially in the past year or two to increase production?  There are many strands to the problem, apart from the very low price base line of 24 cent per litre which is below the cost of production.  Farmers have borrowed substantially on the basis of a potential income in the high 20s per litre but it is now only 24 cent per litre.  The banking and borrowing issue is probably as major an issue as the cashflow problem.  If those figures are available, I would be interested to hear how many members of the ICMSA are in those particular categories?<br/><br/>I note on the front page of the <i>Farming Independent</i>today an article about the increase in milk production.  Dr. Pat Dillon, head of Teagasc at Moorepark research centre, expects us to far exceed our 50% increase in production well in advance of 2020, which was the initial target.  This year alone we are 1.1 billion litres ahead of 2009 which was a bad year for milk production from a price point of view.  Despite the fact the price is low, there appears to be continual expansion.  Given that farmers were planning, prior to the abolition of quotas, for a certain amount of young stock to come into the herd, one cannot decide suddenly to turn them away.  Within the industry there seems to be a reasonably progressive attitude that the position will improve and that if they continue to produce this extra amount of milk, it will compensate for the drop in price.  Would the witnesses agree with that assessment?Obviously the extra milk being produced this year will compensate to a certain extent for the drop in price.<br/><br/>I mentioned the banks.  Have the witnesses had dealings with the banks about some of their members who may be in difficulty?<br/><br/>The issue of the multinationals was mentioned by Deputy Martin Ferris and Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We did much work in the committee on legislation in this regard.  I agree with their point of view.  Would it make a difference if legislation were in place, at European or national level, to deal with this issue?  There is no doubt supermarkets in Ireland use milk as a loss leader and have done so for many years.  Certainly four supermarkets in the one town will not charge the same price for a litre of milk.  The majority of our milk products are exported.  While I agree there is a need for legislation, would it make a substantial difference in this issue?  We depend on exports and are always seeking out new markets, but the markets we had hoped to get into, whether in China or Russia, are under pressure.  I would welcome the opinion of the witnesses on this issue.<br/><br/>Ireland is a small fly in the ointment from a milk production point of view and is dependent on outside sources to survive.  While the witnesses have outlined some of the national issues that could be dealt with, including the commitment to &euro;13.7 million, I agree with Deputy Martin Ferris who made the point that &euro;800 or &euro;900, though a small sum, is welcome to a dairy farmer who may have serious difficulties.</p><p>I was, and I remain, one of those people very much in favour of the abolition of milk quotas on the basis that they held back production over many years.  Mr. Comer noted in his presentation that one would not need to be Pythagoras to understand there would be an issue.  Certainly, this time last year, the vast majority of people knew this issue would arise to some extent.  Perhaps we did not expect it to be as bad as it is, although some might have predicted it accurately.  We are now in the middle of the storm and trying to get out of it.  The wind is blowing in all directions and in some cases it is a tornado.  The question is how to achieve a balance, but the problem is that what has happened will happen again, even if we get out of it next spring or next summer.  In five or six years' time, the same thing will happen again, as sure as we are all sitting here today.  We do not know how many of us will still be here in five or six years' time, but the same discussion could well be taking place no matter who is sitting around the table.</p><p> Learning from what has happened must, therefore, be the main concern.  We must put structures in place for the future to enable us to deal with the volatility in the market and the cashflow issues facing farmers.  The superlevy has contributed to a huge cashflow problem in this country.  In fact, the people most seriously affected by that levy are possibly the very people who would have liked to produce more but have been held back to some extent for financial reasons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#T00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Comer and his colleagues from the ICMSA.  Many of the points I intended to raise have been made by colleagues.  I am sitting here today as both a farmer and a politician, two professions in which one must be an optimist to survive.  The farmer must hope the weather helps out and that he or she is able to make a profit at the end of the year.  A politician must be hopeful of being re-elected at the next election.  Mr. Comer suggested that one did not need to be a genius like Pythagoras to see there would be a global depression in regard to milk prices.  Certainly, all the research that was done did predict a drop in prices this year and next.  It seems, however, that the farm organisations, the banks and the advisory bodies did not do enough to curtail what is now an expansion, and it has put people into great difficulty.</p> <p>  It would be interesting to know what the actual investment has been in the dairy industry by farmers via on-farm investment.  I suppose information on how much was borrowed is easily obtained from the banks, but that will not tell us about the money that was spent which had been saved over the years. The dairy sector is in crisis at present, but that also was the case six years ago when the price of milk was 18 cent per litre.  We are a small player on the global stage and to achieve a price increase here requires some type of problem in other countries.  When grain is cheap, for instance, America produces as much milk as it wants because it is done on a grain basis.</p> <p>  I have a hypothetical question for the delegates.  In their view, should the abolition of quotas have been done gradually rather than having one drop?  As Deputy Deering noted, we are almost ahead of the 2020 target at this stage.  Do the witnesses agree that implementing the abolition on a gradual basis might have prevented some people from getting into the difficulties they are currently experiencing in terms of the investments and borrowing they made?  We were basing our expectations on a price of 40 or 41 cent per litre.  People thought there would be a golden egg forever but, as we have seen, it comes in cycles.</p> <p>  Has the ICMSA been in discussion with any of the retailers in this country on the question of prices?  We saw what happened in Britain when Morrisons tried to play a public relations game by stating that if people wanted to pay more for British-produced milk, it would let them do it.  That was cynical.  Could something be achieved by way of a general meeting with all the retailers with a view to ensuring they no longer use milk as a loss leader?</p> <p>  On intervention, there is a view that if the intervention price is increased to 28 cent per litre, it might make the co-operatives lazy.  If they have a floor price of whatever, they will not go out and look for new markets and seek to expand what they are selling.  The argument is that if they are able to sell in at whatever price per tonne, which guarantees the farmer 28 cent per litre, that will be the base price forever and we will not see any increase.</p><p>It is argued that if intervention is raised to that level, it may make the co-operatives lazy in looking for new markets and trying to expand products.</p></speech>

At least he presented it without reading through it.  We could all do that.</p> <p>  I am somewhat surprised.  Twelve months ago I sat here and warned people.  I was an agricultural consultant for many years and met many farmers.  I warned dairy farmers to be wary of what was about to happen.  I cautioned them very strongly.  I know a couple of farmers who got into dairy.  I warned other farmers who were thinking of changing that unless they won the lotto, they should not do so.  Therefore, I am somewhat surprised by the delegation's attitude.  Farmers are very cautious, as I know from having a brother who is a farmer.  Since farmers are so cautious, somebody must have encouraged them.  I did not hear a farming organisation saying "stop".  As individuals, we have to take some responsibility as well.</p> <p>  The banks were before us, as was the Irish Dairy Board.  They predicted this.  They spoke about the circumstances in New Zealand, China and the Middle East in addition to the Russian ban.  I left the committee that morning saying one would want to be a right fool to believe this would be a gold rush.  Perhaps I am a very cautious person but if I were leaving here after having listened to the presentations, I would have said "stop".  One is dealing with a perishable commodity where one is forced into the market and one is depending on processors to give the best price.</p> <p>  At the time in question, there were discussions about the superlevy bill being approximately &euro;100 million.  Reference was made to the appeals system and all that followed.  The year 2014, especially the early part, was fairly good.  Good prices were achieved and there was good production.  Now the tax bill has to be faced.  If one is in the Revenue Commissioners' online service, ROS, one has another few days.  If not, one had to go the other day.  Those are the circumstances that arise.  There was a collapse in the milk price, which was predicted.  Unless I am wrong, the Irish Dairy Board indicated there would be a significant drop.  It was hoping there would be a recovery in 2016.  I recall this vividly.</p> <p>  Farmers have become more efficient and effective and are promoting later lactation and an increase in milk solid constituents.  That is perfect at this time of the year.  Things work like that.  There is a dilution when one goes into the milk season.  It is related to the mixed production of grass.  We now have good weather and everything else.  I am not surprised the figures indicate we are galloping ahead at such a pace that the 2020 target will be reached two years early.  We have taken many steps, including through cow conditioning, dealing with culled cows and getting rid of certain things.  The efficiency factors are certainly being focused upon by farmers in a very positive way.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue which I agree is important, I disagree with Senator O'Neill that the wiping out and abolition of quotas at one stroke might bring about what was referred to.  It was affecting the whole market.  We are a small player in the market.  One could see what was going to happen.</p> <p>  I believed the banks would be cautious.  Has there been a high level of borrowing?  The banks pointed out that there were a considerable number of farmers with very little borrowed at the time.  Has there been a high level of borrowing since then?  As Deputy Deering suggested, the figure might be possible to obtain.  What degree of leniency are the banks offering farmers?  The banks are great at, as it were, putting their arms around one's shoulder to get one in.  However, when one experiences a bit of trouble, are banks appropriately lenient by giving an interest-free period and not levying people with significant inputs?</p> <p>  We have had the retailers before the committee.  As Chairman of a previous enterprise committee, I was the first person to produce a report in this regard.  The retailers would not even tell us their margins.  I am not surprised, therefore, that the ICMSA cannot get the margins.  Some of the retailers just dismissed us out of town altogether.</p><p>We produced a good report.  Deputy Doyle, as Chairman of this committee, has another excellent report.  We all know where that is.  The farmer, as primary producer, gets whatever is left on the table.  The retailers take everything.  The middle men and the retailers are in there.  The farmer carries the load and they take the profits.  Particularly at this time, they have a role to play.</p><p> I agree with the witness.  I recommended at the time that we should have legislation with teeth instead of puffy legislation with different elements.  The legislation should confer proper investigative powers.  This was shunted to the Competition Authority, but that was a waste of time; where would people get the evidence?  No more than in any other industry, who would come forward?  That was a waste of time.  We have stepped back from bringing forward legislation with teeth, which is regrettable.  The president is right in stating that it is probably easier to do this at a European level.  Let us do that in an umbrella process.</p><p> I know the dairy forum made some progress, especially for younger farmers, which is accepted and welcome, but the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme are speaking about the possibility of an income bond being put in place to cover valley periods between decent returns.  That must be examined.  It is no use to say this has not been done before.  It is a very useful tool and it can be used at a time of reduced prices and consequent income volatility, which we are now experiencing.  This will recur, as it happened six years ago; it could happen in four, five, six or seven years again.  There is a cycle to this.  I support the ICMSA very strongly in that, as it is very useful, innovative and welcome.  We should not be afraid to explore ideas that have not been tried before in other areas.  There are peculiarities in farming that are not present in other types of industry.</p><p> I recall that the other prediction was that in 2016 things would start going back up for farmers, and the dairy sector in particular, as it is on its knees now.  Taking Dr. Dillon's projections into account, one would need to be very cute to survive the next 12 months.  Unless there is a significant intervention, many people will find it hard to survive, and it becomes even more pressing if there is a family involved because of the other commitments.  One must also take into account unexpected or unanticipated events in farming, as it is no different from any other walk of life.</p><p> This is an extremely important area for the committee.  There is much downstream activity with regard to employment that must be acknowledged, not just on the farm but all over the place.  It is very important for rural Ireland.  With that said, I will support the witnesses in any way I can.</p></speech>

There are two big issues.  The first is what multinationals are paying for milk, and on the other side we have the international commodity markets.  It is very difficult to deal with both.  We can take Tesco Ireland as an example.  Its financial statements for last year indicate that it is working on a net margin of approximately 1.5% overall of what is turned over in the supermarket.  It makes money in that regard, but it and many other multinational supermarkets make their money when paying for the goods.  They pay after 90 days but the goods would be bought today and paid for by customer within seven or eight days.  They make 3% or 4% in the intervening 80 days, holding the money in accounts.  They are using agriculture and every other sector in doing that.  They can really squeeze small suppliers, and I know some examples.  Tesco Ireland is squeezing suppliers as tightly as possible because it makes money on those suppliers.  It is wrong, but how do we deal with that?</p> <p>  There is something that can be done from a legislative perspective in both Houses.</p><p>The groceries order is one issue, but other measures can be introduced to deal with this.</p><p> We have seen huge volatility in prices on the international commodities market since January 2007.  Oddly enough, until then the milk commodity price was fairly stable.  It is probably reflective of the international global economic situation and of supply and demand issues.  The commodity markets work on fear and opportunity and supply and demand driving fear and opportunity.  The battle will be very difficult and I agree with Deputy Penrose.  Many people have invested in the milk sector on the basis of quotas being removed, but unfortunately this leads to an oversupply in the market and we have seen it in the price volatility we have now.  How this can be addressed is a key issue, as is how to address and reduce the &euro;80 million in borrowing costs.  There is an efficiency bedrock and all farmers, including dairy farmers, strive to get these efficiencies.  One can only get so much through efficiencies.  I am not sure what the rate of borrowing is, whether it is 5% or 10%, but if it is approximately 10%, then &euro;80 million in agricultural borrowings means a cost of close to &euro;1 billion.  Are these borrowings only within the dairy sector?</p></speech>

If the rates are competitive, and I know some of the banks charge up to 10% for borrowings, perhaps there is a need for State intervention or a mechanism for lending to agriculture given its importance and Food Harvest 2020.  Is there a need to look at this if the banks do not provide value for borrowing costs?  I am not sure.  There are tools that can be used.</p> <p>  The European dimension is critical.  One way to control price volatility in a global sense is to introduce intervention prices.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions for the committee to make to the Commissioner or the Minister?  A twofold reaction is needed at national level and, more importantly with regard to commodity price stability, at European level.  How do we get this?</p></speech>

I have been listening today.  The quota has gone and we have too much supply and are now deep in commodity land globally.  It is very ugly because the commodity price has dropped.  I hate to hear remarks to the effect that we will get out of this and that we will be back in six years' time because such remarks are depressing if I am a dairy farmer because I know I will live my life in these awful times.</p> <p>  In the context of the pathways for growth and the wonderful people who come from Harvard every year and speak to us about a strategy for Irish agriculture, I am very proud of Ireland, and our dairy sector is so much better than that of anybody else.  Look at Kerrygold relative to the size of Ireland.  Kerrygold is the second biggest selling butter in the United States.  I am aware that Bailey's Irish Cream is owned by Diageo.  I am talking about an overall strategy for Ireland.  We are the 12-month, grass-fed beef and dairy country.  We produce the creamiest milk in the world.  Is there a strategy that takes us out of commodity land into more added value, or is it that we just produce too much of it?</p> <p>  I asked a small dairy producer whether he had thought of kefir and he asked me what on earth it was.  It is a stronger version of yoghurt and is produced by a Russian family in the United States.  It will be worth &euro;500 million by next year and was started only a few years ago.  It is an opportunity.  To me, there are always opportunities for specialist products.</p><p>It would take us out of this awful commodity world where things get better and things get worse again and the people whom the witnesses represent wonder if they will ever win the game and get out of the seesaw of a life in which they very obviously live.</p></speech>

Some useful suggestions and questions have been raised, in particular the last one on moving from dependence on commodities in which we have always traded now that we trade in a global products environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Comer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#X00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I want to bring in some of my colleagues.  I will be as brief as I can.  Many of the questions overlap and I will try to take them in order.  One would want a fair brain to go around to everybody and try to attribute each question to everyone. </p> <p>  The major question is intervention price, which is not as straightforward as it might seem.  Of course the concept is what we would call very pragmatic.  The idea behind an intervention price is to ensure the price is not below the cost of production.  Therefore, when the markets are in a downturn, we ensure we do not lose critical mass in terms of the production base across Europe.  The intervention price is currently at 20.4 cent, which is based on 2003 costs.  The costs have increased.  One can argue a cent or two either way, but let us assume that the figure is 28 cent.  Therefore, it would follow through that the intervention price should be available at 28 cent a litre.</p> <p>  Farmers are not fools.  We understand clearly that when the market starts to recover, that product in intervention still has to come back out and that will slow down the recovery.  However, it will stop insolvencies at farm level because it will keep farmers ticking over and it is to be hoped they will be there for the recovery.  The alternative to intervention only helps factory farm structures, whereby the weakest are picked off.  Denmark is one such example.  About five years ago, there were 18,000 dairy farmers there but that figure has decreased to 3,000.  The average milk produced per farmer was 300,000 litres, which is roughly where we are at now, and it is now in excess of 1 million litres.  The 3,000 remaining farmers are still running into solvency difficulties.  Is that a model we want to let happen in Ireland?  It will happen.  As individuals we cannot deal with those challenges.  Milk will always be produced, but will farmers increase their herds to 500, 600 or 700 cows because they picked off the guys who went broke?  Intervention is a useful tool, and although it is not perfect, it is all that is available now and should be invoked.  We need to be more imaginative about tools in the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Deering referred to it being a cashflow issue.  I beg to differ.  It is a cashflow issue in 2015 because the average was not so bad.  If prices fall below the cost of production, the bigger guys will hit the deck because scale will cripple smaller farmers.  If farmers are making 0.5 cent a litre, scale will help them, but as soon as prices fall below the cost of production, cashflow is no longer the issue.  It is fundamental to solvency.  Sometimes it is misperceived as a cashflow issue.  Currently, it is a cashflow issue.  By early spring of next year, given all the costs and low solids, it will be more serious and there will be systemic solvency issues.  It can happen that fast.</p> <p>  There were several questions about borrowings, and perhaps the general secretary will comment on it.  From my recollection, the banks structured repayments at 29 cent a litre, but we are back to 24 cent.  This means people cannot repay their loans.  Banks have built in six-month moratoriums into newer loans, which is a recent development.  People can go interest-only for six months at 29 cent a litre, but we are back to 24 cent.  Young progressive farmers who bought into what Deputy Ferris referred to as euphoria are affected.</p> <p>  If one goes back through the records - Deputy Penrose referred to other things and he should have looked at some of the previous records - the ICMSA was always pragmatic, as I would have said, and considered by others to be ultra-conservative.  I never thought we were.  It is a natural thing for a farmer or any business person to want to grow and expand his or her businesses and improve his or her lot in life.  If everyone does it together, it is obvious what will happen.</p> <p>  The crash in 2009 came when we had quotas.  I always said that quotas were never fit for purpose, were not flexible enough and left us even more vulnerable.</p><p>However, the total free market is not the answer for a perishable product that has such a long lead-in.  The global dairy trade price was down today by 7.4%.  That is going to send another shockwave through the industry.  It is a question of the position at a human level and to where the mind goes.  A farmer may receive a price of 24 cent per litre on a given day and might then hear that the GDT price has gone down.  All the while, he may have built up a sizable debt.  No farming organisation or politician has personal debt of this nature.  They might give the advice or it might be the Teagasc people and it may all be well-intentioned but it is the individual who ends up carrying the debt and that is a strong concern for him.</p><p> I was asked by Deputy Ferris whether the beef forum was a talking shop.  Certainly, I think it was well-intentioned.  It was a tricky negotiation process given the involvement of beef processors, farm representatives, Bord Bia and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We were happy with the conclusions but we were absolutely up in arms with the follow-through.  We do not think it was in any way appropriate because we were given commitments for five different points, none of which have transpired into reality.  The direct answer is that in retrospect it seems to have ended up as a talking shop that did not deliver.</p><p> Deputy Deering asked where we stand on borrowings.  We have dealt with that question and the scale of it.  We dealt with the question on the abolition of quotas as well.</p><p> Senator O'Neill asked about the farm organisations and the banks.  We have dealt with that.  Our organisation believes in incremental steps to growth.  That is the only way to proceed.  It was suggested here that we would be back in this situation again in six years' time.  I do not believe it will take six years.  I have absolutely no doubt that milk prices will rise to 39 cent or 40 cent per litre again.  There is an underlying good news story, that is to say, the nutritional value of our product is now recognised internationally through science.  The body of the science is behind it.  This is a temporary thing but the question is how temporary.  Is the temporary element going to be long enough to cripple the family farm structure?  There is a duty of care to the consumer as well.  Any consumer who is surveyed throughout Europe will say that the family farm is the vehicle they want to supply them with food.  However, they do not realise how vulnerable the family farm is in such a volatile environment.  We need to explain this to people as best we can.</p><p> I hope the members will forgive me if I have left anyone out.  I cannot read my own writing at times.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to Tesco and where we could go with the legislation and the squeeze.  I do not blame Tesco for squeezing farmers.  In fact, it is the duty of the multiple to do that.  It is a plc and must answer to shareholders.  Otherwise, it would be in breach of corporate governance requirements.  However, the legislation must counteract this such that the multiples are not in breach of any law.  I believe this must be done at European level.  There is no way a member state the size of Ireland or any other member state, even Germany, can deal with this alone.  Certainly, we have to be creative in our representations and we must ensure people are well-informed.  We can set the seeds here for sure, but I do not believe we can do much at member state level.</p><p> My colleagues may wish to contribute presently because I have probably left out something.  Anyway, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien asked how we get out of the commodity cycle on international markets.  Of course we do not have a market like Germany or France.  We must export 90% of produce.  However, the reality is that much of our produce is not commoditised.  The GDT price reflects the spot markets on commodities.  What we are supposed to be reflecting in our milk price is the value-added premium product created by the investment that farmers have made in concert with Bord Bia and by coming up with robust innovative products that have value-added.  It is not even reflecting commodity prices.  The current price reflects a value-added price.  I will leave it at that.  I apologise if I have left out anyone's direct question.</p></speech>

There was a question about the superlevy bill and the freezing of the repayment.  It would be far more worthwhile for this country if the butt of that adjustment was followed up.  With hindsight, we reckon this would reduce the super levy bill on a permanent basis by 35% to 40%.</p><p>This matter relates to a comment that was made about the gradual abolition of quotas.  It was always ironic and problematic that quotas were being phased out and we were getting 1% per annum for a four-year period but no national increase in the final year.  The phasing out should have been gradual, for example, 1% the first year, 2% the next year, 3% the next year and so on.  We would have avoided the glut at the roundabout that was 31 March 2015.</p><p> Senator O'Neill suggested that, had the intervention been increased to 28 cent per litre, it would have made co-ops lazy.  Co-ops are allegedly driven by dairy farmers.  We want to maximise our return, given the fact that the cost of production has increased.  As the president stated, it may hold people in the game.</p><p> I will highlight Mr. Pat Dillon's comments in today's newspaper.  Given the climate conditions, 2009 was the most horrendous year for dairy production since I started milking cows 20 years ago.  If this year was not the most ideal, then it was certainly the second best.  We cannot underestimate that.  I would be careful about those figures on the effect of weather conditions.  We do not need the weather of 2009 in 2016.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#Z00200"><p>Regarding the banks, we have conducted an analysis of the interest rates that Irish farmers pay compared with their EU counterparts.  Had we the EU's average rate, we would be paying &euro;80 million less.  To put that in context, this year we paid a superlevy fine of &euro;70 million.  The higher rates need to be addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue arises for farmers from time to time.  If a farmer gets a better interest rate from another bank, he or she must employ two solicitors to transfer the security from one bank to the other.  This is because of the property crash, not farmers, yet we are paying the consequence.  The charge is probably &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000.</p> <p>  As the president stated, there is no point in our dealing with the multiple retailer issue in Ireland.  We export 90% of our beef and close to 90% of our dairy products, with the majority going to European markets.  Something must be done at European level to address the issue.</p> <p>  The Commissioner has stated that he is examining the issue of interest rates and finding cheaper sources of funding for Irish farmers.  The latter needs to happen quickly.  In 2016, interest rates, bank charges and loans will be a major issue for farmers.</p> <p>  We mentioned 2009.  Some have stated that what happened then could recur after six years, but it could also recur after three years.  No one knows.  We must be prepared.  The 2014-16 period is a good example of the difficulties that we face.  The year 2014 was a relatively good one for dairy farmers.  I welcome Deputy Penrose's comments on the farm management deposit scheme.  If I have a good year farming, I should be able to set aside some funds for the more difficult years.  Unfortunately, many dairy farmers are being encouraged to form companies.  We have grave concerns about that.  The majority of dairy farmers are sole traders and we should support them in that way.  The farm management deposit scheme could play a valuable role in addressing future crises.</p></speech>

The dairy forum is also up and running.  Mr. Enright made a valuable contribution regarding tools that could be used in future.  Is there any value in the dairy forum making suggestions and do the witnesses find it beneficial?  It has only been up and running for a while.  When dealing with farmers, nothing beats talking to them and the industry.</p> <p>  Processors in particular were mentioned.  It was stated that they were farmer driven.</p><p>Farmers did not drive one of them very well in recent weeks when it, unlike other processors, decided to reduce the price it pays for milk.  Was this reduction preceded by talks or negotiations between the ICMSA and the company in question?  One wonders if a discussion needs to take place with the processors regarding the price they could pay.</p></speech>

One of the kites being flown is a tool known as margin protection insurance which is designed to deal with volatility.  When one analyses this scheme, however, one finds that while it would probably deliver, it would do so at enormous cost because it involves the introduction of another multinational company to provide insurance policies that would protect farmers' margins and thereby remove another swathe of money from the equation.  Ultimately, someone must pay the cost.  Would it be paid by the consumer?  These types of topics are being discussed at the dairy forum.</p> <p>  The ICMSA had long, hard and tough negotiations with Glanbia, the company that pays the lowest milk price, at 24 cents per litre.  There is outright anger among ICMSA members who supply Glanbia at the company's decision to reduce the price.  The Ornua purchasing price index, which is based on a basket of real products traded in a real marketplace, suggests that the actual price is 20.06 cents.  The processor paying the lowest price is the one that put itself on a pedestal as if was a paragon of perfection in terms of processing product.  It was to have innovative products which would deliver a greater return than the returns available from other processors, yet it pays the lowest price.  This is very difficult to explain but it shows what can happen, even with a player as large as Glanbia which should have the scale and expertise to lead the market up, rather than drag it down. </p></speech>

Dairy is a key player in the agriculture industry.  We have seen all the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  The joint committee, in its report on managing volatility in the dairy sector, identified price volatility as a potential hazard in terms of dairy expanding and achieving its full potential for rural areas and the country as a whole.  It is important that we try to play our part, whether with the banks or the Minister and Government of the day with regard to dealing with state aid rules or developing new market management tools which could give a degree of certainty to farmers, as primary producers.  The industry cannot be based on the producer of the raw material not knowing whether it will be necessary in three years' time to dip into reserves or borrow money, having paid tax in the one good year where the business made a decent profit.  That is not the best model and our goal is to address that issue.</p> <p>  If it is agreeable to the remaining two delegations, we will ask them to make their presentations and take questions together.

I welcome Mr. Patrick Kent, who is the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association; Mr. John Brooks, who is the association's sheep chairman, Mr. Edmond Phelan, who is the association's beef chairman; and Ms Neassa Fitzgibbon, who is the public relations officer of the association.  I also welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan, who is the national president of Macra na Feirme; Mr. Bryan Hynes, who is the chairman of Macra na Feirme's agricultural affairs committee; Mr. Edmond Connolly, who is Macra na Feirme's chief executive officer; and Mr. Derrie Dillon, who is the agricultural affairs manager of Macra na Feirme.  I thank them for coming before the joint committee today.</p> <p>  The witnesses probably heard what the Chairman said about the matter of privilege earlier, but I have to go through it again.  I want to bring it to their attention that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I am aware that there might be a vote in the D&aacute;il on the Order of Business at 4.45 p.m.  I mention that to let the witnesses know in advance that we might need to suspend the sitting.  I ask Mr. Kent to make his presentation, to be followed by Mr. Finan if that is all right.</p></speech>

While we all know there has been a substantial drop in milk prices, the beef and sheep sectors must not be forgotten.  We have this kind of crisis virtually every year.  It seems to be ongoing.  Lack of income is a major issue in both the beef and sheep sectors.  Many of our members have expressed amazement at how quickly a crisis in the dairy sector was dealt with by the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, with the result that a package of almost &euro;14 million was delivered to Irish farmers, of which beef and sheep farmers received nothing.  One would think beef and sheep farmers were in clover.  However, 12 months ago, when beef was in deep crisis all we got was a beef forum.  When Teagasc finalises our income figures for 2014, I confidently predict that the dairy incomes will still be higher than beef, sheep or suckler incomes.  Let us not dwell on this.</p> <p>  I will outline where we are heading in the next 12 months.  On a macro level, we are very concerned at the potential for damage to our sector from a bad Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP deal.  As we speak, EU and US negotiators are working behind closed doors to put a deal together.  The lead negotiator for the EU is the trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation commissioned Copenhagen Economics to do an impact analysis of a potential trade deal for Ireland.  The conclusion was that the beef sector was the likely loser whereas dairy might gain.  ICSA recently attended a public meeting in the European Parliament under the patronage of Paolo de Castro, MEP, where the risks of a bad deal from TTIP became apparent.  Many of the other member states are preoccupied with having their geographical indications for products such as wine and cheese protected.  The risk is that this will trump beef when it comes to the 11th hour negotiations on the finer detail.</p> <p>  ICSA made it clear in Brussels that the Irish beef sector was very vulnerable.  The problem is compounded by the fact that there are several trade deals in the offing.  The Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, has been concluded with a big increase in quota for Canadian beef imports.  However, it is less well known that trade talks between the EU and Australia-New Zealand are getting under way and we must not forget that the Mercosur bloc has not gone away either.  The threat of all these trade deals coming together with concessions repeatedly being given on beef imports is an appalling vista for our sector.  Two issues are prominent.  First, we must fight tooth and nail to minimise additional tariff-free quotas for beef imports from all these countries.  Second, we must fight to protect EU standards of production.</p> <p>  The production standards in some of these countries leave much to be desired from a human health perspective.  There is much genetic modification and high levels of pesticides, hormones and antibiotics are used in production in massive, factory-type feed lots, which contrast with the natural production we do here in Ireland.  We need a higher return on what is a much healthier product for the consumer.  The risk is that, rather than keeping the bar high at the EU standard, there could be mutual recognition of standards, which would be very damaging to our beef sector.  We need Irish politicians and the Government to shout very loudly in the coming weeks and months to ensure any deal does not involve a sell out for the Irish beef sector.  We are concerned that a fear of upsetting multinationals is weakening our national position on this.  We seem to be cap in hand for a few jobs from major multinationals.  Irish companies employ more people in the US than US companies employ here.</p> <p>  This brings me to another concern, which is that our position on GM is leaving us vulnerable on the marketing front.  By the 3 October deadline, 19 of the 28 EU member states had decided to opt out of growing GM crops.  Why was Ireland not one of those?  It is a very serious question, and our politicians have let us down.  Our neighbours and competitors, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, all felt it was necessary to protect their interests in having a clean, green image and to demonstrate that they were in tune with consumer sentiment.  Any surveys done have shown that consumers are overwhelmingly in favour of having clean, green, GM-free products, and more than 90% of consumers want this type of product.  I am also concerned that key markets for Irish produce, such as Germany, France and Italy, have also decided to opt out.</p><p>Like it or not, many consumers are concerned about GM production methods.  Ireland's marketing strategy is to develop the Origin Green ideal, but we may be in danger of shooting ourselves in the foot on this one, especially when one considers that exporting beef and sheepmeat to discerning consumers is far more important than any possible change, with dubious benefits, to crop growing systems in this country.  There is no GM crop we can grow here that would be of any benefit and we should have opted out on this immediately.</p><p> We also must consider the way in which the food chain is not working for beef and sheep producers.  We have seen over-regulation of farmers but hardly any regulation further down the chain.  The money flow back to farmers has been totally neglected.  We must become cognisant of that fact.  The fact that the profit is not coming back to the farmer is being neglected, and the big multinational supermarkets and processors seem to be getting bigger and more powerful all the time.</p><p> In our view, two items are now essential.  First, we need the Commissioner to introduce robust regulation of the food chain across all 28 EU member states.  This means setting up a European authority or regulator to investigate who gets what from the food chain.  In our view, the farmer does all the work and the processors and retailers virtually get all the profit.  The finances of farmers are transparent but we know nothing of the margins made by multinational retailers when it comes to key products such as beef, lamb and dairy.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The second essential item is closer regulation of the processing part of the chain, which could be done at national level.  We need to monitor much more carefully what goes on in meat factories.  Issues such as angle of neck cut and trimming are not being dealt with satisfactorily at present.  There are also question marks over grading issues.</p><p> We believe that factories should not be allowed to own and control feedlots and in the process have the ability to pull prices as it suits them.  We propose that the Oireachtas committee consider examining whether this practice is in keeping with competition law - the Competition Authority was quick to come in when we were at the round table last year and we do not see it coming in and giving us any assistance on this matter - and whether it is possible to legislate against it.  We need legislation.  For sure, farmers know that factory-controlled feedlots are now having a huge impact on the store trade and the beef trade, and we are the losers.</p><p> We also suggest that there is not enough focus on live exports, for both cattle and sheep.  ICSA is concerned that live cattle exports have dropped drastically this year, down some 50,000 head, or 25%, on the corresponding period last year.  Overall we will struggle to hit 180,000 in total live exports this year.  That compares unfavourably with 338,000 head in 2010.  Excessive bureaucracy is also hindering live exports of sheep.  The ICSA believes that the Minister needs to put the same energy into opening live export markets that was put into getting beef exports to China and the United States.  It is clear to us that success in expanding live exports will be far more beneficial to livestock farmers than any gains in China or the United States.  For example, it is now time to talk to the Egyptian authorities about clearing the way for live exports.  It is no harm to remind ourselves that dairy expansion will lead to a lot of extra calves, and it is a matter of urgency to have markets for them.  Also, we must express frustration that the 30 month issue remains unresolved.</p><p> On sheep, I want to mention moves to increase electronic tagging by the Department.  ICSA is yet to be convinced that this will do anything other than increase costs for farmers.  We are particularly adamant that there is no justification for electronic tagging of sheep going direct to slaughter in meat plants.  ICSA is also concerned that electronic identification, EID, will be uneconomic for hill sheep farmers who have no choice but to sell low-value lambs in marts.  While there is a benefit to farmers buying store lambs, ICSA believes that increased cost around EID must be accompanied by a more practical approach on tagging at inspection time, especially for hoggets in the new year.</p><p> ICSA is also concerned at suggestions that the Department may consider introducing a single supplier for sheep tags.  Competition is essential.  In fact, we believe that there should be competition in the supply of cattle tags as well.  This is not just about the cost of the initial tags; it is also about the cost and frequency of replacing tags.  We believe that we are unfairly incurring costs as a result of having only one cattle tag supplier.</p><p> Regarding the future, ICSA believes that more must be done in the rural development budget for sheep farmers.</p><p>We have welcomed the decision to allow sheep fencing back into TAMS, but there is a need for a sheep scheme.  Suckler farmers have the beef data and genomics programme, but sheep farmers have nothing.</p><p> Given the slow roll-out of the rural development programme, RDP, against the backdrop of a CAP reform process, it seems there will be a need to ensure that all funds in the RDP are used.  For instance, the recent budget is forecasting a spend of &euro;494 million in 2016.  This suggests that for each subsequent year, average spend in the programme will have to exceed &euro;590 million.  The ICSA proposes that a sheep scheme could be funded up to &euro;25 million per annum within the RDP limits, or with a small top-up from Exchequer funds.  One amendment per annum to the programme is allowed and we need to consider this at the earliest possible stage.  We also believe that sheep farmers should be allowed to benefit from participation in two knowledge transfer programmes.</p><p> The recent decision to halve the maximum area allowed under the low-input permanent pasture measure in GLAS is the wrong one.  Our concern is that the scheme is becoming totally unattractive to many smaller and medium-scale cattle and sheep farmers.  The ICSA has also been campaigning for a scheme for hen harrier farmers, who have been treated very badly over a number of years, and we welcome the possibility of doing something under the locally led environmental schemes.  However, we are concerned that this could turn into a bureaucratic nightmare with high consultancy costs.</p><p> We need a scheme that will pay farmers for every hectare of designated land.  Under GLAS, there is a potential maximum payment on up to 19 ha, but many farmers have more designated ground.  A key issue will be whether we can find a more flexible approach on afforestation in the hen harrier areas.  The blanket ban on forestry is not supported by the scientific evidence and we need a less dogmatic approach on this. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time.  My colleagues and I are available to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be joined by my colleagues Mr. Bryan Hynes, the chairperson of our agricultural affairs committee, Mr. Edmond Connolly, our CEO, and Mr. Derrie Dillon, our rural and cultural affairs manager.  Macra na Feirme's presentation will highlight the huge development potential and opportunities for young dairy farmers after the abolition of the milk quota.  We will also highlight how policy-makers, co-operatives, industry and farmers working together on the issues affecting the industry can result in young farmers availing of the exciting opportunities that exist in dairying.</p> <p>  The issues that affect young dairy farmers, affecting their future development potential and the decisions they make in their careers, are generally the same as those affecting all young farmers regardless of their enterprise.  My presentation will reflect and outline some of the general challenges and issues facing young farmers in the development of our businesses as well as identifying potential solutions.</p> <p>  This is a great time to be a young farmer entering the industry and also for those who are established and trying to grow and drive forward their business.  Huge opportunities exist and the future is bright for young, trained, energetic, technically proficient, business-minded young farmers.  Young farmers believe that due to a combination of factors, including expanding international demand for food, the ambitious targets set out in Food Wise 2025, mandatory measures for young farmers in CAP reform and milk quota abolition, it certainly is a time of opportunity.  However, the number of dairy farms in Ireland and across the EU is decreasing year on year, according to the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, and it is important that we address this by ensuring young dairy farmers are encouraged and supported in entering the industry.  Encouraging young people into dairying creates job and career opportunities and provides for a multiplier effect in rural areas that supports businesses and rural communities.</p> <p>  As the new generation of farmers, we will have to be technically proficient in our approach to the running of our businesses, focusing on the drivers of profitability on our farms, utilisation of grass, soil fertility, improvements in breeding, and adopting sustainable practices such as the principles of the Bord Bia Origin Green initiative.  This excellent initiative makes Ireland a world leader in food production and highlights the sustainability of the Irish agriculture industry.</p> <p>  As the representative body for young farmers, Macra na Feirme hears from our members about the issues on the ground that challenge young dairy farmers and, indeed, all young farmers.  The common barriers for young farmers progressing within the industry are access to land, credit and education.  Macra na Feirme was founded in 1944 to educate young farmers and improve their practical farming skills.</p><p> Macra na Feirme was founded in 1944 to educate young farmers and help them to develop the practical skills of farming.  We encourage young farmers to engage with formal education.  We also encourage young farmers during their farming career to develop themselves through engagement in continued professional development and further training.  Continued professional development is common in other professions, but a recent young farmer training needs analysis carried out by Macra na Feirme identified that there was no real tradition of young farmers engaging in or completing further training.  What we are seeing is that when young farmers return home and have been farming for a few years, they realise at that stage that they need further training in the skills required to be successful.  Macra na Feirme provides this continued professional development and practical experience through our Macra na Feirme young farmer Skillnets programme.  This focuses on three main areas that young farmers identified in the training needs analysis: business, technical and personal.  This programme is intended as an add-on to the formal education that young farmers receive.  Programmes and structures that encourage young dairy farmers to get involved in their co-operatives and processing industry are also essential to ensure that innovation, energy and leadership are part of the future of the industry.  Macra currently partners with ICOS and Teagasc to deliver training opportunities in this area.</p><p> Access to formal education is an issue that young farmers have identified.  To comply with the requirements of the new mandatory CAP measures, young farmers have to have started their agricultural education by September 2016.  The Government and Teagasc must ensure that sufficient resources are provided for our formal agriculture education system to ensure that young farmers can get their agricultural education and that this education is to the highest standard and equips young farmers with the knowledge and skills they require.  As young farmers, we are businessmen and women, and successful businesses require long-term planning, both financial and strategic.  Macra na Feirme encourages young farmers to improve their skills and take the next steps to improve their efficiency and technical ability.  These steps will result in increased profitability at farm level within their businesses and allow them to add value, drive output and develop their enterprises.</p><p> Macra na Feirme continues to work on the access to land issue and delivers a programme in land mobility through our land mobility service.  The land mobility service sums up what our organisation can positively contribute to the industry.  Young farmers first identified land mobility as an issue affecting them.  We commissioned a land mobility and succession report to give us the evidence.  It found that 48% of farmers over 50 had no identified successor.  A service was then devised and rolled out.  This service means that land is now easier to access for young farmers.  The service is about getting more young blood into the industry through collaborative arrangements such as long-term leases, partnerships and share farming agreements.  I am delighted to inform the committee that the service is growing steadily, with more than 350 clients and approximately 140 arrangements in place.  I would like to acknowledge the contributions that the various stakeholders make to the service.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#FF00300"><p>  The measures introduced in last year&rsquo;s budget to incentivise long-term leasing have been very important in encouraging farmers to move away from conacre agreements to more long-term arrangements, and the newly announced farm transfer partnership proposal is also very welcome.  The land mobility service is contributing to the development of the dairy industry by providing new blood to the industry and encouraging young and older farmers to work together to grow their farm businesses.  Since the abolition of the milk quota, dairy farmers are focusing more on milk production output.  The rearing of replacement dairy stock consumes land that could otherwise be used for milk production.  The result is a spin-off enterprise that offers huge potential for farmers in more marginal areas to supplement their businesses or run contract rearing operations.  This is a positive initiative which has huge potential and we need to encourage more of these types of arrangement.  Contract rearing is an enterprise that dry stock farmers could look at to run alongside their existing enterprises as a way of increasing stocking rates and output.  The land mobility service has established a number of successful contract rearing arrangements across the country.</p> <p>  We welcome the new partnership register of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and we are calling for a register of share farming agreements to be put in place.  There are issues to be addressed in terms of share farming, but young farmers see huge potential in this area.</p> <p>  The land mobility service means that land is more accessible for young people, but access to finance to pay for this land and develop our businesses is a particular challenge.  In most cases, young farmers do not have the security or past track record to draw down loans when starting out.</p><p> The EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Phil Hogan, told our recent young farmers' conference about developments and funds available from the European Investment Bank.  There does not seem to be a clear view here at a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine level and Government level as to how this money, at lower interest rates through the rural development programme, can be funnelled into young farmers' hands in Ireland.  I would ask that the joint committee look into this issue.</p><p> In spite of the opportunities that exist, it would be remiss of me not to highlight briefly some of the challenges that remain for young farmers within the dairy industry.  As the only young farmers' representative body in the country, Macra na Feirme has a huge role to play in working with young farmers and members to identify the issues, speak about solutions, find ways to address them and then lobby policy makers for change to improve our lot.</p><p> Incomes and commodity prices remain issues this year particularly in the dairy, tillage and pig sectors.  Income volatility remains a huge challenge for the industry.  We welcome the establishment of the dairy forum by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  At the first meeting of the dairy forum, I called for a top-up for young dairy farmers here in Ireland when the package from the EU Commission is distributed.  I am delighted that the Minister has made a commitment to give young dairy farmers this top-up.</p><p> Macra na Feirme has also called for an income volatility bond to be put in place to help dairy farmers deal with the volatility and fluctuations in commodity prices, which are inevitable when selling on the world market.  Our vision is that farmers in a year of strong product prices can invest money in this bond and draw it down in a year of harder economic times.  This bond would go a long way towards addressing the issue of income volatility which is crippling young farmers.  When we proposed this to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine we were told State aid rules preclude this from being put in place.  We are asking for the committee&rsquo;s assistance to move this proposal forward and we would like to see the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine work with the EU Commission on this issue and help to develop workable solutions to overcome the State aid rules obstacles.</p><p> We are active young farmers who want to progress and develop our businesses.  We will do something to get something.  The CAP needs to be about rewarding active farmers, but the historical model does not promote active farming.  Nothing annoys young farmers more than to see their neighbours across the ditch farming extensively with low stocking rates and next to no farming activity, while receiving a significant payment based on their activity nearly 15 years ago.  Young farmers on the other side of the ditch, while very productive and driving on, have borrowings but are often receiving a very small or no basic payment.</p><p> Young farmers are happy to deliver on actions on climate change, food security and to ensure our economic viability.  There are young farmers who have fallen on their feet with a top-up and national reserve, but there are farmers who have fallen through the cracks and are not eligible for any of the measures.  There are farmers that are 26 years of age and eligible for no supports, and farmers who are 37 and receive all young farmer supports.</p><p> Young farmers want commitments that young farmers in the future will not fall through the cracks and this is the challenge we face in shaping the next CAP.  Supporting farmers to maximise the potential of their grazing infrastructure should also be a key component of the next CAP rural development programme.</p><p> What I have outlined are the issues and the realities on the ground.  I would like to thank the committee for inviting us to make these presentations today.  Macra na Feirme looks forward to hearing the views of committee members as well as working with them on the issues affecting young dairy farmers and, indeed, all young farmers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#GG00300"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  It is encouraging to see Mr. Finan's presentation about the future prospects for young farmers.  He has identified issues including access to land, credit and education.  Education will certainly play a huge role in the advancement of younger farmers in the years ahead.</p> <p>   Beef imports should be seen in the context of the TTIP proposals and the situation concerning production standards in the US, Canada and South America compared to those applicable in the EU.  If this is going to happen, we need a level playing pitch with the same standards.  Unless such operable standards are in place we should not proceed.  I would like to hear Macra na Feirme's views on that when its representatives respond.</p><p>Mr. Finan mentioned the 28 EU states that opted out regarding GM. Our representatives did not take that road.  Given that Scotland, Wales and the Six Counties have gone for the opt-out, does Mr. Finan believe it will have an effect on this country competing in the future, particularly with regard to good green production, environmentally friendly production and so forth?</p><p> Mr. Finan also mentioned feedlots.  I have been interested in this for a considerable time.  The feedlots are a mechanism to control and manipulate the market at the demand of the beef barons.  What is even more annoying is that people who had held prominent positions in farming authorisations in the past are complicit in this.  What can we do to stop that?  Can we bring in a regulation to do that?  Mr. Finan suggested these feedlots could be in breach of the competition laws or whatever.  I would appreciate it if he could enlighten us further on that.</p><p> Mr. Finan stated that there has been a reduction on exports for 2015.  We had a presentation to this committee which reckoned that approximately 150,000 extra cattle will come on stream in the coming year.  If there are not export provisions available for that, it can have a detrimental effect on prices for the producer in terms of getting back what they need.</p><p> I am glad that serious interest is being taken regarding the victims of the hen harrier.  That farmers in designated areas have been discriminated against is probably one of the greatest injustices.  People living in marginal areas had their land designated, with no compensation paid, and they now find they must try to get redress at this late stage.  I am glad that all the farming organisations are united behind this issue and I hope a resolution will be found that will give justice to the people who have been denied it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#HH00200"><p>I thank the members of the two groups for their presentations, which were very interesting.  Mr. Kent spoke earlier about the drop in milk prices and so on.  We all have great sympathy for people who have lost income and have made a huge investment in the milk sector, but their income is possibly higher than those of the farmers in sheep and beef.  I come from a sheep and beef background.</p> <p>  That brings me back to 2014, which was a very difficult year for beef farming.  On one occasion I was invited to Downpatrick where I saw more than 2,000 cattle from the west, and because of the stance on nomad cattle, the people there had difficulty getting those cattle slaughtered.  Those people were not coming back to the South to buy store cattle, which was a huge loss, and they are missed from the marketplace.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned that 150,000 extra cattle will come on stream in the next year or so and we have to be very careful to ensure the price of beef does not drop again.</p> <p>  We have to monitor carefully the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal because beef certainly will be the big loser in this regard.  Again, GM free growing of grain is a major concern to people, and many people raise this issue with us.  I believe either an all-Ireland approach is necessary or we should work with England and Scotland on this issue to ensure our clean, green image, for which we have always been known.  That might be the way forward and we should consider that.</p><p> We discussed feedlots earlier in our discussion.  It has been a major worry for us over the years that when the price of store cattle is low, factories can go out can fill up their sheds and then, when the price is rising a little bit, can, by putting their cattle onto the marketplace, undermine the genuine farmer who is trying to make a living.  Something needs to be put in place to address that issue.</p><p> The live exports business is very important, but the chart the delegates provided shows the drop in that sector in recent years.  We must be careful not to allow it to drop further, which will require ensuring the competition is there.  The sheep sector, too, must be supported but, again, we have seen a drop-off in the number of ewes in recent years.  A scheme must be put in place to address this, a point we have raised on several occasions.  We certainly will support the delegates' call for such a scheme.  The same applies in respect of sheep exports, which is something that is particularly relevant in Border areas.  We see Northern Ireland customers wanting to buy sheep from places like Wicklow and the Midlands, but there is a difficulty in bringing them from marts onto farms in the North.  They have to come off a farm.</p><p> In regard to the knowledge transfer programmes, dealing with beef, dairy and sheep, it is crucial that farmers are able to participate in at least two of them.  That is vital for farmers, both young and old, who want to get a little more knowledge.  The money involved is not huge and I agree that farmers should be able to have two programmes running.</p><p> The delegates from Macra na Feirme will know that we work very closely with their organisation in my part of the country, which is Leitrim and Sligo.  There was a reasonably good deal done for young farmers under the basic payment scheme.  However, as Mr. Finan noted, a lot of young farmers fell through the cracks.  There is a category of young farmers, or perhaps old young farmers, who may not have gained as much as they should have gained.  Their situation must be addressed.  Progress on partnerships, long-term leases and all of that is positive.  It is vital that we continue to work to find new ways to ensure younger farmers can get involved in those initiatives.  Our farming population is getting much too old and we must continue to see younger farmers entering the sector.  We worked very closely with Macra na Feirme on the appointment of 20 new Teagasc advisers to help young farmers who must have their green cert completed by 2016.  It is important that nothing is put in the way of that and people are not penalised.</p><p> On the availability of low-interest loans from the European Investment Bank, it does not matter whether a farmer is young or old; being able to access money at a low rates must be a good thing.  Everything must be explored in that regard to ensure it is possible for everybody to avail of the facility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  The two presentations we heard cover a broad spectrum of activity which probably covers all livestock.  The delegates from Macra na Feirme mainly focused on dairying, which, for reasons that are easy to understand, has been quite attractive to younger farmers in recent years.  I listened with interest to a recent media interview with a former IFA chairman who has switched from beef to dairy farming in more recent times.  People probably know who I am talking about without having to name him.  He spoke in the interview about where the dairy sector is at and the difficulties being experienced by farmers.  He also made the point, however, that difficult as this year has been, he will be in a far better position at year end than he was in the years he was involved in beef farming.  There seems be no getting away from the truth of that.  As Mr. Kent noted at the beginning of his contribution, beef farmers are used to ongoing volatility.</p> <p>  There was a particular emphasis on education in the Macra na Feirme presentation.  Speaking as a farmer, one has to wonder whether we have learned anything from the beef crisis of last year or the year before.  I had the opportunity last weekend to attend my local mart where I saw farmers buying weanlings at exorbitant prices.  It was a happy day for sellers, but buyers must be wondering how they will make money on their purchases in a year's time or whenever.</p><p>On the previous day, the trade was good at the ordinary sales.  Again, one would have to wonder if one was buying stores, how one would make money next spring.  This is repetitive.  Have we learned anything?  Even though the price dropped three years ago for bulls, in particular, farmers were paid huge amounts for stores the previous fall.  That expectation must be managed.  High prices can be paid for stores in the fall but one never knows what will happen three or four months down the line and we must plan for such volatility.  The same applies in the mixed sector to a certain extent.</p><p> There is plenty of evidence from New Zealand, Northern Ireland and elsewhere around the world of the difficulties dairy farmers have experienced over the past few years.  They have not concentrated enough on producing as much as possible in Northern Ireland using the cheapest product they have, which is grass.  That is the only way forward.</p><p> The same applies to the beef sector.   The cheapest produce in this country is grass and, this year, we are fortunate to have a good supply.  We want to achieve as much value out of that as possible and education is the crucial element.  Knowledge transfer has been very beneficial over the past few years and many good ideas have been exchanged in that regard.</p><p> There is no doubt more young farmers need to be encouraged into the system be it in dairying, sheep or beef.  The sheep sector is more challenging.  It is not as attractive to younger farmers and while I may be open to correction on that, this is what I am hearing on the ground.  An incentive needs to be provided in this sector.  The ICSA presentation referred to the provision of a &euro;25 million subsidy for sheep, which I would like to tease out.  Is the association proposing that this would come from unspent rural development funding or would it be additional money that would have to be sourced?  Is the association assuming rural development funding will be under-spent?  Would Ireland have to get permission for another scheme if that was the case?  Would the Minister have to go cap-in-hand to Europe again seeking permission for another scheme for sheep alone or could we devise a scheme of our own for the unspent money?</p><p> There has been a good deal of discussion about feedlots.  A total of 25% of beef is produced through the feedlots at the moment.  I may be open to correction on that but I saw that figure somewhere in the past.  Many farmers have gone down that road and they have signed contracts in recent times with factories to produce beef in this manner.  It is open to question whether it is right or wrong.  Farmers in this line of business says that is the only way they can make money.  One can see why that would distort the market.  We need to try to balance that.</p><p> Both presentations dealt with European legislation in respect of competition in the marketplace.  Everybody present is on the one page in that regard.  Commissioner Hogan, shortly after he took up the position, said this was one of his key objectives.  The committee produced a substantial report two years ago in this regard.  European legislation seems to be the best way forward and it is crucial to move that to the next level.  We have talked about it for long enough and we need to see action.  Everybody needs to be on the one page to galvanise support to move it on.</p></speech>

I join with them on it because we would be certifiable if we did not stand strong on this.  As I said earlier this afternoon, we are small and special.  We are the only country in the world that is green in a satellite picture.  We can be different from the rest of the world.  We should never think big; we should think big among ourselves, but we are only a spot in the world, although we are extremely special, and we must always think together about how to add value to what we grow and raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Kent" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#LL00200"><p>On my way here I went to a sustainability summit in the Aviva Stadium, met some very interesting people and heard some interesting presentations.  I was a little disappointed that the biggest presentation was by the biggest chemical company in the US, the Dow Chemical Company.  Some of these chemical companies want to get control of the seeds.  They sell genetically modified seeds, and under their contracts farmers must use their products, so they are forced into producing GM crops.  The entire industry is based on this big chain of getting profit back to the big multinationals.  They do not want labelling.  In the United States they do not want food labelled, despite the fact that more than 90% of consumers want labelling.  They fight us with huge funds to prevent food labelling even though consumers want to know what they are eating.</p> <p>  The health of consumers is decreasing.  Ireland is destined to become the most obese nation in Europe in a very short time.  On Sunday, a group of Swedish people came to see my cattle.  I produce Belgian Blue cattle on my farm.  They found it on the Internet and two busloads came to see my cattle.  I also took them to a local dairy farm.  I thought they were very fit and agile people.  A similar busload of people from Ireland might not be quite so fit, and I fear for the health of Irish people.  The announcement by the World Health Organization that sparked cancer fears was not about red meat as such but processed red meat.  There is risk that it could be misinterpreted, and people will not want to eat the lovely, sumptuous grass-fed lamb and beef that we produce here, which is life-enhancing, increases longevity and reduces susceptibility to cancer, obesity and a whole lot of degenerative diseases, including brain disorders.  There is a massive lack of marketing from an Irish perspective.</p> <p>  We have dropped the ball on this one with regard to not declaring ourselves GM-free.  We cannot grow GM crops here, as there is no possible crop we can grow, but we certainly will be competing against cattle fed on genetically modified feed, antibiotics, antimicrobials and in-feed additives.  In the United States, 20 feedlots produce more than half of all cattle, and if the attention of one of those feedlots was directed towards the European market it would scuttle us because their unit cost of production is much lower.  There are massive question marks about the healthiness of this product.  If the product from such a producer went to McDonald's it would take away a lot of our market for forequarter beef.  If it went into restaurants it would take away our higher-price market.  Our unit size here is quite small and we are very vulnerable.  Many small family farms depend on their beef and lamb enterprises.  They would be out of business.  They could not survive.  What will be done with all of the people leaving farming if this is not protected?</p> <p>  Labelling is a huge issue.  Deputy Ferris mentioned the missed opportunity on GM and feedlot controls.  There are a few very large factory farm units in Ireland and they receive very large single farm payments.  Deputy Deering spoke about the weanling price and education.  The person getting the high price for those weanlings needs every penny and I cannot say the person received too much for them.</p><p>I know the cost of production and the amount of work that goes into such a process so we cannot talk against the price of cattle.  Price is open to the free market but we need more support in respect of beef.  We need more investment in rural Ireland in order to make it vibrant.  Recently, I spoke to a broadcaster who said there was a slight bit more buoyancy in rural Ireland because beef prices this year were not quite so bad.  I said to him that if the same happened again and we got 50 cent per pound, then rural Ireland would be lifted up which would mean that people could commit and invest more.  Farmers are great at spending money because they will do up a shed, extend their house or whatever.  They do not pocket their profits but they need a rainy day fund, as mentioned by Deputy Martin Ferris.  Mr. John Comer, who made his presentation before me, certainly referred to it.  We included it in our pre-budget submissions as well.  We referred to the Australian scheme whereby farmers can put their money away for a rainy day but pay tax on it later when they draw it down.  For farmers, such an initiative would act as a bulwark against a bad year.  Ireland suffers weather events slightly more frequently now and prices have been affected.  Therefore, we need such a fund to be provided during a good year.  Unfortunately, farmers have not had many good years in recent times.  A fund would act as a bulwark against a bad year.</p><p> Senator Comiskey mentioned the nomadic cattle issue.  I agree with him that it is a huge problem which needs to be addressed.</p><p> I have spoken to Mr. Mark Durkan, MLA, and Minister for the Environment in the North of Ireland.  He had suggested to his ministerial counterpart in the South that both jurisdictions join together and declare the island a GM-free zone.  He was shocked that such an initiative did not happen and he wants to know why.  We need to ask the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine why it did not happen.  We have not received a satisfactory answer for why that date was passed.  We need to ask why repeatedly until we get a satisfactory answer.  Were these people lobbied by somebody else?  I wish to declare that we lobbied them in the other direction and to declare the island a GM-free zone.  If there was lobbying in the other direction, then we need to know immediately who did so and why.</p><p> There has been a drop in sheep numbers.  I have a very able sheep chairman seated on my left and he will address the matter.  I also have a beef chairman seated on my right.  We need a scheme for sheep and the money seems to be available.</p><p> Knowledge transfer programmes are very important, as is education.  I personally believe that there are huge question marks about the type of education that some young farmers are being forced into enduring in order to qualify for a green certificate.  In order to qualify for schemes, young farmers must undertake courses of varying levels.  It seems that the mantra is "Produce more for less" but there is no future in producing more for less.  We want to get more and then we will produce more.  One also hears that by 2050 there will be 9 billion people in the world so farmers must get busy.  We are going be dead by 2050.  We will certainly will not be farming at that stage and if we are then we will be going about on two sticks.  A few old crocks is all that will be left farming in Ireland at that time if TTIP is approved because young people will have emigrated to farm elsewhere.  Recently I heard the phrase in a film to get busy living or get busy dying.  We will certainly be busy dying as farmers if TTIP runs through without giving us proper food labelling and a proper price for our product.  The Irish product is far superior to what is available in the United States of America where its people are even more obese than they are here.  There are question marks regarding the education provided.</p><p> The next issue is knowledge transfer and mentoring by older farmers.  I have spoken to a lot of older successful farmers who have been through the programme.  There seems to be a lot of mentoring done in business as well.  The farming sector should have more mentoring rather than scientists trying to sell junk science.  There are a lot more false prophets than ever before and they are sponsored.  The sponsorship of the likes of Teagasc by a meat company that tells farmers to get busy producing more.  The company is going to set up a 125-acre farm in the west of Ireland which will have 100 suckler cows but only one man running the farm.  All of the cattle for beef production will be fed using an intensive indoor meal system.  I shudder when I think of the kind of product that such a farm will produce.</p><p>A similar dairy system exists in Kilkenny and it was shocking to see how many cattle died there when the region suffered extreme weather last year.  The case was mentioned in the newspapers a few weeks ago.  If animal welfare people saw what happens at that location, pressure would be put on farming in Ireland.  We should not set up examples that show how inefficient farmers are.  We must set up examples that show how good we are at producing high-quality food.  We should not pressurise farmers further but pay them adequately to produce more if they can afford to do so.  I shall not say too much more.</p><p> Senator Mary Ann O'Brien mentioned the TTIP labelling issue.  We have dropped the ball on the GM issue.  We have got pick it up, run with it and batten down the hatches in respect of it.  I shall ask my two able chairmen to comment.</p></speech>

Everything is down to control.  We have a handful of beef barons who control the meat industry, a handful of retailers and, as Mr. Kent said, a handful of chemical companies control our inputs.</p> <p>  Feed lots control the marketplace.  I have written about the issue for a long time and some people have claimed that I try to talk down prices.  All I want is for farmers to hear a realistic view.  People may feel they are paying too much but I do not know about that.  I do know that the man who produces store cattle must get paid as well.</p> <p>  A big mistake was made a few years ago when the ban on below-cost selling was removed.  Retailers do not sell stuff below cost out of altruistic tendencies that they may have but do so in order to entice people into their stores.  If there was a ban on below-cost buying, retailers would have to pay the producer a living wage and could do what they wanted with the product afterwards.  If retailers buy cheap, they force the producer to sell cheap.</p> <p>  In terms of prices, we all know how bad beef prices were last year.  I predict that the situation will be worse next year because more cattle have been born in 2015 than in 2012.  Those animals will come on the market at the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017.  I do not know how we will get around this problem unless we live exports are permitted to proceed.  I am of the view that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has paid lip service to the issue and that nobody really wants the cattle to be exported.  People have claimed that the current situation will keep jobs in the country.  That may be so and in a perfect world I would agree but when production in the factories climbs over 30,000 cattle a week then the price goes down which has always been the way.  We have had Harvest 2020 and more recently 2025 where both programmes talked about ramping up production.  There is no point in upping production when the price is going down.  Last year 10% extra meat was produced in 2014 when compared with 2013.  As a result, the price was reduced by more than 10% which meant farmers got less money for 10% extra production even though they had 10% extra cost.  Therefore, farmers were much worse off and that is all I shall say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Brooks" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015110300002#NN00400"><p>I am delighted to speak on the sheep issue and to represent the ICMSA.  First, I wish to point out that there are 33,000 sheep farmers in Ireland and many of them farm land that is suitable for no other enterprise.  On a positive note, we welcome the reintroduction of the sheep fencing grants and the fact that the conversion of existing buildings into slatted sheds is now allowable under TAMS.  However, we question why refurbishment or retrofitting of existing farm buildings, under farm safety and animal welfare issues, were not included under TAMS.</p> <p>  In the context of what we have said here on the issue of the live export of sheep, live exporters have told us regularly that there are markets on the Continent for sheep, store lambs, feeding ewes, etc.  The current system means that if somebody on the Continent or in the UK wishes to buy sheep in Ireland, the animals must be retained on the farm for at least 21 days and up to 30 days, depending on the reading of the rules by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We believe that such a stipulation is crazy and that the same system for the export of suckler calves should apply to sheep.</p> <p>  One of the members asked from where would the sum of &euro;25 million that we mentioned to fund the sheep scheme come.  We believe that &euro;25 million is a small percentage of the overall rural development fund and that there will be underspends in respect of some of the existing schemes.  We also believe that improving Exchequer returns may mean additional funding can be provided for the scheme.  It is vital that we have some sort of sheep scheme.</p><p>Sheep farming has been neglected.  We fared very poorly under the reference years because of the system that was in place at the time.  Now we are faring very poorly under the current rural development programme, as we have been left out.  In comparison a sum of &euro;52 million has been allocated to the suckler scheme.  We are calling for a scheme with an allocation of at least &euro;25 million for sheep farmers. </p></speech>

The land mobility programme is delivering.  We know there are more farmers over the age of 80 years than under the age of 35 years.  This programme is addressing that issue and is encouraging more young blood into the industry by encouraging young farmers to become involved in different arrangements.  The benefit is that the landowner retains ownership of his land while at the same time the young farmers get an opportunity to get into the industry and develop themselves within the industry.  We also welcome the farm transfer partnerships proposal in the recent budget, which will have a major impact and will encourage more young blood into the industry.</p> <p>  The collaborative farming scheme which is part of the rural development programme is beneficial and has a very important role in the land mobility programme.  Senator Comiskey also raised the question of access to finance, which is a significant issue and I call on the committee to help in ensuring the European Investment Bank funding, which the Commissioner speaks about, can be drawn down in Ireland.  We are led to believe there is a mechanism for young farmers to draw down money at low interest rates and we would like the committee to focus on this issue which would help us as we will be working on it as well.</p> <p>  Macra na Feirme was founded in 1944 to give young farmers practical skills in agriculture.  Thankfully the education system has evolved since then and the formal education system has developed.  We are constantly in contact with Teagasc about coming up with ways of improving the current system for young farmers so that they can get the skills they require to develop their businesses.  </p> <p>  I spoke earlier about a training needs analysis that we carried out earlier in the year.  The analysis identified that young farmers wanted upskilling on the practical skills.  Some three to five years after finishing their agriculture education, they realise they have a deficiency in particular skills and that is where our programme to try to deal with the practical skills comes in.  The young farmers do not want to go into a classroom and sit down and take plenty of notes.  They want to go on a course for a day and on the following morning implement the practices they have learned on their home farms.  This is very important.  </p> <p>  Teagasc is unique in that it combines research with its education and advisory service.  That allows a knowledge transfer through the system, which is very important.  We always encourage young farmers to upskill in agriculture.  My colleague Mr. Bryan Hynes, a young dairy farmer will take us through the importance of focusing on the key drivers of profitability.</p> <p>  Deputy Deering also spoke about the price being paid for stores at present.  I am a beef farmer and store cattle are dear.  We encourage our young farmers to budget, which is critical, so as to ensure they know the cost of production.  Young farmers need to be conscious of their budgets and what they can get out of their business. </p> <p>  I now hand over to Mr. Bryan Hynes, chairman of our agricultural affairs committee.</p></speech>

We had a beef farm.  I am in the process of expanding and developing a dairy herd.  Older farmers will tell you that expansion is expensive.  As Deputy Deering mentioned we have to make the most of grass.  I question whether the current grants are delivering that outcome.  The TAMS scheme delivers grants for concrete slatted units.  However, young farmers need to invest in the profit drivers that will make them money, such as roadways, grazing infrastructure, water tanks, reseeding, PK and lime requirements and land drainage, for which there are no grants.  If we want to make money in the short term, that is what we need to do, then we will be able to afford sheds.  We are at the stage, where when the young farmer gets the farm, everybody is asking him if he is building a shed.  I am telling farmers not to build as the cost of doing so will cripple him or her.  We need to invest in what will make money in the short term.  We can and need to be innovative.  When young farmers are starting out, they should get help to rent sheds.  I worry about the impact of encouraging high investment in concrete from day one.</p></speech>

On that salutary common sense note, I will draw the meeting to a close.</p> <p>  I thank the representative from ICSA and Macra na Feirme for coming before us.  I thank them for bearing with the process as the session was longer than anticipated.  We will take up many of the recommendations and incorporate them in the committee's work.  This follows on from what we did earlier on the volatility report.  A number of the same issues arise in terms of the market management tools, finance, the taxation code, State aid rules regarding the rainy day fund deposit scheme, similar to the Macra na Feirme bond.  They all amount to the very same thing, a protection mechanism, without having to bring in another global insurance company to extract more money out of the system for the purpose of providing a very expensive insurance scheme, the point made by John Comer.  These are the main points I have drawn from today's meeting, but there are plenty of others as well.  We are cognisant of TTIP, because we discussed it during our extended private session.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation and this opportunity to speak today.  I will read my three page presentation and then will be delighted to answer any questions members may have.</p> <p>  Innopharma Labs is an award-winning Irish technology and training company.  I set up the company in 2009 after having worked in the pharmaceutical sector for ten years and then the food sector for four years.  In terms of the technology side of the business, we operate a research and development budget in excess of &euro;8 million in collaboration with multiple international academic institutions and industries.  We sell these analytical technologies globally to the pharmaceutical, medical technology, food and fine chemical sectors.  One of the things we do is to develop sensors and cameras that control how one binds powders together before proceeding to make tablets.  We are now in more than 20 countries around the world.  Earlier this year we launched our business in India and that is where we hope there will be major growth in the market for the technological side of the business over the next five years.</p> <p>  Education is another side of the business.  We are one of this country's leading providers of innovative training programmes in the pharma, food technology and medical devices industries.  We employ 27 full-time staff and more than 40 associate lecturers and industry professionals.  Our courses are run nationwide in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and along the east coast.</p> <p>  Through the Springboard and MOMENTUM initiatives, in excess of 2,000 people have completed our upskilling and training programmes since 2010 which have focused on providing in-demand industry skills.  Over 70% of participants have returned to employment within six months of completing their programme and many people have returned to employment before the six-month mark.  This proves that the Innopharma Labs' specifically recruited team and jobs-centred approach works.</p> <p>  I will outline the opportunity for Ireland.</p><p> The economy is recovering with the private sector creating jobs.  The pharmaceutical and medtech sectors never stopped creating jobs as they have been doing well even during the past five years.  A gap has emerged, however, in providing the necessary qualified personnel in Ireland&rsquo;s science, technology and engineering sectors, particularly the pharmaceutical, food technology and medical devices industries.  Positions are, and will be, available but major companies in Ireland struggle to fill them with Irish graduates and workers at present.  Attracting appropriately skilled labour into Ireland can be expensive.  There is a global shortage of personnel with such STEM skill sets, and this is not confined to Ireland.  I have been to India twice this year.  Even India is struggling although it is producing 2.5 million science and engineering graduates every year.  This is an international challenge.  It is also leading to the outsourcing of some of the services that we could provide in Ireland when we are building a new pharmaceutical company or supporting an existing company in engineering facility design and start up activities.  This skills deficit is a risk to the accelerated growth currently being experienced by these industries and will have an impact on future foreign direct investment decisions in the life science sector. </p><p> What I am saying is no longer news.  The expert skills groups from 2013 to 2015, inclusive, have been discussing the skills gaps and have invested in upskilling programmes, such as Springboard and Momentum, in these sectors.  There is also a consensus that Ireland needs to increase its output of STEM graduates over the next five years.  A further education and training strategy document dealing with that was published by SOLAS last year.  We want to anchor our current graduates in Ireland in order to meet the needs of technology and science driven companies.  We want to ensure that our third level institutions are continuing to increase the number of science, technology and engineering graduates.  We need to increase the number of secondary school students who study these subjects.  We need to ensure that we can attract people with those skills to return home.  We need to hold on to our STEM graduates.  We cannot let them go abroad unless they want to but we must ensure we have the right industries to keep them interested in staying in Ireland.  Even after doing all that, we must ask how we can fill the gap that results from insufficient STEM graduates.</p><p> We must take the opportunity to upskill people from other sectors and using cross-skilling initiatives prepare them for the pharmaceutical sector.  There are various ways to try to fill that skills gap.  I am aware of the need to introduce an early warning system that would highlight at risk jobs, where redundancies may occur, and take the opportunity to transfer people from companies or industries that are at risk to higher value roles and-or roles where there are great opportunities for career development.  We are interested in supporting such initiatives.  There is a requirement to implement a nationwide approach to ensure there is a nationwide economic recovery. </p><p> Innopharma Labs proposes the expansion of an agile third level education fund that can rapidly react to industry skills needs and upskilling for the unemployed and at risk employed in Ireland through evaluating certain outcomes to ensure they meet current and future industry needs.  I will outline some of the roles of this agile third level education fund.  These projects should focus on enabling the long-term unemployed, particularly those under 25 years and recently unemployed, to return to work through upskilling; enabling those in at risk or in low-paid sectors to cross-skill to more stable and value-adding sectors; increasing the number of STEM based graduates and helping to meet national STEM targets through cross-skilling these at risk participants and people who are unemployed with STEM skills; enabling emigrants to return to Ireland through providing upskilling and bridging services; providing a rich supply of skill sets and human capital necessary to maintain the up-turn in high-tech manufacturing in Ireland over the next five years and beyond; and reacting to specific industry skill set needs in a rapid and flexible manner.  Some components of this agile and nationwide third level upskilling are currently funded through Springboard and other similar upskilling initiatives.  This could potentially continue to be the vehicle for funding such initiatives.</p><p> The jobs secured by Innopharma Labs trainees are located throughout Ireland, supporting balanced regional development.  In the past year alone, more than 600 people trained by Innopharma Labs found jobs in high-end manufacturing who otherwise would have remained unemployed.</p><p>It is not just Dublin-based.  As can be seen from the table, in Galway, there are well over 80 jobs, predominantly in the medtech sector.  In Limerick, it was mostly medtech as well, involving mostly long-term unemployed individuals in a project we focused on there, which I will talk about later.  There are 380 along the east coast from Waterford to Louth, including Dublin, in pharma, medtech, food and chemicals and, for example, Intel, which wanted to hire graduates with a good manufacturing qualification.  They hire our graduates.  There are food and pharma jobs in Cork.  Westmeath and Roscommon, through a programme delivered in Athlone, are doing well in the medtech and pharma sectors predominantly, as are Kerry, Sligo and Mayo.  Many of these 600 jobs went to jobseekers who were long-term unemployed.  They would not have been filled through conventional approaches, as they were attained through a great deal of networking by our team and our graduates and support from the Innopharma Labs industry liaison team.  That sounds fancy, but it involves people being on the road every day talking to companies in the pharma, medtech and food technology sectors and asking them questions such as what jobs they are hiring for, what skill gaps they have now and what skill gaps they will have next year, and whether they will consider hiring graduates from our programmes.  We try to use a matchmaking process in which we engage with the industry and the graduates.</p><p> I refer to Exchequer savings to provide context and to validate the logic of the proposal.  We are happy to provide detailed figures.  Assuming an annual number of 10,000 students participating in upskilling, an average saving to the Exchequer per unemployed participant of &euro;15,000 - currently the Government uses &euro;20,000 as the calculated saving to the Exchequer when someone moves from unemployment to employment - an average annual starting salary of &euro;30,000, or &euro;18 per hour, which would be typical for graduates of our programmes based on these sectors, and an average worse-case cost per student to the programme of &euro;6,000, there will be a direct net saving to the Exchequer of &euro;120 million over five years.  These are first-time graduates who do not have a third level qualification.  To get people on the third level ladder and start thinking about higher-value roles is an intangible but it is important in terms of manoeuvring people who are unemployed or people who are at risk of employment in lower-value roles into higher-value roles with good career opportunities.</p><p> With student coaches supporting the participants, industry experts delivering the training, and industry liaison specialists engaging with companies on a daily basis, we have developed a tailor-made team for successful upskilling.  Innopharma Labs' training programmes are designed in conjunction with industry - pharma, medtech and food companies - as well as representative bodies.  This is one of the reasons behind the huge success rate for graduates in finding employment.  With 70% of graduates finding employment within six months of programme completion, we are not only delivering for industry but helping to create jobs, because some of these jobs would not have been filled had our graduates and staff not been out networking and looking for opportunities.  We picked an example in Limerick because it is ongoing and it is fresh in our minds.  A recent upskilling programme with a focus on long-term unemployment has realised a back-to-work result of more than 70%, with graduates who were previously unemployed between 18 months and six years, some as far back as the Dell closures in 2009, now working in high-value roles within the local medtech sector in companies such as Teleflex Medical, Vistakon, Beckman Coulter and Reagecon.</p><p> Our programmes range from level 6, certificate level, all the way up to level 9, and our accreditation partners for the programmes are the Institute of Technology Tallaght, with which we have worked strongly for the past five years, and Griffith College for some of our pharma business programmes.  We do a survey of industry every year and the feedback two years ago was that more graduates who were savvy in the pharma business, rather than pure technical graduates, were needed.  They wanted good supervisors and managers who understood the bigger picture and could run meetings and so on.</p><p>Therefore, we developed several pharma business-type programmes in collaboration with Griffith College.  From the initial programme design, student recruitment and intensive training, all the way through to taking up employment, the programmes are designed to support participants' job readiness.  Work preparation, student coaching and industry engagement are integral components of the programmes.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  We at Innopharma Labs are very proud of what we do.  Our team works really hard and it is very rewarding when we receive e-mails, as we do on a daily and weekly basis, from programme participants who were out of work for two years, for example, and have just got their first pay cheque.  We have been involved in this initiative for the past five years and felt it was time to make the committee aware of our successes and explain what members are supporting on behalf of the taxpayer.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

This all goes back to 2010 and it relates to the Deputy's first question about which aspect of our activities came first.  I did a programme in Harvard in 2008 in the course of which I engaged with Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a number of projects.  I was very interested in what I saw there, which was a really strong emphasis on education coupled with research and development activity and technology commercialisation.  Nobody else in Ireland is doing what we do in the area of technology development.  In fact, there are only a few companies in the world that do what we do in terms of the centres and technologies we develop.  In 2009, when we were trying to figure out the risks that were presenting for our company, one of the issues we identified was that there were not many people who could service and sell our technologies and understand pharmaceutical processes in the way we needed them to do.  In other words, we identified a need to develop our own skilled people.  At that time there was a labour market activation fund call for education, and we worked with ITT Dublin to put in a call around that.</p> <p>  The typical graduate participating on that programme was an unemployed person who had perhaps worked formerly in the construction sector, had a civil engineering or architecture qualification and was good at managing people and projects.  Together with ITT Dublin, we developed a level 8 special purpose award with a pharmaceutical focus which formed a subset of participants' final year degree in science.  That programme was delivered over a six-month period, the objective being to bring people who were working in the construction sector through a successful transition to the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors.  That is an example of one of our programmes.  In subsequent years, we listened to industry in order to understand where the unemployment challenges were.  As a result, we went down the education ladder to level 6, to provide a pharma, medtech or food entry-type qualification for people with a leaving certificate.  We also went up the ladder to provide a master's programmes for graduates who want to work in an analytical laboratory.  Those graduates might come from an environmental science or forensics background but do not understand the tablet manufacturing side of things.  The master's programme allowed them to transition into laboratory analyst roles in the pharma sector.</p></speech>

They would be familiar with the content of our courses.  We have people on the road every day engaging with food, pharma and medtech companies, in addition to recruitment companies.  We try to trigger vacancies and hiring, especially among small and medium-sized companies.  Especially in the medtech and food sectors, there are smaller businesses and there is always concern over hiring people.  They feel hassled figuring out who they should hire.  That we are removing some of these barriers and making it easier for companies to hire people is helping them.  We get calls from larger medtech or pharma companies if they are going through a major change.  They might need five or ten extra staff, particularly at operator level, because they have got more orders and because their projections for the following year are looking really strong.</p></speech>

There is a real opportunity.  We have not figured it out absolutely yet, but more returned emigrants are approaching us.  It is more of a passive phenomenon right now.  Emigrants return and then approach us saying they have certain skills and qualifications and they ask how they could enter pharma.  That is the type of engagement.  There are many more people who are still abroad who could benefit from these types of programmes.</p> <p>  The skills and experience emigrants generate abroad do not always match up with what exists in Ireland.  Even with pharma, for example, there are more clinical trials, research and development and hardcore research abroad.  Here there is less of that happening, but the returned emigrants would be brilliant at supporting roles more associated with formulation development and technical support.  It is through generating an understanding of how that transfer could happen that we have helped people in the past.  There are opportunities in that regard.</p></speech>

This debate is really enlightening.  We recognise that we must be much more flexible in the workforce because larger companies are changing rapidly.</p> <p>  I have been harping on about apprenticeships for many years.  Did Dr. Jones make a submission to the Apprenticeship Council of Ireland at the time the question?  He referred to an entry level of level 6.  There are considerable opportunities for young people to get away from what was perceived as a third level style education and move towards a more practical, apprenticeship-based education.  Has Dr. Jones done something on this?</p></speech>

Over the years, third-level education institutions, particularly colleges and universities, have been very inflexible with regard to the requirements of the workforce.  How does the witness find that?  Are colleges becoming much more flexible and adaptable to what is required of a student emerging from college life in order to make him or her employable, as opposed to the course being the most important element?  The end product should be a job for the student.</p></speech>

There is a dichotomy between servicing a typical CAO or leaving certificate student and servicing an evening student who may be working.  There is a third group - I suppose it is now a trichotomy - of people who are currently unemployed or unsure where they want to go, and who perhaps need to be supported more.  That is where we seem to fit, and we find that we have been able to develop a structure and process in marketing to them.  We advertise on Facebook and the <i>Galway Advertiser</i>, for example, not only to individuals but to mams, dads and grannies.  They may see it and encourage people to meet us.  We meet everyone who comes into our programme and do not take anybody unless we meet first to determine the level of motivation and suitability.  That is not a bad thing, as we want to ensure people are comfortable signing up for a minimum six-month programme, especially if they have a mortgage - for example, if they are nine months behind on it and they have three kids.  We do not want to waste such people's time.  We want to ensure people will have a great chance of getting a role in the pharmaceutical, medical technology or food sectors.<br/><br/>When individuals come on our programme, we have life coaches who engage with everybody on a one-to-one basis to help them understand the position - this is their three-year plan or five-year plan - and help to manage the self-esteem issues or challenges that go side-by-side with being unemployed.  We are engaged in the industry liaison side, helping people understand roles, providing introductions and facilitating matchmaking.  We have developed a tailor-made process, and it would have been very hard for an institute of technology to do all that.  The institutes of technology are still serving a very good role in terms of engagement with industry and being the third-level leaders in industry-focused education, but we see ourselves as having developed a strong role also.</p></speech>

Our team has come from the industry, so many of our team have been senior leaders internationally and domestically in pharma and medical technology companies.  They know us as individuals and what our reputation stands for and also as a brand; we are lucky that five or six years later we have many alumni now hiring graduates.

In November 2011, Fasttrack to Information Technology, FIT, came before the committee.  This organisation involves information technology companies which work together to ensure the skills gaps in the sector are met in some fashion.  It always strikes me as bizarre that although this country is still in an unemployment crisis we have a skills crisis in certain sectors, which is an international skills crisis as such.  According to analysis, what are the skills gaps?  Are there figures on the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors in the State which show they are shy 5,000 or 2,000 staff?  What is the analysis of the number shortages at skill levels from technician to doctorate level?</p></speech>

The skills document published by the expert skills group in June or July referenced particular skills gaps.  It did not mention numbers, but I can give Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n a broad overview if it would be helpful.  The basic feedback we have from the industry shows that in the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors in particular there are still skills gaps at operator level all the way through to specific technical roles, such as validation engineers, commissioning engineers and technology specialists.  From an analytical perspective in the laboratory, there are also many gaps.  We see opportunities to match these to unemployed people.  If people do not have a third level qualification, their first would be at operator level.  If people come to us with a degree in environmental science or another science qualification, they transition into laboratory roles.  The validation-engineer-type roles which are cited as being a gap are rarely entry-level positions.  People usually migrate there having previously worked as operators or laboratory analysts.</p></speech>

Is there any information on how the education sector has reoriented itself over the past four or five years to fill this skills gap?  The CAO form has approximately 1,400 college courses.  How have these altered over the past four or five years to resolve this problem?</p></speech>

I know there was a trend towards the generalisation of degrees and a migration towards broader science qualifications, and I agree with this approach for 18 year old leaving certificate students.  They should do a broad qualification first and then specialise once they understand the industry dynamics four years later, or if they figure out they do not like chemistry they can do something else.  Beyond this trend towards more generalisation of qualifications, I am not aware of any other reaction measures by the institutes of technology or universities towards meeting specific skills gaps or industry requirements.</p></speech>

Of the 2,000, some were unemployed for four, six or nine months and were aged 23 or 24.  Probably 800 of the 2,000 would have been under 25.

It has been a very good partner with us.  There is an opportunity in terms of broadening it to the at-risk group to which I referred, namely, people who may be about to be made redundant or who are in an at-risk or industry category.  It could also be broadened to those who have a degree but are working in a corner shop and are stuck in a cycle whereby they cannot pursue a Springboard course unless they are unemployed but they do not want to be unemployed because they want to keep some money coming in.  There is an opportunity for the category of people earning no more than &euro;23,000 or &euro;24,000 per year to further their education and career prospects by entering programmes such as ours by means of a Springboard-funded vehicle.  That is another group in which we are very interested, as well as the emigrant group.</p> <p>  It is expensive to get our word out in Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Dubai or wherever, but there is a real opportunity to do so.  We have dipped our toe in the water through Facebook in trying to attract people home and that has worked.  People have returned from New Zealand, Australia and Canada in order to access our programmes.  It is a small percentage because we have not marketed it sufficiently abroad.  We are interested in attracting that cohort, as well as the groups that are at risk, those on lower wages of pay who should not be forgotten about - there are great opportunities for them to develop in their careers - and the emigrant Irish.</p></speech>

In terms of challenges, we will have more and more automation.  As a result, we will need more and more people with software, programming and strong hard engineering skills.  The cloud will have much more influence.  We are now trying to develop programmes and the technology side of our business is also migrating that way.  Not only do we have a sensor which measures how granules are formed, we are also developing solutions so that we can see from Dublin how granules are being formed in Shanghai.  Remote controlability is becoming very important and it will have an impact on the sector.</p> <p>  In the pharma and food sectors, there will be more automation and intensification.  We need more and more people who understand lean processes and how to make products more efficiently and in a safe manner.  That is something that will be a requirement as we grow.  If we want to continue to grow our levels of employment in Ireland and attract foreign direct investment in the high-end manufacturing sector, we will need more people who have an appreciation for lean automation, working within teams and understanding processing data in terms of what it is telling them.  All of those skills will be really important five years from now.  They are already important.</p></speech>

My bank manager asked me many of those questions in terms of business growth.  How long have we been in business?  I founded the company in 2009, so we have been in business for six years.  Approximately 40% or 45% of the work is on the education side and the other half is on the technology side.  Do we charge?  No.  For State-funded projects, we do not charge anything on top of that - whether to the individual or the company.  There are no placement fees or anything of that nature.  We offer private programmes for people working in the pharmaceutical, medical device or food sectors.  Our master's degree programmes are popular but there are also many people with a leaving certificate who are working in the pharma sector and who might have been doing so for the past 20 years.  They are being encouraged by their employers to start thinking about third level.  We are starting to engage with operators and technicians to get their first ever qualifications.  That is part-funded by both industry and the employee.</p> <p>  Senator Mullins asked whether we charge on the non-Springboard side.  We engage with pharma companies and medical device technology companies to try to develop bespoke programmes for them.  However, that is a long process.  We try to engage with various pharma companies to improve things, particularly on the pharma business side.  Often these companies have supervisors who are good at operating a schedule and managing three or four people.  The companies want these supervisors to elevate to team leader or manager positions where they can manage ten people, communicate the plan for the coming three months and so on.  These pharma business programmes are proving to be very successful with industry.</p> <p>  There was a question about at-risk companies.  It is a tricky question.  What are the indicators which determine a company is at risk?  I can offer examples of how we engaged with the Lufthansa employees but that case was after the fact.  Some of those individuals were unemployed for six months before they came on one of our programmes.  We would like to intervene earlier and act as a partner with at-risk companies earlier in the process.  Given that I have name-checked Lufthansa, I am keen to point out that those involved have been brilliant employees in the transition to the pharma and medical devices technology sectors.  They have high-end skills given their work with engines and other high-end equipment.  The transition to the pharma and medical sectors has been quite a success for them.</p></speech>

I missed part of the presentation.  Innopharma Labs strikes me as a rather unusual company in that, in the first instance, it is a direct employer and obviously a successful one.  However, alongside that, the company provides training programmes and work for unemployed people who may then leave the company and go and work with competitors.</p><p>It strikes me as laudable, but unusual.  Is taking that responsibility a unique approach?</p></speech>

We are not a giant, but we have a global market for our sensors and our customer base in Ireland is not large.  Conversely to what the Deputy said, it is industry-led education and we are the company that is leading it and developing content.  This is based on an appreciation of an international dynamic not just a domestic one.  We are engaged with Rutgers University, Purdue University, Pfizer, GSK, Boston Scientific, Kerry Group and so on around the world.  We have a good appreciation of what is happening in those sectors globally and are developing content and programmes that meet the needs of those industries.  Understanding the global dynamic ensures that our graduates are relevant at a domestic level as well.</p> <p>  There is no conflict.  At least, we have never encountered one.  We have hired many students from our programmes.  That is brilliant, as they are adding great value to Innopharma Labs.  If one considers our Springboard or Momentum programmes, our metric is all about getting people jobs.  We do not mind whether they work with us, although we are delighted if they do.  The most important factor is whether they get jobs and are happy.</p></speech>

The quicker that occurs, the better.  The timetable at national school level needs to be rotated to ensure, for example, that Irish is not the only subject taught between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Subjects need to be rotated and it is important for all our children that we become comfortable with change as opposed to the <i>status quo</i>.</p></speech>

However, we would be interested in understanding more about this issue.  We know, for example, that the Spanish pharmaceutical market is similar in size to the market in Ireland, employing approximately 40,000 employees directly and indirectly.  The Irish and Spanish markets are, therefore, a good fit, as is the market in Italy.  There may be opportunities elsewhere, particularly in areas where unemployment levels are high, notably among those aged under 25 years.  With good science and engineering qualifications, there could be a good fit.</p></speech>

Before we move on to Committee Stage of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, we must consider a motion that, like the aforementioned Bill, was referred to this committee by the D&aacute;il on 22 October 2015.  The motion agreed by the D&aacute;il on that date states:</p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Transfer and Mutualisation of Contributions to the Single Resolution Fund as required under Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution, signed at Brussels on 21 May 2014, a copy which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9 October 2015, be referred to the Select Sub-committee on Finance, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>b</i>) and (6)(<i>a</i>), which, not later than 10 November 2015, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.</blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister for Finance and his officials to this meeting.  I invite the Minister to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015110300002#D00100"><p>I thank the Select Sub-Committee on Finance for inviting me before it to discuss the D&aacute;il motion on the proposed ratification by Ireland of the intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the Single Resolution Fund, which will enable the subsequent ratification of the intergovernmental agreement, IGA, to the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM.  This D&aacute;il motion is a component part of the overall ratification process, with the other major element being the enabling legislation in Part 2 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015.  This legislation, which we will discuss later, is short because the Attorney General indicated that the core points of function of the Minister and the power to spend are all that need to be dealt with in primary law.  The remaining commitments in the agreement are binding on the State at state level only and do not, therefore, require domestic legislation to give effect to them.</p> <p>  The requirement for the motion arises from the same Attorney General advice which indicated that as the intergovernmental agreement constitutes an international agreement under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution and, as it deals with funding and involves a charge on public funds - albeit that the contributions will be raised at national level in accordance with the bank recovery and resolution directive and the SRM regulation - D&aacute;il approval is required.  It is necessary, therefore, for the Minister for Finance to propose to move a D&aacute;il motion accordingly.</p> <p>  As members are aware, there is a requirement for the member states to ratify the IGA before 30 November in order for the Single Resolution Mechanism to come into force by 1 January 2016.  Some 90% of the aggregate of the weighted votes of all participating member states is required for this to happen.  As members will appreciate, the SRM is a very important part of the banking union agenda and failure to meet this deadline would be a major embarrassment for the banking union project and could undermine its credibility.  Consequently, I am seeking members' support for this D&aacute;il motion.</p> <p>  The IGA was negotiated in order to enable the Single Resolution Fund, a key element of the Single Resolution Mechanism, to be operationalised.  The Single Resolution Mechanism is the second pillar of the banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, faces serious difficulties, its resolution will be managed efficiently with minimal costs to taxpayers and the real economy through a single resolution board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by levies imposed on the banking sector.  What this means in practice is that should any of our three major banks get into financial trouble, the decision about putting it into resolution will be made by the single resolution board rather than our domestic resolution authority.  In addition, where bail-in of shareholders, capital instruments and eligible liabilities is insufficient to cover losses of the bank in question, then there will be access to funds from the Single Resolution Fund.  This has the aim of breaking the link between banks and the sovereign and thus avoiding a repeat of the issues faced by countries during the recent financial crisis.</p> <p>  It should be noted that the target level for the Single Resolution Fund is at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all of the participating member states, which is to be reached at the end of eight years.  This is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 billion.  We estimate that the contribution of Irish banks to the Single Resolution Fund will be &euro;1.8 billion over the eight years, which amounts to approximately &euro;225 million a year.  The banks' annual contributions will be calculated on the basis of their liabilities, excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted for risk.  The contributions paid will be a normal operating expense for banks, including State-owned banks.  A transition period of eight years to full mutualisation or pooling of the Single Resolution Fund was negotiated.  This requires that contributions from the banking sectors of the participating member states be paid into national compartments or accounts within the Single Resolution Fund during the period.  This was facilitated by the IGA.  This structure enables the progressive mutualisation or pooling of the fund by requiring that in the event of a call upon it, the national compartment of the affected member state pays first before, if necessary, the other compartments make a contribution.  As the transition proceeds, a smaller percentage is taken from the affected national compartment and a greater percentage is taken from the other compartments, until after eight years when full mutualisation or pooling occurs.  From that point, any funds required for the resolution of a bank or banks will come from the Single Resolution Fund as a whole.</p> <p>  In summary, therefore, the main purpose of the IGA is as follows: first, to transfer the contributions raised at national level in accordance with the bank resolution and recovery directive and the SRM regulation to the Single Resolution Fund; second, to allocate, during the eight-year transitional period, the contributions that are raised at national level to different compartments in the Single Resolution Fund corresponding to each participating member state; third, to facilitate the  progressive mutualisation of these compartments in such a manner that they will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period; and, fourth, to prescribe how the Single Resolution Fund can be applied during the transition period.</p> <p>  It should be noted that the reason these changes could not be accommodated within the SRM regulation is that a number of member states argued that Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union did not provide an appropriate legal basis to do so.  Consequently, it was agreed that this issue should be dealt with through an intergovernmental agreement which could be formally ratified through national legislation.</p> <p>  As noted at the outset, the passing of this D&aacute;il motion is an essential part of the ratification process for the IGA and I would appreciate the members' support for the D&aacute;il motion that I have submitted for their consideration.  I am happy to take any questions or provide any clarifications to assist the committee in regard to this matter, including any questions on the related legislative provision in Part 2 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, if members think it appropriate.</p></speech>

We are supportive overall of the banking union and we want to see the Single Resolution Mechanism come into force in January of next year.  On the size of the resolution fund, which is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 billion, I made the point previously that, on the face of it, it appears to be very small given that the cost of the Irish banking bailout alone was in excess of that.  I recognise that the fund will only be accessed after the various bail-ins have been executed.  That is a new provision, and it is to be welcomed, which is being provided for on a pan-European basis.</p> <p>  I have one question for the Minister.  Will he clarify the position regarding the Irish contribution?  I take it that it will be made by three banks contributing &euro;1.8 billion over the eight-year period, which is approximately &euro;225 million a year.

Let us say we have ten banks instead of three.  The Minister has mentioned the two pillar banks and Permanent TSB.  If we imagine we have ten banks, would all of them have access to the fund and contribute to it?  When this was originally announced, it numbered two or three larger banks across member states.

Just to tease this out, let us hypothesise that the bank would take another leap, with the southern business being regulated under the Central Bank.  Where would Ulster Bank be then?  Would the bank automatically have to contribute to the fund, meaning there would be four banks instead of three?  Is that an automatic process or would the bank have to make an application?  Would the Minister have to sign an order or write to the European Central Bank about this?  How does it work?  Is it automatic?</p></speech>

Whether the bank would be a contributor depends on its asset base.  In the Deputy's example, the bank would automatically become a contributor if it changed the manner in which it was regulated in an Irish jurisdiction.  If the bank separated completely from operations in Northern Ireland and the parent bank in Scotland, it seems it would still be sufficiently large to get caught within the regulation.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath referred to an issue that has been mentioned before, that the resolution fund is quite small in comparison with the possible liabilities across Europe.  The primary policy position is that there will be no more bailouts by taxpayers but rather bail-ins of bank assets.  In terms of a cascade of interventions, by the time we get to the resolution fund being involved, we will have gone through shareholders, junior bondholders, several categories of senior bondholders, corporate depositors and probably personal depositors in excess of &euro;100,000.  The resolution fund only kicks in after we have gone far down a cascade of assets that can be bailed in.  In that context, it is reasonably significant.  This was debated very hotly when it was introduced in the first instance.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy McGrath.  It not only looks small, it is small, and I am open to increasing it in future.</p></speech>

I know there has been consultation around whether low risk entities should be paying a lower rate.  The credit union movement has made a strong and convincing argument that, given the risk nature of the credit unions and given that there are other funds in operation, it falls into this category and the lower rate should apply.  I would appreciate comment from the Minister on the submission made by the credit union movement on the question of whether there should be consideration of a low risk sector which qualifies for a lower level of contribution.</p></speech>

I will read the briefing note.</p><blockquote>As part of the public consultation process in relation to transposition of Directive 2014/49/EU on the deposit guarantee scheme a number of submissions were received from the credit union sector, including from credit union representative bodies favouring this position.  Question 7 in the consultation document asks for justification for particular sectors being considered low risk and thus qualifying for a lower level of contribution.  The Department is cognisant that the credit union sector considers credit unions a lower risk sector for a number of reasons thus suggesting that credit unions should qualify for a lower level of contribution.  However, the matter is still being considered and a decision will be made in the context of the broader consideration of the calculation of contribution levels, in particular the risk based element.  In this regard, it should be noted that the directive allows us up to 31 May 2016 to finalise this matter. </blockquote> <p>I would be prepared to take into account the views of colleagues on the committee.</p></speech>

Although no final decision has been made will the Minister clarify whether he is leaning towards the arguments made by the credit union movement; that it is a lower risk sector which should benefit from a lower contribution?</p></speech>

The Department has until May 2016 to make a decision.  The size of an institution and levels of its assets are factors when one tries to make comparisons between financial institutions.  However, the really key question is the risk and it is in trying to measure the risk objectively that I will arrive at a decision.  It is possible to have a credit union with a small amount of assets but with a high risk, which we have seen before.  As the Deputy is aware, and it is a view shared here at this committee, Deputies in this House are generally well disposed to the credit union movement because we realise its importance.  This is also a consideration.</p></speech>

However, I would agree with the Minister that whether we like their ethos and what credit unions do, it does come down to risk and we must act prudently and responsibly.  That is why I agree with the Minister's point on risk.  Will the Minister indicate how much credence he will give to the fact that the Central Bank has already categorised the risk weighting of financial institutions through the PRISM system and has deemed the credit unions to be low risk whereas the other financial institutions are considered high risk?  Does that classification not answer questions being posed here - that the credit unions have already been categorised by the Central Bank as, in the main, low risk entities?</p></speech>

They have indicated that as the purpose of this provision is to reimburse the Central Bank for short-term loans it has provided to the DGS, this repayment from the Exchequer has to be automatic in order to comply with the prohibition on monetary financing as outlined in Article 123 of the Lisbon treaty.  Consequently they have suggested that the words &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; be deleted, which I am proposing to do with this amendment.  The members know how the ECB is chary about monetary financing and if something was done with &quot;ministerial discretion&quot; it would suggest that a Minister could influence monetary financing.  If the term is deleted, as proposed in this amendment, it becomes automatic and therefore there is no suggestion of monetary financing.</p></speech>

I know we are talking about scenarios where there is enough money in the fund, but imagine a scenario where a bank gets into trouble and the Central Bank needs to provide that fund to them and there is not enough in the fund to cover it.  The amendment means that regardless of the state of the Exchequer it has to pay that money within two weeks.  I know the money will be reimbursed when the fund increases in value but we do not know how long that could take or whether that would be within one year or not.  There are numerous other rules that can impact the relation of the Exchequer and the Central Fund.  For example, how would it all play out if we had to make a contribution of a couple of billion euro to the Central Bank and the State had to wait two years for that money to be repaid?  Regardless of the health of the Exchequer finances it is a blank IOU to the banks.  The State will get the money back at some time in the future as the fund increases but I would be concerned about this.  I understand the issues around monetary finance but I am concerned that while we talk of breaking the link this is clearly showing where the link exists between banking and the State's finances.</p></speech>

While the Deputy has identified a risk I do not think the risk is very big.  Frankfurt is chary of its independence and because of the legal position under the Lisbon treaty, in particular Article 123, the ECB will not get involved in anything that it would regard as monetary financing.  It would be challenged constitutionally in some jurisdictions if it did get involved.  If it moved into that space it would certainly be challenged in the German constitutional court.  Ireland has had long experience of tip-toeing around this when we were trying to negotiate alternative arrangements on the promissory note.  The big problem all the time was that the bank was inhibited from doing anything that could be interpreted as monetary financing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-03a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015110300002#G00100"><p>I understand what the Minister is saying in terms of the risk being small but it is risk the Central Bank is not going to take.  Indeed, the bank is willing for that risk to be placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers.  That is something with which I cannot agree.  It goes against the spirit of the thing, even though what we are discussing does not complete the commitment made to break the link between the sovereign and banking.  The link is still there.  There will be a call on the State after a series of other mechanisms and bail-ins.  There is still a potential for a call on the State.  A state also has the ability not to make that.  This year is an automatic regardless of whether a government or parliament wants to provide the money.  Basically, we are writing it into our law that if the Central Bank issues this cheque to a bank that gets into trouble in the future, we will refund the Central Bank within two weeks.  That is a blank cheque which takes matters a step too far because we do not know where we will be in a number of years.  Touch wood, we will not be in dire straits and hopefully an issue of this nature would not be one of huge concern.  Hopefully, the fund will have enough money at a point in time to deal with all eventualities.  However, there are risks.  The issue is that we are putting this into law today.  The officials in the Department of Finance are well aware of the ECB's rules on monetary financing.  I do not expect that people are unaware of these rules, given that it is one of the biggest issues we have been discussing in the State around a number of matters including the promissory note.  Nevertheless, this Bill, which passed scrutiny by the Attorney General, threw up the issue relating to the phrase "with the approval of the Minister".  I presume that somewhere within the Department there was a view that this phrase could be inserted and that there would still be compliance in the context of the ECB's role regarding the prohibition on monetary financing.  I am reluctant to approve the deletion of these words.</p></speech>

I also ask him to clarify that the circumstances in which this scenario would arise would be those in which the fund was exhausted, whereupon the Central Bank would have to use its resources to make a payment to depositors under a compensation event and to state that it would only be in such a scenario that the Central Fund would be obliged to reimburse the Central Bank and make good the deficit.

The figure the Deputy is seeking is &euro;380 million.  Deputy Pearse Doherty is right that the phrase "with the approval of the Minister" was included in the original draft.  Like many matters where Europe and the European Central Bank are involved, we were obliged - after we published the Bill - to have consultations with the latter.  It was quite convincing in its argument that to allow that phrase in would contravene Article 123 of the Lisbon treaty and that it would be deemed to be monetary financing if there was a ministerial discretion over the repayment of the money.  That is why it was changed.  We were legally constrained to change.  However, the Deputy was right that our opening position was to put in a discretionary clause.</p></speech>

How does it work in the context of expenditure benchmarks and all of those types of rules?  For example, if this were to arise this month and there was a call of &euro;500 million that had to be repaid from the Central Fund to the Central Bank because of a payment, what would happen in relation to budgetary arithmetic and how would it be accounted for?</p></speech>

It is obviously very complex but the essential idea about monetary financing is that the central banking system in Frankfurt or any of its components like the Central Bank in Dublin could not financially assist the Exchequer because one would then get involved in monetary financing of a fiscal position.  If money was owed to the Central Bank by the Exchequer and the Minister had discretion not to pay it, that would be deemed to be monetary financing and contravene the Lisbon treaty according to the ECB.  There is merit to that argument.  That is where we are.  If there is a liability, the obvious thing is to levy the banking system to make good anything the Exchequer loses in the process.</p></speech>

The Central Bank would get its money back from the fund in any event and it is just a case of who has to put up with the pain until the fund reaches a point where it can pay for any outlays that have been made.  The Central Bank has involved itself in some of these activities in the past through different mechanisms and the promissory note is one example.  As such, how is this monetary finance?  If it does not fall on the Exchequer to repay this, could not the fund directly repay the Central Bank?</p></speech>

I remember an experience when I was in the Department of Justice and I asked the Secretary General about what a particular article in the Constitution meant.  He very succinctly answered that it meant whatever the Supreme Court decided it meant.  It is the same with monetary financing.  It is monetary financing if the ECB decides it is and is supported by the legal authorities.  That is the position and it is the one we found ourselves in notwithstanding that we initially had a different view when we laid out the original draft.  We take the advice now.  The ECB says it is monetary financing and is supported by legal opinion to that effect.  Our Attorney General does not challenge that opinion and, as such, we amend.</p></speech>

The entire reason for this Bill is the entry into force on 1 January 2016 of the Solvency II regime.  This is a new EU-wide regulatory regime for the insurance sector.  The directive repeals the EU directives underpinning the current insurance regulatory regime but the directive also excludes certain undertakings from the new regime.  In order to ensure there are no insurance undertakings operating in Ireland from 1 January, unregulated, we have provided for that regulation by way of this Bill.  This section seeks to continue the current regulatory regime for such undertakings.</p></speech>

From a legal perspective there was a need to change the wording of section 17 of the Bill, as published, so as to allow for no doubt regarding how the Solvency II portfolio transfer regime is to apply to undertakings regulated under this Bill.</p></speech>

No. 57 of 1984) that&mdash;<blockquote>(a) is a relevant undertaking on the commencement of this section, and<br /><br />(b) is not deemed authorised under the regulations made under the Solvency II Regulations, </blockquote>shall be deemed to be authorised under the Life Regulations.<br /><br />(3) An insurance undertaking that, at any time after the commencement of this section, ceases to be an undertaking to which Title I, II or III of the Solvency II Directive applies and becomes a relevant undertaking, shall&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in the case of an insurance undertaking which carries on life insurance business, be deemed to be authorised under the Life Regulations, and<br /><br />(b) in the case of an insurance undertaking which carries on non-life insurance business, be deemed to be authorised under the Non-Life Regulations.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>This amendment adds a new section which ensures that any insurance undertakings which are outside the scope of Solvency II and which were authorised under the 1976 and 1984 regulations, the regulations giving effect to the first non-life and life directives, respectively, are deemed authorised under the 1994 life or non-life regulations which are being continued by this Bill.  The section further ensures that insurance undertakings which fall outside the scope of Solvency II, subsequent to the Solvency II transposing regulations coming into force, will be deemed to hold their authorisation under those same 1994 regulations.</p></speech>
