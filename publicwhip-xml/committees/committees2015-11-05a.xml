Agreed.  On matters arising from the minutes, last week we had a note on HL Commodity Foods which was circulated to members.  The clerk is doing a background note to inform members of where the issue stands now and we will have it next week.</p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  Correspondence has been received from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on UCC's compliance with the public sector pay policy, to be noted and published.  Correspondence dated 30 October 2015 has been received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; in regard to the delay in the presentation of audited account of Mary Immaculate College, to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Correspondence dated 3 November 2015 has been received from NAMA, a follow-up to our meeting on 1 October 2015.  It relates to a legal position and I suggest we refer that letter to the legal advisers to the committee and ask for their response to the matters raised to give us a clear understanding of what action might have to be taken after that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We now come to individual correspondence.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence dated 12 October 2915 from Ms Frances Ryan Chairman of the Board of Directors, New Ross Community Hospital Limited, to be noted.  The issue relates to the delay in registering nurses, a matter on which the Secretary General of the Department of Health has promised to report back to the committee.  We will forward this correspondence to the Department so that it can be considered as part of its response.  The situation with the Nurses and Midwifery Board of Ireland is not satisfactory.  I raised this with the Secretary General of the Department and asked that it be investigated.  Those returning to Ireland who want to have their qualifications acknowledged are delayed in taking up employment because of the inefficiencies of that system.  We might send a reminder to the Secretary General of the Department requesting a speedy response.</p> <p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 30 September 2015 from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in regard to the application of non-domestic water charges by Kildare County Council, to be forwarded to Ms Julie Gibbons.</p> <p>  We will now deal with documents relating to today's meeting.  Nos. 3C.1 and 3C. 2 are the briefing documents and opening statement for today's session, to be noted and published.  No. 3C.3 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 22 October.  In regard to No. 4.1, I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to take us through his comments on the National College of Art and Design.</p></speech>

In the audit certificate, as well as drawing attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which is a standard paragraph in certificates for third level education bodies, I referred to the governance issues in NCAD, which I have reported on previously.  The statement of internal financial control gives an extensive report by the college on the state of play in regard to those matters.  It continues to be an unsatisfactory situation.</p><p>I have qualified the audit opinion regarding the keeping of proper books and accounts.  The next set of financial statements are currently being audited.  We received them just last week and the audit on that is progressing, but there will continue to be delays because of the extensive difficulties with the keeping of books of accounts in the college.</p></speech>

The issues were relatively well ventilated in discussion with the committee.  The matter is ongoing, and we will keep it under review and continue to report.</p></speech>

Is the college catching up on paperwork that it has, or is it that it does not have the paperwork?</p></speech>

I believe the system is being rectified, but it cannot be rectified retrospectively when it comes to preparing the financial statements.  We expect the situation will improve once we get to the 2014-2015 set of financial statements, and then we should be able to bring them back on track.</p></speech>

I believe the committee had a letter last week from the Department in which the Secretary General drew attention to the appointment of a new board chaired by Professor Brennan.  There is a very significant process in place within the college to rectify the problems.</p></speech>

The committee should make it absolutely clear that those issues are on the agenda for that meeting.  The witnesses will have to outline to the committee how the tender document was constructed and how it is being dealt with now, including the differences due to the fact that the contract is being incorporated into the new tender arrangement.  They will have to explain to the committee how they could get something so horribly wrong, such as its failure to check whether one of the tenderers had a licence to land and take off.  Actually, it was the company that was eventually awarded the contract, and it was the preferred bidder in that case.  That was a failing by the Office of Government Procurement which it will have to explain to this committee.</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy attended that meeting.</p><p>We toured the site and saw it at first hand.  I asked NAMA to answer the questions submitted to us by representatives of families but it did not do so, except to say that the site is sold.  Some of the questions relate to the attitude of NAMA towards this group in the period leading up to the sale.  I want to get the answers to those questions.  I ask the clerk to the committee to remind NAMA that this information is outstanding and that it should submit its response to the committee.  While some of the questions do not necessarily apply now because the property is sold, an explanation as to what happened beforehand is required.  </p><p> On the subject of housing, the completion of the Tipperary hostel and the State money spent on it comes up here time and time again.  In the context of the provision of accommodation, given the current demand, it would be no harm if someone would look at it.  It may provide an opportunity for the State to intervene, fund its completion and put the property to an appropriate use.  I ask the clerk to write to the Department and ask it to review that property in that context, thereby saving some of the taxpayers' money that has already been spent on that building and preventing its further dilapidation.</p></speech>

Salaries accounted for 35% of the expenditure.  At the end of the year, just under 2,300 whole-time equivalent staff were employed in the Department and its related offices.  As well as the administrative costs of the Department, expenditure was incurred on a wide range of services including naturalisation and immigration services, asylum seeker accommodation, legal aid; the Irish Youth Justice Service; the Probation Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Magdalen compensation fund.  The Vote also includes funding for a range of statutory services operating under the aegis of the Department, including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p> <p>  The appropriation account for prisons recorded gross expenditure of &euro;335 million in 2014.  The expenditure was incurred under one programme, the administration and provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people who are sent to prison.  Much of the programme expenditure related to payment of salaries, wages and allowances totalling &euro;237 million.  In addition, the prison service spent just under &euro;50 million in 2014 on buildings and equipment and &euro;28 million on prison services. </p> <p>  Chapter 9 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2014 concerns the development of prison accommodation in Dublin.  The report reviews the current status of and expenditure on a project at Thornton in north county Dublin which aimed to develop new prison accommodation on a greenfield site.  The project commenced with the purchase of a 150 acre site at Thornton for &euro;29.9 million in January 2005.  The site was to be used to build a new prison to replace the Mountjoy complex.  Adjacent land totalling just under 15 acres was subsequently purchased in 2007, at a cost of a further &euro;2.1 million.  At the time the site purchase was approved by Government, it was stated that an indicative construction cost for the new prison complex to accommodate around 1,000 prisoners could be in the region of &euro;150 million.  It was expected that, in time, this cost would be partially offset by the proceeds of the sale of Shanganagh Castle prison and of the Mountjoy site and reduced prison operating costs.</p> <p>  In 2006, a proposal was developed for a significantly expanded scope for the new prison.  The proposed wider project, with a capital cost estimated at &euro;525 million, was to be developed under a public private partnership, PPP, arrangement.  Following the financial crisis, PPP projects in Ireland effectively became unbankable and the option of direct State development of the proposed prison was considered.  However, this was subsequently deemed to be unaffordable and the project was suspended.</p><p> When it became clear that the Thornton project was unlikely to proceed in the foreseeable future, development work was undertaken instead on the prison accommodation at Mountjoy to deal with the problems there - in particular, overcrowding, the elimination of slopping out and security issues.  From 2010 to 2014, &euro;28.7 million was spent on capital works on the Mountjoy site.  Additional accommodation was built at the existing Midlands Prison to house 300 prisoners, at a cost of some &euro;25 million.  As a result, many of the problems at the Mountjoy complex have been fully addressed, at a much lower cost than was originally proposed to build a new prison on the Thornton site.  My net conclusion is that the decision to acquire the Thornton site was underpinned by inadequate analysis of the likely costs of developing a new prison and the potential to deal cost effectively with the problems at Mountjoy by other means.</p><p> Since the acquisition of the land at Thornton, work on site preparation, and on off-site service works such as the provision of water, telecommunications and sewerage systems, has been undertaken.  No prison building work has been undertaken.  The cost of this work to May 2015, together with the site cost, was just over &euro;50 million, and this is the carrying value of the assets on the appropriation account balance sheet.  The prisons Vote appropriation account presents inconsistent valuations of prison land and buildings, with the property at Thornton being treated differently from similar property held by the Prison Service elsewhere.  Relative to other similar property held, the property at Thornton is overvalued in the account.</p><p> The Prison Service has set up a working group to review the Thornton project and look at options which would yield the best possible value for the State in its future use.  When my report was being completed, the working group was still reviewing the options.  The Accounting Officer will be in a position to update the committee on the group's work.</p></speech>

Given that it is somewhat unique to have an acting Secretary General before the Committee of Public Accounts, I propose to say a few words, with the Chairman's permission, on the circumstances that have given risen to this, before proceeding to deal with chapter 9.  As members know, Mr. Brian Purcell, the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, moved to another area of the public service in October last year.  The Minister asked me to take on the role of acting Secretary General, and I felt it my duty to do so.  I was working at the time as director general of the Department's immigration service, and I continued to do that role until the summer of this year.  It was anticipated that I would be in the job for no more than a few weeks while a competition to fill the role was held in the normal way via the Public Appointments Service.  For the sake of full disclosure, I advise members that I was not an applicant for the post of Secretary General at the time.</p> <p>  The competition did not yield a successful candidate, with no name being recommended to the Government for consideration.  The Minister has publicly stated her view that this may have been a result of the controversies which had surrounded the post.  In other words, there was not a huge number of people knocking on the door of the Public Appointments Service seeking to do the job.</p></speech>

The Minister has indicated the job will be re-advertised when she considers the time is right to do so.  There is nothing further I can add at this stage.  I will continue to do the job for as long as I have been asked to do it.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the word "acting" in my title does not change the way I do the job; I do it in the same way as do all the other Secretaries General.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with my colleagues in the Department.  They are fully supportive of me in the role, as are colleagues in other Departments and the wider justice system.  I am doing the job as if I were Secretary General of the Department.  Moreover, I have been formally appointed as Accounting Officer, hence my attendance here today.  I consider it important to put these matters on the record before getting into the issues the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised.</p></speech>

I had been in charge of the immigration service for several years, as I indicated.  It is a very large area of the Department, with approximately 600 staff.

If it would be helpful to the committee, in terms of using time as best we can and answering any issues that members wish to raise, I propose to give a synopsis of the statement, especially in respect of Chapter 9 relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report dealing with prison accommodation in Dublin.</p> <p>  First, I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their comprehensive report.  It is a valuable document for those of us in the Department in terms of managing this issue.  The stark reality is that substantial millions were spent with the aim of building a prison at Thornton Hall and this has not happened.  Clearly, there are important questions to answer relating to why this is the case.  I realise that ten years ago the committee covered questions relating to the acquisition of the site.  Moreover, I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General's predecessor had a report on that matter.  The people involved at the time were before this committee and the matter was discussed extensively.  I do not intend to go over all of that again, but from my examination of the papers and from conversations with colleagues relating to what happened at the time and since then, a number of points strike me.  I believe it might be useful to share them with the committee today.</p> <p>  Based on my experience of working in various areas of the Department over a lengthy career, I reckon the biggest problem for the entire criminal justice system over the decades has been the operation of what became known as the revolving door system in our prisons.  Early release in any civilised prison system, when it is intended to incentivise, is a good thing and it has its place.  However, what we had was a scenario where people were being released in large numbers on an unplanned basis.  The revolving door acts to negate the efforts of everyone in the criminal justice system to keep our community safe.  It meant that the work being done by the Garda in tackling crime, the work in bringing people to court and the work of the courts in sentencing people and dealing with them was all being set to nought when people turned up at the prison door and were then released because there simply was no space for them.</p> <p>  Thankfully, in more recent times we have moved away from that situation.  However, I have no doubt that in proposing the new prison at Thornton Hall between 2003 and 2004, the need to avoid a revolving door scenario was at the forefront of everyone's mind.  Of course, that is as it should have been.</p> <p>  While substantial works have been undertaken in Mountjoy, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, we would be deluding ourselves to believe that a prison first built in 1850 could now match the standards which would apply in a purpose-built prison constructed now.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide where money is allocated at a time of scarce resources and many pressing demands and the decision might be taken not to proceed with the construction of a new prison.  However, it does not mean building a new prison would not be desirable.  This brings me to the fundamental point on why we are here today and why we are addressing the issue.</p> <p>  While people may have points to make about the detail of what happened, the stark reality is that the construction of the prison at Thornton Hall did not proceed because of the crisis that arose in the economy.  In fairness to all those involved in the project, their thinking, understandably, was not informed by the impending economic collapse.  That is where we are.  In order to take it forward from here, I see two challenges that face us now.  Clearly, we have to learn what lessons can be learned from what has happened.  I am being frank with the committee by saying that learning those lessons is going to be complicated by the fact that we had a set of circumstances whereby the economy did what it did and that could not have been foreseen by people who were planning the project.</p> <p>  I emphasise that this was not a solo run on the part of the Department or the Irish Prison Service.  The Governments of the day were consulted extensively about the project because of its scale.  By my calculations, the Government was consulted and made decisions in respect of this project at least ten times, or perhaps a little more when we take other issues into account.  Indeed, the plans for the project, as Deputies will be aware, were subject to legislation brought before the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  It seems to me that if we are to go down this road again, we need to have a clearer picture of what we are trying to achieve.  Are we going to build a prison on the basis that it should last another 150 or 170 years?  Are there compromises we may make around that in terms of the cost?  A report was published by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention earlier this week, as committee members may be aware.  The report raises some interesting points about the type of prison which has been found to work in other jurisdictions in combating recidivism.  We are examining whether there is some way of approaching these projects in a way that would minimise exposure to the taxpayer if circumstances arise involving another funding crisis.</p><p> The second challenge is for us to arrange the use the site at Thornton Hall in a way that maximises its value to the taxpayer and, in that respect, the question of a new prison being required cannot be ruled out.  There has been no Government decision not to build a prison on the Thornton Hall site.  </p><p> Members of the committee will be aware that by and large, communities do not welcome prisons being sited in their midst and it would be a fraught and difficult exercise for us to have to embark on finding a new site or sites some years down the road.  On the other hand, the reality is that in the short term a prison will not be built on that site.  The recently published capital programme for the justice area does not contain funding for it.  We have a group examining the best use which may be made of the asset of that site in the short to medium term to see if it is possible to do so in a way that might leave open its eventual use for what it had been intended for in the first place.  I will be happy to discuss that and to report on future developments in that regard to the committee.  I hope that these remarks have been helpful in setting the context for today's discussion.</p></speech>

I will start with that aspect.  On doing some research into this, I saw press reports of a fast-tracking process being formulated within the Department having been announced in the media in April of this year.  I do not know many times it has been re-announced and every time there is a media scrutiny and exposure of the refugee crisis that exists, and that has grown during the past six months in Europe, we hear about the issue of fast-tracking the processing of applicants much quicker.  At what stage is the fast-tracking of the processing of applicants process at now?</p></speech>

The new international protection Bill will require people to put all their details on the table pretty much immediately when they make their applications.  One of the effects of the current system we are operating is that there are possibly up to five or six, or maybe more in some circumstances, opportunities for people to seek to a judicial review of decisions which have been taken in the system and that has given rise to very serious delays.</p></speech>

They do that on a regular basis and that is their entitlement.  That is the law.  A new Bill will remove that aspect.  There will be two points of decision in the system, which will remove that aspect immediately.  That Bill is a long time in the making.  It was part of a wider piece of legislation, which was contemplated for reform of the entire immigration area, and the Minister, upon taking office in May of last year, decided to separate out the protection aspect of it.  That has been done, and the publication of that is imminent.  I anticipate that the Government will be making a decision on it very shortly.  The intention is that it will be published, brought before the Oireachtas and, ideally and hopefully, the Minister - who is on record as having said this - would wish it to be enacted before the end of this session.</p></speech>

If an applicant is refused in the first instance and then makes an appeal, that decision is ordinarily made in about eight months.  The difficulty in our current system is with the process  beyond that, where the applicant then makes an application under what is known as subsidiary protection and that, effectively, starts the whole process all over again, and when that process is completed, the applicant can then seek to make an application for leave to remain in the country.</p></speech>

Clearly, in cases where they do qualify, they could be processed and recognised as refugees, or they will now be known as protection applicants, within a matter of weeks.  That will happen.</p> <p>  I will come to the issue of the people coming here from Syria, by invitation of the Government, and the relocation process.  That will happen in a matter of weeks in many cases.  In other cases, there is no reason why those applications will not be dealt with and out of the system in a matter of months.  Our target around that is that we should be able to do that between six and nine months.  That will mean that people will not continue to be housed for very lengthy periods in direct provision.  The reason they are there in very many cases is due to the delays in the system because of the sequential nature of it, due to the multiple opportunities people have to apply before the courts. </p></speech>

Essentially, there is no mathematical formula for this.  People present themselves and make an application, and they either qualify or they do not.  At the finish, it is a function of where people are applying from.  Our system in more recent years has seen very many more people applying from refugee-generating countries.  That was not always the case.  Hence, if people are applying in Ireland and are from countries that do generate refugees, they will obviously-----</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, up to the end of September about 1,500 people from Pakistan had applied for asylum in Ireland.

Let me outline what seems to be happening and what is a concern for us.  The applicant cohort in the United Kingdom from the countries the Deputy is referring to tends to comprise young males in their early to mid-20s, or perhaps a little older.  One of the benefits of our common travel area system is that we can check with our colleagues in the United Kingdom whether our applicants already have immigration status in the United Kingdom.  In many cases, the applicants are people who might have arrived in the United Kingdom as students and whose immigration status has expired.  In order to remain within the common travel area of Ireland and the United Kingdom, they come to Ireland, make an application here and, in some instances, remain.  In some instances, when their applications are dealt with, they will have disappeared back into the system.  It is a concern and-----</p></speech>

They would have come to the United Kingdom through a different immigration route.  While I agree with the Deputy, we have a statutory duty to everybody who turns up to claim asylum.</p></speech>

My view is probably shared universally and almost certainly within the Department.  There is a refugee crisis in Europe right now and we have finite resources.  We have not seen the kinds of pressures that Germany, for example, is experiencing.  The city of Berlin is processing 1,000 people per day.</p></speech>

Frankly, what we are dealing with here seems to be people who are applying for refugee status spuriously in many cases.  That seems to have been a hallmark of our system down through the years, bearing in mind the rates Mr. Waters just cited.  He mentioned that the number of genuine refugees is increasing.  It is reflected in the refugee status granting rates.  However, the question arises as to how effective the system will be outside the fast-tracking process.  Consider how much money we spend in this area and where it needs to be allocated.  When there is an increase to 3,800 from 900, which was the number a couple of years ago, we have a problem.  The problem is that the money is not going where it should be.</p></speech>

It is a difficulty and we are not alone in that respect.  All Administrations have such difficulties.  From our Department's view, the staff work very hard to try to identify, as quickly as possible, the people who are in need of protection among the large number of people.  They try to get them through the system, get them to the far side of it as quickly as possible, move them towards having proper and appropriate lives in the community, and support them as best they can, with all the measures.  That clearly has to be the focus.  I agree that people who do make applications and use the system for the reasons Deputy Deasy described are a difficulty.</p> <p>  The Government has agreed to take in 4,000 people as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.  That is an entirely different situation.  While they will be subject to the new process we are talking about, the sense is that perhaps 75% or 80%, or perhaps even more of them, will qualify automatically because they are clearly coming from Syria and the region where refugees are being generated.  Therefore, there is no reason they cannot go through the system very quickly.  In every sense of the word, they will be the people who deserve our hospitality.</p> <p>  On the question of the Acting Chairman on what happens people who do not qualify, a much misunderstood part of our system is that when a person has been through the entire process, he is ultimately invited to make an application declaring why he should remain in the State on humanitarian grounds and to put forward a case.  This, again, will be gone in the new system.  If the case is not accepted by the Minister or, in most cases, officials working on the Minister's behalf, a deportation order is then signed.  The order states the applicant must leave the country.  The onus is on the individual to leave the country on foot of the deportation order and not on the State to remove the person forcibly from the country; it is an important distinction.  Some people do leave the country.  By definition, it is very difficult to say how many would at any given time because of the nature of immigrant communities and given the free travel arrangement between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Some people do leave voluntarily but many people do not.  If they do not, the Garda is faced with a very difficult task - not a decision - along with our staff of forcibly removing them.  That is a very unpleasant duty for everybody to have to do.  It would not be our wish to do it but, in order to maintain the integrity of any immigration system, one has to have forcible deportations where warranted.</p></speech>

Four of five years ago, we did an exercise on this.  We had approximately 10,000 or 11,000 people on our books at the time who had an application in the system.  We did an exercise to clean up the records in this regard.  When we had done everything we had to do, it turned out that the actual live caseload was nearer to 6,000, so the other people had disappeared somewhere into the system.  More than likely, as the Garda would tell us, they would have left the country and probably would have gone back to the United Kingdom.</p><p>We have forcible removals and deportations.  A number of different categories of people are removed.  In the context of the deportation orders that are signed, ordinarily 15% to 20% of deportees are forcibly removed.</p><p> Another difficulty will be addressed by the forthcoming protection legislation which is to be approved by the Government shortly.  The difficulty arises from a High Court judgment which found that garda&iacute; who enforce these orders have no right to enter a person's private dwelling to seek to remove that person.  That has clearly presented a problem for us for a number of months.  It is what is known as the Omar judgment and in effect it means that when garda&iacute; seek to enforce an order, the person concerned can argue that the garda&iacute; are in his or her private residence and have no right to be there.

What will the difference be in the treatment of people who were not fully processed in the UK system but who come here through Northern Ireland once the aforementioned legislation is enacted?</p></speech>

They will not have five or six opportunities to go to the High Court to seek judicial reviews.  It would not be unusual, although the incidences have reduced in recent times, for somebody who is literally on the steps of a plane, having been removed by garda&iacute;, to seek High Court relief to stop his or her removal.  That was not unusual in the period we are discussing.  We can never rule that out.  People have a right to go to the courts but we are removing the opportunities for people to do so as best we can.</p> <p>  There is also a wider issue here in the context of what is known as the Dublin regulation.  Members will be aware that people are expected and required to make their application for asylum in the first country they enter.  If they do not do so, they must be removed but that is not working in any country in Europe at the moment.  The arrangements around it are very complex.  People have to be given opportunities to appeal.  It can work better if a country can detain people but we do not detain people in Ireland.  It is a matter of policy that we do not do that save for very short periods pending their removal.  When I say short periods, I mean a few days at most.  That is part of the process too.</p></speech>

It is very difficult, by definition, because people can travel freely.  The favoured route at the moment is from the North, across to Scotland and down, as it is on the way back in.  Hitherto, it would have been from Dublin on the ferry route or from Rosslare, but those routes are now closed off.  We have an added difficulty in that if someone travels from Scotland and to Northern Ireland, he or she is still in the UK.  None of us wants to reach a point where we are introducing border controls at Dundalk or elsewhere.  That is clearly not an option.  There are practical difficulties in respect of policing that area.</p> <p>  We do not have hard figures on the numbers of people who leave on foot of deportation orders.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015110500002#J01800"><p>As you will be aware, Chairman, the Government set up a working group to look at the entire direct provision system late last year and it reported in the summer of this year.  The working group came up with approximately 170 recommendations to deal with people in the direct provision system.  One of the major issues to be addressed is the length of time people are in that system.  The real difficulty with the direct provision system is the length of time people are in it.  Our focus at the moment is on the people who are in the system for more than five years, to get them out of it.  In an ideal world, when the new legislation is turned on, we will reduce that caseload to the absolute minimum.  It would be an entirely unhappy situation for us to be operating two parallel systems, one where people are being fast-tracked through the system and another for people who were logjammed in the system.  Each case will be dealt with on its merits.</p> <p>  We are often asked if people should be given an amnesty, but that is a matter for the Government.  I have no sense whatever that there will be an amnesty to deal with those cases.  There are practical and political difficulties in terms of the European agenda around that issue.  No country is in a position to move forward individually on this because a person who gets refugee status in one country in Europe can ultimately move to another country.  That gives rise to major difficulties when one is talking about very large numbers of people.  There is political agreement that there should not be any general regularisation schemes.  Ireland, like other countries, makes decisions case by case.  Where a person puts forward a good case on humanitarian grounds as to why he or she should remain, we will look at that.  We have done so and continue to do so, with increasing numbers of people in recent months on foot of the working group report, with the aim of ensuring we get out of the direct provision system as quickly as possible as many people as possible who have been there for lengthy periods.</p></speech>

The Irish Prison Service reports that in 2007, the average number of prisoners in custody was 3,300.  It peaked in 2011 at 4,390, while the figure in 2014 was 3,915.  Where are we now when it comes to the average number of prisoners in custody and what is our capacity?  Has the money that was spent on Mountjoy and on building a 300-person wing in the Midlands Prison eased the capacity restraints?  What kind of a buffer do we have within the system at present?</p></speech>

I will just give the Deputy a flavour of where our prison numbers have gone in recent years which will illustrate the difficulties we face in the context of the Thornton case.  In 2005, the number of prisoners in custody was 3,100 but by 2010 that had gone up to 4,400.  By 2015, the number had dropped back down to 3,600.  The figures fluctuate considerably and figuring out precisely why this is the case would require a great deal of research.  Everyone has a view as to why this might be the case, perhaps related to the wider economy.  The Department would argue that the range of options for the courts in terms of dealing with offenders is increasing, in terms of community service orders-----</p></speech>

I worked in the prisons area as a junior official when it was a division of the Department before Mr. Donnellan's service was set up.

We had to have regard to the danger to the community.  Sometimes we got it wrong and it was very difficult.

Frankly, I think it came as a surprise to everybody.  While we are on the issue of bail, Mr. Waters mentioned the revolving door.  Some people would suggest that the issue of cases not being heard for years almost forces the Judiciary to grant bail in almost every circumstance.  That is the reason Mr. Waters mentioned one particular case that occurred in the courts recently.  Is it not as harmful that the system is that clogged up with cases being heard or not being heard for years in some cases?  Is that not as damaging as the revolving door issue?</p></speech>

In order to move that on and in order to bring people before the courts the Government decided to do that and steps are under way to make that court function very quickly.  That is at the very high end in many cases.  Yes, there are issues in terms of bail.  Perhaps Mr. Martin would speak about the constitutional issues around bail.</p></speech>

Our understanding is that in most cases in the Circuit Court it would be seven to eight months before a trial takes place.  That is not actually a delay because there is a period for gathering evidence so one would not expect a trial instantly.  Where it is identified to us that there are particularly long delays, this can vary from area to area, we try to address the issue.  On the question of bail, under the Constitution there are only three grounds for refusing bail - when a person is going to interfere with justice, normally the witnesses; the person is going to flee the jurisdiction; and, there is the constitutional amendment to allow bail where a person is going to commit a serious offence.  It is a matter for the judge to decide in each case what the evidence is to support those grounds.  There is a long tradition in Ireland for granting bail.  It is not necessarily the same in other countries but the Judiciary decides that.  We are addressing bail in two ways.</p><p>We had a particular difficulty with burglary where the evidence from the Garda suggests that there are many burglars who are effectively professional criminals who were committing multiple burglaries.  They would be arrested by the Garda, charged, released on bail, commit more burglaries and be released again.  There was one incident where it happened six or seven times in one month.  Our perception is that the Judiciary did not view burglary as a serious offence.  It is listed as a serious offence but traditionally-----</p></speech>

It may be the case that a future Government may decide to restrict bail.  The Minister has committed to changing the legislation around that but a future Government may well decide to go further.  It may also decide to introduce further consecutive sentences in some cases.  There is debate around this.  There is no question that all those things will have an impact on the prison population.  We cannot have a situation where, for example, a person who is committed to a prison in respect of an offence committed on bail ends up dislodging a person who is there on a sentenced offence.</p></speech>

One might be talking about Thornton Hall then.</p> <p>  Mr. Waters brought up the issue of burglary.  In recent days it was announced that &euro;5 million of public money was going into Operation Thor.  When I heard that, I wondered where this money will go.  Will it be allocated for surveillance or, in particular, for overtime, which is the issue in my opinion?  What geographical areas will it go to?  When one looks at the burglary figures for the past seven years, one can see that they have gone up significantly in many respects and in many parts of the country.  They have gone up massively in Dublin.  In Waterford in my constituency, they have gone up by 32% in those seven years.  In the south east generally, Wexford is at 39% and Carlow-Kilkenny is at 17%.  The south east has been hit, not as badly as Dublin, but there is certainly a problem and it is growing.  Is the Department allocating that &euro;5 million to the Garda and allowing it to apportion that where it sees the problem and where it sees burglaries arising or will it be spread throughout the country?</p></speech>

The figure of &euro;5 million referred to by the Deputy is new money.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Commissioner to decide where to allocate resources that are provided by Government, but in this case it is our understanding that the great majority of that money will be for overtime because, ultimately, addressing crimes of this nature requires visible policing, either policemen and women or other forms of interdiction.</p></speech>

In any given month in Dublin, the overtime bill for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be about &euro;2 million.  A sum of &euro;5 million will not solve anything when it comes to overtime.  When I look at the overtime figures for about six or seven years ago and compare them with today's figures, I can see that &euro;5 million will achieve nothing.  When I speak to seasoned garda&iacute; and new recruits, they tell me the same thing.  They say the problem is the rostering.  When their shift is over, they take four days off.  There is no continuity.  When it comes to a crime being committed and the investigative work that is needed, the whole thing breaks down because people have to take a day off.  It is not a secret.  Everybody who deals with issues like burglaries understands that this is the issue.  We stopped Garda recruitment.  We are bringing it back slowly but the man hours are not available in many respects to provide for surveillance and to deal with the ensuring investigation and detective work.  I put it to Mr. Waters that &euro;5 million will achieve nothing given the overtime bill we had and have now and the scale and extent of the problem.</p></speech>

I think in the coming years it will be of the order of &euro;33 million to &euro;34 million.  In 2006 or 2005, it would have been closer to &euro;130 million if I remember correctly.  Clearly, this has an impact.  At the same time, the strength of the force was higher than it is now.  Like every other public service body such as the Department and all its areas, the Garda suffered as a result of the need to make very serious cutbacks.  As the Minister has pointed out repeatedly, in a recovering economy, what we want to do in our job of supporting the Minister, the Government and the Garda in this is to ensure an appropriate level of resources is made available to the Garda at Estimates time.</p><p>We have had some modest success this year, and last year.  First, Templemore has been reopened, which is a major item.  It was closed for a number of years.  Nothing was happening there.  There are now 560 people at various stages of training in Templemore.  The period in which they are being trained has been considerably shortened.  They become fully functioning garda&iacute; now after 32 weeks of training.  They do go back at a later period.  Another 600 garda&iacute; will be recruited next year.  There are operational issues, such as the number of cars, equipment and-----</p></speech>

As the Secretary General said, they are able to profile the patterns of burglary, and that will then lead to the allocation of resources.</p> <p>  There are other components to the strategy as well.  The garda&iacute; are also working with the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service to look at how people are managed in the community, including people who have a history of offending.  That is an important part of the process.  Another important part of the process is working with the various community organisations such as Muintir na T&iacute;re.

The previous Government introduced a provision for electronic monitoring of people on bail.  It was indiscriminate - it could have applied to everybody - and there are several thousand people on bail, so it was not regarded as cost-effective.  In the general scheme of the bail Bill there is an amendment to those provisions to allow for the prosecution to make an application for one of the conditions of bail to be that the person is electronically monitored.  If there were particular people involved and the Garda felt that one method of preventing them from committing further crimes would be to monitor their whereabouts, they could apply for electronic monitoring in those specific cases.</p></speech>

It depends on the circumstances, but we have not done any research recently.  If we have a significant number of people it is not possible to monitor them on the current basis.  The systems in other countries are generally historic.  Monitoring is normally contracted out to security firms, which give a report on a next-day basis of what the person did the previous day.  It is not live tracking.  If somebody has breached a condition of bail, he or she will have to be brought back to court and it is up to the judge to decide what to do about that breach.  It is not feasible to use it in a widespread manner.

Clearly, the garda&iacute; could not do it.  It would have to be done by a private company.  We are talking about thousands of people who would potentially be subject to electronic tagging.  The information would be historic; it would not be live.  For example, if somebody who was subject to one of these tags had left his or her home and gone to a provincial town centre, and the conditions were that he or she should not be there on a Saturday night because of a serious assault committed previously, that information would only be available the following day at the earliest, by which point-----</p></speech>

There was a contract with Chubb Ireland in 2014 amounting to &euro;74,000.  I am subject to correction by my colleagues from the Prison Service.  In 2015, the average monthly cost of that is approximately &euro;11,500 and the total cost for the year will be &euro;140,000.  That will provide electronic tagging for about 47 offenders.  That is the cost.  I am subject to correction.</p></speech>

Since 2014, we have used tags on 47 prisoners.  There is a very significant saving to the Prison Service, for example, in circumstances where an offender in hospital is monitored and minded by a number of prison officers.

The person who is head of corporate affairs for the Prison Service has just said that in some respects it is a lot cheaper to have somebody electronically monitored than not and Mr. Waters is saying that overall the scale of this will be very expensive.  It is included in the bail Bill and will be left up to the Garda to make an application when it comes to the electronic tagging of repeat offenders.</p></speech>

Our legislation provides for three different forms.  The first is where there is a court order as an alternative to custody and somebody is required to stay at a certain place for a certain period of time.  There is provision for electronic monitoring which has not been commenced.  That order is limited to a specific number of offences.  It has not been used frequently.  There is electronic monitoring of prisoners who are on temporary release.  There is a significant difference between people on temporary release and people on bail.  People on temporary release have been convicted and if they breach a condition of temporary release they can be returned to prison straight away.  If a person breaches a condition of bail, there is no provision for them to be arrested straight away.  A garda has to apply to the court and bring them back before the court for the court to decide.  It is true that in a small number of cases in the Prison Service it is more cost effective to use electronic monitoring but this is based on a small number of specific cases.  That is what we are saying in the case of bail.  It will be cost effective in a small number of cases but not in every case.  That is the difference.  Similarly in the prisons, it is not used in every case but in a small number of cases.</p></speech>

Operation Thor was announced with a lot of fanfare and with a very small amount of money, when one looks at the overtime bill.  Electronic tagging was thrown in as an afterthought after the announcement was made.  In my opinion, it was done to quell concerns about the issue arising from bail and burglaries around the country.  It was thrown in by the Department and the Minister.  It seems to me that the witnesses are unconvinced about electronic tagging in some cases, the costs involved and the efficacy of electronic monitoring.  There is a sense within the Department that it might not be the most effective way of dealing with recidivism and repeat offenders.  That is what I take from what the witnesses have said.  They have continually said that it is very expensive and other jurisdictions have found it to be unworkable because of that.  It is considerably different from what was said a number of days ago.</p></speech>

What the Minister has announced and what the Department supports is that in certain limited circumstances electronic monitoring has a role in respect of serious and serial offenders as part of their bail conditions.  Our concern at the moment is that if electronic tagging is introduced right now, the system will collapse under the weight of it because of the numbers of people involved.  That is what we are saying.</p></speech>

The last thing I have to ask concerns the issue of the foster home that we have dealt with in this committee over the past year.  There are policy issues arising from that.  It is currently being looked at by a senior counsel.  The terms of reference are too narrow.  The senior counsel will come back with his report shortly.</p> <p>  The third aspect of this is the release of reports by Resilience Ireland and Conal Devine on these matters.  Since the last time this was brought up in this committee, the reasons given by the HSE and others have been that the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have expressed concerns that the investigations into these matters are ongoing.  Since this was brought up in the last committee hearing, I have gotten a sense of what those investigations are.  They are serious and are being dealt with seriously by the Garda.  I know the tenor and substance of them.  It has gone on too long.  Whatever the Garda is investigating, and I think I know what it is investigating at this point, it needs to expedite this.  The Departments of Justice and Equality and Health and Children need to express the view that any current investigations or lingering investigations into this matter need to be dealt with quickly.  That is all I will say. </p></speech>

She was secretary of it at one stage in her career.  She might be able to give some more detail.  The board is sitting.  There have been vacancies on it in recent years but it is now constituted again.  More recently, the chairman was appointed a judge so there is a vacancy at chair level.  We do not believe that this will impact on its capacity to do its work.  It is there and it is sitting.</p><p>The Chairman might be aware of the circumstances in which one can make awards, which are independent.  It is subject to cash limiting in terms of what it can do.  In 2013, there was a large overhang of awards  of the order of &euro;7 million that had not been paid for a number of years.  These were addressed by way of Supplementary Estimate and were made available to the committee.  While some cases still may be outstanding, it did deal with-----</p></speech>

Sometimes, in the case of serious injury, this can take some time to settle down and a number of years.  Consequently, the tribunal would be engaged back and forth with legal representatives.  I also should clarify the tribunal is not full-time.  They all are barristers and solicitors in their own capacity who have their normal practices and do this on an<i>ad hoc</i>basis.

It was from an individual who had been summonsed as a prosecution witness in a multiple larceny and drugs case that required a special sitting of the Circuit Court.  Present was a judge, a 12-man jury, five garda&iacute;, senior counsel and a solicitor for the State, a senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitor for the defence, as well as four court staff and the individual who sent the e-mail.  However, the accused did not show up.  When the person who had been summonsed asked the garda&iacute;, who had worked hard in the case, whether there would be any consequences for this no-show, they replied &quot;No, it is the system&quot;.  The sender of the e-mail then asked to be told that someone in politics was leading the charge to change radically the system, as the <i>status quo</i>was the most farcical and flagrantly wasteful imaginable.  The State would have paid for the judges, the senior counsel and all of that.  Is this a regular occurrence in the system?  While I could be bordering on policy matters here, surely, were this to happen on a regular basis or even a not-so-regular basis, it should be of concern to the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that whatever legislation could be suggested to the Minister to change would be suggested.</p></speech>

Of course, were it a regular event that the entire criminal justice apparatus was to gather in a court and someone was brought before it charged with a serious offence only for that person to not show up and were there no consequences for that individual, clearly this would have the most serious consequences.  It would be negating entirely very good work by other agencies in the criminal justice system.  In the finish, however, if somebody is directed to appear in court and does not do so, there is a number of options open to the judge in court, such as directing that the individual be arrested under a bench warrant-----</p></speech>

However, if a person, going back to an earlier decision, had been on bail and was required to present at court to answer the charges, obviously this would be a breach of bail conditions and in itself, would be subject to its own requirements under the criminal justice system.  In the finish, however, if a person is summoned and does not appear, if an offence has been committed the Garda will follow up on it and deal with it and it can have serious consequences for individuals.  It is part of the criminal justice system that when one is required to attend, one shows up or one faces the consequences and this clearly can have serious consequences for people who do not show up.</p></speech>

The first point I will make in this regard, which is not generally known, is that 80% of all penalty points tickets issued for speeding and other offences are paid by the perpetrators of the offence on the spot as penalty points.  This is a high number and is up there with international standards and norms.  Then one breaks it down and historically or in recent times, in the order of 4% or 5% are cancelled for various technical reasons where they should not have been issued and the committee will be aware of the controversies that arose around that.  We have put in place, with the Garda, serious measures to address that including, for example, a requirement that where a garda in receipt of penalty points seeks to claim he or she was travelling on duty, this matter must now be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In addition, there is oversight of the entire process by a retired judge of the Circuit Court at present, Judge Deery, who will make a report to the Minister on its operation.  Then there is a situation in which there are difficulties with the service of summonses and we acknowledge this is a problem.</p></speech>

Perhaps my colleague here might have a figure on that.  We will see whether we can do that.  However, it arises from the fact that in Ireland, our system to a large extent requires personal service and if the courts are not satisfied that a person has been personally served, they by and large tend to dismiss the case.  We are looking at this, with colleagues, and as the Chairman is aware, the legislation in this area primarily is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Garda and we are in the centre in the criminal justice system.  However, we are looking at ways as to how we best can improve the rate of service.  However, I am not making any claims to say this would be easy; it is a difficult one.</p> <p>  While this also may have arisen in the committee's report, we also are looking at what is known as the third payment option.  For example, when people turn up in court and state they never got the summons, under the third payment option, which we hope - more than that, which we expect - will be rolled out and commenced next year, when a person gets a summons, they will have an opportunity to actually pay the penalty at that point.  This will remove the defence of stating one never got it because the court will be able to say the person in question had an opportunity to pay that fixed notice on receipt of the summons, obviously chose not to do so but now is present in court.  This changes the system fundamentally but is a very difficult thing to achieve; it might sound easy in saying it here but in terms of getting different computer systems to talk to one another, it is quite a difficult thing to do.</p> <p>  The other piece in this regard, to fill the Chairman in, pertains to cases in which people have not brought their driver licences to court.  Again, we are working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Garda to ascertain whether we can resolve that.  The Garda has actually commenced taking prosecutions in respect of cases of people who have turned up in court and who have not produced their driver licences.  That is work on the way and again, we are looking at an information technology-based system to try to resolve that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. O'Sullivan, who is familiar with the details, have anything further to say on this?</p></speech>

I might call Deputy Costello.  It relates to State pathology debtors.

We had difficulties with local authorities previously due to funding issues.  They simply did not have the money to pay.  The system has been rationalised, in that there previously would have been a time lapse before the State pathology lab pursued outstanding fees with local authorities.  That process has been tightened up considerably.  I will confirm the concrete figures later, but my understanding is that the level of debt has reduced somewhat in recent years.  I will revert to the Chairman with specific figures.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present for the opening statement, but I read Mr. Waters's in detail.  Since he concentrated on Thornton Hall, I will do likewise.</p> <p>  Before I do, however, questions arise across the board regarding moneys that have been spent but for which there is no perceivable benefit to the Department of Justice and Equality or the State.  It is taxpayers' money, the use of which we are responsible for reviewing.  Questions arise regarding the Bridge Project on Parnell Street and Wolfe Tone Street.  The officials might comment on it.  The &euro;2 million that was spent seems to have gone down the drain.  There is the issue of the &euro;3.3 million for the State pathology office when an alternative is now being sought at the Whitehall Garda station.  That seems to have disappeared.  There are issues with EU social funding for equality for women, in that projects do not seem to have proceeded.  Why did that funding lapse?  There are issues with substantial overtime payments and extra payments.  There are major issues of non-compliance, in that the level doubled between 2013 and 2014.  Claims against the State also doubled in that time.</p> <p>  The greatest issue is Thornton Hall, where &euro;50.6 million of State funding has not produced anything of what was sought.  The site was purchased at an exorbitant price of &euro;32 million and approximately &euro;20 million was spent on development because it was a backwoods area in the middle of nowhere and there needed to be roads, access points and so on.  The site is lying idle.  This has been the case since the original decision in 2001 to search for a site until 2010 when the Department suddenly decided that it could rectify many of the issues that had caused it to purchase the site in the first place, for example, the provision of in-cell sanitation and so on at a capital cost of less than &euro;30 million.  Work that was estimated to cost at least &euro;525 million was started, yet prisoners' conditions were improved for less than &euro;30 million.  The original decision was taken in 2001, but nothing was done about in-cell sanitation until 2010.  Is there not something ludicrous about waiting ten years to deal with a problem?</p> <p>  The report's conclusion on this matter seems to be a serious one.  It states: "That decision was underpinned by inadequate analysis of the likely costs of developing a new prison, which appear to have been significantly understated, and the costs of addressing the problems at the Mountjoy complex, which appear to have been overstated."</p><p>How did all of this happen?  Who is responsible for it?  Why was it allowed to drag on?  A review committee has been sitting for the last 12 months without any terms of reference.  It has not reported and we do not know what is going to happen, yet the accounts still have a statement of an historical legacy value of &euro;50.6 million when in reality it is &euro;2.4 million.  Surely that is a very serious matter.</p></speech>

First, with regard to the State pathology facility, that process or programme is under way in the former Whitehall Garda station, which the Deputy will be aware is on the way to the airport.  It is under construction and we expect it to be ready for operation in March next year.  There was a little delay in the course of this year in terms of getting the work going, but that has been resolved.  It will cost approximately &euro;3 million, of which &euro;1 million will be spent by the Department and &euro;2 million will be incurred by Dublin City Council.  We are co-sponsors of that project.  It is under way and we expect to have a new facility there in a matter of months, which is obviously very welcome.</p></speech>

Five years passed and now there is the possibility of a new one in 2015, three years later.  The Whitehall Garda station has been free for a number of years too.  What happened to the money?

However, the advice available to us at the time on the nature of the contract was such that we could not take the next contractor on board.  We would have run into very serious difficulties.  Without getting into the complexities of it, the nature of the contract was such that we did not have that option available to us at the time.  It gave rise to the loss that occurred.  We greatly regret that, but ultimately had the contractor remained in business that project would have been finished and on time.  He did not, and we had to deal with that situation.  However, our main concern here is to ensure that we have a fit for purpose State pathology service, which we will have in a matter of months at the former Whitehall Garda station.</p> <p>  To return to Thornton Hall and the issues the Deputy raised, I made a few points about that at the start of the meeting but the Deputy might have missed them.  My essential point was that the Thornton Hall project was driven by the need of the Department and the Prison Service to avoid the effects of the revolving door, of which the Deputy will be well aware as I know he has had a great interest in these matters over many years.  It was an absolute plague on the Irish criminal justice system for many years.  People were being brought into the system on foot of having been detected by the Garda, brought before the courts, charged and convicted.  They were brought into Mountjoy Prison, because it was the pivotal prison in the system, and then released simply because there was no space for them.  People who were involved in this at the time were conscious of that.  It was a driving factor for them in terms of developing a new prison at Thornton Hall where the situation would never arise again.  That was one of the factors in play.</p> <p>  Another factor at the time was the number of condemnatory reports that had issued in respect of Mountjoy Prison.  The then Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Justice Kinlan, since deceased, had requested that Mountjoy Prison be torn down.  He saw that it was not fit for purpose.  The UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture over many years had examined the conditions in Mountjoy Prison and declared that they were not fit for purpose.  The conditions were such that the committee was calling into question Ireland's commitment to ensuring that the human rights of prisoners were respected and observed.</p> <p>  Those were all the issues in the background which gave rise to the decision in the first place to proceed with Thornton Hall.  Everything that happened afterwards flowed from those basic tenets.  I accept that a very large amount of taxpayers' money has been spend on the Thornton Hall project.  It was offset to some extent by the sale of Shanganagh Castle, which had outlived its usefulness as a facility for the prison system.  It was hugely costly to maintain at over &euro;100,000 per prisoner.  At its closure I believe there were 20 to 25 prisoners there.  It was no longer useful for practical purposes for the prison system.  That sale generated &euro;30 million and it practically paid for the cost of acquiring the site at Thornton Hall.  There may have been a difference of a couple of hundred thousand euro.  As the Deputy said, another approximately &euro;20 million was spent in the subsequent period.</p> <p>  Of course it is a very serious concern to us that we do not have a prison or a project there, but ultimately it is a direct consequence of the collapse in the economy.  Simply and straightforwardly, it was no more than that.  There was no degree of incompetence by the Department, the Prison Service or anybody.  The Thornton Hall process was fully compliant in respect of all the procedures that relate to public-private partnerships and the issues around that, including all the procurement issues, had the preferred bidder who was selected from three major companies succeeded in living up to their bid.  Ultimately, they were unable to finance their bid because of the changing international situation.  They were simply unable to access money markets at reasonable rates.  However, had they been able to do that, I have no doubt that Thornton Hall would be built and probably at the point of functioning at this stage.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, there are very significant lessons to be learned from it.  Looking at it again, are there other models we could have chosen?  Again, with the benefit of hindsight, which is very easy, had we gone for the more traditional State construction using the normal processes with the Office of Public Works, OPW, would we have constructed Thornton Hall and would it have been completed?  My answer, and I believe my colleagues would agree with me on this although I was not involved with it at all, is "Yes", a facility would have been built at Thornton Hall if we had taken the more normal route.  However, at the time we had just emerged from a PPP project for the Courts Service which was not quite of the same capacity, although not far from it, and it was equally risky but it had been successful.  It was delivered on budget and in time.  At that stage, which was the mid-2000s, there was a fair wind behind us in terms of doing that.  The Government decided, as it did on at least ten occasions, and the Oireachtas was involved, that Thornton Hall should proceed on the basis of a PPP.  Ultimately, that changed in the latter part of 2009 and in 2010.  The change was to proceed to direct Exchequer build.  By then, we simply had no money to do it.  However, that is a lesson for us in terms of the models we use.</p> <p>  Another lesson for us is whether we should be building in future in respect of the age of an institution such as Mountjoy Prison.  As the Deputy is aware, it is 170 years old.  Should we be building for a much lesser period at, perhaps, much lesser expense?  That is a question which we address.</p> <p>  To take things forward, the Deputy mentioned the group that is examining a possible future use.  We certainly cannot rule out the possibility that there will not be a prison constructed, or a requirement for a prison to be constructed, in Thornton Hall.  That is certainly an issue.  It will not happen in the short to medium term, in my view.  However, if, for example, a new Administration decided to change the way people who are on bail are dealt with or change the nature of sentencing, that could change.  Prisoner numbers have fallen remarkably.</p><p>It has not happened before on the same scale, but this could change and they may well go up again.  This is an issue of which we must be cognisant and consider when making decisions for the future.  With regard to the use of the facility at Thornton Hall at present, the group mentioned has been looking at potential options.  Two issues are in play, one of which is that, as the committee may be aware, the approximately 800 people based at the Garda city centre offices in Harcourt Street in Dublin, who work in national support services and a range of activities central to the operation of the police force in Ireland and Dublin, are required to exit this office by the end of next year.</p></speech>

It is the Dublin metropolitan area headquarters and the head office of the national support services of the Garda.  The OPW is leading the search for a potential new site for these people and all the services.  I understand six options are being considered as potential locations, including Thornton Hall.  There are issues with regard to its distance from the city but it is certainly being considered.  I cannot say at this stage how it will pan out.</p> <p>  The review group has had contact with IDA Ireland, which has indicated it sees the Thornton Hall site as offering significant potential for foreign direct investment.  It is fully serviced and is located 1.4 km from a motorway and a couple of minutes away from the M50, so one can see its obvious advantages.  I do not believe this is likely to happen in the very near future, but it is a possibility.</p> <p>  We must balance all of this with our requirement in the long term for other prison accommodation and all of the issues that go with this, such as trying to acquire a site and communities objecting to it.  We have a site which is ready to go, which is fully serviced with its own access route, and we would be very reluctant to decide not to use it.</p></speech>

Despite the description given by Mr. Waters of how it happened, it seems to have been a flawed project from the very beginning.  It started not as an extension of Mountjoy Prison, but as a replacement for it whereby it would be demolished.  The cost began at &euro;150 million, and the cost of purchasing it was to be partly met by the sale of Shanganagh Castle.  The sale of Shanganagh Castle meant the only open prison in Ireland was closed down.  Part of the final recommendations on Thornton Hall was the inclusion of a 200 unit open prison.  Shanganagh Castle, which was an open prison, had already been sold off for &euro;29 million.  Mr. Waters said open prisons are very expensive, but they are part of the rehabilitation process.</p></speech>

It would be expected that we have an open process to facilitate the rehabilitation of young people going into the system.  This has always been part of the Irish prison culture.  It was questionable that the provision of a replacement for Mountjoy Prison was put against the closure of an open prison.  At the beginning the cost was &euro;150 million and involved the demolition of Mountjoy Prison.  Who in their right mind would have demolished such an historic site as Mountjoy Prison?</p></speech>

Then the project went totally out of kilter and became three times the original size, going from 723 places to 2,200 places.  I cannot understand who was in charge.  The necessity to provide decent sanitation for prisoners in came up in various reports and Mr. Justice Kinlan was strong on it at the time.  All of a sudden in 2010, hey presto and lo and behold, we could do this for just a fraction of the cost.  As it happens, the analysis of the prison population was also flawed because we see it is decreasing.  Perhaps Mr. Donnellan has figures for 2015, but the figures for 2014 show there were more than 200 fewer prisoners than there were in 2013.  The curve of imprisonment has shifted.</p> <p>  We have not received an explanation for the purchase of land in a remote area, which required all types of ancillary works to make it accessible, at the expense of an open prison, or for why its cost and size should change so drastically over a period of time, going from &euro;150 million to &euro;525 million and from 723 prisoners to 2,200 prisoners or for closing Shanganagh Castle.  Nothing has happened, and this has been going on since the original board was established in 2001.  This was called the Mountjoy Prison development group, and Mr. Waters might tell me who its members were.  We have been living with this white elephant since 2000 and we still do not know what will happen.  The last time we discussed it the review was also considering Harcourt Street.</p></speech>

Perhaps it was a different project that has gone out the door.  It does not seem to have a beginning, middle or end.  It seems to be absolutely the wrong way to conduct business.  From the beginning there has been no business plan and no proper analysis has been done, and it is still being run as though nobody is in charge.</p></speech>

I am not in anyway seeking to minimise the expenditure of taxpayers' money on this issue.  It is worth repeating that had the financial crisis not happened there would now be a prison facility in Thornton Hall.  Whether it would have been a public-private partnership or a direct build is a matter of conjecture, but there would be a prison facility there.</p> <p>  I will deal with several of the points and ask my colleagues to come in on the others.  The Deputy mentioned the budget had increased from &euro;150 million to more than &euro;500 million.  There has been some correspondence on this figure.  The figure of &euro;150 million first emerged as a placeholder in a capital envelope for the entire justice family prepared for the Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  It was produced even before the site in Thornton Hall was bought.  It was solely a placeholder budget for a prison that was intended to be produced at some point.  At the time, capital envelopes ran for three years, and had we not put a figure in the envelope we would have had no money and we would have gone nowhere on developing a prison.  The motivation of the people doing this was the revolving door situation and the terribly bad conditions in Mountjoy Prison, which the Deputy mentioned.  The figure was a placeholder budget and was never intended to be indicative of what the cost of developing Thornton Hall might have been.  We simply would not have known that.</p></speech>

The capital programme available to address all of that could have been put in place in 2010 and would not have cost more than &euro;30 million.  Extra numbers in the region of 2,200 were going to be provided so can the witness indicate why this was not addressed at a much earlier stage? The pressure was on from the European Court of Justice and from Mr. Justice Kinlan to get decent accommodation.  Why was it left to drag on with new plans?  Mr. Waters may not have been in the Department at the time but the real issue, and what was the cause of it in the first place, has not been addressed.</p></speech>

This was going to be done on a cost effective basis and prisoners would be maintained there for a lot less than in Mountjoy Prison.  The type of prison proposed at Thornton would be of modern standards.  It would not be based on the Victorian principles which are now being replaced around the world.  It was going to be an entirely new concept in how we deal with prisoners.  That was all to be part of a solution to the wider prison issue at the time.  I invite my colleague Mr. Michael Donnellan, director general of the Irish Prison Service, who can provide the Deputy with some more detail.</p></speech>

It was absolutely unthinkable in 2010 to close a division of Mountjoy to allow it to be refurbished because the numbers could not have been coped with.  As a result the Thornton project was conceived and would have happened, as the Secretary General has said.  However, since 2011 we have had one division of Mountjoy closed continuously, and one is still closed today because the numbers of people in prison has dropped by 20% since 2011.  This has allowed us to do a whole range of things, not just in Mountjoy but also in Cork.  The numbers in Cork have dropped from 330 to 220.  In Limerick the numbers have dropped from 330 to 220.  The numbers have also dropped in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  The drop in prison numbers has allowed us, for the first time in many decades, to address  the appalling conditions of slopping out.</p></speech>

An engineering feasibility report was commissioned and was delivered in February 2003.  It strongly recommended against investing money in Mountjoy Prison on the basis that it would be lost money because Mountjoy Prison would have needed serious refurbishment if it was to be sustainable in the long term.  The fabric of the building is over 160 years old and was in such bad condition that it would need serious renovation.  If money was invested to install in-cell sanitation it would have required further investment in another five years, so that was not considered to be a permanent solution nor would it have addressed the other issues.</p> <p>  While the most obvious concern was in-cell sanitation, there was the equally serious matter of overcrowding.  We had two or three prisoners in one person cells.  And as the director general has explained, it has only been possible to address those aspects and tackle the refurbishment since those figures came down.  There was an engineering report that recommended against it.  The interim board thought a greenfield site was the more obvious route.  It is not true to say there was no analysis of the requirements.  Part of the PPP process is that a detailed cost benefit analysis is required for each project and that was done in 2006.  It looked at the costs of all the options and it identified the green field site as the most cost effective option.  It was on that basis that the decision was made to go ahead with the PPP.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the changing shape of the project.  The Deputy is correct in that the original project looked at by governor Lonergan and his team was for the replacement of one prison on one site.  It was not a long term project.  One of the reasons for the choice of the greenfield option was that in addition to improving on what was available in Mountjoy Prison it also allowed for long-term development.  However, at that stage in 2003-04 there was no concrete idea of what was meant by long-term development.  It was felt that more could be done with more space.  When the site was identified then the requirements potential was identified.  In 2005 prison numbers started to increase exponentially and at that stage, before the PPP tender was started, it was decided to build a prison with 1400 cells, some of which could be doubled up.  That was included in the outline business case which looked at all the options.  It was on that basis the Government approved the issuing of a tender and approved the PPP process for the preferred tenderer.  The Deputy is correct that in 2001 the thinking had changed and it had not really solidified until 2005 when a site was chosen and there was concrete proposals for the particular type and size of prison required.</p></speech>

There is no public transport and it would be very awkward for them.  In choosing a site in the middle of nowhere with no public transport one wonders how families are going to get there.  Measures could be put together, but the travel issue does not seem to have been considered.</p><p>Egans Cash and Carry, on the boundary of Mountjoy Prison, was purchased.  Why could it not have been developed while some of the in-cell sanitation and other conditions were being addressed?  As I understand it, it is still in the ownership of the OPW and the Department of Justice and Equality.  It was a ready-made alternative for improving the conditions beside the prison.  The Department had the site in Shanganagh which belonged to the Department of Justice and Equality, but it sold it.  The Department could have held on to it to expand the prison and develop other, broader prison services and it would not have cost a penny.  </p><p> The downturn in the economy came in 2008 and I presume that, at that stage, the Department had no money to carry out the works at Thornton Hall.</p></speech>

The cost of financing it proved to be unsustainable.  The Department and the Irish Prison Service went to the tenderers to ask them to make their best and final offer and they came back with a figure which had gone up by 30%, while the annuity charge went up from &euro;52 million or &euro;53 million to &euro;70 million.

However, the right decision was made to call a halt to it.  If we had gone ahead, the conversation we would be having today would be entirely different in nature.  We would not know where we were.  Perhaps the PPP might have moved forward or perhaps it would not have.  We would, however, be in a quagmire.  The Government accepted our view that it should be stopped.  As we realised that the situation in Mountjoy Prison was unsustainable, the programme of refurbishment and the measures to deal with slopping out commenced.  It has been a very successful programme, carried out at a very good cost.  While it prolongs Mountjoy Prison, it has nowhere near the capacity it had many years ago when there were 1,100 prisoners in the complex, but it will not prolong it forever as it does not address the structural issues at the prison.</p></speech>

It is stated a saving of &euro;127,000 was achieved but that this came about because of three existing projects not availing of an extension.  As it was for employment purposes, what was lost in these three projects not continuing?  How much money was drawn down?  Are there other areas where the Department could draw down funding, or where it did draw down funding in the past but is not doing so now?  Is it matching funding?</p></speech>

It is a very complex issue.  Communities and NGOs applying for funding have a huge burden placed on them in terms of the requirements to qualify for funding.  For example, one must ensure people who are working on these projects produce appropriate timesheets within a margin of error of 2%.  During the course of an audit by the central authority on behalf of the European Union it transpired that they had not complied; therefore, we took it back.</p></speech>

We are reviewing our processes to ensure we can help groups to meet the requirements.  One of the difficulties we had was that, owing to the fact that there were a number of such measures in the Department, our knowledge was scattered.  we are, therefore, centralising it in one unit and putting our financial management unit in charge.  We will see benefits arising from this and the new arrangements will be in place for the new programme which started last year and will involve a new call for funding.  We expect the difficulties that arose in the past not to arise in the future.  Under the new arrangements, the applications did pass muster, unlike under the previous measure.</p><p>It meant that for that measure we were unable to draw down funding of &euro;3 million.  I am advised that this &euro;3 million is not lost to Ireland but will be taken up under other strands of the same measure in other Departments.</p></speech>

For instance, all locking systems in Irish the Prison Service, with the exception of those used in Cork, are procured through Chubb.  In Cork we have introduced a different locking system which will allow us to break into another supplier.  All of the requirements for parts and replacements have to be met through that process.  Similarly, our time and attendance system is very expensive.  We are developing our own system in-house which will save &euro;1.5 million.

There is a balance to be struck as to whether the inquiries are public or - like the very last one mentioned, the O'Higgins inquiry, which is sitting at the moment - not public.  The fact that it is not a public inquiry means that the costs tend to be far less.  It was introduced under legislation in the mid-2000s, and that changed the entire tenor of those commissions of inquiry.  I agree that it is a very significant amount of money and that ultimately we would put proposals to Government to try to minimise the costs.  At the same time, we must strike a balance in terms of the public's right to know what is going on when they hear the evidence.</p></speech>

That included the Garda, the prisons, the courts, the Department and the Land Registry.  That has changed dramatically.  We are now down to the Prison Service and the Department.  A report published during the week suggests that the director general of the Prison Service should now become the Accounting Officer for the Prison Service.  The Department will study the report but as a matter of principal I personally would not have a difficulty with that.  I think it would be right and proper for the appropriate accountability arrangements to be in place.  Nevertheless, as the Deputy can see from the Department's Vote, there are approximately 60 subheads in it and it covers a huge range of activities from immigration to many other issues in the Department.  It is a big Vote and it takes in all issues that are in the justice area.</p></speech>

A major issue that will emerge in the course of next year is the establishment of the policing authority, which will completely change the entire relationship between the Department and the Garda.  Effectively, the policing authority is a new player on the scene in the justice area.  It will hold the Garda Commissioner and her force to account for the expenditure of their money and it will do it in a very public way, so it will change the entire tenor of how business is done.</p> <p>  The legislation is almost complete in the Oireachtas.  The plan is that the authority would function from 1 January.  A chairperson has been appointed, Ms Josephine Feehily, the former chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners.  A policing authority board is in the process of being selected.  We are providing a budget for the authority of &euro;2.7 million for next year.  We are meeting with the authority next week to discuss the very issue Deputy Perry raised, namely, how the new arrangement will work.  We have had several meetings in the various divisions but the next meeting will be at the highest level.  I will meet the Commissioner and the chair and others to work out a pathway for how we are going to make this new arrangement work.</p> <p>  It is important to point out that the Minister of the day will continue to be accountable to the D&aacute;il for the Garda, which is right and proper.  We are very strongly of that view ourselves, in that in any democratic parliamentary democracy the head of police reports to the Minister of the interior or Minister for justice of the day, who in turn reports to parliament.  What does that mean in practice?  It means that, for example, parliamentary questions will be dealt with by the Department.  The Minister will account to the Oireachtas, unlike in the case of the HSE.  We have not gone with that model.  We definitively decided that we would not go down that route.</p></speech>

I have huge admiration for the job done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these challenging times where the force must deal with a massive change in crimes and sophisticated technology.  What are the Department's biggest challenges in terms of its remit and that of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  There are always issues and problems.  People can easily criticise but we must acknowledge the extraordinary work, dedication and commitment given by the force.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015110500002#W01000"><p>Of course they vary from time to time.  Clearly, from the perspective of the Department the support of the Garda in its work preserving the peace and security of the people of Ireland is clearly a major role of us in the Department and we would be very strong on that.  What does that mean in practical terms?  It means negotiating with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the annual budget for the Garda and supporting the force in whatever way we can.  Clearly crime is always going to be with us.  Right now it is a very serious issue.  The Deputy will be aware of the Minister's announcements during the week and a resource envelope is being made available to tackle crime.  That is a very big issue for us.</p> <p>  The immigration area is a huge issue for the Department which impacts on the Garda as well.  This is an issue which has resonated around the world and around Europe, in particular, which we see every night.  We have to deal with all of the related issues.  </p> <p>  We have to support the prison system of course in terms of ensuring that the prison system maintains the safe custody of people.  We support the Courts Service in ensuring that justice is administered fairly.  We also have a whole range of equality issues in our remit around the Department which we have to ensure we support as well.  </p> <p>  In looking at matters in the round, what are we trying to do in the Department?   We are trying to ensure that the entire criminal justice system is joined up and over the years that may not always have been the case.  When one part of the system does something we must ensure that the implications are known to the others parts of the system.  For example, in terms of addressing burglaries at the moment, and the Deputy may have heard the statistic that 75% of all burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  We want to ensure, and these cases are now being targeted by the Garda, that we have the resources and provisions in place to ensure that the perpetrators are brought before the courts, that they are dealt with expeditiously in the courts, that the law is appropriate - the Minister, as the Deputy will know, is addressing that aspect - and if a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment that he or she is held there.  We have a number of proposals which will be announced in the near future in terms of ensuring that we join up appropriately to keep all of the elements of the criminal justice system working efficiently in order that we have better outcomes for everybody.    </p></speech>

As Mr. Waters has said, 25% of burglars cause 75% of the burglaries.  We have heard about tagging but there is a lot simpler method available.  Any legal office that is connected to the website of the Law Library can view the whole registry of deeds so lawyers know exactly who they are dealing with.  Is it not possible where people have a criminal record that such knowledge would be interfaced into the courts through such a web base?  It would mean that when a gentleman goes into court that the clerk can say to the judge that he or she has checked the gentleman out and state that he is on the system.</p></speech>

That is a very difficult thing to achieve even though it sounds easy.  Strategically, this is where we want to go.  We want to ensure that we can do that so that we have one view of the customer, if I can put it like that.</p></speech>

I come from a business background so I imagine that when a guy goes into a court one should be able to gain access to every technological base in the world and scan, etc.  A court clerk should be able to check whether the gentleman's name is registered and, for example, state whether he is on probation.  Such information should be automatically sent to the Courts Service and it could easily go back to the Law Library.  It would mean that when a client goes to his or her solicitor the solicitor can check the system to verify the prospective client's background.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty and I think it is only right and proper that the elements of the criminal justice system would share the information.  Once they go beyond that I would have a difficulty because one is into issues of data protection.  One is into a situation where everybody, irrespective of what crime they may be charged with, is innocent until the courts have dealt with them.  I think we would be reluctant to go into the aspect of sharing information with third parties.</p></speech>

For the criminal justice system to be actively working to make sure that information is available generally to the public is not something that I think would be an immediate priority for us.

The Deputy mentioned the Border area but there are a number of bodies that work jointly to counteract tobacco smuggling which represents a serious loss to the Exchequer every year as well as diesel laundering and fuel smuggling.  These bodies work together to the greatest extent possible.  The Deputy may be aware that, in the context of the talks that are under way at the moment, there may be further developments around that in terms of ensuring that if there are any gaps there that need to be addressed they will be followed through.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners and, indeed, the Department of Social Protection, which has been a feature of our system in recent years.  For example, there are 20 garda&iacute; assigned to the Department of Social Protection and the question of a continuation is being considered at the moment.  They are there for the purposes of ensuring that fraud and issues of that nature are dealt with, that the system is joined up and that people who need to have that information when chasing people down do have it.  We know about the number of garda&iacute;.</p><p>We would all like to have significantly more garda&iacute; visible in our own communities.  At the same time, we would strongly support the Commissioner in that, according to the wider interests of the public, garda&iacute; would be assigned to other offices to do work of that nature.  It is a good use of resources in the overall sense, for the entire community and for the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We have to protect the public interest here.</p></speech>

It is very easy to identify the top five types of property that are now being a serious hit on these guys who are coming from Dublin in high-speed vehicles.  I am not saying that we would identify 100% of them but that we would take, say, 5% of key suspect properties for which there would be a clear monitor to the local Garda station.  These would be a commercial properties with substantial assets on base.  It would be one way of looking at the detection rate.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; do have very good relationships with the private security industry generally.  They have senior garda&iacute; on the board of it.  They ensure that the appropriate licences are issued to the people who should be getting them in an industry that historically was not always very clean.  That is what they are working very hard to ensure.  There are very good relationships there and they do work with them.  Ultimately, we have to ensure that we have outcomes which are to the benefit of all the community.</p></speech>

I think we are getting extraordinary value for money for the reserve force and I have seen them operate and they are as effective as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the ground.  They really are an extraordinary vehicle for creating a policing presence.  What are the plans for that?</p></speech>

I think the Minister has indicated that she would wish to see it go higher.  In the coming weeks there will be a recruitment campaign to bring an additional 600 garda&iacute; into the force.  As part of that we anticipate some possible further announcements around the reserve as well.  It has been particularly useful in terms of recruiting garda&iacute;.   People who would have come through the reserve would have a sense of the career they are entering into.  I agree entirely.  The Department and, I have to say, garda&iacute;, after some initial reluctance on it, have been very firm advocates of the reserve.  I know from talking to her personally on this matter that the Commissioner would be a very strong supporter and sees the value it brings in respect of particular elements of policing, crowd control and attending local events.  For the ordinary member of the community to see the reassuring sight of that person in uniform - they may as well be a fully-fledged garda.  The cost to the State is minimal; I do not have the figure but it is very small.</p></speech>

It is not a matter that is in my gift.  I want to acknowledge the work of my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in ensuring that my own personal situation was resolved.

I have not said that I did not want the job.  Again, it is a matter entirely for the Minister and what she sees fit.  On the original competition, she has indicated that she believed that perhaps the time was not right, given the controversies which had arisen and all the issues that had fallen out of that, and that it was a difficult position - which I can attest to.  It was a difficult position, and perhaps in those circumstances people who otherwise might have come forward did not.  She has indicated that at some future point she will decide what to do in terms of approaching the appropriate authorities to hold a new competition.</p></speech>

I will share the information I have with the Deputy, but I am slightly limited in that the procedure is not directly run by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The ordinary process for filling a Secretary General post - again, our colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might fill in any gaps I might have on this - is that nowadays an ad is placed in the papers.  It is an open competition to the wide world.  Anybody can apply.  That ad is placed by the Public Appointments Service, which is effectively the State's employment agency.  The terms and conditions are set out, and the requirements of the job are all published and are there available to people.  People apply online.  Ordinarily a group would then be brought together of senior people from within the system and from outside it, and they would assess the applications.</p><p>Depending on the number of applications, they may decide to invite some people forward for what is known as a preliminary interview.  On foot of that, they would recommend those for further interview by the Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, which would interview the people and then nominate a person or persons for the Government to decide who should be appointed to the role.  That is my understanding of the situation in very broad terms.  Perhaps colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are here with us might be able to add something to that, if I have missed out on something.</p></speech>

Those proposals were accepted by the then Minister.  It is important to note, in case the point is lost in the debate, that in terms of the population, we have a very substantial number of Garda stations - 585 - still in operation.  To make a comparison, Scotland, a similar jurisdiction, has only a couple of hundred.</p><p> In terms of the rationale for the programme of station closures, it was not merely - I use the word "merely" advisedly - about saving money but also about the Garda, as it is required to do under law, identifying the best policing model it saw fit and delivering that model.  In the view of Garda management, a view the Minister accepted, it represented a better utilisation of Garda resources for members to be out on mobile patrols meeting people in communities rather than manning Garda stations, which was soaking up resources.  That is the context in which the decision emanated.</p></speech>

For some stations, with longer opening hours, the figure would presumably be a lot more.  On the other hand, some of the stations that were closed had been opening only for half an hour a day or every two or three days.  In many cases, therefore, we are not talking about stations that were functioning 24-7 with a full complement of garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

The per annum figure is very small in proportion to the overall budget.  It seems strange that anybody should describe what we have now as a policing model that is working.  Certainly, the incidence of burglaries indicates it has failed in certain areas.  I will concede part of the point here to Mr. Waters but not the main part of it.  The Central Statistics Office figures that were announced by the Minister last week show that in certain areas where Garda stations were closed, crime, including burglaries, has gone down.  That is being claimed as a justification for this particular move.  In other areas, however, crime levels have rocketed.</p> <p>  It seems there is no one-size-fits-all solution here.  The mistake that was made was to look at the projected overall cost saving and view the issue as an overall problem to be solved.  The reality, however, is that whereas certain areas need more resources in a context where we are seeing rampant burglaries - I am thinking of people coming off the M50 and other motorways - in other areas, the closures were justified and crime rates have gone down.  That is true generally of the west.  However, in the areas where it has gone up, it has rocketed.  Mr. Waters knows the areas to which I am referring, such as Stepaside in particular, in which I am especially interested.  We should not be frightened of reviewing this decision.  It requires accepting that what was done was partially right and partially wrong and was neutral in terms of moneys saved.  Does Mr. Waters agree that is a reasonable conclusion to reach?</p></speech>

It is important to note there was a significant deficit in the resource envelope for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Action has been taken to address that, particularly in the past 18 months, in terms of the provision of equipment and manpower.  When one looks at the overall situation in respect of stations, one should factor in that there will be more garda&iacute; becoming available to serve communities.  The Government is committed to keeping Templemore reopened for the purposes of ensuring we do not find ourselves in a situation where the level of recruitment stops entirely, which it did some years ago, and that we have a continuous flow of recruitment into and replenishment of the force.</p></speech>

In recent times, when an issue has arisen, for example, in respect of the Health Service Executive, there has been a tendency to refer it to the Garda for inquiry.  This happened in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report into matters relating to the HSE and the management of a SIPTU fund.  Once that happens, this committee's investigation into the issue in question has to be parked.  It is difficult to understand why a matter that is being investigated by this committee and is subsequently referred to the Garda for investigation is not given priority in terms of a decision whether the Garda can conclude such an investigation.  Some way must be found to assign priority to matters that are being debated at or investigated by this committee, and the Garda should be encouraged to deal with them in an urgent manner.  I say this to be helpful both to the work we do and the work done by the Garda.  If there is a way of dealing with these matters more efficiently, that certainly would be helpful to the Oireachtas committees.  I raise this point in the context of the points raised by Deputy Deasy.  Perhaps Mr. Waters will raise it with the Commissioner in the course of their discussions.</p></speech>

I take the point the Chairman and Deputy Deasy have made.  I share their view that the public interest requires that when these issues are raised, whatever information should be given to the pubic is, in fact, put out there as quickly as possible.  It is in all our interests to ensure that is done.  At the same time, in so doing we should be careful not to cause a further difficulty or jeopardise a prosecution if such is in course.  Nevertheless, I take the point entirely.</p></speech>

It is frightening.  I encourage the Garda to do whatever is necessary, wherever these raids have peaked, to provide localities with more resources and give comfort and commitment to communities.  Garda&iacute; are making the effort to do that but at no stage in the course of doing it should resources become an issue.  That in itself would be a kind of defeat in the face of the alarming escalation of burglaries and violence.</p></speech>

I was struck recently by a remark the Commissioner made in the context of a discussion about the bad things that are happening in rural areas.  She indicated her wish to reassure communities they were not being left alone.  That is entirely the way we in the Department are approaching matters.</p><p>As my colleague said, one of the benefits of our investment in the force is that through the analysis section the Garda is able to pinpoint - I have seen this myself - and examine what might seem to others as random, unlinked events in a community.  When they are all mapped onto an IT system and a trained, skilled person has the capacity to analyse that, however, it provides an entirely different picture.  The Garda is doing precisely that today now that we have the resources for it to do so in tackling the type of issues the Chairman referred to.  That is a big breakthrough for us and we were able to support the Garda with a resource envelope to enable it to maximise that.</p></speech>

I know this is properly a matter for the Courts Service, but our report goes to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Will Mr. Waters comment on or give the committee an idea of when it will receive a reply to that report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015110500002#AA00300"><p>I have not seen the report yet but there are a couple of points I want to make.  I have checked this with our colleagues in the courts.  First, at a policy level, we have no objections whatsoever and would support the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee having sessions on this in terms of the audit.  That is a matter for legislation and the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The committee will not find any objections from the Department or the Courts Service to it getting involved in this - far from it.  We believe it will give it added validity in terms of reassurance to people.</p> <p>  In respect of the committee's report generally, I had an opportunity overnight to have a look at its contents.  I checked this morning with colleagues in the Courts Service and they have set up a provisional implementation group on this report.  They are looking at how they will take it forward and what was identified in the committee's report.</p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, I want to make two points in support.  There is legislation on Committee Stage in the Seanad at the moment.  It is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill which will become law before the Oireachtas rises for the Christmas recess.  That will change the entire administrative apparatus around the operation of wards of court.  Another piece of legislation, which is quite complex, is the civil liability Bill, although I do not know precisely when it will emerge.  It will provide for periodic payment orders.  Therefore, instead of the courts making a very large award in one lump sum to a person who suffers a catastrophic injury, as happens, tragically, they will make awards to him or her on the basis of his or her anticipated needs during the course of his or her life.  Based on international experience, everybody would agree that would be a far more preferable way of ensuring the needs of people who find themselves in that appalling situation are met throughout the course of their lives.  That legislation is coming down the tracks as well.</p></speech>

In addition, &euro;20,716 was paid to four former public servants, and &euro;198,838 to six former members of the Judiciary who were engaged in various roles in 2014 under the same heading.  A total amount of &euro;1.226 million was paid through the payroll to 121 individuals.</p> <p>  On 4 November, I saw in a newspaper that &euro;1 million was paid in expenses to judges in six months this year.  Is it true that their gowns and so forth are paid through the Department or the Courts Service?</p></speech>

Any expenses in the course of their duties are picked up by the Courts Service Vote.  The Chairman asked about individuals who were paid.  An example of those would be the judge who ordinarily presides over our citizenship ceremonies.  He is paid a small stipend for each of those.  That is one example.  Another example is a judge who is involved in ensuring the telephone and communications legislation is operating appropriately.  Therefore we are talking about people who are involved for relatively small stipends for doing that work, and they are all retired.  Then there is a judge who chairs the mental health review body.  That involves prisoners who have been found guilty but insane.  They have a statutory right to have their cases reviewed, so a judge is involved in reviewing those cases.  Those are the types of situations where such people are involved.  We have a judge who is the chief inspector of our prisons.</p> <p>  A former senior civil servant is the commissioner for the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.  Members of the Parole Board are former public servants.  It was believed that they would be able to bring something to that board, but they are not entirely public servants.</p></speech>

That is a concern for us, as it is a concern for all colleagues in other Departments regarding people who are overpaid.  Both in the Prisons Vote and the Department's Vote, one of the difficulties is that the regulations governing sick leave were changed so that now people move on to half-pay after three months of sick leave.  Our systems are slow in catching up with that.  We are also moving or have moved some of our payrolls.  Up to recently, these were all done by my colleagues' operation in Killarney, but we are now moving into a public service payroll centre.  We are working with them to ensure we reduce those overpayments to the minimum and, crucially, that we have repayment plans in place for everybody.  We are not happy with a situation where people have been overpaid for whatever reason, through payroll error or inputting information, and it is left to gather and there are no repayment plans in place.  One of our key objectives is to ensure we have repayment plans.</p></speech>

The idea is that all the local police would be given a specific number of streets and they would have to meet directly all of the residents, collect data on the area and be responsible for the community policing of the area.  Public representatives have worked with them on that.  Is it intended to introduce that programme throughout the country?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, she is conscious of speaking to local communities and has picked up strongly that there would be positive support for this in the sense of people in communities getting back to the old model of policing where everybody knew who their police person was.  Obviously, there are resource constraints.  However, they are reviewing that programme to see what can be done with it, subject to the resource requirements associated with it.  The Garda Commissioner is reviewing that and perhaps it is something the committee may wish to take up with her when she is before the committee.</p></speech>

I thank them in advance for their presentations and the work put into them.  I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for being here.</p><p>This is our final meeting in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>This will, we hope, be a positive opportunity for delegates to have their voices heard.  They are most welcome.  I will begin by asking Ms Helen Gilmartin from the Adoptive Parents Association of Ireland to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

Of the three who have met their birth mothers, two have also met other members of their birth families, including siblings.</p> <p>  I have been working in the area of adoption counselling and support, etc., for almost 30 years.  I was honorary secretary of the Adoptive Parents Association of Ireland, APAI, which campaigned for many years for the establishment of a contact register to enable adopted children and their birth mothers to make contact with each other, if that was what they wanted.  We were part of the consultative group which culminated in the setting up of the national contact preference register in 2005.  Many of the other members stepped back after that because they felt we had achieved quite a lot, but, as my contact information was included in leaflets and publications, including the Golden Pages, I left it there.  As a result, my workload increased and multiplied exponentially because the greater the publicity, the more people were looking for information.  As the APAI was listed under the letter "A" for adoption information and irrespective of what aspect was involved, they tended to telephone me.  I continue to assist adopted persons and birth mothers, as well as some birth fathers, when they telephone or e-mail looking for information on how to make contact with a significant other person and I am delighted to do so.  I do not work office hours, which means that I am available at all hours.  I have received telephone calls from the United States and Australia at weird hours of the day and night, but I am delighted to be able to help and enjoy a great deal of success in what I do.  I am sure committee members can accept that I have always been wholeheartedly in favour of the provision of information and tracing.</p> <p>  Counselling is a vital part of the process.</p><p>I find that when people are younger, aged 18 or 19, their immediate wish is to have instant access to everything.  One has to talk them down from that and explain how they can go about it in the proper way.  It is not a matter of just going on social media when they get a hint of their original birth name.  That is one aspect that has to be considered in the giving of information.  It is very easy for people to do a trace and they can be very successful.  They can be so successful that they land on the wrong doorstep and approach the wrong person.</p><p> Will I refer to the heads of the Bill?  Is that the mechanism?</p></speech>

Part 3, head 10 on the information and tracing service is the "Function of Agency to provide information and tracing service".  The background is that the authority has operated the National Adoption Contact Preference Register since its establishment in 2005.  This register is to be discontinued and a one-stop shop will be provided for in the Bill.  The new register should not negate all that went before.  There is much that should be salvaged from the contact register because it cost a lot to set up and maintain.</p> <p>  On head 11, the Adoption Information Register of Ireland which will be established is a new register and it is not proposed to transfer the existing entries to it.  There are approximately 11,500 entries on the current register.  Why not transfer the existing entries to the new register?  The National Adoption Contact Preference Register was set up at a considerable financial cost to the State and great personal investment by the people who registered on it.  Most of those who registered did so with the expectation of successful reunions or to exchange personal or medical information.  Some indicated that they did not want contact at that time.  Why should these original entries not migrate to the new register?  It seems wasteful and dismissive of people's hopes when they responded to the publicity for the contact register and the leaflet drop to virtually every home in the country.  The new register should encourage those already on it to reapply, particularly to update their original information.  However, they should not have to reapply for inclusion on the new register when they have already applied to the old one.  Why store this information with the authority when ideally it should be readily accessible to the new register?  An adopted person can indicate that he or she does not want contact with his or her birth parent.  I suggest that the phrase "at this time" or "at present" should be added to it.  Otherwise it is like saying, "No way, this is it, this is my final answer".  If somebody indicates that they do not want contact, whether they are the adopted person or the birth parent, it should have "at this time" added to it.</p> <p>  Head 12, on pages 48 and 49, provides for the "Allocation of monies for performance of functions by Agency and Authority and provision for charging fees".  There are huge problems with proposals to charge people for anything to do with information and tracing.  I am shocked at the implied threat to use the courts to recover unpaid fees.  Instead of making it easier and more user friendly, this will arouse great resentment among those applicants seeking to learn something about their identities which were shrouded in secrecy through no fault of their own and, dare I say it, with the connivance of the State.  </p> <p>  Head 13 concerns "Information for adopted person where adoption order made prior to commencement of Bill".  For the foreseeable future, all applicants will have had their adoption order made prior to the commencement of this Bill.  Ideally an adopted person will have counselling as soon as possible after applying to the agency for a search to be undertaken.  Non-identifying information about the birth mother should not include any fine detail of her circumstances without her permission.  Even without naming names, when people are given a few clues about siblings, for example, it is very exciting for people to go racing off to do their own research and find it all out themselves.  Social media is the prime source and has produced hair-raising results.  Unfortunately they might very successfully find the wrong person and, metaphorically speaking, land on the wrong doorstep.  Even when the searcher turns up on the right doorstep, the person who is found without any warning can very easily respond negatively, denying ever having a baby and even slamming the door.  It is hard to come back from that.</p> <p>  If the birth mother is located and engages with the agency and there is a prospect of reunion then it still should not be part of the agency's brief to pass on her personal information.  Details of her marriage and other children or where she lives should be her choice to reveal when she wishes to and at her own pace.  Nobody else should assume the right to disclose her history unless she is ready to share it, neither should they assume the right to disclose the name of the birth father.  After all, the father's name given when the records were taken might have been aspirational rather than actual.  Without a DNA test it is risky to assume anything, unless the putative birth father acknowledges his status.</p> <p>  Likewise, telling someone that they were conceived as a result of rape is information for further down the line and should be handled very carefully.  Counselling is vital, not just exchanging information.  The adopted person's history has been made with a family that they feel is their own, with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.  Often they have siblings - some adopted, some born to the family.  Instead of developing into friendships, I have seen reunions fizzle out sooner than they should simply because of an impatience to know everything and an insistence to meet people who might never have been told about this part of their mother's history, for example, if the birth mother has married and had children and has not told her husband or the children of her marriage that she had a child before she was married.  It is wrong to assume that anybody has a right to barge in on all of her relationships just because an individual needs or expects to have full disclosure.  I emphasise that because I have seen it crash and burn because it has not been handled properly.</p> <p>  During the reunion and discovery process, the birth mother will gradually reveal enough information to enable the adopted person to get their original birth certificate without applying to anyone else for permission.  That would be where there is an agreement to contact.  I do not think the giving of the birth certificate should pre-empt that part of the search and reunion.  If the birth mother cannot meet or divulge any information, then the birth certificate becomes relevant.  Prior to that if there is a meeting, the adopted person knows his or her own date of birth.  If they are meeting the birth mother they will know her name.  They will be able to get their birth certificate very easily if they have not got it already.  Many adopted people get it before going on the register.</p></speech>

This is not so.  It should be noted that people adopted prior to 12 November 1975 in England and Wales, like our own mostly closed adoptions, have to have counselling, because the same assurances were given to the birth mothers there that their information would be kept private.  Even with adoptions that took place after 12 November 1975, counselling is almost always part of the process.  I am regularly in contact with English and Welsh social workers and I help with searches.  I have asked how they exchange information and what I have described as the ideal way in Ireland seems to match their usual procedure regardless of when the adoptions happened.  Assessing the applicants' understanding of what contact might reveal, both positive and negative, how they would handle it if there is a negative feedback, explaining the value of taking things slowly and being considerate of the other's feelings about having their past opened up to assessment or judgment, particularly if the mother had another kept child-----</p></speech>

We welcome any discussion on a Bill that would address the question of adoption information because the Adoption Rights Alliance and our predecessor group, Adoption Ireland, have been campaigning on this since 1999.  I will go through the headings I have included in my speaking notes.  I will not read out my submission verbatim but it will be available afterwards.  We have a separate document from Monday that we will make available to the committee and in which we address each head individually.<br/><br/>The first point that occurred to us on reading the Bill was that there was no real sense that its authors had faced up to the background of Ireland's rather flawed adoption industry.  There is no reference to criminality, illegal adoptions or those children who were trafficked to the United States.  On the question of illegal adoptions, there are two false assumptions, one being that there is no paper trail for illegal adoptions.  It very much depends where and through which agency a child was illegally adopted.  St. Patrick's Guild has a file on every person it placed for adoption, be it legally, illegally or before the enactment of the Adoption Act 1952.  Therefore, there will be two sets of people whose information will have to be handled under that heading.<br/><br/>I thank my colleague Ms Mari Steed, my opposite number in the United States who is a member of a group called Banished Babies, and other groups representing people trafficked from Ireland to the United States.  They are astonished that they have been totally ignored in the provisions of this Bill.  Given that speakers from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs referred to &quot;Philomena&quot;, it is astonishing that they chose to omit this whole category of people from the Bill.  Ms Steed has some questions she would like the committee to consider.<br/><br/>Also on top of our list is the misinterpretation of the I. O'T. <i>v</i>. B. Supreme Court case.  There have been false assumptions about that case for many years.  There is a pretence that the vast majority of women were promised privacy when in fact the opposite seems to have prevailed in that women were forced to sign away their rights to their children rather than having been guaranteed any specific rights themselves.  I commend Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the reappointed chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, on his salient comments on this matter on 22 October.  I will repeat them for the record: </p><blockquote>A possible interpretation of the judgment in the case of I. O'T <i>v</i>. B is that the right to information about a child's identity is a freestanding entitlement that does not depend on the existence or necessarily the enforcement of the maintenance of a relationship between parent and child.  That is worth considering when it comes to legislating.  This judgment has been held up as a roadblock to legislating in this area.  I take the view that it should not present a roadblock and it is not of huge relevance in the area.</blockquote> <p>When considering the question of privacy, members should realise it is a two-way street and that, as it stands, because adoptive people are denied access to their information and knowledge about their families of origin, the State is positively impeding their right to lead a private life.  I cited the relevant article from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  I would like the committee to consider that.<br/><br/>We also want the committee to consider whether the Bill's provisions are discriminatory as no other children in the history of this State have been denied access to their birth and early care information to the same extent as adopted people.  A blanket ban has prevailed in this area, for both marital and non-marital children.  I would like the committee to consider in particular the reciprocal arrangements in the Good Friday Agreement, under which the Irish Human Rights Commission was set up.  The commission's brief is to ensure Irish citizens, both north and south of the Border, enjoy the same rights.  Our Northern Ireland counterparts have enjoyed open access to their adoption records since 1987.<br/><br/>I will not refer to counselling and support, as Ms Gilmartin has done, because I believe the Minister should seriously consider decoupling identity information from contact and tracing provisions.  That would make the entire job of this committee and Houses so much simpler.<br/><br/>I commend Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Averil Power on their work on the Adoption (Identity and Information) Bill that was presented to the Seanad last year.  It ran to only 16 pages and very few of us had a problem with its content.  I commend Dr. Fergus Ryan, who will be speaking to the committee today, on his work on that.  Our fifth recommendation is for the committee is to consider the Oregon law on the handling of adoption information.<br/><br/>I will now move on to particular objections to sections of the Bill.  There are very limited statutory rights for adopted people in the Bill.  They are limited by access conditions in addition to veto conditions.  We must be very up-front and name them.  There is not an automatic right to information; there are absolute vetoes in place.  I ask the committee to consider either having a firm definition of &quot;compelling reasons&quot; or, as we recommend, setting it aside completely because we can see it being abused at a very high level.<br/><br/>We also have concerns about Tusla.  We do not believe social workers are best placed to trace natural parents as they have neither the resources nor the expertise.  If the Minister is insisting on leaving information and tracing provisions together in this Bill, we want to see a completely rewritten model involving family law experts and experts in data mining.<br/><br/>Let me refer to the files.  The details on how an adopted person would gain access to his or her file are scant.  We will discover in the end that a further layer of information vetoes will attach to the access provisions for files.  There are at least five files that any particular adopted person might have.  Only one of them could really be called an adoption file, that is, the file of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Every member of the population should have the same level of access to all files.<br/><br/>Ms Patricia White from Barnardos will be speaking to the committee later.  That organisation runs the Origins project for people who were separated from their family through incarceration in industrial homes.  There are no compelling reasons, or statutory declarations, to be signed for accessing its database.  Adopted people should not be treated differently in this regard.<br/><br/>I wish to talk about the prejudice and discrimination that pervade this Bill.  Some of the language is highly offensive if one considers that an adopted person may be denied the right to discover his or her identity because of &quot;compelling reasons&quot; based on the view that the discovery of that identity &quot;may endanger the life of a person&quot;.  This is confirmed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is very inflammatory language and it will not make adopted people feel any better about the Bill.<br/><br/>I have identified other issues in this part of the Bill and they are contained in page 11 of my notes under the heading &quot;Prejudice and Discrimination towards Adopted People - Past &amp;amp; Present&quot;.  I concur with Ms Gilmartin and other speakers that the notion that adopted people would be charged fees is abhorrent.<br/><br/>Clarifying the numbers is important because neither Tusla nor any other service provider could be in a position to adjudicate on how well placed it is to offer the service until we actually assess the numbers of people using it.  We estimate the number is approximately 90,000.</p><p> Would this Bill have assisted Philomena and Anthony Lee?  Our conclusion is that it would not.  Were he alive today, Anthony Lee would be appalled at how this Bill does not even stop to consider him and his 2,000 counterparts.  He would be appalled at how the Government has squandered the publicity dividend that his story and that of his mother generated.  He would be appalled the database of his files, and those of the other banished babies, have been moved to the Department  of Foreign Affairs and Trade where there are no systems in place to allow access.  He would be appalled to discover the extent to which the Irish State co-operated in trafficking children to the US.  It is only because of the international embarrassment caused by the film, &ldquo;Philomena&rdquo;, that we are even sitting discussing this matter.  Yet, Philomena and Anthony Lee will not be assisted one iota by this Bill.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Margaret Dromey, chief executive officer, an expert in this field, and Ms Marie Naughton, a Treoir director and social worker with Here to Help, an organisation which specialises in crisis pregnancy support.</p> <p> Treoir, formerly the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, was founded in 1976 to improve the position of unmarried parents and their children in Ireland.  As well as operating a national specialist information service, Treoir promotes policy change, advocates on behalf of unmarried parents and their children and undertakes relevant research.  In the early days of the organisation in the 1970s and 1980s, significant numbers of unmarried mothers placed their children for adoption.  It was not socially acceptable to be unmarried and raise a child in Ireland then.  Many unmarried women who became pregnant concealed the fact of pregnancy, hid away in mother and baby homes and had no option but to place their children for adoption.  They sought and were guaranteed secrecy.  Treoir&rsquo;s early directory of services for unmarried parents listed 20 adoption societies placing children for adoption in Ireland, an indication of the demand for the service.  By contrast, the 2015 edition of the information pack for unmarried parents only mentions adoption in the context of step-parent adoption, a testament to how society has changed dramatically.  The days are long gone when unmarried women have to hide from their families and society during pregnancy and when adoption was the only socially acceptable solution to an unwanted pregnancy outside marriage.</p> <p>  While secret adoption solved the problem of pregnancy outside of marriage, there was little awareness the children who were placed for adoption may in the future have a desire, indeed a right, to know the identity of their birth parents in order to have a sense of who they are.  Article 8.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states, &ldquo;States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as recognised by law without unlawful interference&rdquo;.  Treoir has from its foundation believed that, although children may be raised apart from one or both parents, they have a right to have their identity preserved.  We have made numerous submissions on this issue over the years, most recently on the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.</p> <p>  Treoir warmly welcomes the publication of the general scheme and heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015.  We appeal to the committee to ensure this legislation is progressed as quickly as possible.  Treoir has several concerns about the heads, however.  Our concerns are mainly around information and tracing associated with adoptions that occurred in the past.  Balancing the right to privacy of mothers and the adoptees&rsquo; need to know of their origins will be a challenge.  Also, if the service is not adequately resourced, those involved in adoption will be further hurt by their experience.</p> <p>  In respect of adoption orders made following the enactment of the legislation, all parties will be aware of the principle of openness and no guarantees of secrecy will be given.  The birth parent will be aware that information will be released to the adoptee when he or she reaches 18 years and the adoptee will have his or her identity preserved.  This will ensure so many of the problems we are experiencing today will no longer exist.</p> <p>  On head 7, the information to be kept by the authority, Treoir proposes the information on the birth father is also included.  This information is important for identity purposes.</p> <p>  On heads 8 and 10, Treoir member organisations have concerns that accredited adoption agencies will be excluded from the information and tracing service, as all applications to join the register are to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  As currently drafted, it is not clear if the adoption agencies accredited to undertake search and reunion work will have access to the register.</p> <p>  On heads 11 and 12, Treoir believes it is imperative the register and the supports to those involved in adoption are adequately resourced with a ring-fenced budget.  Treoir would be very concerned if adoptees or birth parents were denied a service because of lack of finances.  The service should be free to adoptees and birth parents.</p> <p>  We have great difficulty understanding why it is not possible through this Bill to transfer records from the passive to the active register.  This is information on 12,000 people, an extraordinary resource that has been developed with great patience and expertise.  At a minimum, such a transfer would save resources that could be better spent.  We believe those currently on the passive register should be contacted and invited to transfer.  A public awareness campaign will not suffice for this purpose.</p> <p>  On head 13, Treoir welcomes the presumption in favour of disclosure of information, unless the birth parent gives compelling reasons for not disclosing.  We welcome the requirement for adoptees to sign the statutory declaration, agreeing to respect the privacy of the birth mother.  We recognise that many birth mothers wish to have contact with their birth children but that there is a small number for whom the prospect of their secret adoption having to be disclosed to family is a source of great distress and fear.  Their situation needs to be handled with the greatest sensitivity and balance.  Their guarantee of privacy and confidentially, as well as the severing of parental rights and responsibilities at the time of adoption, must be balanced with the right of the adoptee to information about his or her birth parent.</p> <p>  On heads 23 and 24, Treoir agrees that those who were incorrectly registered should be assisted to acquire information on their biological parents and enabled to have their births registered correctly.  Wrongful registration raises an issue for Treoir about the inappropriateness of the adoption/birth certificates issued under section 89(2) of the Adoption Act 2010.  The abridged version of the certificate, which appears to be the default version generally provided by the General Register Office, names the adoptive parents as the mother and father.  There is no mention of adoption on the certificate.  There is something incongruous about the State on one hand issuing birth certificates with inaccurate information to conceal the fact of adoption, while at the same time censuring those who falsely registered births in the past to conceal the fact of adoption.  We understand that some adoptees would not want the fact that they are adopted to appear on their new birth certificate.  A solution needs to be found to enable authentic certificates to be issued, while respecting the wishes of these adoptees.  Consideration should be given to a return to short-form birth certificates.  This issue will also have to be addressed in the context of children born of assisted human reproduction to same-sex couples.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for his time and attention.</p></speech>

When the organisation was set up in 1998 the first thing we did before we made a submission to the Government on adoption - in that case it was the Hague Convention - we carried out research on adoption matters in the National Archives of Ireland.  We found two very important statements which we feel proves that there was a forced adoption policy on behalf of the State.  The first quote comes from a speech given by Mr. Paddy Cooney, the then Minister for Justice, at the first Irish Adoption Workers' Conference in 1974.  He said, &quot;I think we are all agreed that the consensus opinion in our society is to the effect that adoption is better for the illegitimate baby than to be cared for by its mother&quot;.  The second quote was by Marie Louise Colbert who was a social worker with the Adoption Board and comes from an article she wrote herself that was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i>in 1976.  She said, &quot;This tendency (for mothers to keep their babies) may have progressed too far.  Fewer babies are coming onto the adoption market as a result&quot;.  These two quotes say it all.<br/><br/>Prior to the setting up of our organisation in 1998, one of our committee made a submission to the review committee on adoption services in 1983 which is 33 years ago.  The person was a natural mother who asked in the letter which was sent to the then Government, which had invited submissions from members of the public and interest groups, that a yearly letter be sent to every mother whose child had been taken from her by adoption to tell her how her child was faring and if her child was alive or dead.  Anguish over a child's safety is the nightmare that mothers must live with.  Every day of a mother's life from the time her child is taken from her she will worry that her child is sick or dead.  Every time an accident is reported in the newspaper and the child involved is a son or daughter at the right age mothers think that could be their child.<br/><br/>However, mothers have no right in law even now, as envisaged in this Bill, to know whether their child is alive or dead.  My organisation has operated a helpline for the past 20 years, so we know the nightmares that mothers must go through.  I can cite one case where a mother sought information on her son for many years, on an annual basis, through the adoption agency but she did not have the right to get any information on him.  At the same time he was looking for information on her because both of his adoptive parents had died and he was in care.  When mother and son found each other they had a happy reunion and he came to live with her but they were resentful of the fact that the State had allowed their separation to continue and that he had to remain in care when she was willing to provide a home for him.  The case illustrates the fact that, as has often been said on our side of the fence but also by adoptive people, adoption is a permanent solution for what is often a temporary problem.  From the time when the unmarried mothers' allowance and other State supports became available to help mothers keep their children, adoption figures went down.  <br/><br/>I shall try to summarise the opening statement that we have compiled.  I shall try not to read it all because I know it sounds boring when one does so.  This is the fifth submission that we have made to the Government on adoption legislation since the foundation was set up.  It greatly disappoints us that this Bill seems to ignore all of the work that we put into previous submissions over the years.  The situation illustrates the cyclical nature of governments changing and legislative ideas changing along with them.  It also points to the danger of having a generalist Civil Service.  Very often particular civil servants will have put a lot of work into legislation on adoption matters but when they move up the chain they generally move sideways.  It means they move away from dealing with adoption legislation to dealing with legislation on agriculture, industry and commerce, etc.  It also means that everything that they have done gets locked in a filing cabinet and forgotten, which is a structural problem that needs to be improved.  We wanted to bring that aspect to the attention of the committee.<br/><br/>There is another issue that we would like to bring to the committee's attention, and it is something that we harp on all of the time.  Since 1998, when we made our first submission,  we have emphasised at all times that we are hurt and offended by the inaccurate and insulting terms of birth mother and birth father.  Both terms diminish our connection with our children to the few hours of their birth and reduces us to the status of breeding machines.  When we reunite with our children it is very rare for them to ask us about the details of their birth because they are interested in everything and anything else.  Furthermore, now that women can be contracted and paid to give birth to a child with whom they have no genetic connection, the term &quot;birth mother&quot; is plainly legally confusing.  We are mothers and fathers and, therefore, have no need for prefixes of any kind. <br/><br/>With regard to the most recent Adoption Act 2010, which was the last legislation that we commented on, we said the following: &quot;It seems to be a hastily drawn-up document which clumsily incorporates all previous adoption legislation together with provision for giving effect to The Hague Convention&quot;.  Our prediction has come to pass.  The Bill under consideration will necessitate a raft of amendments.  It does not even attempt to provide a wording for the further amendments which will need to be introduced following the passing of the Children and Family Relationships Act.  We strongly urge the Minister to defer the enactment of this adoption Bill until it can be considered and examined by the Oireachtas joint committee alongside the Children and Family Relationships Act.  We will welcome making a further presentation to the committee on both in tandem.<br/><br/>The present Bill is mainly constructed from the perspective of the adopted person and an illustration of same can be found in the flow chart that was provided with the wording of the Bill.  The chart only shows how an adoptive person can seek information.  It does not show how a natural mother can seek information on her child.  Therefore, its glaringly obvious from the text of the Bill that our previous submissions were never read.  <br/><br/>We have operated a helpline for natural parents for nearly 20 years.  Our helpline number was distributed through the information leaflet for the contact preference register that was published by the Adoption Authority of Ireland and distributed to every household in the State.  Therefore, we are in a position to vouch for the fact that almost all natural mothers and many fathers wish to have contact with and receive reassurance that their children are alive and happy.  It is a great pity that this Bill gives so little credence to that fact.  We can only hazard a guess that the reason for this false assumption arises from the State's belief that natural mothers were promised secrecy which is simply not true.  An examination of all forms of the adoption consent forms in use by the private adoption agencies, which were registered with the Adoption Board, notes only that the natural mother lost all rights and responsibilities regarding her child.  If those private agencies made verbal statements to mothers on secrecy or, more commonly, told her that she had no right to interfere in her child's life, which was what most of us were told, then such verbal statements have no legal standing.  Over the years the Adoption Board should have closely monitored the agencies to ensure that they did not step outside the letter of the law, as detailed in the Adoption Act 1952.  The Bill continues to deny adopted people their birth certificates.  We support their right to have unrestricted access to their birth certificates as a human right alongside all other citizens of the State.<br/><br/>We note that the Bill does not accede to our demand that we noted in our submission of 1999 for parity with our adult children.  We believe that we should be able to access our children's adoption certificates at the point where our children access their birth certificates.</p><p>A hierarchy of rights can be applied to the practice of forced adoption.  At the time of the adoption, the child had no choice, the mother usually had no financial or social supports and had very little choice, while the adopting couple had a free choice.</p><p> The contact facilitation provisions in the Bill are woefully inadequate.  The amount of space and wording given to it highlights the fact that no consideration is given to the support needed during the contact process, the support of the relationship that would be developing between the adult child and his or her mother, and the counselling both parties would need to make the reunion work.  High Court expenses would, it seems, be taken from the overall budget of the Child and Family Agency.  If this is the case and if there is recourse to High Court hearings on points of law, the fees to be charged to individuals will have to increase proportionally.  We do not agree with the charging of fees.</p><p> We concur with Susan Lohan of the Adoption Rights Alliance that the interpretation of the I. O'T judgment has been faulty.  We do not agree with the way the State has interpreted it.  Under the present interpretation, if an agency or the Adoption Authority of Ireland knows the adopted person does not know he or she is adopted, the person is not contacted and told he or she is adopted and illegally registered.  It is a basic civil right that a person should know who his or her real parents are.</p></speech>

However, it is by and large a common sense Bill within the existing constitutional and Supreme Court limits.  It is also a reasonable and good faith attempt to address many of the issues that have been deliberately stalled and swept under the carpet by successive Governments.  The inclusion and recognition of the illegally adopted people in our community is to be welcomed alongside the long overdue collection and safeguarding of adoption files currently in private hands.  With some goodwill on the part of this committee and the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and with the active participation of the adoption community, the Bill can move significantly closer to fulfilling the realistic expectations of the people it affects.</p> <p>  The one-year lead-in is a major problem.  Members of the adoption community are elderly and getting older by the day.  As somebody pointed out to me earlier, seven people in the community have died since the commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes started in January.  The longer the delay continues, the more people will fail to have reunions or any options.  Because of and during the one-year lead-in, both adoptees and natural parents will end up reuniting with headstones in cold and lonely graveyards.  The solution is to reduce the lead-in to the bare minimum, perhaps 30 to 60 days.  The resources that are to be allocated for use over a year should be put into a more intensive information campaign as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I have a major problem with Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill which deal with informal adoption and wrongful registration and are sorely missing the real point here.  &ldquo;Informal adoption&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrongful registration&rdquo; are a polite way describing the most serious criminal actions, including illegal adoptions, potentially baby trafficking and even child abduction.  These criminal actions, by their very nature, leave little or no paperwork and what little may exist is usually fraudulent.  This matter needs to be taken far more seriously and the State needs to accept that where it failed in the past, it needs to correct matters proactively now and into the future.</p> <p>  Illegal adoptees are in the worst position of all adoptees, and that is if they are the lucky ones who know they are adopted.  What is to be done about the people who are illegally adopted and do not even know they are adopted?  This echoes what Ms McManus said.  The State has a duty of care to tell people they are adopted if they do not know.  While the issue of adoptees, legal and illegal, having no medical history is bad enough, those who do not know they are adopted at all have unknowingly given false medical histories to their doctors and thereby risked their lives and health.  It is more than likely that innocent people have died because of false medical information they provided in good faith.  Without proactive intervention by the Government, they will continue unwittingly to pass on false medical histories, including to their children, with potentially lethal consequences.</p> <p>  Section 4 of head 23 in Part 5 states an &ldquo;Agency must take all steps it considers reasonable&rdquo; to locate natural parents on behalf of an illegal adoptee.  It is too little, too late.  What is needed is a small, dedicated team of civil servants and garda&iacute;, with modest resources, to investigate actively the case of any illegal adoptee who applies to the unit.  If, in the course of any investigation, any evidence comes to light regarding other illegally adopted persons, the team shall discreetly approach any person it believes to be illegally adopted and inform him or her of that fact, in line with the State&rsquo;s duty of care to people who are the unwitting victims of a crime.  I fully concur with what Ms McManus said on this.  All the actions needed by illegally adopted people must also be applied to natural mothers and fathers whose children were taken against their will and-or forcibly adopted.  This applies to the great majority of illegally adopted people.</p> <p>  Despite the fact it runs to 200 pages, there are still some omissions in the Bill, including unenumerated forced relinquishment in modern Ireland.  Although it is not mentioned in the Bill, there is one major outstanding matter in contemporary adoption in Ireland that needs to be addressed and included.  We have a ridiculous and woefully outdated provision in current adoption law known as the &ldquo;step-parent adoption process&rdquo;.  This provision forces a parent who wishes to unite his or her family legally, usually after a marriage, to relinquish his or her child legally in order that the child can be re-adopted by the relinquishing parent along with the new spouse.  A natural mother must become an adoptive mother under the law.  We still have an odious form of forced relinquishment in Ireland which demands a natural parent to sign away his or her child and transform into an adoptive parent.  There are no plans to change this bizarre provision.  The Bill is the ideal opportunity to shelve this degrading anomaly.  It is a simple enough matter to include in the new Bill, would also certainly be cost neutral and may save the State money and the valuable time of social workers and garda&iacute; in vetting and paperwork.</p> <p>  Appended to this submission is a link to a public petition initiated by Milana Kearns, a dedicated and loving mother unwilling to sign away her children for anyone or anything.  Milana is caught between wanting to unite her family and her principled stand against signing away her own child.  CMABS fully supports Milana&rsquo;s fight for a fair and just system to be put in place.  The public comments on the petition clearly record the anger of a selection of members of the public who have been caught in this legal anomaly and their desire for a fair and just reworking of the system to recognise legally the reality of the many new and loving families who simply want to be recognised and accommodated.  It is abundantly clear that many families are caught in this legal quandary and the numbers are likely to increase.</p> <p>  I urge the committee to recommend that the Minister include a couple of brief paragraphs in the new adoption Bill that would sort this problem instantly.  There are no major principles or constitutional issues at stake.  It means the General Register Office would produce a new template certificate for use in such situations.  People have been talking about the future regarding surrogacy.  In such situations, we need a certificate headed &ldquo;Birth and Adoption Certificate&rdquo; which would reflect the new reality of life in modern Ireland.</p><p>The no-contact veto is the most publicly contentious provision of this Bill.  I represent an umbrella group of several different adoption campaign groups and there are widely differing opinions on this veto.  It is impossible to represent the community fully without noting all sides of this argument.  I will briefly run through them.  There are civil and human rights arguments against<i></i>the veto by those who feel passionately that adoptees should be able to access their personal original birth certificates without any restrictions of any kind whatsoever.  Some members of the community will never accept this veto and will continue to fight it on principle into the future regardless of whether this Bill is passed.  As part of this side of the argument, Adopted Illegally Ireland would like to point out to the committee that, &quot;Adopted Illegally Ireland notes that the eighth amendment to the Irish Constitution gives the life of an unborn child equal status to the right to life of the mother, why then doesn't that same child have equal rights to an identity and know their mother ... in life.&quot;<br/><br/>Then there are those, and I include myself among them, who accept this Bill and the no-contact veto simply because of the reality of the current legal restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court's ruling in the  I. O&rsquo;T case. The argument is that they can see no other way to balance the rights of adoptees and natural mothers and thereby ensure this Bill is constitutional. They also argue that the idea that a no-contact veto is discriminatory is a relatively new idea that originated approximately 20 years ago in America, and as Ireland has a distinctly different Constitution and specifically a unique Supreme Court ruling on the balance of rights of adoptees and natural mothers, this idea is simply incompatible with our legal system as it stands. This does not mean it is impossible to change the veto but we argue that it can only be very slightly modified at present and not dropped as any Bill such as this is legally obliged to protect the constitutional right to privacy of natural mothers.</p></speech>

People have spoken about an elderly vulnerable community who have not only been through the trauma of losing a child to adoption but have also been through the trauma of the hellhole of mother and baby homes and that they should be protected.  Ms Helen Gilmartin has spoken out about protecting such vulnerable people and fragile women, and she is right.  They need to be protected.</p> <p>  It is only fair to note that beyond the confines of the active campaigners in the community, people like us and the small number of people we represent, the majority of the non-political but active community have voiced no opinion either way.  That would be the great majority of people who have no strong opinions about the veto either way.  I will leave it at that and I thank the members for listening.</p></speech>

I very much thank them for their presentations, for all the work they have done in this field over a very long period and for bringing us to the position in which we now find ourselves.</p> <p>  We all welcome that the heads of the Bill have been published.  The legislation has been a long time in coming and we are all pleased this day has come.  Whether people agree that it contains everything is a matter to be teased out.  The presentations from the representatives of each of the organisations have highlighted not only the problems they have with the Bill but, in very many cases, they have also presented us with many solutions.  I am sure those issues and solutions will be very important in the drafting of the Bill and that many of them will be taken on board.  Some of the solutions and issues presented were probably ones we had not even thought of but I noted from the presentations that many of the issues overlap a little.</p> <p>  These are real and genuine issues for many people.  It is a very complex issue and also a very sensitive issue.  I agree that everybody is entitled to know their identity and where they come from.  They are entitled to their medical records and their health footprint.  I agree with Mr. Paul Redmond that it is very important that everybody is entitled to know that.</p> <p>  I have jotted down some notes on this as we have heard other presentations and issues have arisen in previous briefings.  I agree with Ms Susan Lohan that privacy is a two-way street.  There are the issues we discussed at the other hearings with regard to compelling reasons not to disclose information.  We have been trying to figure out exactly what a compelling reason is.  It has varied from a life or death situation to somebody being distressed.  We made the point that there is distress on both sides.  There is the question of who makes the decision on the compelling reasons and we have asked for examples of compelling reasons.  The Minister stated last week that it will be a panel set up within Tusla.  That gave us some indication of who might be making the decisions in this regard.</p> <p>  There are many views on statutory declarations.  Most people are of the view that people should not have to make a statutory declaration, but I have noted that not everybody would be of that view.  There is, however, nothing to stop a relative afterwards from getting involved or people looking through social media.  There are varying views on that as well.</p> <p>  I agree strongly on the issue of fees and that there is the threat of using the courts to recover unpaid fees.  That is of great concern to everybody and is reflected in all the presentations.</p> <p>  With regard to the funding of counselling services, I am not sure who will provide all the counselling services or how they will be funded.  We all know that Tusla is pretty underfunded as we speak, and even though it got an increase in funding under the budget, it is providing funding to a great number of organisations and areas ranging from family resource centres to the implementation of the aftercare Bill and the adoption (information and tracing) Bill to women's refuges.  Will it be able to fund the implementation of this Bill and the social workers required and will it cause backlogs?  This needs to be teased out a little more.</p> <p>  The national adoption contact preference register has been in place since 2005 and much work has done on it.  I strongly agree that the data need to be transferred.  I am not sure if there is a legal issue in this regard but a great deal of money in terms of time and resources has been spent and we need to find a way to make it work.  It is very important.  Have I used up my allotted time?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.826" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#J00800"><p>To pick up on Deputy McLellan's last point, it has been great to get the representatives' presentations and they show us the complexity and importance of the issues with which we are dealing in this Bill.  I thank each of the representatives for their presentations.  We will not cover each of the points raised but that does not mean the committee is not considering them.  We will not cover some of them because we agree with them and that will be in the report and we will deal with that.</p> <p>  I co-sponsored a Bill with Senator Power.  In my work in the area of children's rights, which is where I have come from to this issue, there is the issue of the right to identity and the importance of that right.  That certainly frames my thoughts on the area and how we ensure the right to identity of every individual of this State or those who have gone to other countries who are equally entitled to that right.</p><p>When the Adoption Authority of Ireland was before the committee, Professor Geoffrey Shannon said we cannot rewrite the past, but equally we cannot be paralysed by the past.  That is what I will bear in mind in the context of the Bill, that we must find a way that we are not also paralysed by our past, as all too often we have been.  For me, change is incremental.  The Bill has come further.  I hear what people are saying about how the Bill needs to go further.  There may be pieces of it we can look at but my sense is that in the balancing of rights, change is incremental.  I just want to be honest.  I will try to do what I can to try to get the Bill progressed as much as possible because I am very conscious of people who are getting older and if we wait to get the perfect model, there may be nobody around to see it and I do not want that.  I just want to be honest with people.</p><p> Some questions have been raised with us about counselling and who should provide it.  We could get into discussions about the degrees of counselling.  I have a concern about it being a social worker given some people's experience with social work services.  I say that with no disrespect to current social work services.  The agencies in this regard have been raised as an issue by several witnesses.  We must examine the option and ensure people are entitled to have a choice once there is a certain standard or level, but we must be open and examine the issue.</p><p> Illegal adoption concerns me.  We must be very broad and open in terms of how we understand the position with records.  There will not be one piece of paper or one file for every child transferred.  It may involve a nurse's register, as we have seen, and there may be different types of documents.  My understanding is that files are being transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of this measure.  I understand we will deal with some of that, but a scoping exercise could point to where documents might exist if organisations wish to come back to us and say we need to look at certain records.  However, it is my understanding that many records are being transferred.</p><p> I agree with what was said about compelling reasons.  I have heard that we need to have the provision in the Bill to ensure balance and to ensure it is constitutional.  Nobody has yet been able to give us an example of a compelling reason that I am satisfied with.  In fact, I was alarmed by one of the compelling reasons we were given by the Child and Family Agency because it was a case of distress and while I do not want to diminish what is involved, it was a case of distress and not a compelling reason.  We very much have to separate the information and contact.  One has a right to information and nobody wants to put anyone into distress, but that cannot be a compelling reason in terms of one's right to identity.  There must be a process and the way that happens is important, but it does not mean one can say it is a compelling reason and therefore we will not provide it because we are where we are at the moment.</p><p> I heard what was said about fees and also the contact preference register.  That had not come up before and we will ask why the register is not being transferred.  I am grateful the point was raised with us.</p><p> In terms of the information and awareness campaign, I accept what was said about the lead-in time.  I have asked if the committee could be presented with the information and awareness campaign in order that we could have a say in it when it is being devised.  I would like to hear whether the witnesses have any advice for us.</p><p> Two issues were raised with which I concur but which are outside the scope of the Bill.  I am in agreement on the step-parent adoption issue.  I have dealt with too many cases.  It is wrong that we have children being adopted today in a closed adoption system.  We are talking about the past but we are also talking about the present and step-parent adoption is part of that.</p><p> On the issue raised by Treoir on birth certificates, that was an issue it raised with me and we tried to change the civil registration Bill.  The fact we could not was one of the most depressing moments for me in the House.  If a person is adopted, it is a fact.  I said in the Seanad that I believe it is a case of the State colluding in falsifying documents.  It is wrong that there is not even an asterisk on the certificate to identify it in some way.  I get it, and I had not thought of it in the context of the Bill under discussion because it comes under the Department of Social Protection, but it is something for the committee to examine.  The witnesses will all be allowed to make further comments.</p><p> It is important in terms of one's right to identity that a person would always know.  I want to have a system whereby a person would always know he or she was adopted.  This is part of learning the lessons from the past.  We must deal with the past but we must also deal with the present in order that children would never be in a position where they do not know.  They should have those rights.  It is a fact that a person is adopted.  We are making it into a stigma by taking the approach we are taking.  I agree with the point.</p><p> I thank Mr. Redmond for what he said about the no-contact information.  The way he has articulated it strikes a really good balance and shows us the complexities we are dealing with.  I thank him for doing that.</p></speech>

I will not repeat what Deputy McLellan and Senator van Turnhout have said.</p> <p>  Ms Gilmartin mentioned there is an existing register and she is worried that it will not be transferred into the new register.  I would like to hear why she thinks that is the case and how members can ensure it is transferred because it is very rich information and it should be in the new register.</p> <p>  I agree with everything that was said by my colleagues and the witnesses about charges and fees.  There must be a balance between the mother and the adopted person.  It is difficult and no matter what we do, people will still be hurt.  I am not sure I agree with Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s suggestion about 30 to 60 days.  It is a little short.  I would be interested to hear whether the other witnesses agree with a lead-in of 30 to 60 days or whether they think it should be more.  That would help us to understand what we should do.  I would imagine that more time should be allowed but I am open to being convinced.</p></speech>

I will read back over the contributions later.  I thank the witnesses for coming forward.  I have met some of them in connection with other issues.  I compliment them on the work they have done in advocating the need for the Bill and for bringing it to where it is today.  All political parties welcome the publication of the Bill.  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s work in bringing the Bill to where it is today.  As my colleague, Senator van Turnhout, said, I am very conscious of the time-sensitive nature of the issue because so many people who have been affected by adoptions are ageing and we must ensure we get the Bill right and done in a timely fashion.  We are coming to the end of this D&aacute;il term and we must ensure we get it right.  The input of the witnesses today is very important.  We are talking about giving back a basic, fundamental human right to people, namely, one&rsquo;s right to one&rsquo;s identity.  We all agree with that.  That is the purpose of the meeting.</p> <p>  I, too, am worried by the lack of a clear definition of a compelling reason.  That leaves it to public servants, staff in Tusla or whoever else to use their own interpretation.  The situation is not clear cut.  It is not black and white.  It is bad legislation when something is open to interpretation.  As colleagues said, we must ensure there is at a minimum a clear definition of a compelling reason.  Perhaps the witnesses could help us draft such a definition.</p> <p>  The statutory declaration is a further insult to people who have been treated already as second-class citizens.</p><p>We have to look at how that can be addressed into the future.  We also have to be true to the legal advice that has been given regarding being able to deal with this retrospectively.  The legal opinion we have been given, through the Minister and the Department is that the only way it can be done retrospectively is by including this statutory declaration.  Funding is going to be a crucial issue, as with anything.  Even with the limited service that is available through Tusla at the moment, the length of time some people are waiting to be dealt with is appalling.  It takes months or years in some instances.  That has to be critical.  This will put an extra burden on that section within Tusla and it is important that extra resources are made available with that extra burden.</p><p> I never realised the issue with step-parents, which Mr. Redmond highlighted.  The first time it came to my attention was a few years ago, when a constituent came to me.  She had a child in a previous relationship, got married later in life and her new husband wanted to adopt her first child.  I was amazed at the process she had to go through.  It is alarming.  I do not know whether it can be addressed in this legislation, but if it cannot, I imagine it could certainly be addressed in the adoption legislation that has come about as a consequence of the children's rights referendum.  It is a point well made here this morning and it is something we can look into.  I thank the witnesses for their time, for their interest and for their input into this, and I look forward to working with them all and their respective groups in trying to ensure this legislation is the best possible legislation adhering to the constraints the Constitution has placed on us.</p></speech>

Our four children have birth certificates taken from the adopted children's register.  That is fine.  The way things are at the moment, that has to be produced for everything like passports, everything significant.  They also have the short-form birth certificate, which is the same as the short-form birth certificate carried by every other person in the country.  They valued that, because they did not think it was anybody else's business to know whether they were adopted or not in the ordinary scheme of things, going for jobs or whatever.  One still needs the long form for the Garda or things like that.</p></speech>

I am not sure I can say this here, but they involved seriously criminal actions and all of that.  There are sometimes - though not often - grounds for considering compelling reasons a woman's identity should not be revealed.

It was a passive register.  That meant that someone seeking information on their adoption registered on the NACPR and sat there until a matching person registered their interest in finding them.  That would be a key difference, but it might be an issue around data protection, if a person signs up for one type of register and it changes.  However, the vast majority of people who signed up for the NACPR thought it was an active register and we get many complaints from adopted people saying they have been on that register for ten years and not heard a dicky bird.  There would be huge public impetus to move their registrations from the NACPR to this new register.  I agree with various points people have made, saying that we should not necessarily throw the baby out with the bathwater.  If the Adoption Authority has expertise it can bring to the table on this, it should be allowed continue with that.</p> <p>  On the question of compelling reasons, I agree with Senator van Turnhout that distress should not be a sufficient reason, because, as we highlighted in our submission, I could see situations with vulnerable natural mothers, particularly those who may have been incarcerated by family members in mother and baby homes, where those same relatives would encourage them to register that compelling reason and it could be widely abused.  I should also point out to Deputies and Senators that compelling reasons, incredibly, will be used for future adoptions, so those people born next year, upon reaching their 18th birthday, who are adopted, will also be denied access to their identities and birth certificates by virtue of natural parents being able to file compelling reasons.  That is wholly unacceptable and it is not visionary enough for those future cases.</p></speech>

On the point of the register, I can understand that there could well be data protection issues, but the role of the Data Protection Commissioner is to ensure that the law is observed in the access and transfer of data, so if this Bill provides a mechanism for people to transfer the data from the passive register to the active register, it would save on resources and it would give a much quicker solution to what everybody wants to see.</p></speech>

We have raised it several times and I hope this group can do something about it.  Ms Gilmartin mentioned the short-form birth certificate.  That solved the problem of people not wanting to give their personal information to everybody, but they are no longer accepted for most purposes.  We need to find a way of having a certificate that will be acceptable to the State but is not falsifying.</p><p>On step-parent adoption, I agree with the speaker.  For years Treoir has been saying that step-parent adoption is very often inappropriate.  While a woman's husband may want to have a legal relationship with her child, we feel adoption, which severs the child's link with the biological father's family, is completely inappropriate.  We think the Children and Family Relationships Act will be of relevance here.  A man who is married to a woman with a child that is not his child may be able to apply for guardianship.  That will not be changing the child's identity but it will be giving that man legal rights in respecting of raising the child.  People may still be attracted to the adoption route because under the legal relationship of guardianship, that link would sever when the child is 18, whereas adoption is long term.</p><p> We in Treoir favour statutory declarations but we would suggest that both the mother and the adoptee should have to sign them, rather than just the adoptee, as is provided in the legislation.  There are issues of respecting the other person.  I know there are difficulties about it.</p><p> Balancing the rights of adoptees and that very small number of older women is the real challenge.  In years to come I do not think there will be the same challenge at all; it is just for that small group.  It is a pity in a way that all the legislation might almost be dropped because of that.  We have to find a way of dealing with it while bearing in mind that it is for a short time and in the future there will be much more openness.  </p></speech>

It was a passive register and some people could legally object to it being moved over to an active register.  That was the reason, in their interpretation of data protection.</p> <p>  I would like to raise the way in which the IOT judgment has been interpreted by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  When somebody applies for a birth certificate and is refused by the Adoption Authority, he or she then has to appeal to the High Court, which makes a judgment as to whether this birth certificate can be released.  In the IOT case, the two mothers were consulted and, initially at least, refused for whatever reasons but they were contacted by the State, let us put it that way.  The Adoption Authority transferred that interpretation onto the adopted person in a different way.  In other words, where an adopted person does not know they are adopted the authorities will not write to that person to say their mother wishes to have contact with them or wishes to get information about how they are.</p> <p>  We have sat across the table with the chief executive, registrar and head social worker of the Adoption Authority and had them tell us that such and such an adoption was not legal and that therefore they had no responsibility to inform this man that he was adopted.  His mother could sit there in limbo getting older by the day while she was yearning for her child.  We think it is inhumane and a faulty interpretation of the IOT judgment in any case.  </p> <p>  I should state again on the record that all of us on our committee, which includes a man who lost a child to adoption, are in regular contact with our adult children so nothing that we do is out of any kind of grievance.  It is from our experience that we know the best way to proceed with this Bill and with other legal moves.  We know how much faulty and false information and forgery is contained in the files.  Every time we advise a mother to request information from her file she discovers things she never knew.  I am talking about her age or address being changed, or information that was falsely given to her at the time, for example that her child was going to be adopted when the child was not adopted but was put into care - things like this.</p> <p>  Our concern about the Bill is that the adopted person coming forward seeking, for instance, non-identifying information, which is given without any consultation with the mother, will very often encounter information in the file that is not true.  The adopted person's decision to seek contact is then influenced by that information.  For instance, the file might contain a social worker's note saying it was well known that such and such a girl was sleeping with every man in town and that was the reason the child was adopted - I am just giving that as an example.  Social workers very often made harsh judgments.  Many of them would have been religious women and men, priests and nuns in these adoption agencies who made value judgments on the conduct of women.</p> <p>  When we sat on the advisory group to the adoption board, we came across huge reluctance on the part of the social workers represented there about the fact that we wanted to see the information that was in our files, because they knew they would be judged by the standards of today.  What we are looking for is the right to read our files and write a statement to correct any misinformation they may contain, not to remove anything from the file.  The adopted person would then be able to decide whether what we say is true, or what the social worker or adoption agency said is true.</p></speech>

I completely agree as well about the national contact register.  It would be terribly wasteful to just throw that to one side and start all over again.  If a mechanism can be found to move it from its old function as a passive register to a more active register it should be looked into.</p> <p>  I was questioned about the one year lead in.  Since the start of this year I am aware of at least seven survivors who have died in our small, active community.  The longer this goes on the more survivors will die and the more people will end up visiting Glasnevin Cemetery or somewhere like that to meet their mothers.  This cannot happen fast enough as far as I am concerned; it really is a matter of urgency.  Deputy Troy made that point as well.  Whatever resources were going to be put into advertising during the one year lead in should be thrown into a far more intensive campaign of 30 to 60 days.</p> <p>  An awful lot of good could be done if a figure like the Taoiseach, the President or the church would co-operate in, for example, sending a letter out to be read at all masses on a Sunday.  If a public speech was put out there when this Bill is actually passed, by a major public figure from the church or State, it would let everybody know almost overnight that there is something going on.  That would make the papers and the news, as opposed to the commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes for example.  We were promised and assured there would be a lot of advertising to make sure everybody knew that was going on.  So far there seems to have been one or two tiny little ads in Sunday papers - no wonder nobody knows it is actually going on.  We need to be far more proactive on that.  If we are more proactive in promoting what is going on we can reduce that one year lead in to 30 to 60 days and we will be doing a huge favour for a number of people who will still have time to reunite.</p> <p>  One other thing that has been brought up here several times is the issue of adoptees who do not know they are adopted or are illegally adopted.  I firmly believe, as does Theresa Hiney who runs the Adopted Illegally Ireland group, that the State has an absolute duty of care to let adopted people know they are adopted.  If they are the victims of crime - the victims of false paperwork - they should be told, especially in this day and age as medical science advances and medical history becomes more and more important.</p><p>Several months ago, Angelina Jolie, discovering that there was a history of breast cancer in her family, very bravely had a double mastectomy.  She went public about it to inform people about their health, which was an incredibly brave thing to do.  Imagine that she had gone through that and then discovered that she was adopted.  It is a crazy situation.</p><p> I sat in Holles Street Hospital holding my wife's hand when we were going to have our first baby.  There was a midwife sitting there saying, "Can I just get your medical history?"  I vividly remember going through my wife's medical history and I said I was adopted.  That is totally unfair, but it would be even less fair on illegally adopted people to give false medical histories.  That is outrageous.  The State has a duty of care and I insist that it must tell people.</p></speech>

One of the major shortcomings in this Bill is the fact that it uses euphemisms, yet again, such as "wrongful registration", when it is illegal.  The false registration of a birth has been illegal and a crime since the 19th century, yet here we are in the 21st century and we are not prepared to state it like it is.</p></speech>

From having had contact with so many women over the years, we know that they were totally traumatised at the time of the birth.  A lot of things happened that they were not informed about and this was one of them.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Redmond that it needs to be intensive.  We cannot delay this any further because the advertising campaign is envisaged to start after the enactment of the Bill, so we might well already have a couple of years of a delay.</p> <p>  In 2010, we campaigned furiously with the previous Government for the 2010 Adoption Bill to include provisions for every adopted person to know that they are adopted, and for that to be part of their life story from a very early age.  That recommendation was turned down, so today - whether legally or illegally adopted - nobody has a right to know that they are adopted.  When we are putting through other amendments to other Bills we should bear that in mind.</p></speech>

I appeal to legislators to speed up the introduction of the legislation because it will probably be quite some time before this goes though the House and meanwhile people will be passing on.  It will probably be introduced within a year, but during that year there is nothing to stop people with services from linking up.  There is some protection in the year for people who are reluctant but it does not mean that where there is agreement people cannot meet during that period.  There is no requirement to wait for a year.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I welcome Ms Mary Slattery and Mr. Tom Walsh from Know My Own, and Mr. Martin Parfrey.

We in Know My Own in Cork appreciate the opportunity to address the committee on the heads of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2015.  We thank the committee for the invitation to be here and congratulate the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly on bringing this legislation forward.  We also wish to acknowledge all of those in the Minister&rsquo;s office who drafted this Bill because the layman&rsquo;s user-friendly language in a relatively long Bill made our preparation easier.</p> <p>  It is our opinion that &ldquo;compelling reasons&rdquo; must be copper-fastened in legislation.  I listened to presentations made here last week and was shocked to think that the compelling reasons could rest in the hands of a social worker, those will be operating the legislation and a birth mother.  It cannot be like that.  I am a birth mother and have come a long way in my journey, which has not been easy, so I understand secrecy and shame.  I have been there.  The mother&rsquo;s secrecy is not a strong enough compelling reason.  The only compelling reason has to be backed up with medical evidence.  The one that I can see to back it up is risk of suicide.  If the medical evidence is that the mother is at serious risk of suicide, that would be a strong enough compelling reason but it would have to be copper-fastened.  It is important for the adoptees to have the right to information.  While a birth mother may get a huge shock when she receives the letter but she knew in her heart of hearts that she had been pregnant, no woman forgets that.  She might not remember the date but she does not forget being pregnant because she changed physically and knows that she has given birth.  The shock of the letter is fully understandable but the compelling reason has to be copper-fastened as suicidal risk.</p></speech>

Our group is made up of adoptive parents, people who are adopted and people who have put children up for adoption.  Each of us here today represents one of the corners of that triangle.</p><p>At times the members of the group have different views but I am totally at one with Ms Slattery's view that it cannot be left open to interpretation by a person on the ground.  It must be stated very clearly what is acceptable and what unacceptable.  No one has the right to deny to anybody else a knowledge of their identity and I look at the requirements for a compelling reason with a very jaundiced eye.  If this aspect must be operated, however, it must be copperfastened and not left open to interpretation.</p><p> We welcome the proposals in the Bill because, a bit like the position Michael Collins had on the treaty, it is a stepping stone.  For a long time adoption and adopted people were treated as second class citizens and an adopted person started from a minus position, while this was not the case for a non-adopted colleague.  That is not on but we welcome the fact that the Government recognises the difficulties attached to adoption, whether an adoption is legal or illegal.  There are some 44,000 registered adoptions in the country but I have strong suspicion, based on my experience, that there is almost the same number of illegal adoptions, though the number is guesswork.</p><p> Our group will insist that the bureaucracy called for in this Bill is actually supplied in the course of its implementation, not just talked about.  There is talk of moneys being made available but the moneys must be made available and a full and efficient back-up for the bureaucracy must be in place, whether in the form of office workers, social workers or whatever else.  The current situation is ludicrous, though I am not criticising social workers when I say this because they are totally overworked in this arena.  When an adopted person begins an inquiry he or she could have to wait three years even for the first step.  That is nonsense, so funding must be provided and it must be proper funding, not such that something will be made available if something falls off a truck going out of the gate.</p></speech>

One is the consent form mothers must sign under head 13 on page 61 and page 187 of the Bill.  We think the Bill is skewed in favour of the birth parent and we do not think that is right as there should be more balance.  The birth mother can sign the consent form without any evidence of her legal relationship to the adult child.  She may have to produce two current forms of identification but these might be totally different from where she was 40, 35 or 50 years ago.  One legal document is available to the mother and that is the original birth certificate.  We believe that when she puts forward her consent form she should show identification of the legal relationship to the adult child.  Otherwise, it is open to all forms of abuse and there are no checks and balances.  The mother could sign it and she could be any Joe Bloggs.  Not only can the mother do that, so can somebody else on her behalf.  That is unethical and wrong.<br/><br/>In England it is only since 2005 that birth mothers have actually been able to trace their children.  In the UK legislation the birth mother is required to show the legal relationship to the adult adoptee and we think it is important to separate out the question of information from privacy issues.  The current world of the mother, her deep loss, is a separate emotional issue.  We are talking about information.  We need to separate the emotion of the mother from the legal information that links her to her adult child and this, in turn, will allow the adult adoptee to get the birth certificate.  It is their right to do so and hitherto they have been treated as second class citizens.<br/><br/>Under head 13, Nos. 23 and 24 on page 68, the Minister can make regulations.  There is an omission in the Bill in that there is no accountability.  There are no minimum standards in adoption.  We have been plagued with secrecy, deceit and lies.  When I was in my doctor's surgery in 2003 I located a booklet entitled <i>Pregnant and Thinking about Adoption</i>.  On the subject of us birth mothers it says, &quot;While birth mothers continue to remember their child they can move on with their lives in a positive and meaningful way&quot;.  That was a complete lie and I make no bones about it.  It was unethical and wrong of those who compiled this booklet, with State funding, to state that birth mothers could move on with their lives in a positive and meaningful way without acknowledging their loss in any shape or form.  This was only 12 years ago.<br/><br/>Last year the husband of a friend of mine, who is an adoptee in his mid-40s, went about getting his non-identified information through his local agency but was met by a trainee social worker, a student on placement, a 20 year old.  We are looking for accountability and standards.  Minimum standards were brought in for foster care in 2003 which are now regulated by HIQA and we see no reason why minimum standards cannot be brought in by the Minister to regulate, inspect and support the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.</p></speech>

Equally, there is no problem with the last condition.  However, the two in the middle are complete nonsense, in our book, because they suggest that the person signing for the birth certificate will cease his or her effort at tracing at the point at which he or she gets the birth certificate.  Time out of number, we have come across cases in which the first step taken by an adopted person who is trying to trace is to try to find his or her birth certificate.  He or she will continue his or her work on the trace from there.  The second and third conditions quite simply say "thou shalt not".  They require the person to say "I will not go any further than this certificate", "I will not proceed with the threat", or "I will not ask anyone else to proceed with the threat for me".  Those two conditions should be taken out.  If the certificate itself has to be used, that is okay.  We would prefer if it were not there at all.  If a person is asked to sign a certificate to get his or her birth certificate, he or she is given a different status from someone else who does not have to sign at all.</p></speech>

The Council of Irish Adoption Agencies was established in 1961 as a forum for adoption practitioners.  Membership is open to all accredited bodies and Tusla adoption services.  Each agency is represented at the council by practitioners whose work is guided by internationally recognised principles of best practice.  The council aims to encourage through research the provision of relevant adoption information and continuous professional development workshops so that all of its members operate to the highest professional standards.  In 2009, the council published An Ethical Framework for Adoption in Ireland.  In 2012, it published a series of leaflets for adopted people, birth parents and adoptive parents in relation to information and tracing.  Both of these documents are available on our website.</p> <p>  The Council of Irish Adoption Agencies welcomes the proposed Bill, which provides for a comprehensive statutory-based information and tracing service to ensure applications for services can be made by adopted adults, birth parents, birth relatives and people who were informally adopted or whose births were registered incorrectly.  It is welcome that the Bill will allow adults who were adopted internationally and their birth relatives to apply for information and tracing services.  We regard as positive the presumption in favour of sharing information.  We are pleased that this Bill acknowledges the right of adopted adults to have access to their birth certificates and family histories.</p> <p>  I wish to mention a number of areas that are of concern to the Council of Irish Adoption Agencies and make some proposals and suggestions with regard to those areas.  On head 6, which relates to the future role of accredited bodies, I would like to point out that the Adoption Act 2010 provided for a process of accreditation of agencies, other than the Child and Family Agency, to provide adoption services.  Agencies that are providing information and tracing services under section 4(k) of the 2010 Act had to undergo a rigorous process by the adoption authority to determine their suitability to provide such services.  The council recognises the value, skills and long experience of these accredited bodies in providing adoption services.  We are concerned that the heads of the proposed Bill seem to allow for the Child and Family Agency alone to provide information and tracing services.  The Bill is unclear on the role that accredited bodies will have to play in the future, except where it provides that the Child and Family Agency may decide to authorise "persons ... for the purpose of carrying out an adoption information and tracing service on behalf of the Agency".  We propose that the term "persons" should be replaced with the term "accredited bodies under the Adoption Act 2010".  We believe the role of such bodies should be referenced throughout the Bill.</p> <p>  On head 12, which relates to appropriate funding for services, like other speakers we appreciate that the proposed adoption Bill addresses the issue of funding for services but we are concerned that there has not been an adequate review of what is needed in terms of service provision so that the Bill&rsquo;s aspirations can be realised.  While it is recognised that adopted adults and birth parents need information and access to their family histories, the process of seeking and being involved in this search involves much more that just that.  The Council of Irish Adoption Agencies recognises that the process can be a complex one.  In addition to accessing existing information, updated information is required.  There may need to be a mediation process between all the parties before a reunion takes place.  The council recognises that all the individuals involved, often including wider extended families, may need adequate counselling, advice and support.  At present, adopted people and birth parents have to wait on long waiting lists to access such services.  We are aware that in some agencies, there is a three-year wait to see a social worker.  We consider this unacceptable, particularly in the context of aging birth parents and equity of access to services for all parties to an adoption.  Therefore, there are significant funding requirements under the proposed legislation.</p> <p>  We are not comfortable with the statutory declaration measures provided for in head 13.  We recommend a similar approach to that taken in other jurisdictions, where the applicant is required to participate in a session with a qualified social worker or counsellor to discuss and explore issues of privacy and respect before the birth certificate is released.  We also have concerns about equity with regard to how the Bill proposes that these services should be delivered.  Under head 13, which relates to the information for the adopted person where an adoption order is made prior to the commencement of the Bill, and under head 15, which relates to the information for birth parents in respect of adopted people over 18 years of age, we are concerned that the Bill allows for different practices in relation to the sharing of information between birth parents and the adopted people.  We propose that the Bill should allow for the sharing of non-identifying information to both parties without permission.  Our final concern relates to the appeals system provided for in head 13.  We believe that the period stipulated is extremely short.  We are not sure that many people who really do not want this information to become public information would appeal.  Nevertheless, we feel that the timeframe in which somebody who wishes to appeal can do so is too short and we would look for it to be extended.  We can expand on this further in response to questions.  I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.</p></speech>

I will focus briefly on some of the competing rights issues that have already been discussed this morning in the context of the Constitution.  I will also say a little about international human rights law.  As members are aware from earlier contributions, much of the discussion in this area is informed by the 1998 decision of the Supreme Court in the I O'T <i>v.</i>B case, which addressed the competing rights of adoptees and natural parents.  The court recognised that the adoptee has a constitutional right to identity and that the natural parent has a constitutional right to privacy.  The court stressed that neither of those rights are absolute, as each of them may be qualified to an extent by the other.  Much of the discussion that takes place when constitutional concerns about laws of this type are raised is based on this case and on what I would see as a greatly exaggerated concern about possible constitutional issues.  Much of the discussion is based on focusing on the outcome in the I O'T <i>v.</i>B case rather than on the principles established in that case.  The outcome of that case was a ruling in favour of protecting the mother's privacy.  The court made that ruling in the context of something of a legislative vacuum.  This law is seeking to fill that vacuum.<br/><br/>With regard to the laws enacted by the Oireachtas on issues like adoption identity and tracing, the court said that it is for the Oireachtas and not for the courts to establish how to balance competing rights and how to deal with sensitive matters of social policy.  In the vast majority of cases, the courts will defer to the balance struck by the Oireachtas unless there are extreme consequences of doing so.  That is the key message set down in the decision in the I O'T <i>v. </i>B case.  We have seen that message repeatedly emphasised in subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court.  Some recent examples include a challenge against the law on the age of consent, a challenge against the law criminalising assisted suicide and a case involving the allocation of parentage in surrogacy arrangements.  In all of those cases, the Supreme Court stressed that complex social matters should be addressed by the Oireachtas and not by the courts.  For that reason, I think the key message to take from the I O'T <i>v. </i>B case is that it is up to the Oireachtas to legislate in this area and to reconcile competing rights.</p><p>Any future court would be exceptionally slow to second guess that and to strike down any law that is enacted in this area.  It is important to stress that.  </p><p> Aside from the fact that the constitutional impediments are greatly overstated, there is also a legal imperative to enact laws of this nature.  That legal imperative derives from Ireland's international human rights law obligations, in particular, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and, to a lesser extent, the European Convention on Human Rights, both of which recognise the right to identity as a key right recognised by international human rights law.  There are various degrees and levels to that right but the minimum core is to know one's origins, parentage and conditions of birth; in other words, to have access to a birth certificate as a minimum core.  Ireland's international human rights law obligations require the enactment of this legislation.  As long as the legislation remains unenacted Ireland is vulnerable to findings by international human rights committees, such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, that we are in breach of our international human rights obligations.  Far from there being a rights-based reason to not enact the law, there are rights-based reasons to go ahead and enact this law forthwith.  </p><p> Equally, there is an issue of consistency internally within Irish law.  Identity is strongly protected by the Children and Family Relationships Act in the context of donor-assisted human reproduction.  If it is important in that context it is equally important in the context of adoption and far more people are affected.  If we are to be internally consistent in our laws, this law is necessary to bring the area of adoption in line with the area of assisted human reproduction.</p><p> If the law is to be enacted, it is important that it is done properly.  I mentioned the idea of the minimum core of the right to identity being at the very least a bare minimum of access to a birth certificate.  The notion that the law would potentially qualify that bare minimum create exceptions to that is unfortunate.  If there is legal advice that suggests that it is constitutionally necessary to qualify that I am not sure I would agree with that advice and I would like to see it in more detail.  Ultimately, if one has a right which sets birth certificate as a bare minimum, not files, medical history or contact information, that is a bare minium.  Any suggestion that be denied on the basis of a potential threat to safety, especially in a context where there is extensive civil law and criminal law, in particular, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act which provides other protections in those circumstances, is not necessary.  I do not believe there is any constitutional reason or any justification for qualifying that bare minimum right of simple access to the birth certificate, balancing it, of course, in the context of contact information, that makes more sense.  When it comes to the bare minimum or the birth certificate I do not believe that is necessary.  Rather than defining the idea of compelling reasons, I submit that the preferable course of action for just that level of access to information would be simply to remove the qualification altogether and remove the idea to define that idea of compelling reasons.</p><p> Finally, an issue mentioned at the earlier discussion and which I mentioned in my written submission is the issue of step-parent adoption.  I will not explain all of that in detail again because we are well aware, by now, of what it involves, except to note that a commitment was given during the debate on the Children and Family Relationships Act that the issue would be dealt with in this Bill.  The Bill, as drafted, does not propose to do that.  There is a very simple solution available, based on the English legislation.  A simple short miscellaneous provision, modelled on the English legislation, included in this Bill could resolve that issue.  Last year, of the 112 domestic adoption orders, 74 were step-parent adoptions, so I think this is an issue which needs to be addressed.  It can be addressed very easily and this Bill presents an opportunity to do that.  Conscious of time, I will leave my submission at that.  My written submission goes into more detail on all of those points.  I am happy to take questions later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.878" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergus Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#R00300"><p>First, I thank the committee for inviting me to appear before it.  I broadly welcome the scheme and commend the Minister and his officials on their diligence and skill.  This is a long overdue initiative.  As far back as 1997, 18 years ago, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that plans for legislation in this area were well advanced and were a priority.  I have submitted a more detailed written analysis to the committee which I hope will be of some assistance.  Today, however, I wish to highlight, briefly, a few key points.  In this process it is crucial that we listen to and learn from the experiences of adopted people, natural parents and adoptive parents and that we endeavour to address their needs sensitively and respectfully.  The dignity of all those affected by adoption should be central to any analysis of proposed reforms.<br/><br/>The right to access information on one's identity and origins is, while not absolute, a vital right, recognised by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution.  While the right to privacy is also an important and relevant factor it is not as Dr. Conor O'Mahony has very ably explained, a trump card.  In seeking to vindicate the right to identity, the process that we choose should be as transparent, as clear and as straightforward as possible, for those seeking information.  Admittedly, the scheme is lengthy and complex as are the issues that arise.  This may be unavoidable but if there is scope for making things simpler in this scheme, that should be explored.  Unnecessary complication and bureaucratic hoops should be avoided where possible.  It is worth noting that the Seanad Bill on this point was 20 pages long while this is over 200 pages long.  There may be scope for making this simpler and more straightforward.<br/><br/>I welcome proposals to gather and consolidate information on all past and future adoptions, making the Adoption Authority the central repository for all adoption records.  I commend also the proactive role envisaged for the information and tracing service to be operated by Tusla.  Given that tens of thousands of people may be affected, the distinct risk arises that under-funded services will be overwhelmed, unable to cope and subject to long delays.  As other contributors have already said - I concur in this regard - it is vitally important that both the Adoption Authority and Tusla are properly resourced to carry out their new functions.<br/><br/>While the scheme leans in favour of granting information needed to source a birth certificate there are two significant caveats.  First, that information needed to obtain a birth certificate may be withheld where the agency believes there are compelling to justify denying such information; as others have said, I would welcome some clarity, greater specificity, on what are compelling reasons.  Second, information necessary to obtain a birth certificate is generally made available, subject to the adopted person signing a statutory declaration, promising that he or she will not attempt to make contact with the natural parents.  The underlying concern here is to protect the privacy of natural parents.  This is both constitutionally pertinent and understandable, nonetheless these measures are somewhat blunt and insensitive.  They imply that some adopted people present a danger to others or are likely to force unwanted contact.  On the other hand, birth parents may, understandably, worry about the consequences for their private and family life.  It is submitted that gentler and more sensitive measures may be more appropriate and the recommendation already made that counselling or other supports would address concerns, just as effectively, to ensure that no contract preferences would be respected.  I point the committee to a possible example of a more sensitive approach being taken in the Seanad Adoption (Identity and Information) Bill 2004, in sections 8 and 12 which would require those seeking information to attend a counselling meeting at which concerns around privacy are discussed.  That may be a more sensitive way of dealing with this issue.<br/><br/>In a number of places in the scheme, provision is made for appeals to be taken and questions of law to be referred to the High Court.  There may well be solid reasons for choosing the High Court but I suggest a speedier, cheaper and less formal access to justice may be facilitated by also allowing appeals in the Circuit Court.  That may be worth exploring.  It has been noted already that the timeframe for appeals proposed in the scheme, which is 14 days from notification of the agency's decision, is too short and should be extend.  I agree with that view. <br/><br/>The definition of relative in the scheme does not include the cohabitant of a person which is strange given that the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 gives a status to cohabitants.  Moreover, it appears to exclude the civil partner or cohabitant of a parent of a person and I submit, therefore, that the definition of relative might be expanded to include these persons.<br/><br/>It is welcome also to see provisions addressing the right to information for those who were wrongfully registered as the children of people who are not their natural parents, though I point out that it may ultimately prove difficult in such cases to obtain accurate information.  There are similar concerns in relation to natural fathers in respect of whom records may be unavailable in most cases.</p><p>The natural father will not be named on a birth certificate, making it difficult to get information on him.  Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Mahony has addressed effectively the constitutional issues in this context.  I concur wholeheartedly with his cogent and learned analysis.</p><p> When considering the weight to be attached to privacy, it is important to note that many birth mothers in the past were not guaranteed privacy, so much as sworn to confidentiality.  This does not negate the birth mother&rsquo;s current right to privacy which must be respected.  While that privacy right is one important factor to be balanced with all of the others, it is not a trump card.</p><p> It is also important to ensure the justifiable concern for the privacy of birth mothers is not exploited to keep past wrongdoings under wraps.  Genuine concerns about privacy should not be allowed to be hijacked in the interests of maintaining the shroud of secrecy or keeping a lid on past and, in many cases, illegal adoption practices.  The dignity of survivors demands very strongly that these wrongs be brought to light and confronted honestly and openly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia White" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#S00300"><p>Barnardos welcomes the opportunity to make a presentation to the joint committee on the heads of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  Being Paddy Last, much of what I was going to say has already been said.</p> <p>  Barnardos has provided a post-adoption service since 1977.  Having been in that service for 30 years, I am aware that there has been much debate about the rights to birth certificates, etc.  I am glad that the Bill will address these issues.  Barnardos provides a unique service, in that it was never an adoption agency, offering an independent and confidential service to birth parents, adopted people, adoptive parents and their families.  This has grown from its beginnings as a telephone helpline on adoption to the wide range of services now offered to all involved in adoption.  Through our various services, we have gained great experience and a good overview of the changing Irish adoption situation during the years.  We are proud that we have managed to keep the service going with very limited resources for the past 38 years and are committed to its continuation.  Ours is the only service which has provided a group work service for birth mothers and adopted adults for over 25 years.  We also offer group work and training to adoptive parents and run sessions for birth fathers, as well as individual and group sessions for intercountry adoptive families.</p> <p>  We have offered a mediation service to those matched through the national adoption contact preference register since its inception in 2005.  We have also worked with a large number of information and tracing cases at the request of the Adoption Authority of Ireland where there has been a delay in the transfer of records of closed adoption agencies, which has happened quite a lot recently.  Obviously, ours is a small service and there is only so much we can take on.  We also run a service called Origins for people raised in institutions.  They only have a birth certificate but no other information.  We provide a service for them to contact their birth families to see if they are open to contact.  Obviously, there are no statutory declarations or compelling reasons involved.</p> <p>  We provide that one counselling session which many people have suggested as an alternative to the statutory declaration.  We have been doing this since we started in 1977.  It is worth noting that many Irish birth mothers have been affected by the change of law in the United Kingdom in 1976 giving an unequivocal right to an adopted person to his or her original birth certificate.  As a confidential independent service, ours is a likely place for people affected by these legal changes to contact.  To be fair, we have received very few inquiries where this law has had a negative outcome in the past 38 years.  The issues in these cases have more to do with after the reunion or search where it has not worked out as people expected such as where the birth parents are deceased, a regular occurrence as the population affected gets older.  However, we are aware of the constitutional issues involved in Ireland.</p> <p>  We agree that statutory declaration is not the way to go.  We are concerned about the compelling reasons.  Who would make the decision?  The compelling reasons could deny an adopted person access to his or her birth certificate.  It is a huge step.  As drafted, we do not believe it is going to work.</p> <p>  The Bill could be strengthened if those involved in the process were offered appropriate support and guidance.  The use of preparation groups could be useful in this regard.  In our course for birth mothers we always invite adopted people and adoptive parents along to talk about their experiences.  The role of accredited agencies needs to be clarified and strengthened.  We are concerned that the huge range of expertise gained by voluntary agencies since 1952 be used.  We would like to see the NACPR, national adoption contact preference register, amalgamated.  We would like to see the American-Irish adoptions included, although false registrations have been included.</p> <p>  The best people to tell anybody that he or she has been adopted are their family, not somebody like me, a social worker, or a Government agency.  Perhaps there might be some campaign for those who are aware of illegal adoptions, or otherwise, that they would be supported in some way in telling people.</p> <p>  Barnardos tends to link people on a one to one basis with others in the same boat.  For instance, a woman concerned about telling her family that she placed a child for adoption would be linked with another mother or a group to gain the courage and understand it might not be as bad as she envisages.</p></speech>

We appreciate the work done to the heads of the Bill so far.</p> <p>  I am the founder of Irish First Mothers and I am a first mother.  My first child was born in April 1974 after I had spent four months in the Good Shepherd convent in Dunboyne, County Meath.  I was aged 18 years and nursed my child for seven days.  On the day I was discharged from Holles Street Hospital, however, a nurse took my infant daughter without warning.  I was later forced to sanction her adoption and I did not see my daughter for another 28 years.  We reconnected through the adoption database, as we had both registered with it.  I did not intend to include this in my opening statement, but it is important to recount my experience of connecting with my child through a register.</p> <p>  I previously worked in my community where I raised my subsequent three children.</p><p>In early 2014 I founded Irish First Mothers.  I had been a member of the Adoption Rights Alliance, on and off, for a while and saw a need for a place where mothers could come together to share their experiences and help each other to overcome some of the damage done to them.  In short, Irish First Mothers is a peer-to-peer mutual support group for women who have lost children to adoption.  We have more than 50 verified members, ranging in age from their early 40s through to their mid-70s.  Most of us were incarcerated in so-called mother and baby homes and I am here today to represent the majority view of members.<br/><br/>Public discussion of the proposed heads of the Bill has included reference to so-called privacy rights around access to adoption information, but commentators often confuse privacy in respect of information with privacy in regard to personal contact.  Any citizen is entitled to privacy, but there are already well crafted laws to defend against unwanted intrusion on one's personal privacy.  As such, the proposed sections of the Bill which use the contact veto to limit privacy intrusion are arguably redundant.  Such privacy rights were not what the Supreme Court had in mind in the often quoted IOT <i>v</i>. B judgment.  That case hinged on confidentiality in circumstances where a mother had been given specific guarantees about confidentiality regarding her participation in an adoption.  I am here to advise the committee that we first mothers never sought confidentially, nor were we ever offered it.  Instead, we were threatened against ever attempting to make contact with our children.  My own abiding memory of my incarceration in a mother and baby home was of mothers screaming in anguish following the often forced removal of their babies.  Our rights and welfare were not of paramount concern to those around us.  None of our group was offered confidentiality.  In the IOT <i>v</i>. B case the court relied on the existence of a cohort of women who had been given special confidentiality assurances.  However, such a cohort of women simply do not exist.<br/><br/>The other, broader, confidentiality argument is that the natural mother and other parties had a general right to expect confidentiality in adoption proceedings.  That might be true if Ireland's historical adoption practices had mostly been legal.  However, the bulk of historical adoptions were the result of sustained coercion.  Women were coerced into convents, coerced during pregnancy and birth, kept as mere dependent chattels and finally coerced into signing adoption consent forms which violated their parental rights and interfered with their infants' natural bonds.  These unsound consents constituted a systemic fraud on the adoption process and rendered Ireland's historical adoption procedures substantially illegal and a violation of constitutional and international human rights.  The relevant birth and adoption information records are not normal confidential records; they are evidence of the illegal acts to which we and our infants were subjected.<br/><br/>First mothers and injured adopted persons will likely never see prosecutions for these illegal adoptions.  The very minimum we should offer all potential victims of this illegal process is prompt and unhindered access to the evidence, namely, the records of the crimes against their national identity.  All parties to illegal historical adoptions - the child, the natural parents and the adoptive parents - have rights to available information on these adoptions.  All the mothers in our group who expressed an opinion are opposed to vetos or excessive delays in adult adopted persons accessing their birth information.  We estimate that some 98% of first mothers are open to reconnecting with their adopted children at some level, bearing in mind that access to information does not mean automatic contact.<br/><br/>The committee might find it useful to consider the recent experience of the state of Victoria in Australia which earlier this year passed the Adoption Amendment Bill 2015, which removes the reference to &quot;contact preferences&quot; from existing adoption laws.  This removal does not affect a person's option to register his or her contact wishes on Victoria's adoption information register.  In reference to the new law, the Victoria MP, Sam Hibbins, wrote:</p><blockquote>[Contact statements] set up yet another barrier to contact between natural parents and adopted children being re-established.  It is not appropriate when we are dealing with two adults who want to regulate contact with each other ... We should revert to the framework we had in place for 29 years where Victorian adults regulated contact between each other.</blockquote><p>For 29 years in Victoria, adult adopted people, their natural parents and adopted parents had been able to access information once the adopted person reached the age of 18 years.<br/><br/>I was shunned, labelled and incarcerated because I was a so-called single mother.  Nobody cared about the impact this would have, how labels, stigma and the treatment I received would affect my entire life.  As natural first mothers, it was not as a result of our inability to parent a child with love that our children were taken from us.  While it is true that adoptive parents can provide a loving home, so also can a single parent.  I went on to have three more children, the youngest of whom, sadly, died in a road accident aged 16 years.  My surviving marital children are upstanding members of society.  The first mothers I know are caring, sensitive and capable.  They deserve to have their parental rights defended.<br/><br/>I understand copies of our submission have been circulated to members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Parfrey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#T00700"><p>If a measure such as this were imposed on any other sector of society on any ground, be it colour, religion, class or something else, there would be absolute uproar and probably a case would be brought to the European Court of Human Rights.  Why should adoptees be singled out for such treatment?  Moreover, the measure is unnecessary for a number of reasons.  First, adoptees are not stalkers and usually respect the wishes of others as par for the course, without being bound to do so by legislation.</p><p>Let me give two examples.  Recently I heard of a woman who realised when in the queue at her local Woodies that the woman right in front of her was her birth mother, who did not want contact.  Difficult as it had to be for her, she resisted the temptation to tap her on the shoulder and introduce herself.  The other example concerns a woman I knew in Dublin some years ago who located her birth mother in Cork, who did not want contact.  She drove to Cork because, out of curiosity, she wanted to see her mother and where she lived.  She sat in the car, saw her mother and went back to Dublin and never attempted to make contact.  Again, that must have been a very difficult thing to do.  Therefore, we do not need to be handcuffed by legislation.<br/><br/>Also, this legislation only proposes access to birth certificates.  It does not propose to identify the whereabouts of the birth mother.  Therefore, I do not believe it clashes with the IOT <i>v. </i>B case in any way, because it does not identify the whereabouts of the mother.  The last comment I would like to say on this is that we get a significant number of situations in which a birth mother will at first, because she is in shock, refuse contact.  However, given time to absorb what is happening, she will often change her mind.  We had a classic case of this in our group in the past year.  After a mother who was vehemently opposed to any form of contact had had time to think about it, she changed her mind.  At the end of one of our meetings a few months ago, Mr. Walsh and I watched the same mother and daughter almost tripping on the stairs.  Because they were so wrapped around each other, they were putting their lives in danger instead of watching where they were going.  Therefore, that statutory declaration is complete nonsense.</p></speech>

Much more funding will be needed to provide the staffing levels required to provide the proper service.  Many of those affected are getting older.  For many of them, time has already run out.  For others, the clock is ticking.  Waiting periods of a number of years are simply not an option.  The general scheme of the Bill gives no indication what level of funding will be provided, but it is essential that they get enough funds to provide a service where a trace can be completed in a matter of months rather than years.  Many do not have time on their side.  I will leave it at that because we are running out of time.</p></speech>

They spoke honestly and movingly in sharing what I can only imagine is possibly the most painful life experience they have gone through.  Today it hit home to me how fortunate we as legislators are to be in a position to bring about legislation that can have a real and meaningful impact on people's lives, and I thank them sincerely for their honesty, integrity and sincerity in sharing their experiences with us.  It certainly will prove beneficial as we look over their contributions to see whether we can improve the general scheme of the Bill to make it fit for purpose and ensure it has the desired effect and is a help to those concerned.</p> <p>  I will not go back over a number of points I made in the previous session because I am conscious many present were in the Visitors Gallery and know what was said.  I am interested in the contributions given by the two legal experts.  I am reminded of the old saying that doctors differ and patients die.  The legal evidence the Department is getting is at variance with what the legal experts stated.  The common theme in all the contributions is the right of privacy, the veto and the signing of the declaration.  That is the big stumbling block.  Both legal experts stated it is our job as legislators to determine the competing rights and deal with this complex social matter, yet the Department, in its contribution a number of weeks ago, told us that the only way it could deal with this retrospectively is to insert this.</p> <p>  I am conscious I have been asked how quickly can we move this on.  Many have spoken about the sensitive nature of the general scheme of the Bill and the lead-in period of 12 months, but that is when it is enacted.  As someone quite correctly stated, this has been ongoing since 1997.  I hold my hand up because the previous Government ignored this.  This has been ongoing for four and a half years since the current Government came to office.  We are only getting to the start of it in the twilight of this term.  We need to determine how we can nail it down and ensure the best outcome can be achieved in a timely manner to give effect to the proposed legislation.  I would welcome the witnesses' opinion on that.</p> <p>  Nobody referred to the lead-in time of 12 months.  It should be much shorter.  Whatever resources would be provided to the publicity campaign could be channelled into a much tighter timeframe and there could be a much more extensive media campaign to ensure people were made aware of this issue.</p> <p>  Funding is crucial.  People are waiting years for the limited information that is currently available.  We cannot stand over that.  The proposed legislation, while welcome, will not be fit for purpose if it is not matched by adequate resources in terms of funding and the necessary personnel to execute this.</p> <p>  On the issues of illegal adoptions and illegal registrations, how would a person know?  I do not suspect I am, but to all intents and purposes I could be illegally adopted and not know.  I would welcome the views of witnesses on how we can tackle that.  Those who were adopted legally, albeit maybe forced, are somewhat lucky in that at least they know they can now find their true identity, but what about the person who does not know whether he or she was illegally adopted?  How can we as legislators help and facilitate that process?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the sincerity of their contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#W00500"><p>Like everybody else, I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  These presentations not only highlight a number of issues raised in the sessions over three weeks but also raise a number of issues which we had not heard previously and which will be important in the final drafting of the Bill.  I am sure all the issues will be considered legally or by the Minister.</p><p> Some of the material was very personal, in particular Kathy's experience which was given here today.  We were very moved by the presentation.  She brought home how difficult it was for people who had experienced mother and baby homes and for those who had no option other than to give their baby up for adoption, some of whom were forced to sign them away or had their babies removed from them without their consent.  It does bring home how difficult and sensitive the whole issue is.  I thank her for that.  I think we would all agree it was very emotional and moving.</p><p> I will not go back over everything that has been raised over the last number of sessions but I just want to bring up a few issues.  I believe that everybody is entitled to know their identity and to know their medical history.  I have no doubt about that.  It is unclear what roles the accredited bodies will play in the future.  If this is not tied down in the legislation there would be a concern that expertise would be lost or some organisations may not be used, even though they would be the experts.</p><p> It has been highlighted that some of the records are not correct and I agree that a person should be able to write a statement in order to correct the information in their own file.  The person in question did not even want the old file deleted.  She just wanted to say that the information is incorrect.  I believe that a person should have the right to correct files if they are wrong.</p><p> Reference was made to the step-parent adoption process.  This is something that needs to be looked at.  During the debate on the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 it was indicated that the step-parent adoption process would be dealt with in the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  It has not been dealt with to date and it needs to be looked at.</p><p> Fees are also a worry to a lot of people and the use of the courts to recover unpaid fees would be of huge concern.  The resourcing of this is also a huge concern for everybody who has appeared before the committee and for the committee itself.  If the work comes down to Tusla - we know that agency is under funded as are all the organisations that it has to fund - then the details of resourcing would need to be tied down, including how much this is going to cost and if the money is going to be available.  It has to be properly resourced.  People cannot be put on the long finger for years because of waiting lists or backlogs.</p><p> The issue of statutory declarations has come up and I will not go through that again.  People have already aired their views on the issue of compelling reasons but it does still need to clarified and tied down.  Reference was made to "compelling reasons" at a briefing session last week and it was thought that some cases might be down to distress.  While some people will say it is a matter of life or death, the distress within the situation does have to be considered and who knows whether the adoptive parent or the adoptee is more distressed.</p><p> It was indicated that social workers might have some decision making role in this process and it was suggested that all social workers are very experienced. That perception was contradicted at this committee today.  I agree that there are trainee social workers and this brings us back to the point that there must be minimum standards, inspections and accountability.  This must be copperfastened and tied down in the legislation.</p></speech>

I thought I knew quite a lot about the matter but it is always good to hear different perspectives and to probe how we feel on the different issues.</p><p>In regard to the legal inputs, it is very welcome to have it on the record of the House and - while it is at variance with the Department's legal people - I think it is in line with what Dr. Geoffrey Shannon also said to us, that it is up to us as the Oireachtas to legislate.  We have to take that role responsibly and ensure we do that.</p><p>Perhaps further consideration can also be given to the issue of the timescale for appeals.  I also note the comments about step-parent adoption which has come up previously.  When the Houses legislated for the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 it was said that this Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill would look after step-parent adoptions.  We do need to ensure that it is raised up.</p><p>I will now turn to the matter of statutory declaration.  When the Bill was announced, if I am honest I can say that I only half understood why it was included.  However, these hearings are convincing me.  As Ms Pemberton has said, a statutory declaration introduces a legal dimension into what is a very individual and personal matter.  When drawing up the heads of the Bill with Senator Power and Dr. Fergus Ryan, we included the provision for a meeting or a counselling session.  I understand that not everyone was happy with that as a device but I believe it to be a much more appropriate mechanism in that there is some point in time when one can connect.  I agree with others that this does not necessarily have to be done by the agency.  We have accredited bodies and they could be a good starting point for us.  We have the expertise of many organisations but in particular we have seen the work of Barnardos today and some of the material it has sent to us.  The information that Barnardos provides could be very useful if we are looking at that issue.</p><p>In regard to the matter of compelling reasons, which is one we keep coming around to and we are still none the wiser, I agree with Dr. O'Mahony's observation that we could be starting to chip away at rights.  The Barnardos submission contains a proposal that perhaps it could be up to the Adoption Authority, or perhaps more appropriately the courts, to determine if there is a compelling reason.  That might be a safeguard and I would welcome advice from our legal people on whether that could be included.  We are told we must include the reference to &quot;compelling reasons&quot; for constitutional balance, so how do we ring-fence it so that compelling reasons becomes a high bar? The bar should be an actual case that demonstrates compelling reasons so that we can say &quot;Yes, that is what we should be doing&quot;.</p><p>On the question of the right to identity, it has been very valuable for this committee today to have had people like Martin, Mary and Cathy appear before us and who were able to give us their personal testimonies.  When the Child and Family Agency Bill was presented in the Seanad I took a quote from the author of <i>Roots</i>.  Alex Haley says: &ldquo;In all of us there is a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage - to know who we are and where we have come from.  Without this enriching knowledge, there is a hollow yearning .. and the most disquieting loneliness&quot;.  Equally, we have a past that we have begun to address and that we have to show.  However, the difficulty all too often is that we have cloaked adoption in secrecy and it has made society complicit in suppressing women and children and their respective rights.  Part of what we are trying to do today and in the Bill is to try to unpack that and shine a light.  We know that sunshine is the best disinfectant.</p><p>These hearings have been most valuable.  The committee will put together a report of recommendations.  Having spoken with officials I know there is much work involved from what we are dealing with now - the heads of the Bill - to what is going to be.  They need to do that work and we want them to take on the recommendations of the committee but that will take time.</p></speech>

These presentations were not prepared in a short period.  I thank each one of them for their efforts in setting out in writing the issues they see in the draft legislation.  I wish to touch on one or two issues.  The first is the issue of 14 days being an inadequate time in which to bring an appeal.  What do the people who raised that issue feel is an appropriate length of time?  I agree that 14 days is a very short period.  It would be helpful to get some indication of their views on the time to be allowed for appeals.</p> <p>  The second issue is how far on we have moved.  This is a huge step to take.  People have referred to the fact that this issue was being discussed in 1997 but has moved on very little since.  What is happening now is welcome but it is important that it is carried through fully and that the legislation is passed.  On what went on previously, I came across people as recently as four years ago who had been put into foster care.  They had not been adopted.  One of them was 71 and the other 79 years of age before they met again.  The unfortunate thing about it was that I knew both of them for more than 30 years.  I knew them but they did not know each other.  I think the reason they never met was that one was very involved in Fianna F&aacute;il and the other in Fine Gael.  That story is true.  They met because one of their daughters carried out research on her mother's background and found her sister who is now aged 79.  This case involved foster care and not adoption.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on the issue of illegal adoptions and incorrect information being provided in hospitals.  I have raised the issue previously.  We still have a scenario in some hospitals - not all - where proof of identity is not required.  That was the major issue with illegal adoptions.  Incorrect information was provided in the hospitals where the delivery took place.  Records were filled in with incorrect information.  A question now arises.  There must be people who knew the information on the child they delivered is incorrect.  There must be people who want to move forward and find out where their son or daughter is.  We need to provide them with information.  Some of the delegates may wish to comment on that issue.</p> <p>  I agree that for every legal adoption there were many illegal adoptions.  As I said to some members of the panel during the break, I know of some of these which occurred as recently as the early 1990s.  This illegal activity was going on not that long ago.  It is important to try to address the issue and give every possible level of support to the natural parents and those who were adopted.  It is important we get this right and that we achieve the right balance.  The delegates' contributions are helping us to come to a decision on the issue.</p> <p>  I have a very broad question on whether we are doing enough at this stage.  Do people feel a lot more could be done to try to help people at this stage?  People have raised the issue of funding.  Should we be doing a lot more than we are and how do we properly structure it in order that adequate funding is given to assist these people?  That is the final issue I wished to raise.  I thank the delegates again for the very detailed contributions they made.</p></speech>

The lead-in time and its benefits are linked into the media campaign.  It appears Tusla will be operating it  but I am concerned that it is only talking about a media campaign.  It should hold public meetings as well.  It should also link in with the Department of Social Protection and agencies such as the ICA, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Legion of Mary and other agencies that will open up contact possibilities.  If we do that and strengthen the campaign, we will educate people on adoption and allow the conversation to continue at a wider level.  We will then have the benefit of a lead-in time.  If there is just a media campaign in newspapers and little else, it will not be adequate.</p></speech>

Many people make contact through social media.  I would set up a Facebook page and link it in with the social welfare and community welfare offices, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the ICA and other organisations.</p> <p>  On illegal adoptions and illegal registrations, there is no doubt in mind that some of the accredited agencies and the mother and baby homes have files which contain illegal adoption information.  I am not a legal expert but my understanding of the Bill is that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will have within its remit the ability to chase this up and obtain warrants.  This has to happen.  None of this information will be provided voluntarily.  If people think the information will be handed over voluntarily, they are being very naive.  It is not going to happen.  It will only happen if the adoption authority uses the powers within its remit and provided for in the legislation in terms of search warrants.  Not alone is the information in mother and baby homes, it is in people's attics.  Those are the attics of people who worked in agencies, GPs offices and anyone else who facilitated illegal adoptions.  They know who they are themselves.  They have to be followed up and search warrants obtained.</p></speech>

Right now, the general drift of this Bill is good.  A lot more should be in it but we will begin small.  We need to establish a force of people on the ground who will deal with the provisions of the Bill efficiently, effectively and quickly.  I use the word "quickly".  Senator Burke queried what is adequate time.  The phrase "undue delay" is used in the Bill.  That phrase is abhorrent to me.  By putting it in the legislation, the Legislature is accepting there will be a delay and that it is somehow excusable.  To me a reasonable time between starting, finding and producing a result from start to finish is six months at most.  We are in an IT age.  A person can push a button on a computer and whatever information is sought will be brought up on a screen there and then.</p><p>That is an aside.</p><p> The member asked how best to make this work.  I am not being facetious but in a different arena it was suggested to me that in order to make a thing work, I should kiss.  My reaction was, "What?"  The answer I was given was, "Keep it simple, stupid".  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

My observations on expertise are that within the agencies there is a history of expertise and knowledge on adoption.  I accept that within different teams and agencies there are different levels of experience among the social workers, but the agency holds quite significant expertise and that must be recognised.  We are more than happy to work with that.</p> <p>  I thank people for recognising the role of accredited bodies which, as we have noted, appears to have been airbrushed out a little or is not recognised strongly enough.  It would be great if there could be a means of ensuring we are included in that.</p> <p>  I also welcome the comments on funding and the recognition that a massive amount of funding is required.  I share everybody's concerns about how much this will cost and where it will come from.  That must be thoroughly explored.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.908" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#Z00300"><p>Deputy Troy raised the point that some of the legal analysis presented by me and Dr. Ryan is at variance with some of the points made by the Department's legal advisers and asked how we could move forward in that situation.  The analysis I presented to the committee, particularly in the written submission, is publicly available.  I have circulated it widely and am happy to stand over it.  It has been noted that Dr. Ryan and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon take a similar view.  It is regrettable that the advice that comes through Government Departments is not so widely available, because it is difficult therefore to engage with it.  There is a culture of secrecy around legal advice on draft legislation.  That is regrettable as it stifles debate and proper analysis.  I do not expect that the culture will change just because I have said that, but on this issue I would be more than happy to engage with the Department on a less public basis to discuss its analysis and compare it to mine.  In the event the Department has identified something I have missed, I would be happy to hold up my hands and say that.  However, I would be somewhat surprised if that turned out to be the case.</p> <p>  That said, my basic point was not that the right to privacy has no role to play here but that there is a balance to be struck between the two rights, and that the courts want the Oireachtas to deal with that balance and not to have to get involved or step in and legislate instead of the Oireachtas.  The privacy interest of the natural parent grows stronger the more information is provided.  When one starts with the basic level of the birth certificate the privacy interest is less strong than it is when one progresses through to files and contact information.  The Bill acknowledges all of that by providing progressively more protection for the birth parent as more information is requested.  That is appropriate.  However, the Bill tilts too far in the direction of the privacy right of the natural parent by creating a situation where access to the basic level of information of the birth certificate, which does not give rise to any contact information, is subject potentially to exceptions and qualification.  In that sense it is not my argument that privacy does not have a role to play here, but simply that if one is to balance the two, as the Bill seeks to do, that balance leads too far in one direction at present.  However, my key point is that whatever balance is struck, that balance is for the Oireachtas to strike and it is one that the courts are very unlikely to second-guess.</p> <p>  Regarding compelling reasons, there was a question about how to ring-fence that and make it as narrow as possible.  The basic level of access to the birth certificate is at such a minimal level that the compelling reasons argument is not persuasive in that context.  My preference, as I submitted in my earlier presentation, is that it would be better to remove it altogether rather than seek to define it.  Compelling reasons are more relevant when one reaches the point of contact information but, of course, the birth parent is given an absolute veto over contact information anyway.  They do not have to prove compelling reasons; they get to veto for whatever reason.  At the basic level of access to the birth certificate, I am unconvinced that there is any such thing as compelling reasons.  Including the possibility of an exception in that regard might run into difficulty with respect to international human rights law in the future.  If it is to remain there, and I would prefer if it did not, it must be defined as narrowly and precisely as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.909" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergus Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015110500002#Z00400"><p>I will make three points in response.  First, I reiterate the point regarding privacy.  There is something of a tennis match between the Judiciary and the Government on these issues.  It is arguably open to the Oireachtas to determine the appropriate balance to be struck in these cases.  The courts have consistently said, when these issues have arisen, that on sensitive social issues of this nature they will defer to the Oireachtas, and sometimes they defer very heavily.  On the one hand the Government is saying it cannot do this because the courts will block it but, consistently, when the courts are asked they say it is up to the Oireachtas to make the call.<br/><br/>I agree with the point Dr. O'Mahony made.  I believe the right to privacy must be taken into account and given due weight in these circumstances but the precise balance is for the Oireachtas to determine.  To suggest somehow that only one type of balance is permitted and that the courts will strike out every other type of balance that might be achieved is not correct.  In IOT <i>v.</i>B the court said there was a right to identity.  It also said there was a right to privacy.  The key point in the overall tenor of the decision is that neither the right to privacy nor the right to identity is absolute.  The consistent message from the courts is that the precise balance to be struck is a question for the Oireachtas.  They have consistently emphasised that the law-making role is for the Oireachtas, not the courts, and that they will not interfere lightly in that context.  That is important and I have addressed it further in my written presentation.  Dr. O'Mahony has addressed those issues much more effectively as well in his presentation.<br/><br/>Regarding the appropriate timeframe, I and others have raised the 14 day appeal window.  It is very short.  It is also important that the appeal window is not too long, but it should be long enough that somebody is able to access legal advice with a view to deciding whether to go ahead.  I suggest 28 days at a minimum as 14 days is far too short.<br/><br/>Finally, with regard to compelling reasons it is worth noting that the concept of compelling reasons has been used in case law regarding custody, including custody in cases where a child has been placed for adoption but the adoption has not gone through.  The use of compelling reasons by the courts has tended be about something that is quite pressing.  It is only if there are very pressing circumstances, and the courts' interpretation of compelling reasons is something that is very pressing.  The problem with compelling reasons is that what might appear compelling to one person might not appear compelling to somebody else.  It is important not to be over-specific, because by doing that one could rule out a rare but compelling situation that we might not have contemplated, but it is also important to have at least some guidance as to what will and will not be considered compelling.  Otherwise there is a risk that something that might be appropriately dealt with, for example, by a counselling or information session, might be used to block information being passed on, when in fact some other mechanism could be used to deal with it.</p></speech>

Not everybody wishes to go to their local Tusla service.  They might know somebody who works there or they may be one of the many people who work in the health services and they might be concerned about privacy issues.  People must have a choice and that is one reason that the accredited bodes and other bodies apart from Tusla should be able to offer a service.  It might not suit the person to have to go to Tusla.  Basically, what is required are services that appeal to people.</p><p>It may be to join a group to meet other people in the same boat for some peer support.  It may not necessarily be a counselling session.  The word "counselling" is inappropriate, given that it suggests there is a problem.  Adopted people do not have a problem; they have issues that they need to tease out, which is different.  If we could find another word to use such as "preparation" or "consideration", it would be better.  Delay is a major issue.  Social media are passing us all out and in a way have made the Bill almost defunct.  While it is a major issue, there are others around adoption.</p><p> Deputy Robert Troy asked how one would know if one had been adopted and illegally registered, given that one would have a regular birth certificate.  Most people discover this after their adoptive parents - their parents, as they knew them - die.  They may discover it, unfortunately, at a funeral or other family function when somebody drops the bombshell in asking, "Did you ever go looking for your mother?"  The adopted person says, "Sure, I grew up with her," and the other person says, "No, you did not."  There may be many older people who would have known the birth mother or known that the person was adopted.  The adopted person was generally born in a nursing home or at home rather than in a hospital.  During the years we have spoken to approximately 80 people who were falsely registered.  We have much experience in hearing the unfortunate way they heard about it, which very often was too late, given that the people who have would known were no longer around to ask.</p></speech>

There are many mothers in limbo.  Their children could have been exported to America, for example.  </p> <p>  Regarding groups, funding and social media, I am going to push for Irish First Mothers.  Some 70 women have come into and out of the group and it has been a great stepping stone for mothers to go to Barnardos or decide they need counselling.  We engage in one-to-one counselling and make telephone calls between each other.  Stepping stones between groups such as the Adoption Rights Alliance have been very beneficial.</p></speech>

A very effective set of intersecting skills have been built up in the private sector which enables the resolution of these complex detective functions.  If we attempt to formally replicate these <i>ad hoc</i>procedures with the much slower pace of a bureaucratic structure, we may tie ourselves up in impenetrable knots.  We must find a way to bring the totality of the information available before all parties, not just an isolated birth, hospital or adoption agency record, in order that we can begin to tease out the truth of these matters.<br/><br/>Ms McMahon has addressed another aspect of funding which Senator Colm Burke mentioned and which perhaps arises from this discussion, namely, that we must streamline as much as possible in order to keep the funding tolerable for the taxpayer and the results and outcomes achievable in a limited timeframe.  We are forced into streamlining in order to deal with the issues involved.</p></speech>

However, we have heard that there is a problem under the Data Protection Act, given that it would be an active register.  I strongly suggest that, at the very least, people who have registered with the NACPR be contacted to ensure they do not fall between the cracks.  When the NACPR was first introduced, the information was pitiful.  Every household in the country was to receive an application form, but that did not happen.  In a huge number of houses nothing whatsoever was known about the NACPR.  The ones who registered should have the opportunity to register on the new one and this time it is vital to ensure every household will be informed about the new register and that everyone will have the opportunity to register his or her names on it.  The last one was a dismal failure and one of the reasons was that a huge number of people knew nothing about it.</p></speech>

I am normally a full-time attendee of the committee, but, unfortunately, something came up to which I had to attend and I was delayed as a result.  I have, however, read most of the statements received.  </p> <p>  Since the committee started to debate this issue, we have heard from a wide spectrum of people.  What comes to mind constantly is something my mother always used to say, &ldquo;You can only have one mother.&rdquo;  It is not really true; one can have more than one mother.  People who were adopted but did not realise it until years later discovered that they had two mothers: the person who had given birth to them and the person who had reared them.  Sadly, for many people I know, the connection with their birth mothers has been very difficult and, sometimes, non-existent.  Many people who were adopted, for whatever reason, ended up in very loving homes.  However, those whose babies were taken from them, in whatever circumstances, have suffered the greatest loss.  I apologise particularly to the women who have given their personal stories.  Things that happen in this place do not always fit into the agenda.</p></speech>

I understand there are two particular areas of our activity on which the committee wishes to focus.  These are the recent decision to defer the DART underground project and issues associated with Kerry Flyer and school transport provision.  I will deal briefly with each in turn.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions I am accompanied by two directors, Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO, who manages transport investment and also taxi regulation, and Mr. Tim Gaston who manages public transport services and integration measures.</p> <p>  In regard to the decision in relation to the DART underground project, the National Transport Authority carried out a review of the key transport infrastructure projects that were proposed to support the growth of the greater Dublin region.  This included the DART expansion scheme which included DART underground, the Fingal-north Dublin study and a study of the orbital movements around Dublin, all designed to inform the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2016 to 2035, published recently, and which is open for public consultation.  </p> <p>  DART underground is a rail link proposal predominantly underground from the northern line, just north of Connolly station, to Inchicore on the Kildare line and with stations proposed at Docklands, Pearse, St. Stephen's Green, Christchurch, Heuston and Inchicore.  The project received planning consent in 2011 which became operative in March 2014, following judicial review proceedings taken by a number of third parties.  The estimated cost of the currently designed DART underground project is &euro;3 billion and the cost of the currently envisaged DART expansion programme is &euro;4 billion.  The DART expansion programme comprises DART underground, as outlined above; electrification of the northern line to Drogheda; electrification of the Cork line from Heuston to Hazelhatch; the completion of four tracking from Park West to Inchicore; electrification of the Sligo line from Connolly to Maynooth, together with the removal of level crossings and resignalling; and expansion of fleet and depot facilities.</p> <p>  The DART expansion programme will provide a DART service from Drogheda to Hazelhatch via the city centre tunnel and a second segregated DART service operating from Maynooth to Greystones.  The two segretated services will intersect at Pearse station, which will be the main passenger interchange.  The DART expansion programme remains a key project in the delivery of an integrated rail transport network for the Dublin region and continues to feature as a key project in the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The overall DART expansion programme has been assessed as a positive project from an economic perspective and a benefit to cost ratio of 1:1.4.</p><p>While the DART underground project has received planning approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the business case for that project, prepared by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, indicates that its development alone under the current railway order is not economically justified with a 1:0.8 ratio.  The DART expansion programme business case is available on the National Transport Authority website at the link indicated in the written statement.</p><p> Given the very significant cost of the DART expansion programme, and recognising that a lower cost alternative for the tunnel element is possible, the authority recommended that the compulsory acquisition powers of the approved railway order for the DART underground project were not activated, that is, that the notices to treat were not issued; that the DART underground project is redesigned to provide a lower cost technical solution for the project whilst retaining the required rail connectivity; that a new railway order is sought for the revised, lower cost DART underground project, together with any remaining elements of the overall DART expansion programme which have not already been approved under separate approval processes; that the design and planning work of the revised DART underground project is advanced in order to be available for commencement of construction after 2020; and that the non-tunnelled elements of the DART expansion programme be progressed in line with available funding.  Some alternatives that the National Transport Authority will explore in regard to a lower cost solution for DART Underground include to tunnel to Heuston and not Inchicore; to tunnel only between Heuston and Pearse stations and not Docklands; or to tunnel between Heuston Station and Pearse Station with fewer intermediate stations.  The Government&rsquo;s capital investment plan 2016-21 has made provision for advancing the DART expansion programme commencing with the extension of the DART line as far as Balbriggan and the design and planning to progress for expansion of DART services to Maynooth in the west and to Hazelhatch in the south west. </p><p> I will conclude with the Kerry Flyer service and the provision of school transport.  The National Transport Authority has no role in the provision of school transport services funded by the Department of Education and Skills.  Bus &Eacute;ireann procures school transport services under an administrative agreement with that Department.  Therefore, the authority is not in a position to comment on any school transport contract as we are not a party in their procurement.  The authority is responsible for the management of rural transport service provision funded by the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport under the rural transport programme.</p><p> Having taken responsibility for the programme in 2012, the authority devised a new organisational framework for these services in mid-2013, reducing the 35 groups to 17 transport co-ordination units based on local authority boundaries.  All 17 Local Link offices are now up and running very successfully with many operating from local authority offices, which has been of great benefit in integrating service provision with other services of the local authority.  The authority hopes to build on this new structure and, where gaps have been identified, provide new services in 2016.</p><p> Kerry Flyer is one of the operators which provides rural transport services under contract with the National Transport Authority and the Kerry Local Link office, managed by Kerry Community Transport Limited.  Many of these contracts were novated from Kerry Community Transport Limited to the National Transport Authority.  In 2014, Kerry Flyer received &euro;172,899.50 as a contracted operator for the delivery of 26 rural transport services all of which were wheelchair accessible.  The majority of this funding came from the National Transport Authority through the rural transport programme.</p><p> This week we intend starting the re-tendering of all rural transport services provided by private bus operators with the publication on the e-tender website of a call for interested operators to register their interest in future tender competitions for rural transport services.  Currently there are approximately 290 contracts in place which now need to be refreshed.  These will be tendered by the authority over the next 12 months.</p><p> I trust that we can answer any queries from members.</p></speech>

My only concern about the DART underground decision is to do with the decision making process itself.  If we look back to 2010 when there was an initial cost benefit analysis done on DART underground, the business case suggested a  4.23:1 ratio when measured using the traditional cost benefit analysis - considered to be approximately a &euro;13.3. billion return on investment over a 60 year period.  This was using standard criteria for carrying out that benefit to cost ratio.  When one factors in the figures from 2010 of the wider economic benefits of &euro;4.7 billion, it generated a 5.38:1 ratio.  When the Minister came to making a decision it appears that there had been some further work done by the National Transport Authority.  I do not know whether this was done on its own initiative or at the suggestion of the Department or the Minister.</p> <p>  I would like the witness to take the committee through the process of how the authority revisited that cost benefit ratio.  The Minister said it was a 1.5:1 ratio.  Using the 2010 figures, where the sensitivity testing shows a worse case scenario of virtually no growth from 2010 and a 1.99:1 ratio, I am confused as to how the initial data gets transposed later and provides a different outcome.  If we compare the baseline level of expected growth and activity in 2010, a period of economic uncertainty, to any analysis now it would show a much more positive outlook and envisage a potentially much greater benefit to cost.  I would appreciate comment from the representatives on the business case reported in 2010 compared to the situation today.</p></speech>

That business case covered the full DART expansion programme, the DART underground tunnel and all the other ancillary pieces.  The Deputy asked what was the impetus to update the business case.  It was because there was a new capital plan to be developed this year - which had been flagged for a number of years - and it was necessary to revisit, revise and update the 2010 business case to produce the current information in order to inform the new capital plan.</p> <p>  When the authority started work on the updated business case it identified that with the new circumstances, the DART expansion programme would have, as the Deputy has pointed out, of approximately 1.4:1 to 1.5:1.   The Deputy has asked why this was different from the  previous business case.  There are a number of reasons.  One is that the distribution of population and employment projections, or the density of population close to stations, is a bit different now than it would have been seven or eight years ago.  The current business case also had to consider other factors, such as the Phoenix Park tunnel link which is now going to open next year.  That would not have been a consideration in 2009 or 2010 when the original case was made.  That tunnel does not have a huge impact but it does have some impact on the benefits that one can say are truly delivered by DART underground and DART expansion.</p> <p>  The third reason why the current business case is different from the 2010 case is there are things that could be done outside of the DART expansion project such as higher frequencies on DART.  It is hoped to introduce ten minute DART services next year.  They had been assumed to be part of the DART expansion programme a number of years ago but now they will be delivered outside of the programme.  They do no need the DART expansion project in order to be delivered and some of those benefits cannot truly be tied to the project.</p> <p>  I will conclude with the fact that in the intervening period there have been some technical changes in the way cost benefit analyses are conducted.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has provided clear guidance under the public spending code, elements of which are technical such as discount rates, and some of which have changed in a way that would bring down the benefit side of most of these equations.  It is a more thorough process now than previously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.934" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015110500002#F00100"><p>What Mr. Creegan is saying is that the system of establishing the cost-benefit has changed and that is where the figure comes from.  Is that correct?  I have some information before me which I believe I got from the National Transport Authority through the freedom of information process.  It sets out the appraisal sensitivity test.  The base case involves high growth and a 60-year appraisal.  The figure is 4.23.  On a 30-year appraisal the figure is 3.19 and on a no-growth scenario it is 1.99.  The most pessimistic scenario had no growth over a 30-year appraisal.  It included a two-year delay and a 25% cost over-run.  Even the figure for that is 1.36.  The Minister seems to suggest that the re-worked case brings the figure down to 0.8 BCR, benefit-cost ratio - Mr. Creegan has already highlighted it.  In the revised case in 2015 that involves only the DART underground without the DART extension.</p> <p>  I get and understand the notion of the DART extension being a fundamental part of getting to where we will really get activity on the line.  However, I am confused about how the numbers could change so much.  The same changes do not seem to have come on the same BCR or with the same cost-benefit on the metro project.  There does not seem to have been the same step change from 2010 to 2015 with the new analysis.  Perhaps Mr. Creegan could help me to understand that a little better.</p></speech>

There are what are known as wider economic benefits.  These are sometimes disputed in respect of whether they are truly capable of careful quantification.  Therefore, the guidance that exists suggests that we should be cautious about adding on other wider benefits.</p></speech>

It seems to me that one can change the criteria to lend to a given person the outcome he desires, within reason.  If we change certain fundamentals, the numbers will obviously change.  That leads someone like me to believe that if the Minister or the Government take a decision not to proceed with the project and rework the business case - it is effectively the same raw data - then they can get a different outcome.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Cost-benefit appraisal in transport is well-developed and there are rules we all need to follow.  They were not always clearly set down but they are now clearly set down as part of the spending code.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.940" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015110500002#F00700"><p>That has changed from 2010 to 2015.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Some projects would have been following the methodology set out in that code, while others might not have.  There is a codified process in place now.</p> <p>  Factors like discount rates, which represent the cost of money and investment, vary from time to time.  Reviews must be carried out on a regular basis and they can change.  However, the overall methodology has not changed.</p> <p>  What happened in the past was that project sponsors and developers might have taken an overly optimistic view of the wider economic benefits, for example, the non-transport benefits of a project.  Now, we have a codified system in place to control that.</p> <p>  What has happened in this case is that we have updated the business case in accordance with the current rules.  We are getting a benefit-cost ratio of approximately 1.4.  That is different from the figure of 2.4 produced previously.  Among the reasons is the fact that the Phoenix Park tunnel provides some benefits that would have been provided otherwise by DART underground.  That needs to go into the equation.  A ten minute DART service, which would have been in the equation previously, is going to materialise so it should not be counted as one of the benefits of the project.  Some of the more technical things, like the discount rate, have increased from one number to another number over a period.</p> <p>  Let us consider the business case produced by Irish Rail.  We were part of that and we reviewed it.  Irish Rail set out a step-by-step comparison on how the number in the original business case moved to the new number.  The explanations include those I have just set out for Deputy Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.942" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015110500002#F00900"><p>It can undermine public confidence in the way the State does its business.  In 2010, when we were at the height of an economic crisis, projections would have been at an all-time low and the general outlook was uncertain, to say the least.  Yet, we still get a higher turnout on the basis of the investment.  Let us move on to 2015 when things are looking far brighter.  We are understood to be the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  We are now getting back to the same level of pressure on housing and an ever-increasing demand for public transport.  The M50 is rapidly reaching its capacity.  As the deputation will know, sections of the M7 are at breakneck point at certain points of the day.  Yet, there is a change in the methodology and a significant infrastructure project, which would alleviate some of the constraints I have referred to relating to other surface transport options, seems to deliver less value to the State.  It is hard to comprehend that in real terms.</p> <p>  A person can write an algorithm to give an output for whatever he wants.  That is not a problem.  Calculus is fantastic when we decide to use it in a particular way.  However, in real terms it will take more to convince me, and many others who find themselves in gridlock on a daily basis, that this is anything other than a political sidestepping of an important issue.</p> <p>  The establishment of the authority was the right thing to do at the time.  It created an independence from the old adage, practised by all political parties, of having key projects that delivered certain political benefit.  It was a question of separating that and ensuring public transport was delivered on the basis of need rather than political realities.  The same situation relates to water.  This is why, the Government would tell us, Irish Water was established.  It was to take out that prioritisation by politicians.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that it tends to undermine things.  Give the case where a scenario changes, it tends to undermine public confidence in the work that the authority does.  I am not accusing the authority of anything.  I am simply pointing out how I believe the authority needs to do more to convince all of us about how the DART underground and its wider implications are of lesser importance and lesser benefit to the State now than in 2010.</p></speech>

As we have indicated, it is a key project in our draft transport strategy.  It will deliver benefit to the region if it is constructed.  However, many other elements need to be developed to reduce the level of congestion throughout the region.</p> <p>  We agree that it is still a very important.  It is a key project and programme that needs to be delivered over the 20 year horizon of the strategy to reduce congestion and provide for the travel demand that is increasing throughout the region.  We are an independent agency that evaluates these business cases on behalf of the Department.  We are required to evaluate them.  We retain our independence in that regard.</p></speech>

The issue I am keen to raise with the authority relates to the Kerry Flyer and what I see as the displacement of private operators from school transport routes by this publicly-funded organisation.  I thank the authority for making reference to this issue in the opening statement.</p><p>I note that there is an air of "it's not our problem" about the statement, but I certainly feel that it is the NTA's problem.  I know, Ms Graham, that we have discussed this previously.  In my view, what is going on here is completely unacceptable.  We have private entrepreneurs, business people, who are effectively being put out of business by a body that is heavily subsidised by the State.  Our efforts to date, over the last number of months, to try to get answers and hold somebody to account, have been met with a collective "pass the buck" from a range of organisations.  Members of the Oireachtas from County Kerry feel that there has been buy-in from everyone here in terms of saying that what is going on is completely wrong.  </p><p> Is Ms Graham concerned about what is happening here?  Is this how she envisaged from the outset the use of funding that she is giving under the rural transport programme?  Is this how she envisaged it being spent?  </p><p> What level of investigation has Ms Graham engaged in to ascertain where the money that she is delivering has been spent?  Has she investigated precisely what activities are covered by the money she is giving here to this company?  Does she see this as the role she was expecting this company to deliver?  What does she say to the private operators who have been forced out of business or are in fear of being forced out of business because of the actions of a body that her authority is funding?  Could I get answers to those initial questions?  I have further questions, Chairman.</p></speech>

We would be aware of what they are, but the decisions relating to that have nothing to do with the authority.  Therefore, we cannot comment on any outcome relating to that procurement because it is not part of the statutory role that we have.</p> <p>  We do have a responsibility for the rural transport programme.  We took over the management of that programme in 2012.  At that time there would have been a number of contracts in place between Kerry Flyer and Kerry Community Transport Limited in regard to rural transport provision, the provision of public transport services.  They would have been procured by Kerry Community Transport at that time.  Those contracts, as with other contracts throughout the country, were novated in that we became the client for them in order to keep them in place and the services running until we were in a position to re-tender them.  Therefore, I can only respond concerning those particular contracts for rural transport services.  They would have been procured by Kerry Community Transport Limited back in 2009.</p> <p>  We are now going through a process of re-tendering those services.  We commenced that process this week with a pre-qualification procedure.  It is open to all public transport operators to avail of and go through that process.  We cannot comment on the school transport contracts.  I can only respond in regard to the rural transport contracts. </p> <p>  In terms of the checks and balances we would have in place, we have an external audit concerning the rural transport programme.  The audit relates to the funding that is given to the different groups, the 17 RTP groups.  Those auditors would try to ensure that proper public procurement has been used in terms of contracts that are funded through the rural transport programme.  There is a rolling series of audits of all the rural transport groups.  There were originally 35 rural transport groups.  They would have been audited by Pobal which was the agency responsible for the programme in advance.  </p> <p>  At this stage, I do not have to hand the date of the last audit undertaken of Kerry Community Transport Limited but I can certainly make it available to the Deputy.  However, that would have been an ongoing audit of all rural transport groups, initially by Pobal followed up by ourselves, to ensure that the funding associated with rural transport programmes continues.</p></speech>

These concerns that we have and about which Members of the Oireachtas have been in contact with the NTA, go back a number of months.  One of our key concerns is that funding administered by the authority is being used incorrectly or is being used to basically give one party an unfair advantage over private operators.  Does Ms Graham mean to tell me that since then she still has not initiated any efforts to ascertain what is going on here, and to see if the funding is being used precisely and only for what it is supposed to be used for?</p></speech>

At that time, they would have been considered and evaluated by Kerry Community Transport Limited which would have accepted those contracts.  It is not appropriate that the contractor or client would then check each expense associated with or related to a particular contract.  They accept the contract tender price associated with the delivery of those services which then get delivered by the operator.</p> <p>  The audit that we would do is an audit of funding that goes to rural transport groups that manage those services.  We accept that the contracts have been properly tendered and put forward through a public procurement and that those costs are reasonable, related to the operation of those services.</p></speech>

As she knows, these concerns have been flagged for a number of months.  It is not good enough to accept what she is being told.  Ms Graham she needs to show a lead on this and investigate what is happening here.  Ultimately, we are questioning the appropriateness of the NTA's funding.  These concerns have been ongoing for a number of months now.  How often is it that Ms Graham gets so many Oireachtas Members all with the same concerns?  Why is she taking a passive approach to this?  Why is she not being proactive to forensically investigate and ensure that the funding the authority is providing is only being used for a specific purpose and for no other purpose, and is not involved in the displacement of private operators?  That is certainly the concern of myself and others.</p></speech>

They are the providers or operators, including Kerry Flyer which is an operator.  They have all the licences associated with providing public transport services.  In good faith, they tendered for a contract related to rural transport services in 2009 and have been operating the services since 2009 to deliver rural transport services in the Kerry region.  I do not think there has been any question about the services that they have been providing.  They have been very good quality services to the public of County Kerry.</p> <p>  A different procurement has happened related to a different service that has nothing to do with the rural transport services that are provided by Kerry Flyer.  It is not appropriate for us to open up an investigation into funding that we provide related to rural transport services because it is funding that has been delivered to them over a number of years to provide specific rural transport services.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the company.  I am assured the moneys put forward by us for rural transport service provision are used for rural transport provision.  It is a very reasonable cost in terms of what is provided by the particular company but how it allocates the funding within the company is not something that is appropriate for me to discuss.  All I am concerned about is that the services are run for the tendered price put forward and that this is the money paid to the particular body.</p></speech>

We inherited the contracts in 2014 and we are confident the service being delivered is that which is being paid for at present.</p></speech>

The concept of the community rural bus service was to provide a State-funded transport service for unserviced rural areas, with a scheduled timetable if at all possible.  This is a huge diversion which has massive consequences for the bus contractors to whom I referred.  A total of 43% of their commercial business has been taken from them, with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann school contracts.  It is quite obvious the playing field is not level and the contractors are up against State subsidies.  I estimate that between 2014, this year and next year &euro;500,000 in subsidies will be paid over.  The bodies involved include Pobal and the Department of Social Protection through various schemes.  I would like confirmation this State funding is provided for vehicle maintenance costs and for insurance and tax payments.  The Kerry bus contractors are fully taxed and do not have charitable status.</p> <p> The bus contractors would not be here today and would not have had meetings throughout the summer unless they were very concerned about their small businesses, their employees and their families.  They have given a top-class service to Bus &Eacute;ireann down through the years and everybody has been witness to this.  They are upgrading their fleets and doing their utmost to deal with all of the impediments they face at present.  We are here today at this democratic committee to seek fair play, which is what democracy is all about, but we are not practising it.  As Deputy Griffin stated, the National Transport Authority has complete oversight and is the responsible body.  The buck must stop somewhere and as far as we are concerned, it stops with it.</p> <p>  Is the National Transport Authority the body which adjudicates on operating licences?  On what basis has it granted licences for community bus transport?  Are conditions written in from the beginning?  I am not speaking about the most current licences or those from 2006 but those from prior to that.  In 2000 and 2001, when the scheme was started, what was the situation regarding clauses and conditions in the operating licences for companies?  If changes were made, what was the reason?</p> <p>  This is comparable to Dublin Bus, which is also under the jurisdiction of the National Transport Authority.  Will the witnesses compare Dublin Bus services to community bus services?  Is there any connection or are they in tandem?  Is what is given to community bus services different to what is given to Dublin Bus services?</p> <p>  Does the National Transport Authority communicate with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and Pobal on this?  The authority needs to give further clarification to clear the air and provide transparency.  From here on, the authority needs to quickly advance on this and resolve the matter.  Genuine people in the transport business are losing their jobs.  What is happening at present will mean the closure of some of these businesses in the short and medium-term.  These buses also provide a service in villages with regard to licensed premises and public houses but many of these are closing down, which is another loss to the bus service providers.  They are up against it.</p></speech>

We do not have complete oversight of the funding for Kerry Flyer.  We are just one of its funders.  As the Deputy pointed out, Pobal manages funding through a community services programme on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  We provide funding through the rural transport programme, which is related to particular contracts associated with the delivery of rural transport services in Kerry.</p><p>If I understand the Deputy correctly, he is referring to the road passenger transport operating licence, RPTOL, which is administered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and not by us.  That gives an operator the ability to operate as a public transport operator.  An operator providing one of our contracted services is required to have this licence, however.  It is either a RPTOL or a community licence.  That is what is required in order to deliver services for us.</p><p> In terms of trying to compare Dublin Bus and the services provided by Kerry Flyer, Dublin Bus services are provided under a direct award contract to the authority.  That is where there has not been an open public competition but there is a contract in place for delivery of those services.  In the case of Kerry Flyer, it tendered for the services it delivers.  It is slightly different in terms of the contracts that are in place.  That would be the only comparison.  They both receive a subsidy in terms of delivery of the services.  Dublin Bus receives a subsidy to meet the operating costs relating to the delivery of those services while Kerry Flyer also receives the cost of operating the services it has tendered for.</p><p> We have not been in touch with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  If we need to contact the commission, we certainly will.  We do not feel that it is necessary at the moment.  We have a good working relationship with Pobal and can certainly speak to it in relation to its funding.  We only have oversight in relation to our own funding.  While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns about the particular companies that have not been successful in school transport provision, we can only consider the rural transport services under the rural transport programme.  We encourage those operators to partake in the tender competitions we are commencing this week.</p></speech>

Perhaps the European competition authorities also need to be consulted on this on a wider basis.  There is a possibility here that funding from Europe is being utilised within the system and we would like to get to the root of all of this to get a fuller picture.  For the NTA's own sake, it should also consult with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That would be very wise given that this is a very serious matter.  At this stage, all the nails must be hit on the head properly and all the relevant authorities approached which are stakeholders in this.</p></speech>

The witnesses might come back to me on that.</p><p>The second issue will come as no surprise to the Chairman or Mr. Creegan.  I am absolutely disgusted with the National Transport Authority.  We have been at this for the last four years.  The National Transport Authority will say it comes to the Oireachtas, listens and engages with public representatives.  However, it engages on its own terms.  Its terms when it comes to rural transport services are that one can have whatever one wants as long as it is what the NTA gives one.  I have continuously raised an issue here which has fallen on deaf ears and nothing has happened.  In fact, the situation has gotten worse in relation to rural hackneys.  A sop was created in the not-to-distant past in the establishment of the special rural taxi licence, which was an admission by the National Transport Authority and relevant Government Departments that there was a deficiency in relation to rural hackneys.  It was a joke.  If one contacts the local authorities which have a role in this, they do not even know what it is.  There is supposed to be a transport co-ordinator from whom one can seek information.  On the NTA's own website, it suggests that as part of compiling information to show that one can meet the needs, one can contact people like a local priest, shopkeeper or publican.  That would all be very well and good if those people were <i>in situ</i>.  However, we have parishes in County Limerick, unfortunately, which have been amalgamated and there is no priest.  There is often no local shop or pub.</p><p>The National Transport Authority has turned this into a bit of a joke but it is no laughing matter.  The reason I continue to raise this issue is that in recent correspondence, the NTA has tried to con me into believing that if one is from Mitchelstown, County Cork, and being asked to do a knowledge test for County Cork, one should have no difficulty knowing the name of the street in Castletownbere where the post office is.  That street is the same distance from Mitchelstown as O'Connell Street in Dublin.  I am getting a bit withered from this-----</p></speech>

Lo and behold, after a very positive meeting and engagement, it was nailed by the National Transport Authority which circled the wagons to protect the <i>status quo</i>.  I am disgusted with that.  Since 2010, the number of hackneys in rural communities has dropped by 50%.  The number of people failing knowledge tests is of the order of approximately 80%.  I challenge any of the three witnesses or any member here, all of whom are from rural communities, to sit one of these tests.  As I have said to Mr. Creegan before, on one of the tests, one is asked on which street in Doon can one find the Allied Irish Bank.  There is no AIB branch in Doon because it closed.  One is also asked on which street in Abbeyfeale is the Allied Irish Bank.  It is not on any street, it is in the square.  I am getting withered from it.</p></speech>

Is was stated that all rural transport services are being retendered and that there are 290 contracts in place.  In light of some of the comments made by Deputy O'Donovan and the fact the Chairman and others, including myself, have raised in the past the bypassing of certain towns and villages by the national bus company, can the NTA include a criteria, which I do not think it does now, under the new tendering process to provide for co-ordination of timetabling in rural areas?  That would allow people who want to access the national bus service, which they cannot do in their local villages, to do so in the larger towns.  In my part of the country, that would be Longford.  Timetables should be co-ordinated to ensure that those people, many of whom are elderly, could access the national bus routes.  </p> <p>  My last point is a comment and it is not being smart.  I am a great supporter of plain English.  What does "novate" mean?  I would be a grateful for a written reply on my specific questions.</p></speech>

The last thing we or the industry would want is that we use the lesser licence type to displace existing operators.  It is important to us in dealing with local area hackneys that they be targeted at a local area and that that area is not served by a number of taxi or hackney operators.  Many of the applications we have received to date have been to cover a vast area of a county, not a local area.  They cover towns that have multiple operators.  Clearly, in these cases we cannot issue a licence.  However, we would like to issue more local area hackney licences in places that genuinely need this service.</p></speech>

Is it fair that a hackney driver in Mitchelstown who will cover parts of counties Limerick and Tipperary and north east Cork should be expected to know where the post office in Bantry is, given that it is as far away from Mitchelstown as O'Connell Street in Dublin?</p></speech>

He or she does not need to know anything about Kilfinane, Cahir, Skeheenarinky or Kilbehenny which he or she will service.  The NTA is happy that he or she does not have to know the area he or she is servicing, but he or she has to know about an area almost 200 miles away.  If he or she gets a fare to the post office in Bantry, good luck to him or her because it would be the equivalent of winning the lotto if one comes from Mitchelstown.  It sums up the intransigence of the NTA in this regard.  It is no wonder we came up with a B list hackney licence to make up the deficit.  The Minister, the Department and the NTA have failed in this regard.</p></speech>

He raised an issue about rural transport tendering and trying to schedule services in line with other mainstream services.  Before we issue a detailed tender for a particular service, we will take the opportunity to have a look at the services surrounding the rural transport service and try to tweak that service to meet adjoining services, if possible, because it is in our interests to have an integrated transport service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-05a.1001" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015110500002#L01400"><p>I would like to come back to the Kerry Flyer issue and the loss of five operators who had served the school transport system excellently for a number of years.  As the tendering process is about to commence again, it is possible the other seven contractors may lose their contracts also if this is allowed to continue.  The main argument centres on the use of public money by Kerry Flyer.  A sum of &euro;172,899.50 was mentioned in the presentation as a contribution.  My understanding is this is divided into two sections - staffing and support and operational-non-wage funding.  The former includes drivers, driver vehicles, supervisors, passenger assistants and administration, as well as 7.5 FTE posts.</p><p>The operational non-wage funding includes diesel costs and other running costs such as vehicle insurance, maintenance services and motor tax.  Will the witnesses tell me which of those two sections the money it allocated went into?</p></speech>

In this case, it would have been a single price.  It would not have been divided into different aspects.  It would probably have been a daily price for the delivery of a particular rural transport service.  We would not interrogate where that money is going in relation to the group and we would not be expected to do so.  It was an open public tender.  At that time in 2009, a price was put forward in a tender for the delivery of a rural transport service.  We would have accepted the price for that service and we pay the price for it through Kerry Community Transport Limited, which manages the local office in Kerry.  We are required to ensure there has been a public competition relating to the provision of a service and the funding matches the tender price for that service.  That is the extent to which we look at the costs.</p></speech>

I ask that question in the context of the need to examine the unequal playing pitch that is a feature of the tendering process.  For example, bus operators who do not enjoy State funding and do not have the ability to enjoy charitable status are competing in a disadvantaged position.  Kerry Flyer, which has charitable status, divides the State funding that it gets from the NTA into two sections: staffing and support funding and non-wage funding.  Kerry Flyer is at an advantage and the private operators are at a disadvantage.  If this is allowed to continue as it has continued without being checked and scrutinised, it has the potential to put more and more private operators out of business.</p></speech>

All I can say is that there was an open public tender associated with the provision of rural transport services in 2009.  The price that was put forward by a company for the delivery of those services was accepted by Kerry Community Transport Limited at the time.  The services in question are now under contract with the NTA.  Under the similar process we will follow when we are re-tendering those services, we will receive a price.  If it is an acceptable price, we will pay that price for the provision of the services in question.  That is what public procurement is about.</p></speech>

I understand that this guidance could relate to instances in which businesses receive assistance under social policy schemes, such as the community services programme, that may place them at an advantage in competing with existing commercial operators.  It is intended that this guidance will help policymakers and grant-giving bodies to design and implement schemes in a way that minimises the distortion of competition and allows consumers to reap the benefits of active competition.  Has the NTA had any consultation, written or otherwise, with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission?</p></speech>

I will just cover the services side.  The Deputy might know that the Minister has announced an increase in public service obligation payments for 2016.</p><p>That allows us to look at additional services not only in the greater Dublin area but also in rural areas where there are gaps that we know about and which members know about also.  It gives us an ability to start putting back into rural areas the level of service required for them.</p></speech>

There are many parts of rural Ireland that need services, including small towns.  While there is a rural service and I acknowledge that it is a help, there is a need in the different aspects of life in rural Ireland.  We have the rural bus link, which is good.  It has worked well in Sligo and started well in County Leitrim.  However, the NTA needs to look at it.  At one time it was the bingo bus and the bus taking people to collect their pensions.  That is realistically what it was.  In fairness, there has been some new thinking in counties Sligo and Leitrim and it has started in other counties.  However, we must ensure the bus we look at is the bingo bus, the bus to take people to collect their pensions and the bus to bring employed youngsters to town who might not have cars as the price of insurance is getting out of hand.  We need to ensure it is the bus that goes around an area to bring people to the pub in the evening to keep that side viable.  An aspect of rural life has been decimated by different laws and regulations.  While one cannot obviously drink and drive, we have not put in place an alternative solution.  We need to take an holistic view to ensure we provide the services required to help different businesses with welcome extra funding.  Rural isolation has also become a big problem.  Dublin is a fine city and everyone loves it, but there is another part of the country and we would like people to turn their eyes to it to ensure it has services too.</p></speech>

Our eyes and ears around the country are the 17 local link offices.  They assess the need for services and put forward proposals to us for additional services in rural Ireland.  While they have to consider the uses of transport - it is not just the bingo bus or a bus to bring people to collect their pensions - they must also encourage public transport use to access employment, education and other services.  That is the type of environment in which we want to operate.</p></speech>

There may be five or six small communities or small towns in a rural area and everyone is whipped out of them on a Friday and brought to the larger town where there is a Lidl and a Tesco store.  However, it is the small trader in the small town to whom the NTA should help local people to get.  I ask it to keep a focus on the "shop local" idea to revive smaller towns.</p></speech>

Some hospitals provide concentrated services in areas, including cancer services and so on.  Does the NTA liaise in any way to ensure people from County Leitrim can have their appointments in Galway later in the day because its services might be run in that way?  Is there any joined-up thinking?  Does the NTA ever sit down with people to ensure the right hand knows what the left hand is doing?  In most cases and most walks of life, it does not.</p></speech>

In some areas it works very well and the HSE is very open to co-ordinating services with rural transport groups, but in others it has not happened at all.  We want to apply the same standard nationally where we can.  We have a great deal of support nationally from the HSE, but it needs to operate and work on the ground.  We need our local link offices to do that work for us.  Many of them are engaged in it.</p></speech>

I refer to the rural-urban divide.  It has come to my attention in Galway where private bus operators from Tuam, Loughrey and parts of County Mayo operate daily services into Galway which is a university town and has a hospital that the licences or the pick-up points used to be determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but are now determined by the local authorities.  What is happening, if it has been described to me correctly, needs attention quickly.  A lot of pick-up points are not being approved because of safety issues.  What we want to do is keep a link between rural areas and the university and other services in Galway city.  I am sure the position is the same around the country.  It makes no sense that buses are allowed to pick up primary and secondary school pupils along the way but that does not apply to third level students.  I understand a lot of the licences will be up for renewal next year.  This is going to be a massive issue down the track if private bus companies are put out of business.  If a lot of the places I have heard about are not approved as pick-up points on services from Tuam to Galway city, the services will be no more.  The idea is to pick up people along the way.  To add insult to injury, primary and secondary school kids can be picked up and one imagines that the danger is to them.  I would like to hear the NTA's comments on this issue.  It may be a matter that has not hit the national airwaves yet, but it is coming down the track at a fast rate.</p></speech>

I suggest that well in advance of their licences needing to be renewed they engage with local authorities to see if there are issues associated with their stopping places.  If some are identified, both they and the NTA can engage with the relevant local authorities.  I am not saying we will necessarily have a solution, but we will certainly have no problem about engaging.</p></speech>

What is happening is that in a lot of cases there are byroads and at one time the bus pulled in at each one along the way.  Now the local authority states, "You cannot park there.  It is not safe".</p><p>However, that is where they get their business.  It is safety gone mad.  A solution must be found, even if it involves bringing in a digger to make a corner in order that it can pull in.  If one includes these places in one's list of stops, one will be refused.  Saying the local authorities will do it is not going to solve the problem.  What is urgently required is that the delegates and local authorities consult on the different routes and a digger be sent to make an area safe.  They are even being blocked on the hard shoulder, but, as the Chairman said, school buses can pull up outside every house along the route.  That is sound.  Nothing will happen to them because they are different from the ones that are a little older.  It has gone a little mad and the end result will be that private bus operators will be driven out of business.  The Chairman is 100% correct.  I ask the delegates to take the lead on this issue with the local authorities as it must be resolved.  It is not just a problem in Galway.  It started there, but it will surface throughout the country.</p></speech>

Local authorities are also the roads authorities.  We are just the licensing authority associated with the provision of public transport services which are commercial services and we do what we can in that regard.  We cannot give a licence to stop at a particular stopping place unless there is approval.  We can certainly engage as a stakeholder with them, but I do not believe it would be appropriate for us to drive the issue.  However, given that we already have close links with local authorities in dealing with a number of issues-----</p></speech>

They are stating the stops where the buses have picked people up for the past 50 years cannot be used.  Basically, they are stating people can walk.  To be honest, one is nearly obliged to walk from Tuam to Galway in view of the local authorities stating one cannot pull in on a road.  It is fine to say it is not the NTA's responsibility, but somebody had better take the bull by the horns and decide what is to be done because this problem will fester throughout the country.</p></speech>
