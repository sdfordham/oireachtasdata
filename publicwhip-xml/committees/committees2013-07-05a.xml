Before we do I wish to complete some necessary procedures.  With regard to the caution issued to witnesses referring them to section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, I propose that we give each witness a written version of this caution and that I read out the following shortened version.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege.  Witnesses are directed to restrict their evidence to the subject matter of these proceedings and to respect parliamentary practice by not criticising or making charges against any person, persons or entity.  Witnesses are asked to read the document which has been circulated to them concerning privilege.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Members are fully aware of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I will not read this statement out each time.  I also insist that members ask questions.  I will not allow long introductions or policy statements.  There is no need for each member to thank each individual witness for coming before the committee.  Where members do this, they should please be advised that I will immediately intervene to ensure we have appropriate time to discuss specifics.  Each member may speak on each section only once.</p><p>  Given our tight schedule today, we have no choice but to move quickly.  We have no spare time to allow for delays or unnecessary commentary.  We are against the clock.  We are here today to hear evidence from experts and not listen to members.  We want to hear from the witnesses.  Accordingly, the time allotted to each section will be strictly adhered to regardless of who has not put their questions.  If one member takes too long, it will eat into the time of other members.</p><p>  We have received documentation and an opening statement from the witnesses.  We will ask them to give their views rather than read their opening statement.  I call on Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for welcoming us.  I introduce my colleagues, Ms Lorraine Fitzgerald, secretary to the corporate leaders group, and Mr. Joseph Curtin, a consultant who recently worked with the National Economic and Social Council and was the author of its recent December 2012 report on the subject.  I intended to read a statement but if the Chairman does not wish me to do so, I will not.  I will talk about what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>  First and foremost, I would like, on behalf of the corporate leaders group, to thank the Minister and his officials for bringing forward the heads of the Bill to this juncture.  There was some debate and questioning as to the commitment of the Department and Minister to bringing this forward and I commend him on bringing it forward.</p><p>  A few points should be addressed in the Bill to strengthen it.  The heads of the Bill would benefit from there being an overarching vision towards 2050 for the country in terms of climate change.  Other countries have done something similar.  In our statement we referred to Denmark and elsewhere.</p><p>  In our submission we note it has been clearly recognised, and attested to recently in moves by President Obama in the United States with regard to his proposals on fossil fuels, that Ireland, because of its location and geography and climate change, as it is occurring, can benefit disproportionately.  We have a disproportionate amount of renewables.  Renewable energy is no longer a fringe subject but is core, and it is recognised it can play a major role.</p><p>  In bioenergy and a number of other areas, Ireland can disproportionately benefit from a move to a low carbon economy.  We need to set out a national vision which cascades down into all the other sectors and departments.  One of the issues in the Bill is that it seems to be built up from those sectors.  There is a role for a national vision.  Ireland can create huge strategic gain in developing a national vision which will cascade down.</p><p>  Related to that is the development of sectoral and national roadmaps.  In Bord na M&oacute;na we set out a vision which is encapsulated in a statement, a new contract with nature.  It is about sustainable development, which is defined in economic, social and environmental terms.  We have a duty to the communities we serve, our shareholders and the environment.  It is being rolled out in each of the business units within the company.  This would be a better practice and a way of moving forward on this Bill.</p><p>  My final point concerns the role of the expert advisory body.  As published in the heads of the Bill, it is not sufficiently strong.  For instance, the Bill envisages that the body may be consulted in developing roadmaps.  We believe that the expert body should have a much more powerful role.  We fully acknowledge the role of Government and the Houses in terms of setting out legislation and objectives, but the Houses, as they pertain to this Bill, would benefit from much stronger expert advisory group and, as we have laid out in our statement, the rules, goals and responsibilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500002#A00700"><p>If businesses are to invest, they need certainty.  Does the Bill provide sufficient certainty or is more required?  Mr. D'Arcy referred to a vision, with which I agree.  How would he state that vision?  Would it require a target?</p> <p>How would the delegates see such a target being best stated?</p><p> Some of the companies represented today operate in parts of the world where climate change legislation is already in place.  In some cases, the jurisdictions in question have targets in excess of what Ireland has stated.  How have the delegates' companies coped with that legislation?  Has it been helpful or unhelpful in terms of investment and competitiveness?  It would be very useful for us to have an understanding of the experience in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500003#B00200"><p>The Deputy's first question was related to flexibility and certainty.  There is certainly a leadership challenge to be met in a context where so many changes are taking place.  Take energy, for instance, we saw what happened in the past two or three years in the shale revolution in the United States.  There is significant ongoing technological development and we have seen a great deal of emerging information from eminent climatologists and so on.  Our view is that there must be a global setting of targets and a tightening of existing structures, including a follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol and so on.  Recent announcements by President Obama and the Chinese Government have been helpful in this regard.</p><p>  In terms of what Ireland should be doing, the type of vision we are proposing would include setting out a view of where we see ourselves up to 2050.  The NESC report suggested attaining carbon neutral status by 2050 could be a target for us.  If that is to be achieved, we must set out what has to be done by 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 and begin laying out guidelines to that end.  Of course, while all of this is going on, we have the normal cycle of economic life.  We are in a difficult economic period and that must be taken into account.  It is crucial to retain some level of flexibility to accommodate normal economic cycles.  It will inevitably happen that particular goals will not be reached because something else has arisen which the Government of the day must take into account.  There must be a mechanism for retaining a certain flexibility, but, at the same time, we need to have a degree of certainty in terms of where we are going, how policy is being developed and the framework within which targets will be achieved.  There must be a clear plan in terms of how objectives in this regard will cascade into all areas of Irish life, whether it be planning, particularly spatial planning, food and agriculture and so on.  Objectives have already been set in some of these areas up to 2020, but we must plan for how we can build on this in a sustainable manner.  There is a massive opportunity in the energy area, for example, and that is all linked into resources, including water and wind energy.  This could all be encapsulated within a vision up to 2050, which would include a plan for how objectives could be  brought forward and cascaded into all relevant areas.</p><p>  At the same time, I am not a great believer in having specific targets.  As an open economy on the western fringes of Europe, we should be careful about taking unilateral actions and must always give consideration to the global and regional consequences.  Europe, I am pleased to say, is further ahead than most regions in the world in this domain.  There is a real opportunity for Ireland to be a leader within Europe on these issues, simply because of the disproportionate strengths we enjoy in terms of our renewable resources, if they are properly mobilised.</p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Curtin, might comment on the experience of companies such as Vodafone, for example, which operate in other countries in terms of the climate change targets and legislative provisions that pertain there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Curtin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500003#B00300"><p>A number of countries, including some of the leading European countries, have taken on specific climate change targets.  The NESC report highlights some of the options that have been taken internationally, to several of which Mr. D'Arcy made reference.  Several countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, have taken on science-based, legally binding targets, but there are other options.  Sweden, for instance, has adopted the objective of being climate neutral by 2050.  The NESC has indicated that Ireland is in a very favourable position to achieve that type of target because we have a large agriculture sector, climate neutrality being capable of capturing the potential of agriculture as a sink, as well as a source of emissions.  This vision of a climate-neutral Ireland could harness much of the potential inherent in agriculture, including afforestation and so forth.  It is broader vision, one to which Ireland might be very suited because it reflects the particular nature of the country and its particular climate change challenge.</p><p>  In the case of Denmark, to give another example, the extremely ambitious objective of becoming fossil fuel free by 2050 has been adopted.  This is a typical Danish approach and really captures something about that country and its relation to climate change, decarbonisation and ongoing transition.  The trick for Ireland is to discover a unique offering which we can give to the world in terms of the climate change challenge and to encapsulate that offering in some type of vision.  The Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change has a sister organisation in the United Kingdom which is very favourably disposed to the approach in that country of incorporating a legally binding target for 2050.  The UK corporate leaders group has a similar membership to ours, with members from across a broad range of organisations.  It campaigned very vigorously for a legally binding target for 2050 for precisely the reason the Deputy suggested, namely, to be able to offer its member organisations certainty in terms of investment decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500003#B00400"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  The key points they have set out correspond with the provisions of a Bill I introduced earlier this year.  I understand Deputy Catherine Murphy's Bill reflects many of the same themes.  These include an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, a five year roadmap, clear benchmarking of targets, prioritisation of a national roadmap and annual reporting to involve the Taoiseach.  Mr. D'Arcy has indicated that Bord na M&oacute;na is always watching for opportunities to diversify.  Do the delegates believe there is significant willingness, awareness and preparation on the part of corporate Ireland in terms of the changes that will have to be made?  These changes are comparable to what happened in the industrial revolution but must be made in a much shorter timeframe.  Is there a readiness to meet this challenge?</p><p>  The process of change will be very important.  Do the delegates agree that the national plan should be followed by sectoral plans?  From an economic point of view, the reality is that people in boardrooms are mostly looking to boost profits.  Have significant numbers bought into the idea that there is an opportunity for Ireland to lead on this issue and get ahead of the curve?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500004#C00100"><p>I look at the matter from a corporate point of view.  I am currently CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na and I previously spent 19 years in the food industry.  I was abroad for most of the latter period.  In the corporate world, it is markets and our customers that are driving this.  Corporate social responsibility has risen way up the agendas of most international corporate groups.  As part of that, they play to social sustainability.  They do not want people working in sweat shops producing cheap products and services for the western world.  This is the case whether it be technology, food or clothing companies.  Customers are also seeking low carbon footprints.  The consumer is beginning to understand the position in this regard.  Our customers are driving us in a certain way.  For example, our customers for horticulture and energy products are driving our business in a certain direction.  The opportunity for corporate Ireland lies in the future rather than in the past.  The latter is gone.  Future opportunities will increasingly be based on leading-edge technology and service products that are responsibly produced from an environmental point of view.  I refer, for example, to energy products which give rise to lower carbon emissions and low-carbon products in other areas.  Many corporates are moving into what is termed the circular economy.  The latter involves trying to be much more resource efficient.  What we are discussing is but a subset of a wider issue relating to resource management.</p><p>  Profit and customers - particularly those whom we keep satisfied - drive corporate Ireland.  Our customers are motivated by sustainably produced products and services.  There are sectors which are extremely carbon-intensive in their activities and which there is a great deal of investment.  These have to migrate and there must be a transition.  It is not just as if one can throw a switch, a proper transition must be made and it is necessary to bring people and communities along.  However, it is the market which drives companies.</p><p>  On a national plan followed by sectoral plans, corporate Ireland would benefit from a national vision.  There would then be an opportunity for that vision to cascade into various different aspects of policy.  This is a Government vision which should cascade into all areas of policy formulation throughout the country.  It is within that framework that the corporates should operate.  Corporate Ireland would benefit if there was such a national vision in place.  That vision should be developed following consultation with all of the key players throughout the country.</p><p>  The Deputy's final point related to opportunities.  I am of the view that opportunities exist.  Ireland should be at the leading edge because, as a nation, it can reap the greatest benefit.  Germany is far ahead of other European countries in this area and when one considers what is at its disposal in the context of renewables, one can see that it has much fewer resources than Ireland.  However, Germany is still moving in a definitive direction.  There is a real opportunity for Ireland and, thankfully, much of this is beginning to be realised.  It would, however, be greatly embellished by the presence of an overarching vision.</p></speech>

The members of the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group are collectively exploring ways in which they can deal with the challenges which will arise.  Are they the group considering the direction they are going to take from a business perspective?  Obviously low-carbon economies are going to present opportunities for our guests.  Are they considering this matter from the perspective to which I refer or do they approach it in different ways?</p></speech>

In the context of climate change and of responsible businesses in various sectors operating in circumstances where such change is occurring at pace, the members of the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group believe they have a responsibility to try to inform policy-makers about what they believe is the right action to take at such a critical juncture as we contemplate passing a climate Bill into Irish law.  It is in this context and in respect of a number of different sectors that we are saying this would be good for our businesses and that it would be responsible to do.  We are trying to inform the debate.</p></speech>

On behalf of all the members of the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group and the wider business community, I think I can safely say that we all get the concept to the effect that unfettered focus on economic gain at the expense of everything else is not sustainable.</p></speech>

He stated that corporate Ireland would be better placed if there was an overarching national vision on climate change.  The latter is what we are trying to address in the context of the proposed legislation.  Would corporate Ireland benefit from and would jobs be created as a result of that vision being wedded to unilateral national targets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500004#C00700"><p>Ireland has a small open economy and people must understand that it operates in a global context.  Notwithstanding how emotional we might feel about it, we must be careful about taking unilateral actions.  Any actions we take must be in some way aligned to European and international actions.  I am of the view that in certain sectors we can be at the forefront in respect of this matter and, as a result, enjoy disproportionate gains.  We must be careful, however, about taking unilateral actions.  I accept that this may be an extreme example but we could decide to go carbon free tomorrow and to put in place a national law stating that the country must have zero carbon emissions.  This would lead to a large number of business closures throughout the country but would that have any impact in respect of climate change?</p> <p>No, it would not.   It would certainly get us notice but it would have no benefit for the social, economic or environmental fabric of Ireland.  Therefore, we cannot act unilaterally.  The Minister and his officials engaged very actively in Doha, and we need to be represented there.  We can be leaders in those debates and some progress is being made having regard to some comments that were made by international leaders in America, China and so forth.  It is in that context that I mean that we as a small open economy have to be careful about unilateralism.  Mr. Joseph Curtin might wish to add a further comment.</p></speech>

We have a legally binding target for 2020 and if we were to say there should be a 3% annual reduction in that target or try to reformulate it for the domestic sector of the economy in legislation that would be unnecessary and would go beyond our exiting commitments, which are extremely challenging for Ireland.  It is a question of trying to balance that with the need to be ambitious and to set something ambitious in legislation for 2050.  My understanding of the discussions among the corporate leaders is that while there was no definitive conclusion about whether that should be a science-based target or an extremely ambitious formulation of words along the lines of carbon neutrality or a fossil-fuel-free society, those are the gamut of options from which to choose.  There is a NESC paper which evaluates those options within a specific Irish context and it is worth considering.  It goes into considerable detail about which of those options would be most suitable for Ireland and the reasons for that, but now is not the time to go into the details and nuances of that because it is a quite a complex subject.  There is a very strong need for there to be something on the horizon in 2050 and for that to be something towards which we can benchmark progress, but we must avoid duplicating targets for 2020 and muddying our existing legally binding obligations.  I think the leaders would suggest that there is no need for that.</p></speech>

One of the witnesses said that this was important economically, socially and environmentally, and they were the priorities given.  I  presume the next group could give its priorities as being environmental, economic and social.  It is good that we hear all of the views.  I take it the group's priorities in this respect are economic, social and environmental.</p><p>  Do the witnesses consider there is anything missing from the heads of the Bill or that there is a glaring gap in it?  Enough has been said about the targets, although I had intended to ask a question about those.  I note in the paper submitted by Mr. Joseph Curtin that he stated that no comprehensive analysis with regard to targets, similar to that which has been done in other European countries such as Germany and the UK, had been undertaken in Ireland.  One would think there would be a need for comprehensive analysis and that we as a committee would need that.  The EPA has done some initial research on it, but would Mr. Curtin recommend that the committee obtain such analysis before we make any decision?</p><p>  I believe the position regarding tariffs in Europe will change big time because of a court case an Irish man took on his own to bring the European Union to heel.  He did not bring his case to the Irish Government.  Would the witnesses put an emphasis on one tariff over another?  We are an agricultural country and we have talked about that during this entire process.  Anaerobic digestion is the poor relation in tariffs here and perhaps it has to be.  Have the witnesses a view on that?  I intend to put that question all the guests who will appear before the committee today.</p><p>  In terms of the companies the group represents and that have amalgamated with companies in other jurisdictions to plan further afield, have the targets they have introduced to ensure they reach maximum targets harmed or hindered the business in any way?  Have the companies in the group learned anything in this respect that they could transfer to Ireland?.</p><p> One of the witnesses said that the expert advisory group was not strong enough.  In his view, what is needed to strengthen it?</p></speech>

Under head 5,  can they explain the reduction in emissions under the national roadmap, or annual review, every five as against every one years?  I agree with the witness who said that the expert advisory body should be more similar to the Fiscal Advisory Council and I ask him to elaborate on that.  If similar terms of reference were used for the expert advisory council, would he consider that would strengthen the Bill under head 9, section 7?  Does the witness consider that it would be useful to use wording to the effect that the expert advisory body should publish a report under subhead 5 within ten days beginning from that day the Minister receives the report, thereby transposing the terms of reference from the Fiscal Advisory Council to the expert advisory board, and that we should go through the Bill and accordingly change the language used?</p><p>  There are targets set out under head 3.  Would the witnesses recommend that targets for 2050 should be inserted in the legislation?  If they would, will they outline their vision for the Irish economy in 2050?  Ireland will emit 11 million tonnes of carbon in 2050.  Agriculture currently accounts for the emission of 9 million tonnes of carbon.  In terms of the 80% target, that would mean there would be a reduction in carbon emissions down to 11 tonnes, which would mean there would be no carbon emissions from power generation, heating, business and transport if the agricultural sector was allowed to constitute the full 11 million tonnes.  What is the group's vision of the of economic mix we will have in 2050?  If a target for 2050 is set in the legislation, we must have a vision of what that economy will be.</p></speech>

This is an important debate around the climate change Bill and the challenges we face.  I noted with interest Mr. D'Arcy's comments regarding the setting of targets and that we have to be very careful about doing that.  I ask him to expand on that.  In his view, should Ireland set targets in this legislation?  He referred to that, but I would like him to give a simple "Yes" or "No" answer to that question.  I note that some companies in the group operate in other jurisdictions around the globe where climate legislation is in existence and targets have been set.  How are those companies doing?  Is it affecting their business and the cost of doing business?</p><p>  We need to explore further climate change realities versus the current economic realities, because the NGOs clearly tell us we should set targets, but that will affect us economically.  I would appreciate if Mr. D'Arcy would explore and explain that further.  What are the group's constituent companies doing internally in the sector?  Are they individually setting targets internally?  I appreciate that the group has many policies on corporate social responsibility and reducing carbon emissions is one of the areas it is trying to address.  I have mentioned this issue at the committee and it is an important point.  A company in my constituency, GlaxoSmithKline, is trying to reduce its carbon emissions by installing a wind turbine but it is meeting opposition to that project at every level and An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently refused its application for it.</p> <p>I acknowledge that companies are trying to reduce carbon emissions but Government policy and the way we are set up - it is probably a legacy issue because we are not moving quickly enough to assist - is causing problems.  It is all very well to set targets and to expect companies to make reductions when the country does not have its act together in terms of how we assist them policy-wise.  How can we do more to assist?</p></speech>

Deputy Coffey spoke about setting targets and being careful.  He answered the question in the conundrum he posed.  I fully understand that when companies set targets they can be impeded in their achievement of a target by a critical policy in another area that is not aligned to the main initiative.  That is the point I am trying to make about setting targets without an overarching vision that is set at the top, having consulted widely with the various vested interests and deciding where the country is going, and cascading it down into every area of policy in the country - industrial policy, transport policy, spatial policy, water policy, energy policy and planning policy - one will come up against more conflicts.</p><p>  In the absence of a vision for the future, targets are fine but will not achieve very much because one will wind up with more problems.  One must set one&rsquo;s vision first, set out one&rsquo;s stall and cascade it into each Department.  We often hear Ministers say that the role of Government is to set the overall national policy and strategy framework within which companies such as ours can operate.  If the policies are not properly enforced or not properly aligned, then one will wind up with more not less of those situations.  That is what upsets companies such as ours.</p><p>  We should absolutely have incentives.  Reference was made to anaerobic digestion.  One must devise a vision and strategy and cascade it out into each of the policies and then one will incentivise what one wants to make happen.  Of course there are conundrums.  I am sure incentives are currently in place that conflict with policies that are being pursued in other areas.</p><p>  On many occasions I have been in the privileged position of trying to develop a new economy for the midlands, for instance.  The first thing one does is try to have an informed debate, an appreciative inquiry - whatever one wants to call it - with all of the key stakeholders, in particular companies &ndash; small, medium and large, foreign and national &ndash; because that is what pays for everything through taxes, employment and so forth.  We had an informed discussion about the strengths of the midlands, the unique leverageable strengths in a world where we are going to lower carbon and introduce more sustainable practices.  That has given rise to a debate about how we leverage those key strengths in terms of renewable energy in water management and so forth.  That puts a focus then on the approach.</p><p>  That is the type of debate we must have nationally.  We must examine what we are good at, disproportionately, that other nations are not.  What assets do we have that other nations would love to have but do not have?  There is a prime example in an era of extreme global water stress.  Of course we do not have <i>in situ</i> a method to tap into that but at least we have the rain which comes down on top of us.  Thanks be to God we are getting a bit of respite now.  Water is one resource.  Renewable energy is another and there are more.  Our climate and rainfall give us a disproportionate advantage for instance in our food and agriculture business.  That is the reason for our success.  It is not that our tractors go any faster than French tractors.  It is because we have a climate that provides a rich sustenance that we feed our cattle which gives us a thriving beef industry.  That is, relatively speaking, a low carbon industry because we are competing with nations that have to import all their feed.  One must set the vision and the strategy and then one can talk about targets.</p></speech>

The vision is more or less to have a decarbonised economy across transport, energy, residential and commercial sectors and whatever is left would be apportioned to the agricultural sector.  The important thing is that how we calculate agricultural emissions could change and there could be significant opportunities for this country.  For example, grasslands could potentially be used as a sink for emissions, as could afforestation.  The year 2050 is a long way off.  That gives us 40 years to change.  We will not be in the same situation in 2050 in terms of our agricultural emissions as we are now.  For example, nearly half of agricultural emissions are made up through artificial fertilisation &ndash; the use of fossil fuels in fertiliser.  Within a long timeframe there are opportunities in agriculture so I would not assume that the chunk of emissions will always be there in the agricultural sector.  There will be possibilities and technical advances.  There have been technical advances recently as a result of the nitrates directive where, for example, we reduced fertiliser use by half.  Who is to say we cannot continue along that road?</p></speech>

In the interest of more discussion time, as the Chairman has suggested, I propose to summarise the main points of my opening statement rather than reading it.  While the outline heads obviously are at a very early stage, as they stand I have two overriding impressions.  The first relates to the absence of a domestic target from the heads of the Bill and the second relates to the emphasis in the heads of the Bill on policymaking and planning for climate change into the future.  As indicated in my opening statement, I have a number of legal responses in respect of the omission of a domestic target from the Bill.  The question of whether the heads or ultimately the Act include or omit targets, their stringency and whether they match or surpass European Union targets is a political issue and pertains to political decision-making, which I do not propose to address.</p><p>  From a legal perspective, I have the strong view that targets are simply that: targets.  For as long as they are not expressed as obligations or requirements in the heads of the Bill, the Bill itself or ultimately in the Act, they are not matters that leave the Government or the Legislature vulnerable to legal action at every hand's turn from members of the public who claim the targets are not being achieved or are not being achieved quickly enough.</p><p>  As noted in the original written submission, I refer the joint committee to the discussion on this issue before the United Kingdom's parliamentary committee hearings into what became the United Kingdom's Climate Change Act 2008.  At those hearings, the point was made strongly by a weight of legal opinion that it is extremely unlikely a court would take the view that the Government is hidebound or is binding itself legally to have such targets enforced.  Essentially, the point made there and which I endorse - I am not simply taking it directly from the United Kingdom's position but rather have formed this view - is it is not simply a target.  It is a greenhouse gas reduction target that a court would recognise and which entails the Government embarking on a series of policy choices into the decades ahead.</p><p>  This brings up the entire issue of the separation of powers and of distributive justice in respect of how the targets will be met, how sectoral targets, if there are such targets, will be met and where the most stringent cuts will be enforced.  I refer to all those distributive justice type of issues and the position of the courts here in a series of legal cases from O'Reilly <i>v</i>. Limerick Corporation in 1989, the Sinnott case on provision for special education for autistic children and the TD <i>v</i>. the Minister for Education case in respect of improper provision of secure units for young people.  All these cases stress the courts ultimately are extremely reluctant to get into issues of distributive justice and it is a fundamental separation of powers issue that I believe will mean that were a case taken in respect of the enforceability of targets, it would be quickly knocked on the head for those reasons.</p><p>  Moreover, it is not as though the legislation is without a mechanism to stress this point even further.  I again refer to the United Kingdom Act in which, on foot of the parliamentary committee hearings, Parliament ultimately gave a message to the courts as to what was to happen if a target within a particular budgetary period was not met.  To be specific, the Secretary of State would be obliged to come into Parliament, explain the reason it was not met and set out recommendations for meeting it or trying to redress it or to set it off in the next budgetary period.  In other words, the legislation itself tells the courts this is the mechanism and the redress if the target is not being met.  I refer to these matters because of the references in the media over a number of months to concerns within the Attorney General's office about constitutionality and the possibility of the Government leaving itself open to legal action.  In my written statement, I have addressed this point and while I appreciate there are sensitivities in respect of Cabinet confidentiality and so on, I have suggested the joint committee might consider how it might at least get the gist of that concern.  Ultimately, however, I made the point in my detailed written statement that I consider there to be ample scope within the Constitution, by reference to the principles of common good and social justice as well as separation of powers issues, that would leave the Government not needing to be concerned about any constitutional challenge.  The rest of my submission is contained in the written document supplied.</p></speech>

As for the point he raised regarding the Attorney General's advice, I raised that issue at a meeting of this joint committee.  When members were informed they could not have sight of the Attorney General's advice, I asked for precisely that.  When reading Mr. Linehan's submission the other evening, I noted his use of the word "gist" and I had asked that the joint committee at least be given an overview or, if not the precise information, a more broad spelling out of the reason members were not getting that advice.  To be honest with Mr. Linehan, I am at a loss in this regard and I believe the joint committee is being kept in the dark on this issue.</p><p>  My other major concern pertains to a considerable degree of vagueness regarding targets in the heads of the Bill.  On targets, this is an absolutely key issue because unless one decides to go a certain distance on a particular day, the journey will not be completed and one will only get half-way towards the destination.  In particular, in the context of how business is done here, unless matters are set out in black and white, it becomes grey with the result that nothing happens, it does not go anywhere and one find oneself being obliged to try to play catch-up.  In that regard, how important does Mr. Linehan believe it to be to have five year targets as opposed to seven year targets?  How important does he believe it to be to have specific targets for 2050 and not simply broad statements that will keep us in line with whatever Europe is doing?</p><p>  Mr. Linehan also should expand on the legal points.  Anyone present who has served on a county council will have encountered a great phrase being used continually in documents presented by county managers or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, namely, they would "have regard to".  Mr. Linehan also has raised concerns about this issue.  How strongly does he believe one must ensure the Bill is absolutely clear and terms such as "having regard to" should be removed?  My concern is that through such vagueness, we will experience carbon cliffs and that at different times over the next 30 or 40 years, good governments will be trying to play catch-up in the wake of governments that may not have been so good on this issue.  The joint committee's previous discussion was with corporate leaders, who are in favour of having specific targets and who appear to be ahead of the Government in this regard.  However, from a legal point of view, how important does Mr. Linehan consider it to be that vague terms such as "having regard to" would be removed from the Bill?</p></speech>

On the access to the Attorney General's advice, I have not concerned myself, for the reasons I explained, with access to that beyond the general observation that what is taking place here this morning is part of the same process as what led to the Attorney General's advice being sought in this regard in the first place, namely, the legislative process from start to finish.</p> <p>I am not a constitutional law expert or expert on the law on Cabinet confidentiality.  If there are such experts to address the committee, perhaps the point could be raised with them.  With regard to periodic targets or budgets, as distinct from one long-term target, I am examining targets from the legal perspective and determining whether there are legal or constitutional impediments to their featuring in primary legislation.  I take the view that there are not.  Perhaps it is a political issue but I would have believed the old adage, &quot;If you do not know where you are going, you will never get there&quot;, certainly applies.  A budgetary and periodic structure is a useful review mechanism.  It ties into the legal issue in the sense that I have outlined.  The solution to all of this in the United Kingdom is that the Secretary of State explains in the Parliament at the end of a budgetary period why the Government is off track and the proposals to address that.  That is the legislative remedy.</p><p> With regard to vague language, I would hesitate to criticise excessively expressions such as &quot;having regard to&quot;.  The case of McEvoy and Smith <i>v</i>. Meath County Council was a case that drew attention to what the question of &quot;having regard to&quot; means in any legislation.  In that case, the High Court said it does not mean one should follow what one is meant to have regard to but take it into consideration.  Therefore, one must ask whether the term is meaningless.  It is not meaningless because one must assume the decision maker will have regard to the phenomenon in question.  There is a certain amount of trust involved.  Ultimately, under the heads of the Bill, the Minister must have regard to the sectoral plans when carrying out statutory functions and remits.  While it is important that regard be had to a matter, democratic accountability means there must be a decision maker.  One really cannot have someone making a decision for the Minister at every hand's turn.  The Minister is the person with whom the buck stops and the expression &quot;having regard to&quot; tries to achieve that balance.</p><p> The one piece of vague language that I believe is unhelpful in the heads concerns what is called the &quot;transition objective&quot;.  I believe it is a defined term.  The title of head 4 refers to a low carbon future and it expresses a transition objective.  It is described as transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in the period up to and including 2050.  It is stated that to pursue and achieve that objective, the Government is required to provide for the adoption of the national and sectoral plans.  That is really the objective.  It is objectionable language to appear in a primary Act.  The courts would not be happy with that, nor will the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel be happy with that in due course.  It is a question of what it means.  I am trying to confine my remarks to the legal issues as much as possible.  Certainly, in the absence of the target and the acknowledged controversy over whether there should be domestic targets, this is the compromise.  A low carbon, climate resilient economy is referred to rather than a reduction of 75%, 80% or 95%, for example, by 2050.  Lawyers are not used to seeing this type of fudgy language in legislation and it is not helpful.</p></speech>

Many of us feel very frustrated that we are largely doing so blindfolded.  One Attorney General clearly gave one set of advices while another gave the opposite.  We can presume that is the case because the last Government had a climate change Bill that contained targets while the current one does not.  It is quite difficult to square the circle.</p><p>  To what extent has there been successful litigation against other countries that have had targets?  Is Mr. Linehan aware of any court action demonstrating a valid reason not to include targets?</p><p>  On the point on the vagueness of the language and the McEvoy and Smith <i>v</i>. Meath County Council case, changes to the framing of development plans changed behaviour.  Would Mr. Linehan accept that the language in the Bill is not only included to provide legal certainty but also that legal certainty, in turn, changes the approach?  I felt there was a dramatic difference in how people approached the zoning of land when the operative legislative phrase was &quot;be consistent with&quot; rather than &quot;having regard to&quot;.  The legal relationship between sectoral and national roadmaps is vague.  How might the Bill be improved to ensure the sectoral roadmaps are in compliance with the carbon budget specified in the national roadmap?</p></speech>

I refer to the roadmap and finalising policy and legislation.  I am not sure what the reason was at the time for getting the committee involved at this stage.  It is a new experiment.  To some extent, this is unique legislation.  Whatever is contained in it will ultimately be unique.  Passing primary legislation that addresses a global environmental problem and that will have a physical and economic impact in Ireland and make a multi-decade provision for an economic transition that will have an impact on every area of economic life is a unique legislative experiment.  It is probably no bad thing that the committee gets to express its views at a relatively early stage.</p><p>  With regard to climate change litigation, there is an increasing amount of climate change litigation internationally in different jurisdictions.  There is none that I am aware of that focused specifically on a government failing to meet a particular interim or long-term target or which tried to compel it to do more to achieve the target.  There is an enormous range of climate change litigation.  Much of that is emerging because legislatures are not passing domestic climate change legislation.  There are various legal strategies that really take the form of legal cases to try to force governments to pass legislation.  It is in the absence of domestic legislation that a lot of it is happening.</p> <p>In my opening statement, I sought to outline how existence of a target will not give <i>carte blanche</i>to the public or interested parties to go into court at every hand's turn to say that not enough is being done, or to say they cannot have a gas or CCGT plant, or must have a wind farm because of influencing targets.  </p><p> Under existing legislation, planning authorities making a decision on any application must have regard to a range of matters, including Government and ministerial policy.  Since this will be Government and ministerial policy, they will have to have regard to it.  It will operate at that level, so it is appropriate that the planning authorities' role should not be taken away.  They must make their decisions only by reference to a particular target.  After all, it is a multi-decade target.  If it adds to gas emissions, the Minister can say that it can be offset, but the courts will not want to get into that type of distributive stuff.</p><p> I take the point, however, that post-McEvoy and Smith, there was a change whereby planning and development plans had to be consistent with regional planning guidelines.  There has been a move away from language like &quot;Having regard to the legislation...&quot;.  It may be helpful to state &quot;Consistent with the legislation...&quot; instead.  </p><p> The certainty of targets is one issue but there also needs to be some in-built flexibility when one is dealing with a multi-decade period.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Linehan think that the Attorney General should publish all advice on legislation under the consideration of her office?  What ramifications does he think that would have, notwithstanding the fact that he is not a constitutional lawyer?</p><p>  Much has been made of the targets provided for in the previous government's Bill, and their description.  We have been having that debate for quite some time.  It they were not justiciable targets, surely there would be a question-mark over the efficacy and enforceability of that legislation.  What was the point of including non-justiciable targets if they could not be enforced through the courts?  Was this as meaningful as we were led to believe at the time?</p></speech>

Is consideration being given to having an expert group to review the legislation and its implications?</p></speech>

In his paper, Mr. Linehan said the weight of legal opinion before the UK committee was that a target is not legally binding, but is equated with the creation of a legal duty, and that is the position if a Minister uses his or her best objectives to achieve that duty.  Am I correct in interpreting Mr. Linehan's statement in that way - that, in law, targets cannot or will not be legally binding?</p><p>  I think we will have to leave the other question about the Attorney General's advice.  Perhaps we could put it on the agenda for discussion another day to see how we will deal with it.  As regards setting targets, if there is a hindrance to us doing so as a committee then we need to know about it.  If we cannot get the Attorney General's advice, we will need separate legal advice on it.  There is no point in discussing targets without knowing where we stand legally.  We cannot recommend it if it is not legally possible, so we will need advice on that.</p></speech>

The first one concerns head 3 which obliges Ireland to adhere to any future international agreements, including EU 2050 targets.  By introducing a questionable element in the Bill, head 3 has made that argument unnecessary.  It is an unnecessary legal risk.</p><p>  My second question concerns the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Bill and the heads of the current Bill.  As I read it, the Attorney General's advice seems to be similar.  The previous Bill stated that one could not go to court with the targets.  It would be nonsense to bring legislation through under which one could not refer to the courts.  Head 3 covers the element that Mr. Linehan outlined in his submission.  I would like to hear his response to that point. </p></speech>

Given that I am not a constitutional lawyer, I really do not want to get into that territory.  I am not avoiding that issue but there are aspects on which I can hopefully be helpful to the committee and others that I cannot deal with.  The only context in which I mentioned it is that, in respect of some of the constitutional points I put in the written submission, I said I may be speculative here.  I have tried to anticipate what problems the Attorney General's office may have identified and I have responded to them as best I can.</p><p>  As regards the propriety of publishing that opinion, however, there are good reasons that there must be confidentiality.  There may or may not have been precedents in the past for departing from that.  The advice from the Attorney General's office to the Government is one of the first exceptions in the FOI legislation.  Ultimately, if confidentiality is being cited then it is a political issue as to whether the committee can get the gist to help it in its deliberations.  That is as much as I am prepared to say on that.</p><p>  As regards the justiciability question, I gather that the inclusion of targets in the climate change response Bill 2010 was a controversial issue, even between the government parties at that stage.  A reference was put in to say that nothing in the Bill, or the Act, would be justiciable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Linehan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500009#H00900"><p>I take that as covering the targets as well.  In my written submission, I sought to emphasise that.  To some extent, I hesitate to make this point because Attorneys General are always extremely eminent lawyers, which is why they are appointed.  The climate change response Bill may not have been a good example around which to consider the issue of justiciablility, because a lot of other considerations were in play when the language of that Bill was being finalised.</p> <p>Ultimately, the word &quot;non-justiciable&quot; appeared in it.  It is something that would be somewhat eye-opening for lawyers.  One tends not to get an express statement in legislation to the effect that it shall not be justiciable.  That is the Legislature saying to the courts that they cannot go near it, which is highly unusual.  A number of decisions are relevant, including the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case in 1947, Buckley &amp;amp; Others <i>v.</i>Attorney General and Another, where there was a similar attempt to make such a provision.  The Supreme Court said it cannot happen.  More recently, there are decisions, including in the Tormey case, which suggest the same.  It is not necessary to do that in any event in respect of the targets.  It is done much more subtly in the UK legislation, as I have described.  The courts in the UK are told what the redress is where a target is not being met.  If a person comes to court to say the target is not being met, there is a ready-made approach.  It may be a political solution or redress and not very effective to require the Minister to explain to Parliament what will be done where a target is seriously missed.  That is aside from the point I made earlier that, by its nature, a target is a target, especially a greenhouse gas reduction target, the achievement of which reaches into every sector of the economy over a multi-decade period.  The courts will not want to get into making themselves expert as to how the Government is going to get back on track and whether it is off-track in the first place.  It is not necessary to get caught up in the language of justiciability for the reasons I have explained.</p><p> Deputy Barry Cowen asked if a review group would be acceptable.  Some review mechanism is important.  One can have a long-term target, but it requires a mechanism to ensure one adjusts to get back on track.  I am not quite sure how it operates in the UK.  Certainly, there is a power for the Minister to adjust the long-term target and to adjust the reference baseline by reference to developments in climate science and changes in international and EU law.  The Committee on Climate Change, which is the advisory body in the UK, probably has a role in advising the Secretary of State.  I am not sure it is necessary to have a specific review group in respect of adjustment of targets.  Certainly, if one is going to have an advisory body, it should have a role in the question of any adjustments or changes to the target.</p><p> Senator Keane asked if the targets will be legally binding.  It is unique legislation.  Let us assume there is a domestic target in the eventual enactment.  While it is not unique in Irish law to have targets to achieve certain things in the environmental field, the examples of which I can think derive ultimately from EU directives.  An example is the targets on the diversion of waste away from landfill, which are specific quantitative targets set out every couple of years.  They are set out in secondary legislation, transposed from EU directives.  The directive on packaging and packaging waste of some 15 years ago included targets for member states.</p><p> This may be the first time we have had quantitative targets in non-financial legislation.  There is a degree of State planning about this.  There will be people who want the targets to be legally binding and there will be those whose political perspective is that there should be flexibility.  It does not have to be one or the other.  A target has a value even if it is not legally binding.  It has symbolic value.  There are a range of reasons one could cite for wishing to surpass EU or international targets which bind one.  Different countries have their own motivation for imposing domestic targets separate from or above international or regional targets.  It would be unworkable to make the targets legally binding in the sense of allowing someone to go to court on the basis that the Government is straying from them to seek a mandatory order compelling the State to get back on track.  Someone would need to police that.  The courts are extremely reluctant to make mandatory orders against other organs of State and the most they might do is make a declaratory order and leave it up to Government to implement the decision.  If, on balance, the committee would like to see a domestic target included but the Attorney General is concerned people would run into court every other day to try to stop this or that project or to force the Minister to act in a certain way, they should be reassured.  Nevertheless, a target has a value which is more than symbolic.  The Minister would be under a duty to try to achieve the target but such duty would not constitute an all-or-nothing obligation.  It is a duty to use best endeavours.  I would like to think we can assume there will not be cynicism around the target and, once it is in there, Ministers will not turn their backs on it.  There will be a bona fide effort to achieve it.  Perhaps that will go some way towards answering Deputy Kevin Humphreys, part of whose question I may have missed.</p></speech>

The purpose of legislation is to allow the citizen to take legal action if the provisions are not followed.  Mr. Linehan referred to waste management and landfill directives and legislation, which include targets and associated penalties.  Is he juggling balls a little bit?</p></speech>

Those relate to two different legal systems.  The landfill targets are obligated by EU membership.  We have subscribed to that legal regime and if we ignore or fail completely to achieve the targets, we are open to the potential imposition of penalties by the European Court of Justice.  That is the way directives operate in the context of the relationship between the EU and the State.  Climate change legislation is domestic legislation which we are negotiating internally and concerns the relationships between organs of the State.  I do not agree that, of itself, enacted legislation provides the citizen with the right to go to court to ask why it is not being observed.  One has to ask what the duty provided for is.  If a domestic target is created, that does not of itself create an all-or-nothing duty.</p> <p>Certainly, there is no breach of the duty as long as the Minister and the Government are using their best endeavours to try to achieve the target.  For that reason, we have to look at how it is expressed.  I suggest that a target, of itself, does not create the right to have it enforced if it is not reached.  It is a "best endeavours" obligation.</p></speech>

Our industry is committed to a process of continual improvement in sustainability and efficiencies so that increased production is achieved with reduced environmental impact.  This commitment is embedded in the industry&rsquo;s development strategy, Food Harvest 2020, prepared by the industry and the Government, which sets out an ambitious growth target for Ireland&rsquo;s food industry based on the principles of smart green growth.</p><p>  The agrifood industry broadly welcomes the outline heads of the climate action and low-carbon development Bill.  It is our hope that in a collective approach to the development of a low-carbon strategy for growth, Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood industry can become part of the solution to achieving sustainable growth in the world&rsquo;s most carbon-efficient food-producing country.</p><p>  Sustainable agricultural production is about ensuring man&rsquo;s production of food does not result in undesirable consequences but allows for the continual production of food in harmony with nature.  Agricultural systems can, therefore, be managed to ensure the least impact on the environment while producing increasing volumes of sustainable food.</p><p>  While some suggest that the route to a low-carbon economy can best be achieved through the limitation of agricultural production, the reality of a rapidly growing global population means a growing global demand for food.  This food can be produced from sustainable agricultural systems or unsustainable production systems.  In short, carbon cannot be engineered out of cows.  The largest portion of non-ETS emissions from Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood industry is composed of emissions from enteric fermentation, namely cow digestion.  This is a natural process that cannot be engineered out.  Accordingly, animal numbers will continue to be the primary driver of emissions from Irish agriculture.</p><p>  Irish farming is efficient, however.  The greenhouse gas, GHG, efficiency - that is, the unit product per unit GHG emitted - of Irish agriculture is really high, especially compared to the developing world, due to intensive pasture management and the relatively high-yielding animals to be found here.  This undeniable conflict between sustainable agricultural practices and accounting practices poses a very real challenge to policymakers.  However, global and EU institutions are now considering this dilemma as they face the challenge of feeding a growing population from more sustainable food-producing regions.  Accordingly, it is not inconceivable that a differing approach to dealing with global agricultural emissions will be developed as part of the 2030 and 2050 strategies.</p><p>  The proposal for sectoral roadmaps to be developed as part of Ireland&rsquo;s climate action and low-carbon development Bill is, therefore, appropriate and consistent with the global policy developments.  This will allow for the alignment of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy for smart green growth with a national strategy for carbon reduction.  This logical alignment will ensure sustainable agriculture will become the central pillar for Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural growth, underpinned by independent farm sustainability audits that identify where improvements can be achieved.</p></speech>

There are targets outlined in Food Harvest 2020 along with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  Will Mr. Kelly explain how we can strike a balance between increased production in the agrifood industry and reduced environmental impact?  For example, agricultural machinery is powered by fossil fuels and increased production will mean tractors and so on will be used more.  With the rapidly growing global population and the subsequent demand for food, how would the agrifood industry produce it in a sustainable way?</p><p>  Some see the sectoral roadmaps as being aspirational.  Some corporate leaders argue that there must be a collective responsibility to agree these targets.  This may mean more concessions for agriculture as cattle emissions cannot be engineered out.  This would involve trade-offs with other sectors such as transport.  It can be argued that specific national targets would give more certainty to the agrifood industry.  What is Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s view on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500012#L00400"><p>It is worth noting that approximately 80% of emissions in the agrifood sector are pre-factory.  They are happening at farm level and I believe that is where a large amount of the focus will have to be.</p><p>  By virtue of Ireland's having a large agrifood sector in comparison to the rest of the economy and Europe, our non-ETS emissions are much higher than those in other EU member states.  That also highlights the importance of the sector.  However, it must be taken into account in European terms that agricultural production here, particularly meat and dairy, is very environmentally sustainable.</p><p>  At national level, while the overall agrifood strategy, Food Harvest 2020, is expansionary and has targets of a 42% increase in agrifood exports and a 50% increase in milk production, it has smart green growth as its vision.  The "green" part of this is particularly relevant to this committee.</p> <p>I would also argue that "smart" is relevant as well because much of the intellectual property development that will take place in food products, processing systems and production systems is interlinked.  These things are not being looked at in isolation and are highly relevant to the subject matter today.</p><p> In respect of it being a large percentage of non-ETS emissions and the issue of targets versus roadmaps, we would strongly argue that in terms of the accounting practices, this needs to be done at European level, as is the case for the emissions trading scheme, namely, industry.  I mentioned that in my opening statement.  When we are looking at agricultural emissions, we should be looking at them in a European context rather than exclusively in an Irish context.</p><p> If we look at specific targets from an Irish perspective, because of the outlier status of Ireland - for good reasons as it is a very important sector - all we would do is disadvantage Irish agriculture in comparison with competitors who, in our view, have less sustainable farming practices.  This is backed up by the facts about which Ms O'Shea will speak shortly.</p><p> In respect of the roadmap itself, we would argue that sectoral roadmaps are the appropriate approach to take, provided they are dealt with in a rigorous fashion.  Our understanding is that to date, the work done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its agencies on independent environmental analysis of Food Harvest 2020, which has been under way since last year, is appropriate and rigorous.  That is being done in consultation with the Environment Directorate-General, is following the principles laid down for strategic environmental assessments and is examining all the relevant criteria, including greenhouse gas emissions.  Our view would be that the outputs of that process will lead to an appropriate roadmap for the sector in question.</p><p> In respect of the business imperative behind this, we are an exporting country.  We export 80% by volume of our food production.  We are very much a business-to-business operator.  In other words, we are selling an awful lot of our products directly into food service companies, directly into retail as private label and directly to multinational food companies as food ingredients.  Those companies now have very rigorous sustainability criteria.  That is the simple business reality and is what we must deal with at company and national level.  All this additional growth that will come out of the sector will not be sold here in Ireland.  We are a small domestic market.  There are about six million people on the island.  If anything, over the past few years, we have seen a reduction in demand here because of the economic climate we are in.  All the additional food that will be produced here will be sent off the island and we must meet those stringent criteria of our international customers.  Much work has been done at national level by the Department in terms of the environmental analysis but a lot of work has also been done by Teagasc and Bord Bia in terms of Origin Green and the carbon navigator tool.  I will pass over to Ms O'Shea who will explain how that manifests itself at enterprise level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Audrey O'Shea" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500013#M00200"><p>To reiterate what Mr. Kelly said, quite rigorous studies have been carried out on the carbon footprint per unit of product at farm level.  It is coming out at the lowest across Europe with maybe the lowest globally with the exception of New Zealand.  That number is 1 kg of carbon per 1 kg of milk.  When we talk about the litre or kg of milk, we are talking about fat corrected milk produced so that we are talking about the same thing on a global scale.  The only other country in Europe that can match that is Austria.</p><p>  Mr. Kelly already alluded to the carbon navigator tool that has been developed by Teagasc.  This is a tool that will be rolled out to all farmers participating in the scheme to allow them to see the changes they can make on the farm and their effect on their carbon input.  There are five key measures that have been identified that can reduce the carbon number per unit produced on farms.  They include extending the grazing season.  For example, if one extends the grazing season by one more day out in pasture, it will reduce the carbon footprint by 0.17% per kg of milk produced.</p><p>  I will provide an example from industry and other schemes happening elsewhere.  FrieslandCampina has a scheme abroad where it is enticing its farmers to have their cows out on pasture 120 days per year for six hours per day.  It happens naturally in Ireland every year for more than 200 days so we have a significant advantage straight away because of our unique selling point of grass-fed cows.  The second thing that can reduce the carbon footprint is the economic breeding index, EBI.  Many of our farmers are using the EBI in the breeding of their cows.  Again, this can reduce the carbon footprint by 0.2% per kg of milk.</p></speech>

Essentially, we saw how in the past year, there was a very high level of mortality compared with other years because of the shortage of feed.  It shows the kind of issue that could arise if there was a dislocation of climate and if our climate changed substantially between now and 2050.  The science is telling us that this is what is going to happen.  There will be an implication for the number of cattle if that is the only way, and clearly it is, that one can impact on that because one cannot engineer out the emissions.</p><p>  The UN has identified climate change as a major threat to food security.  We all understand, from the point of view of the national economy, that the food industry is very important.  If climate change causes food insecurity, could it not equally be argued that there is an obligation on agriculture to take a proportionate share of the reductions in national greenhouse gas emissions?</p><p>  Ms O'Shea referred to New Zealand.  Could she elaborate on that?  New Zealand has obviously developed a policy on climate change, yet it seems to be doing as well as us, if not slightly better.  Could Ms O'Shea give us some comparisons?  Perhaps it is not the big bogey if it can be done in New Zealand, which practices intensive agriculture.</p><p>  What realistic target for overall agricultural emissions does Ms O'Shea see for 2020?  Obviously, we have legal obligations nationally, but what would be a realistic target for agriculture for 2020 and up to 2050?  Is that something Glanbia Ingredients Ireland has modelled?</p></speech>

Perhaps members of Teagasc would be the most appropriate people to answer that question.</p><p>  The data that have come out of New Zealand are a couple of years old at this stage.  They relate to the type of cow found in New Zealand and the intensive, factory-type model it has.</p> <p>We have been constrained due to quota regulation to the present day.  Our farmers, depending on the number of cows they have, have a certain quota per litre of milk that they can produce.  We expect to catch up with New Zealand quickly once the quota regime is reduced post-2015 because our cows will be able to produce more milk.  This will reduce emissions and rumen because what happens is when the cow eats the food, it either converts into methane and belches it out or converts it into milk.  If our cows are able to produce more milk, they will be more efficient.  Each unit of cow will produce less methane and more milk, thereby reducing the amount of carbon associated with a litre of milk produced.</p></speech>

The others are managing the nitrogen application through fertiliser, manure management, which is associated with that, and energy usage on farm.  Nitrogen fertiliser and manure management are inextricably linked and they are covered under the nitrates directive.  It is related to the methodology of application of fertiliser on farms and the volume of fertiliser applied.</p></speech>

There is increasing consumption of nutritionally valuable dairy and meat products.  That will increase as people get more protein into their diets.  This needs to be examined at the very minimum on a European level, if not on an international level.  Using targets from an Irish perspective disadvantages production in Ireland and, as I outlined generally and Ms O'Shea did specifically, the production methods in this State are highly sustainable.  All that will be happen is production will move to more unsustainable parts of the world.  In some respects, a similar analogy can be made with the concept of carbon leakage, which is provided for under the emissions trading scheme.  That is very much looked at in an economic sense in that certain industries can be restricted in Europe as a result of emissions trading and move offshore out of Europe, which is effectively carbon leakage.  The same will happen here in some respects, the difference being from a sustainability perspective, food production will move to other pars of the world where it will be done in a more unsustainable fashion.  Ireland is the right place to do it.</p></speech>

Currently, it produces approximately 19 million tonnes of carbon.  The 2020 figure for the entire nation will be 11 million tonnes.  Many of the representatives from the sector say we are the best placed environmentally to produce food.  While I can accept that, for us to meet the 2020 target, surely the sector will have to reduce emissions.  The target for 2020 is 19 million tonnes and it will be difficult to meet that without agriculture playing a key role in the reduction.</p></speech>

At domestic level, the comprehensive work done to date by the Department and Teagasc shows relatively limited amounts of potential mitigation based on the current available technologies.  The reason for that in part is we cannot engineer methane out of cows because of the enteric fermentation process but also because the processes in this country are efficient.  That is the dilemma we face.  We are probably close to being as efficient as is possible.</p></speech>

Given that we are such a strong country in terms of agrifood, we have a huge and world class scientific capability in all aspects of dairy science from processing to production and it is a case of continuing to invest in that to see where there are further measures to increase the mitigation figure.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly has just discussed the nub of the issue.  The dilemma the committee and the country faces is the alignment of the roadmaps.  The agriculture sector is the main driver in our economy in terms of exports, food production and jobs.  We need to acknowledge the work being done by Glanbia, Kerry Group and so on.  If food production was reduced as a result of targets set by the State, will it be displaced?  Where else would the food be produced?  What would be the effect on the economy and carbon emissions globally?  If targets are set and companies are forced to reduce production, the food will be produced elsewhere because the demand will still be there.  Will it be produced, resulting in greater carbon emissions than Ireland produces?  This is what the issue boils down to.  We must align our roadmaps with national policy and sectoral policy.  We cannot say on the one hand we want jobs, exports and food security while, on the other, set targets that will reduce them and result in the food being produced elsewhere while carbon emissions remain at the same level.</p> <p>There is a dilemma here and as a committee member I am very concerned that the matter needs to be addressed.</p><p> I commend the work done on initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in the sector generally with regard to breeding and other areas.  However, there is scope for further progress if corporate entities such as the co-operatives, Glanbia and the Kerry Group, would engage more with farming organisations and individual farmers on the ground to make progress with regard to renewable energy.  It needs subvention or to be incentivised more.  We need initiatives on energy production through the use of methane.  We need buy-in from the stakeholders that we need to reduce our carbon emissions generally.  Have the witnesses done any work on that area to progress it further?</p><p> I am afraid that we will enact legislation and suddenly people will discover we have a big problem and have not done the proactive work we should have done.  Is the sector doing proactive work to try to involve the stakeholders, including the farmers and others in the sector?  Agriculture and transport are two of biggest contributors to the carbon emissions here.  I do not want to undermine that in any way because it is a very productive sector that is driving our economy.  We need to be very careful about how we handle this.  The nub of the issue is alignment and I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

Then perhaps Ms Joyce-O'Caollai could address the issue of renewable energy.</p><p>  Our economics unit has done an analysis using the input-output tables from the CSO.  We have used the targets as outlined - the 42% increase in exports, the 50% in milk production and the other numbers for pigmeat production, seafood, beef, sheepmeat and prepared consumer foods.  If those targets are met we estimate an additional 25,000 to 30,000 jobs by 2020.  Approximately 20% of those would be in manufacturing and the vast bulk of the remaining 80% would be at farm level and in ancillary services.  That is the prize in terms of these export targets being reached.</p><p>  In a broad sense we believe the carbon leakage concept or food leakage concept, if one wants to call it that, would apply.  All the additional food that will be produced here will be exported so certainly an economic benefit will arise from the jobs I mentioned.  We will be selling that into overseas markets, partly EU markets, but in the main it will be to third countries in Asia and so on.  If we do not fill that demand someone else will.</p></speech>

Policy on the renewable energy technologies and bio-energy crops would be very important.  We do not have the same policies and incentives as the UK or Germany would.  Perhaps Ms Joyce-O'Caollai can speak more about that.</p><p>  There is a joint collaboration at industry level in association with Bord Bia.  Teagasc is playing a key role with respect to that with the national sustainability dairy scheme.  This is where the industry has come together and we are setting out our own roadmap with respect to an audit-based system of continual improvement.  Glanbia Ingredients Ireland Limited, the company I represent, has undergone a pilot for several years - we are probably in our third year.  We are fully behind the national scheme.  We have audited on farms.  In the next couple of weeks we will request our board to make it mandatory for all our farm suppliers - more than 4,300 suppliers - to participate in a sustainability scheme.  We are doing this because our customers require it.</p><p>  It covers a number of key indicators.  Carbon, animal health and welfare, energy usage and water efficiency would all underpin that as well as health and safety.  I am sure I am missing one or two.  We are working very hard.  We are looking at international studies.  We are looking at what companies abroad are looking for.  We are looking at what the multinationals want.  It is a roadmap towards a sustainable secure supply of food.  Many of our customers are looking to Ireland and are commending Ireland on what our companies are doing and what the country is doing.  They want to get their product from Ireland.  There is no mistake as to why more than 15% of the world's infant formula is sourced from Ireland.  It is seen as a secure place to get their infant formula base ingredient and also the traceability with respect to that.  Quality and traceability are very important, but so too is the carbon number associated with that production.</p></speech>

At the last meeting we were told that the carbon footprint of the beef sector is the lowest in Europe.  Ms O'Shea has said that only New Zealand is ahead of us.  How do we take something like that into consideration?  We have to use a methodology to recognise that here and to push it when accounting methodologies are being analysed and implemented in the EU.  How do we take that into consideration?</p><p>  We have read that the Mediterranean countries will be reducing agriculture production because climate change will not be conducive to such production, whereas our country will remain sustainable for agricultural production.  One can see that the demand from outside might increase and we need to balance that.  We have no control over the sun.  So the European Union must engineer its policies and we have to take into consideration how climate change will affect food production.</p><p>  There was mention of bio-methane and bio-gas.  I do not see the industry driving anaerobic digestion.  In the North of Ireland there are 600 anaerobic digesters in six counties.  I believe we have four in 26 counties.  The farming industry has the basic raw material for anaerobic digestion sitting on its doorstep.  Do the witnesses have a comment on the area?  I would like the witnesses to say more about it.</p><p>  What is the view of the witnesses on emissions trading as a means of allocating emission rights to efficient producers on a pan-European level?</p></speech>

It is to ensure that the technology is appropriate on each site.  There are specifics relating to the technology meaning it may not be appropriate everywhere.</p><p>  Establishing the emission trading scheme and accounting methodologies would be a massive task.  However, it would ensure that Irish farmers are on a level playing field on a European scale.  It would require considerable work but would be very worthwhile given the agricultural emissions we have.</p></speech>

In Europe the managed markets with comprehensive intervention systems that we used to have under the Common Agricultural Policy are largely a thing of the past; the ending of dairy quotas in 2015 and 2016 is a classic example.  There will be much greater price volatility as European prices fall much more in line with global prices.  Much of this is weather-related and we can see the price of various food inputs increasing and decreasing rapidly, depending on reports on the extent to which yields are affected by weather conditions.  This must be faced by the industry in its broadest sense and is something on which everybody keeps a very close eye.</p></speech>

Are they in favour of agriculture being included in the European emissions trading scheme?  I take it from the replies given that they are not.  It has been stated we are so sustainable that this needs to be seen on a Europe-wide basis, but at the same time what if the European Union does not see it that way?  I do not think it does.  We still have legally binding targets for 2020 which are at the low end of what we must ultimately deal with by 2050.  I do not see how we can square the circle.  If the European Union states we must meet our obligations within the targets set at country level, not at Europe-wide level, how will the circle be squared?</p></speech>

A Commission Green Paper is due out later this year or early next year on sustainable food and diet and it is an issue that is being examined in detail.  The Common Agricultural Policy negotiations were concluded in recent weeks and a significant element of the budget, approximately 30%, under Pillar 1 which deals with direct payments is directed towards greening measures.  The green chapter deals with land use and diversification.  Pillar 2 deals with rural development and REPS and also has a very strong green element.  The argument at European level is the same as that at national level and is on whether we want to produce food in a sustainable fashion.  Policies and frameworks such as the CAP are very focused on sustainable methods of production.</p><p>  With regard to legally binding targets, from a sectoral road map perspective, the initial work done to date is robust but indicates there is limited potential for mitigation in the food sector.  As an economy we need to weigh up the growth potential of food produced in a sustainable fashion versus it shifting to overseas locations where it would be produced much more unsustainably.</p></speech>

Pillar 2 is very dependent on the Government's commitment.  Are the delegates happy there is a commitment on the part of the Government to meet the demands placed on it under Pillar 2 and anything which may be contained within it to progress this element?</p></speech>

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not criticise, comment on or make charges against any person or persons outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  Tr&oacute;caire's submission has been already circulated to members and will be taken as read.  I now invite Ms de Barra who has five minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe de Barra" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500017#Q00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  As an overseas development agency, the advance of climate change is now the context within which Tr&oacute;caire works.  The impacts of climate change are being felt first and most keenly by those with the least resources to cope and least culpability with respect to climate change.</p><p>  Tr&oacute;caire is concerned that the heads of Bill do not propose a mechanism fit for ensuring the long-term vision and planning required to bring about the fundamental shifts necessary to adequately address climate change.  We are concerned in particular about the inclusion in the Bill of clear, numeric national targets, which are important in order to enshrine our EU and international targets.  If, as we assume, the intention is to meet these external targets, then their naming in national legislation should give no cause for controversy.  We are concerned that there are differing interpretations of what low carbon means and that in the absence of a clearly defined objective, the practicalities of planning towards an overall emission reduction strategy will be compromised.  We believe that it is, therefore, important to place beyond doubt the meaning of a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by setting out in head 4 an emission reduction target of 80% to 90% for the period up to and including 2050.   We believe this would give clarity, objectivity and measurability to the context.  We believe also that consideration could be given to inserting a definition of low carbon into head 2 so that low carbon would in that definition be in line with the European Council agreement for the EU to reduce emissions by 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050.</p><p>  We believe that strong accountability and implementation mechanisms are essential to ensure the effective management of the transition to a low carbon future.  It is proposed that provision should be made in head 5 for the development of low carbon roadmaps every three to five years.  A seven year cycle, as currently envisaged, is too long to ensure an adequate form of political accountability.  Further, we believe that the role of the expert advisory body should be strengthened and in this regard propose that provision be made in head 8 for the expert advisory body to have the ability to publish its annual reports independent of Government consent.  </p><p>  We ask that in its considerations the committee reflect on the three principles outlined in our submission, namely, responsibility, justice and coherence.  While Ireland ranks highly as an international partner as a result of its development co-operation programme, it has a disproportionately high level of greenhouse gas emissions for its population size and is among the highest users of natural resources in Europe.  We believe that an adequate and just response to the threat posed by climate change would require Ireland to reduce its domestic emissions in line with the established international commitments and scientific evidence to ensure that those disproportionately impacted by a problem to which they did not contribute are adequately and reliably supported to cope with the impacts, that the most vulnerable people, domestically and internationally, are not disproportionately burdened in the response but receive an equitable share of the opportunities that action on climate and sustainable development presents.</p></speech>

Does Ms de Barra agree that is what is happening in the context of this legislation?  In terms of our credibility as a development partner, will our approach to climate change be seen in that context and does it add or subtract to our credibility from that point of view?</p><p>  The White Paper on development emphasises policy coherence.  Why is the enactment of domestic climate change legislation important in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe de Barra" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500017#Q00400"><p>On the first question, we believe it is important targets are set in this legislation and that they are not adequately addressed in the legislation as currently drafted.  We all know that what needs to be managed must be measurable.  We believe that if Ireland is committed to meeting existing and future international targets it is then hard to argue against the setting of specific targets which are measurable in our national legislation.</p><p>  On credibility as a development partner, this goes to the heart of development.  As I mentioned at the outset, for Tr&oacute;caire climate change is the context within which we work.  We work in countries in eastern and southern Africa, which are badly affected by climate change.  This is not a matter of short-term variability in climate but of long-term destructive climatic changes.  For example, when I was in Malawi recently - I have previously worked and lived there for many years - I met a woman who had harvested her crop in April.  She has four months between that harvest and her hitting what previously was a two to three months hungry season.  Women and men in developing countries are feeling the impact of climate change.  It is literally costing them the lives of their children and making them vulnerable beyond the scope of our imagination.  Ireland is a small nation with a proud record and history of supporting developing countries.  Our action on this will be a reflection of our continued commitment to that.</p><p>  Policy coherence is important because work on the development side can be undermined by work in other areas of government policy.  We believe it is important that the White Paper in terms of its content, contribution and commitment to policy coherence for development is taken as a core policy piece by the Irish Government.  We are aware that these discussions are not easy and that there are trade-offs that need to happen between different areas of Ireland's interest.  We believe, however, that an over-arching contribution to the global good is not only good for developing countries and impoverished populations within them, but ultimately is good for the population in Ireland.  This is part of the reason we believe that policy coherence is an extremely important element of this and propose that this is taken seriously by the committee.</p></speech>

Ms de Barra mentioned earlier that roadmaps should be developed every three to five years.  Is there a particular reason targets should be set every three years?  I understand the Government proposal in this regard is seven years.  The Bill I produced proposed the setting of five year targets.</p><p>  On the effects of climate change in Ireland, I have referred on many occasions in the D&aacute;il to the presence during the past couple of years, in particular in June, July and August, of water in the drills of cornfields in Kildare, which is the driest part of the country.  If anyone needs convincing on the issue of climate change the sight of corn lying under water during those months would do it.  There is still very significant resistance to addressing climate change.  There is much denial around this issue, including the constant argument that because Ireland is a food producing country, it does not have to play any part in it.</p> <p>How will we try to win that awareness campaign?</p><p> There is also the media issue.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill had received good coverage before it was even published when the heads were discussed in the Seanad Chamber.  We might as well have this meeting in a bunker in south Armagh because the details will probably never get outside the walls of this place.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate.  We are currently off-track in meeting our targets and a figure of &euro;900 million has been quoted from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association with regard to the fodder crisis.  I may hear five or ten minutes of the media every day but I have never heard that figure before, despite having my ear tuned for that kind of issue.  The figure has not got into the wider world, although it may have appeared in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> or somewhere like it.  It is staggering to think nearly &euro;1 billion is the cost of the fodder crisis.  We are trying to mainstream this debate, which is one of the bigger issues, along with the economic crisis.  Sustainable development and the economy are linked so I wonder how we can present this to a wider audience.</p><p>  If we are to communicate this to the public, we must somehow or other get across the type of economy, society or community we will be in 20, 30 or 40 years.  Do the witnesses from Tr&oacute;caire agree we must now start painting this picture?  They have correctly highlighted what is happening in developing countries, although I have not seen that at first hand.  The media reports nevertheless indicate that serious things are happening.  What are the main shortcomings of the Bill?</p></speech>

We consider that a seven year timeframe is simply far too long not only on the political accountability front but also in terms of our understanding of the issue; having a period of seven years without a substantive review is too long.</p><p>  On the economic evidence, apart from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association figure - I do not have the details on where it got the figure - the fodder crisis was in the media and research was done, meaning a cost was put on it.  There is a very large blind spot with regard to the economic costs to Ireland of doing nothing about climate change.  The matter must be taken very seriously, particularly in the context of an intergenerational impact from climate change on the country, as it will affect future generations.  I posit that the committee should take it forward and ask those with a relevant background to conduct analysis so we can understand perspectives.  In the absence of such analysis, a three to five year timeframe is more appropriate than a seven year timeframe.</p><p>  We fully agree that the issue needs to be given a national importance but it is always very difficult to get it across.  People nevertheless feel strongly about it for different reasons.  Tr&oacute;caire's work is overseas in the developing world; that is our area of competence and we can speak very well on that.  We need to join with other sectors in society which have a vision on how this impacts Ireland.  I cannot underline enough how important it is to have the evidence of how that affects livelihoods in Ireland.  There is a big gap there at the moment.</p><p>  I was asked to summarise three key points.  They are around the need for a clear reduction target of 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050, making a provision in head 5 for the development of the low-carbon roadmaps every three to five years and provision for strengthening the role of the expert advisory body so it has more freedom in publishing annual reports without the process of necessarily having to go through Government.</p></speech>

The witness stated that it should publish annual reports without ministerial consent and have the independence and autonomy to do so.  I understand where the witnesses are coming from in that regard.  Who should be permitted to sit on and operate within the expert advisory group?  Will the witnesses elaborate on how it should be structured and how they believe independence can be maintained <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Minister and the Government?  Given that we are in a progressive minority in the European Union, as outside France, Sweden, Austria, and the UK we are the only State to date which has published and is on the road to enacting domestic climate change legislation, what is in the proposed legislation that the witnesses would favour and welcome?</p></speech>

I will give my colleague an opportunity to contribute in a moment.  With regard to the expert advisory body, we know that accountability is critical in a democracy in order to effect change.  We consider that there must be the strongest form of accountability around this issue mandated by the Government.  I will ask my colleague to comment on some of the more technical questions but it would be a missed opportunity if we did not ensure very strong oversight and accountability built into this mechanism.</p></speech>

The heads of Bill indicate there should be four <i>ex officio</i> members but we believe members should all be scientific experts and there should be no <i>ex officio</i> members from the Departments.  It would be a key issue for all members to be independent, and that would feed into the independence of the committee.  The members could come from the scientific community, as it would be the most credible way to take forward that body.  The members would have to maintain independence by having an ability to publish their own reports, with the mandatory requirement for the Government to consult with the body on the development of low-carbon roadmaps.</p><p>  Having a Bill in the first place is a very positive step and it will ensure we meet our obligations.  There is also a positive in some of the accountability mechanisms, although we need to strengthen the role of the expert body and those roadmaps on a more regular basis.</p></speech>

One question arising from Deputy Nash's question is whether Tr&oacute;caire is against the use of the four figures as stipulated in head 6 as <i>ex officio</i> members.  Are the witnesses clearly stating that these figures, including the director general of the agency, should not be a part of the expert committee?</p><p>  I get a sense that the purpose and drive of the presentation concerned climate justice, which is clearly related to Tr&oacute;caire's very important international role.  Do the witnesses have any comment on the challenges facing economic growth in Ireland, and specifically a possible clash between Food Harvest 2020 and targets that may be inserted in the Bill?  I ask this with regard to the agriculture and energy areas.  I know Tr&oacute;caire has international expertise in this regard.</p> <p>However, I wish to hear the witness's view on the domestic challenges in that regard.</p><p> Finally, clearly the witness's point of view is from the perspective of development and foreign affairs.  The T&aacute;naiste was quoted as saying that Ireland could be one of the first countries in the EU to enshrine climate change targets in domestic law.  Does the witness have a view on which Department should have this in its remit?  At present, it is within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but as these hearings continue we are continually reminded that it has an impact across all Departments.  Does the witness have a view on how this might be implemented differently from what is in the Bill?</p></speech>

My colleague, Ciara Kirrane, will deal with the first question.  As regards the challenges we face, as a development agency we often encounter the positing that there is a direct trade-off between global food security and achieving changes in climate change legislation.  It is important to understand that these issues are quite separate for us.</p><p>  I will give our perspective as a development agency.  Global food security impacts on the poorest people in the poorest countries.  Global food security is an area that we and my colleague, Tom Crowley, focus on primarily.  It is about ensuring food availability locally for local populations and the generation of food supply within a region or country.  We often hear an argument which we believe is over-simplified, which is about the expansion of food production in countries such as Ireland, which tends to produce high value added products that have a strong and growing market.  Sometimes one hears people say, "Is this not part of a response to global food insecurity?".  The simple answer is that it is not.  It must first be put on the record that those two things do not have a direct link.</p></speech>

There are two separate issues.  We have been working with food security in the developing world for the past 40 years.  From our experience in ensuring that the poor have food security it is about their ability to produce their own food locally and to access food locally.  That is the key to ensuring their food security.  That is what we have learned from our experience.  The key element that is undermining their food security at present is climate change.  The biggest thing we can do to ensure their food security is rein in climate change and support those communities to adapt to climate change.</p><p>  It is about who accesses the products we export.  I have lived in Latin America and in Africa.  As I have learned, when one goes to the supermarket the exported products on the shelves are available to the elites.  These are very high value meat and dairy products and they are purchased by the wealthy groups in those communities.  In the case of the farmers I worked with in Honduras, the key to ensuring their food security was their own ability to produce food on their own land, and climate change is undermining that.</p><p> To reinforce what Caoimhe said, it is very important to disentangle the issues of the opportunities for Irish exports from addressing chronic malnutrition in the developing world.</p></speech>

Given their experience over the last 50 years, global climate change was probably on their agenda before it was on anybody else's agenda.  They were working in the countries affected by it before we even started thinking about it 20 years ago.  Their experience and input are valuable, particularly when they tell us the number of people dying each year.  It is worth repeating that 300,000 people are dying each year due to climate change.  We must keep that in mind.</p><p>  The witnesses said responsibility is among their three priorities.  As politicians we would love to have to wear just one hat for responsibility, but we must wear three or four hats for responsibility to A, B, C and D.  When the witnesses outline their three objectives as responsibility, justice and climate, I presume their responsibility is to the Third World and to the countries that are most affected.  That would be their priority.  I gave that number of our responsibilities because our responsibility is to those as well.  We have an impact on their lives so it is our responsibility as well.  However, we have another responsibility and I wonder how to balance the two.  We have a responsibility to the people in our own country who cannot afford to eat, if food is going to get more expensive.  Have the witnesses any advice on how to balance that?  They know we want to be responsible and do the best for the Third World but they also know we are bound by the economic constraints to do our best for the people in our own country as well.</p><p>  The witnesses suggested that there be a definition of low carbon under head 2.  Do they not think the definition of low carbon should be worldwide?  We talked earlier about how to do the accounting, definitions and so forth.  When they ask us to define low carbon in head 2 do they mean for Ireland, on a European scale or on a global scale?</p><p>  My third question is also about the submission.  It says the way we currently live and do business is not viable in the long term.  I always say it would be great if we could go back to the slower pace of life in the Aran Islands versus the east and so forth.  I am not picking on the Aran Islands as it is a beautiful place and I am from the west, but what do the witnesses mean by that?  I realise we must put a great deal into educating people about the throwaway society and so forth.  As the witnesses have mentioned it, if they were to ask us to do two things to stop this, what would be their recommendations?</p><p>  I take their point about food security.  We discussed it earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe de Barra" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500019#S01400"><p>I will reply to some of the questions and my colleague, Ciara Kirrane, will also respond.  The Senator asked for our advice with respect to the very difficult situation in which Ireland currently finds itself.  It is not really our position to give the committee advice.  However, in overseas development in situations where we see people facing short-term extremely difficult and harsh conditions, we have been forced to take an intergenerational response.  If we try to respond in a short-term way, we are simply storing up problems in the future for the next generation.  That is as true in Ireland today as it is in our work overseas.</p> <p>We need to ensure the policy is as strongly intergenerational as politically possible.  This is why we say we need to have accountability measures in place and three to five-year policy-making cycles.  We need to bear in mind that what is decided here and now is in a difficult climate and a harsh context but the effect of the decisions will be felt 40 years later.</p><p> I am sure Ms Ciara Kirrane would like to contribute on whether it should be a definition worldwide.  I underline that the definition we have posited is the one outlined in the European Council agreement regarding the reduction of emissions by 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050.  When we talk about justice and responsibility, it is in the context of Ireland having the tenth highest ecological footprint in the world.  We have enjoyed the benefits of rapid economic growth and have had to deal with a rapid economic downturn that has been very difficult.  We also have responsibility to take what we have, our technology, our knowledge, our capacity and our skills to do what we can across a multiplicity of fronts.  There is no single answer to reduce emissions.  This will be driven by policy and targets are essential in order for policy to be fulfilled.</p></speech>

The cost of not acting will have a major impact at the Irish level.  We have already spoken about costs in terms of dealing directly with impacts that may come down the line from climate change, like the &euro;900 million figure quoted for the fodder crisis in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  We also have international obligations in terms of supporting developing countries.  The issue of loss and damage arises in international negotiations.  That is about compensating developing countries for the loss and damage they experience to which they cannot adapt.  It is early days but some of the early proposals are that contributions are based on a <i>per capita</i> emissions basis and <i>per capita</i> GDP.  Our levels of emissions <i>per capita</i> are high so we will have a high obligation in that regard.  We need to consider these points.  By acting to reduce emissions now, we will be acting in our interests in terms of the savings we can make on international obligations for finance, such as loss and damage.</p><p>  In terms of the definition of low carbon, it makes sense to define this for Ireland and for the Bill.  Without defining it, we are using vague language that is open to interpretation.  I strongly believe planning would be incredibly difficult when working off a definition that is not clearly defined.  The European Council objective of 80% to 95% as indicated earlier is an appropriate definition we can apply.</p><p>  Caoimhe de Barra has addressed the question but another important point is to provide leadership on the issue.  It is not an issue that gets a major amount of attention in the media but it is in our interests to act now, at the earliest possible stages, to prevent catastrophic climate change.  It is the responsibility of the Government and the committee to show leadership and to try to address these problems in an adequate manner.</p></speech>

I have read the submission although I do not have the opening statement.  I will get it later.  The Fiscal Advisory Council is a template.  Is it a good template to transfer onto this?</p><p>  With regard to figures in other submissions, such as the dairy sector's submission this morning, we are transposing the Kyoto Agreement into the heads of the Bill, which clearly gives us a target for 2020.  There are negotiations in 2015, which will likely come out at 40%.  The other day, we heard that in reality it means a 52% figure for Ireland.  In negotiations in the EU context, is it likely to include a 40 year target at this stage given that negotiations must take place in 2015?  We were listening to the dairy sector.  Will the targets for the agricultural sector be the same as those for other European countries that are not as agricultural?  We are a very agricultural economy.  Within the negotiation pack of 80% to 95% for Europe, Ireland may not have a target if we take it in the European context.  Have the witnesses looked at this in the context of the Green Paper for Europe?</p></speech>

We do not believe the answers will all come from one particular sector of the Irish economy.  There must be fair burden sharing across different sectors.  Agriculture is often at the heart of the debate, as is a sector such as transport.  A solid piece of work is to be done to identify the work plan through the rolling agendas and how this will be managed within Ireland in a fair and equitable way so that the burden does not fall on one sector which, as we can completely understand, feels vulnerable.</p></speech>

I agree it is a good idea.</p><p>  In terms of targets and whether it is premature to include targets, it is not premature because the likely target, as stated by the European Council, will be 80% to 95% and the scientific community has stated that is what is necessary.  In fact, it may well be an underestimate of what is needed to address climate change problems adequately.  Including a target of 80% to 95% does not compromise ourselves but supports us to put us on the trajectory towards meeting our objective.  There are ways of dealing with that kind of a target.  By including it, we can start planning to give the clarity and benchmarks against which we can measure.  There are ways of dealing with it in how we can revise it should the targets change.  We can look to including clauses about revising in legislation, as has been done in other Bills.</p></speech>

At this early stage, if the European target ends up at 80% to 95%, it is not the case that every member state will have a total target for the European Union.  Will each individual state have a target of 80%?  Others may carry a higher burden because they have a lower dependency on agriculture, which generates higher greenhouse gases.  What is the thinking of the witnesses on that?  Is it a European Union figure rather than an individual state figure?</p></speech>

I imagine that it would be highly unlikely that we will not have very high and significant emissions targets such as 80% to 95% and that is what we would need to write in.  By putting it into our legislation we would be acting in our own interests in trying to give ourselves the mechanism that we need to develop policy and plans to meet that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to answer questions on our submission.  I would like to introduce my two colleagues, Ms. Jill Murray from Bord Gais Energy and Ms Audrey O&rsquo;Shea from Glanbia whom the committee met this morning.  There are particular circumstances for her second appearance.  We apologise if we have breached any protocol.  I explained to the clerk the particular circumstances.  It is my intention to handle most of the questions.  Unless there are questions specifically directed to my two colleagues I will attempt to answer them.</p><p>  The committee is aware that I head up IBEC's energy and environment policy unit. I have been doing that for three years.  I previously worked for the Sustainable Energy Authority and prior to that in industry.  As part of my policy brief I administrate several policy committees including an energy policy committee and an environment policy committee and our climate change working group runs across both those committees.  We try to represent the broad common interests of all sectors of industry because we have several thousand members in different sectors.  Whereas individual sectors may have particular interests we are trying to find the common ground.</p></speech>

In his opening statement he mentioned that this Bill is an improvement on previous attempts at legislation which would have worked against, rather than alongside, EU policy.  Could Mr. Walker explain how previous Bills may have worked against, rather than alongside, EU policy?</p><p>  This morning we heard the other employers' body, Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change.  Those witnesses said that they can see the need to use the opportunities to provide certainty in respect of the legislation, clear markers and a clear direction, clear five year targets, clear 2050 targets to give people and investors certainty.  Mr. Walker's statement seems to be at variance with that.  Why is that so?  The future will be very different from the present.  Would Mr. Walker agree that if we do not change course now we will lead ourselves into a cul de sac, instead of going down a different road where we use the new realities to develop the opportunities to move towards a more carbon-neutral future?</p></speech>

There have been four or five attempts at climate legislation in recent years.  I am familiar with all of them, and with two authors of the legislation who are here today.  I do not intend to imply any criticism of any person but as a point of principle it is important when designing national legislation that it works in harmony with the pre-existing European legislation.  The primary criticism that we made of the last government attempt at legislation is that it effectively ignored the existing EU policy and would have directed mitigation efforts into areas where there would have been no environmental benefits, specifically the emissions trading sector where the absolute cap is already determined so the money would not have been spent on meeting national obligations but simply on driving down the price of EU allowances.  This has been debated at length in various fora.  There is very little debate about it now.  It is imperative that national policies reinforce EU policies in the same way that EU policies have to reinforce the UNFCCC framework.</p> <p>There is no room for national solo runs.</p></speech>

I am director of the Abbey Theatre, which is a member of IBEC, although our representative is not on the energy committee.  I had better outline that in case some wily journalist reveals that.</p><p>  Mr. Walker states clearly in his submission: "For the avoidance of doubt, such a body must not be modelled on the UK's committee on climate change whose relationship with the Department of Energy and Climate Change and with the UK Treasury has become increasingly fractious and ineffective over recent years".  He later states: "We would also disagree with recent proposals that responsibility for climate policy should be transferred into the Department of Taoiseach".  They are two Doomsday visions for IBEC about what a committee might look like.  Will Mr. Walker outline his view of what that horror might be?</p></speech>

This is not a criticism of IBEC.

There will be a committee of experts.  I happen to have a background in this and I have a great interest but if the Senator gets me started, we will be here for the rest of the afternoon and he will not get any more questions answered.  I have done a great deal of work on what technologies are available.  It is one thing to identify a technology with potential but it is another to design an efficient policy that gets that implemented.  For example, work done by McKinsey suggests many energy efficiency projects have a negative cost.  Why are they not happening?  If one cannot get things to happen of their own accord when they are a negative cost, how much more is policy needed to make sure things happen that have a positive cost and are done in such a way that they will create opportunities for the business community to deliver domestically rather than substituting a dependence on fossil imports for a dependence on technology imports?</p></speech>

That is no argument for moving responsibility for it to the Department of the Taoiseach because that is not a spending Department.  It holds the ring between all the other Departments.  Clearly, there is a Cabinet decision-making process and a Cabinet sub-committee, which is advised by experts, but no country makes the Head of State personally responsible for delivering climate policy.  The President of the European Commission, for example, does not have responsibility for it; the Commission has a directorate.  Britain has the Department of Energy and Climate Change, not David Cameron.  From that viewpoint, while I can see the argument for having greater accountability and it would be great to haul the Taoiseach in during Question Time every week and ask him what he has done for the climate this week, I am not sure that would have any positive real effect on achieving what we want.</p></speech>

It is the exception rather than the norm.  Every member state has transposed EU legislation that would have the impact of promoting renewables, energy efficiency, building standards, sustainable transport or reducing carbon emissions but few have introduced a climate Bill, which has targets that do not specifically relate to what has been negotiated in Brussels.  We have an effort sharing agreement on renewables, energy efficiency and climate targets for the non-emissions trading sector.  The way those targets were reached was through modelling similar to Dr. Brian &Oacute;'Gallach&oacute;ir's, except that he reckons they got the numbers wrong.  Although there was meant to be an equal sharing of the burden, the numbers for Ireland are much higher because they did not take proper account of agriculture, but then Ireland's target was adjusted upwards as part of social cohesion.  Instead of us getting 16%, we got 20% and we were meant to carry more of the burden than other less wealthy EU states.  They thought we were rich back in 2006 and we would help them.  The question is whether we would help them by going the extra mile doing domestic abatement at ever-increasing cost or whether we would have financial transfers to cause abatement to be done at a lower cost, thereby helping economic development in poorer countries.  That is different from buying dubious credits from Third World countries where there have been issues about how real they are.  This is within the EU and the Commission wants us to promote social cohesion.  Target setting is a complex process, which is negotiated in Brussels.</p><p>  The UK does many things well but it has determined its climate targets without adequate reference to the EU policy framework and one of the unintended consequences, for example, of the carbon price law is to depress the price of carbon in the European market.  It has targets up to 2050 but if the Senator Googles it, he will find in two minutes that there has been a series of public spats between the committee on climate change and the Government.  Perhaps he will say that is holding the government to account but has it been constructive?  I invite him to form his own view.</p></speech>

They were keen on having certainty and referred to the UK approach as being positive in giving certainty for people, for example, in the energy sector.</p><p>  Mr. Walker said we should not do solo runs here.  Would he be in favour of inserting into the Bill the targets to which we have already more or less subscribed?  The main emphasis in the IBEC submission appears to be on avoiding measures that increase the cost burden on employers.  On the other side of that, has it quantified the damage-type issues, such as increased insurance costs and investment in water infrastructure?  Would the cost of inaction be more than the cost of action?</p><p>  This morning, the corporate leaders pointed to the need for a broader vision that would cascade down into each of the sectors.  Would Mr. Walker agree with that approach?  The decision on where responsibility is placed at Government level ties into that.  He has already said that the Department of the Taoiseach should not have the responsibility.  That broad vision seems to be a very sensible approach.  We would have to come back to how it might be defined.  Does Mr. Walker believe the science on the targets up to 2020?</p></speech>

It is difficult to see how we can meet the targets without having costs in the short term.  If the proper investment is made, there may be a greater cumulative return in the longer term.  We need to plan for 2020, 2030 and 2050.  Is IBEC working towards that?  How can we meet those targets without incurring a cost at this stage?</p></speech>

There are five questions and I may not respond to them in the order asked.  First, the Deputy spoke about damage, which is really the cost of adaptation.  Most of the pollution is being done in the developed world and most of the damage is being done in the Third World.  That is an issue of climate justice, on which I feel very strongly.  Within Europe there are issues relating to flooding, coastal defence, etc.  However, I do not claim to have any expertise in the mitigation costs of that.  Globally, the Stern review has shown that the cost of mitigation should be cheaper than the cost of adaptation, but I cannot say whether that also pertains to one EU member state.</p><p>  I agree on the need for a vision, which is why it makes sense to have a national roadmap.  However, it must also adhere to European policy and cannot be a stand-alone national vision.  On the issue of whether central roadmaps should inform the national roadmap, it will be a two-way flow.</p><p>  Do I believe that the target for Ireland was scientifically reached?  As I have previously outlined, the European Commission runs a model called PRIMES which is run by the University of Athens.  It is similar to the TIMES model which Dr. &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir runs.  A model is only as good as the numbers on which it runs and it is an engineering technical model.  It is an optimisation model in Dr. &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's case and a simulation model in the Commission's case.  Having come up with a solution that was supposedly equimarginal - that is efficient - because nobody was asked to be able to do something at a higher marginal cost than everybody else, they then adjusted the targets for purposes of social cohesion.  The target we have is not purely the result of science.</p><p>  At a global level a scientific reduction is required because the environment only cares about global emissions.  High-level international politics at the UN then decides the share that is being carried by the EU.  Negotiations in Brussels then determine the share of individual member states and that is partly on economics and partly on social grounds.  We ended up with the toughest target by far, partly because the modelling is questionable and partly because we were perceived to be a rich country - we got landed with our target based on 2006 GDP.</p><p>  We need targets but we have loads of targets.  Between now and 2020 for each year there is a trajectory for the ETS which is EU-wide.  There is a trajectory for the non-ETS sector.  There is a requirement to move towards the use of 10% of renewable sources of energy in transport.  That is qualified by a target related to indirect land use change.  There is a target for overall renewable sources of energy and there is a target for annual improvements in energy efficiency.  That makes 48 targets.</p><p>  We could put a reference to targets in the Bill, which we suggested to the former Minister, Mr. Gormley, more than two years ago.  In order to get broad support for his Bill, all he had to do was to say that the purpose of the Bill was to enable Ireland to meet, at a minimum, its legally binding obligations under the EU climate and energy legislation.</p><p>  However, this is not purely about energy policy.  The climate-change working group covers not just energy policy, but also environment policy so it feeds into two broad policy committees.  I believe every member of the Irish Corporate Leaders is a member of IBEC and most of them are represented on those policy committees.  If there really was a stark disagreement between the two positions, it would have surfaced in our discussions.</p></speech>

I was interested to hear his view that responsibility should not lie in the Department of the Taoiseach, which is probably similar to mine.</p><p>  On head 8, IBEC's submission refers to the need to provide more detail.  It also states that it should not be modelled on the UK's committee on climate change.  I ask Mr. Walker to outline the weakness in head 8.  While dealing with head 8, does Mr. Walker believe the national should come before the sectoral roadmap or should they run in parallel?</p></speech>

If one buys into that, there needs to be constant two-way communication.  It may be that there are several iterations.  Nobody writes a plan that will be good for 40 years - it will need to change.  To the extent that there is a national target and a framework, it is then necessary to ask each of the sectors what it is possible to do, what it would cost and what policy design is required to do it.  Some of them may need more encouragement because they have not been at it as long.  The individual plans are then added together and reviewed.  That is what the European Commission does with renewable energy and energy-efficiency action plans to see whether the national plans in total add up to the overall target.</p> <p>There is likely to be a shortfall, for the simple reason the European Commission intended that in Ireland's case there would be a shortfall.  This is why we were given an extra 4% in the target, so we would have a choice between more expensive domestic measures or funding work elsewhere in the EU.</p><p> It would be a matter for the national roadmap to state how big the gap would be.  There almost certainly will be a gap, even if the economy stays in the doldrums.  Effectively our reduction is not 20%; it is probably more than 30% when one considers the sheer difficulty of abating emissions from soil processes and enteric fermentation in the agriculture sector.  Even if one could come up with a novel technology, such as vaccinating cows to stop them burping or particular chemical inhibitors which would stop soil bugs from decomposing matter into nitrous oxide, the UN accounting system would not recognise them as savings.  It is likely there will be some use of flexibility instruments in the EU and this is not a bad thing; it is what the Commission wants us to do.  It will not be for an individual sector to state it can do nothing so it will meet its share of the burden through the purchase of instruments.  This would be an issue for the central road map.</p></speech>

There are already costs associated with the policies in place but they are being borne.  Some of them are very visible, such as the carbon tax and EU allowances, but there are also costs which are less obvious in terms of how the energy system is required to operate.  We have not been complaining and we have been very progressive.  It is fair enough to meet a target in a way which is efficient but there is nothing to be gained from doing it in a way which is inefficient.  How would this help anybody?  It would just mean there was less money over to do the work needed.</p></speech>

Whether this would extend to supervision is not clear.  It is quite feasible there should be some form of supervisory body, not necessarily the Taoiseach or an Oireachtas joint committee because it could be diluted across several such committees.  One could envisage something along the lines proposed in the final report from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  We do not state this would be the best way to do it, but it would be no harm to consider whether there would be a role for such a supervisory body.  We would see it as complementary to the role of the expert advisory group.  The expert advisers would advise on how to design policies and implement them in a way whereby technologies are adopted early and cost effectively, but somebody must examine whether it all adds up and if not what more needs to be done.  This is not necessarily a role for the heads of the EPA and SEI.  It might be, but they all have day jobs also.</p></speech>

A major issue with regard to sustainable development and renewable and sustainable energy is certainty in the market.  Mr. Walker is against the UK model.  The UK position on the single 2030 target emissions reduction will help reassure investors the Government understands the need for certainty and flexibility if they are to invest in new low-carbon technologies.  One of the main themes at a conference held in Dublin Castle last month, which I helped organise, was that investors need certainty.  One way of achieving certainty is knowing what a government will do.  What does Mr. Walker recommend to achieve certainty in investment in renewable energy?  It is all right to have policy, but if we do not have people to implement this policy we will go nowhere.  We must make it happen; there is no point in writing a document if we have nothing at the end of it.</p></speech>

I am interested to hear about this because we do not have money.  Offshore wind energy costs much more than onshore.  It is more productive at sea but we do not have it.  I would be delighted to hear about measures with negative costs so we could recommend them.</p></speech>

If we look at what happened during the pilot phase of the emissions trading scheme, which was between 2005 and 2007, the price of carbon moved from approximately &euro;20 to approximately 20 cent per tonne.  During this period investment in wind in Ireland accelerated because the revenue received by a wind developer does not depend hugely on the price of carbon.  It can help, but what is more important is the wholesale price of electricity, which also depends on fuel costs.  There is also the safety net of a renewable feed-in tariff which means even if a recession hits, which it did in 2009, and the price of gas in Europe were to fall by half, which it did, and therefore the pool price of electricity falls by 25% to 30%, the wind farm is held whole and has a hedge against energy prices falling too low.  Anything above this provides the icing on the cake.  There are also other issues with regard to certainty on wind farms, such as the weather and planning permission.  The gate process was first come, first served, so many people are sitting on connection offers but do not have planning permission.  It is a very complex area.</p><p>  I will speak briefly about European policy.  This week, the European Parliament passed a vote on backloading and the price of EU allowances has shot up from &euro;4.50 to &euro;4.75.  It has not had a huge effect yet, but if it is followed by further measures it could increase the price of carbon.  The question is whether this will have an impact on the build-out of renewables.  Other countries have gone for much more expensive technologies, particularly on the Continent.  Some countries have tried to create certainty.  In one instance solar photovoltaic energy was being developed at a multiple of the cost of onshore wind but there was no certainty because the government in question then realised how expensive it was and pulled the plug.  It has been very damaging to investor confidence.</p><p>  The way the Department has proceeded has been very good.  It has thought things through carefully and is focused on technology, which is where we have an advantage.  Having the refit scheme as a safety net is a reasonably cost-effective way of promoting onshore wind.  If the price of energy continues to increase the refit will not cost anything because there will be no need for a public service obligation.  It will be above the safety net level.  We have policies in place which, regardless of the price of energy, of which carbon is only a part, there is sufficient certainty to promote renewables.  There is a queue around the block to build onshore wind.</p></speech>

This Bill will be helpful in that it will provide a co-ordinated approach, which means each sector will know where it is going, at least for the duration of the roadmaps, be they five or seven years.  A positive development for us in terms of renewable development is that the Department has stuck to its guns.  Europe has set a target and Irish policy makers have developed the policy to achieve those targets and have stuck to them.  In other countries, Governments have pulled back and changed their targets, which kills investment.  It gives investors comfort that the Irish Government is pro-investment in renewables and renewable policy.</p><p>  The uncertainty at the moment is around where we are going next and what happens post-2020.  By providing a framework whereby we are planning in advance on a five or seven years basis, we will know well enough in advance where the Government is going and what policy will be.  This provides for certainty and stability to investors and reduces the costs of investment.  One of the key questions we are asked by financiers these days is what is Ireland's policy on renewables.  We have been able to show that Irish Government policy has been stable, which has proven very helpful for us.  </p><p>  In terms of the Bill, we believe it will provide the framework to give us the certainty so that we can invest and that this, in turn, should reduce the cost of those investments.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to bring nature-based approaches to climate change before the committee.</p><p>  BirdWatch Ireland is Ireland's largest NGO and we have been actively engaging in climate change issues for over ten years.  I will not outline the scale of the challenge because that is contained in our submission and I am sure members are aware of it.  We are keen to see a target of 80% to 95% for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  It is really important to have targets; otherwise, the effectiveness of the Bill will be undermined.</p><p>  Biodiversity and climate change are not issues people would usually put together.  The interaction of climate change and biodiversity has been reflected in the national biodiversity action plan.  There is a quote from the plan in the submission.  It states how important ecosystems are for actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, as well as being really important in providing adaptation to existing impacts of climate change.  There will be impacts from climate change and they can buffer us against some of the worst impacts, such as flooding.</p><p>  Nature-based solutions to climate change are very cost efficient.  They are our key ally in the fight against climate change in respect of both mitigation and adaptation strategies.  The most important and relevant example of this in Ireland is peat bogs - that is, peatland restoration and conservation.  Bogs store an enormous quantity of greenhouse gases.  In Ireland the figure is approximately 1.56 million tonnes of carbon.  This is massive.  They actively absorb 2.64 million tonnes of carbon per year.  They are a massive store of carbon and they are actively doing us what is effectively a free service.  The problem is that when we reduce the water table in peat bogs and degrade those bogs through burning, turf cutting or peat extraction, that role is reversed and the bogs start to release greenhouse gases.  At present, Ireland is a net source of greenhouse gas.  I provided a figure in the submission.  This Bill must have specific targets for restoration of degraded peat bogs.  We must examine that issue if Ireland is to do anything meaningful to reduce its emissions.  Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General, has said the restoration of peatlands represents low-hanging fruit.  It is among the most cost-effective options for mitigating climate change.  It is important to point out that it is not part of the UNFCCC process, so it must be in addition to cutting emissions.  A required action we have sought for the Bill is that it should adopt targets for the restoration of protected peatlands to stop carbon loss in accordance with the recommendation in "Bogland", a major study compiled by many academics across the universities in which they put forward a set of recommendations.  The Bill should set a target for achieving this by 2020 through partnership approaches to peatland management.  This has happened in the UK, Canada and other countries.  In the UK, for example, there is a target of 1 million hectares of peatland to be restored by 2020.  Ireland is very far behind.  We have done a handful of studies which have shown that we can successfully cap losses of carbon from peat bogs, but we have done very little on this.  We must do a great deal more.</p><p>  Energy is another big issue.  Some of our mitigation actions can have negative impacts on the environment.  We must ensure there is explicit reference to protection of the environment in the Bill.  The challenge we face is to protect nature while deploying renewables at the scale and pace required.  BirdWatch Ireland supports our renewable energy targets and supports meeting those targets through wind energy, but there must be a strategic and planned approach to the deployment of renewable energy in Ireland.  BirdWatch Ireland is actively working towards that with sensitivity mapping for wind energy.  That is a really important issue.</p><p>  Bio-fuels are another issue.  Until now, there has been much support for bio-fuels, but unsustainable production of bio-fuels is driving environmental damage.  It is not as climate-friendly as had been assumed.  In some cases the bio-fuel can be more climate-damaging than conventional oil.  The required action for this Bill is that there are references to the protection of the environment and explicitly for biodiversity that require no damage to valuable ecosystems arising from mitigation and adaptation strategies.  Targets for reducing emissions from fossil fuels must be matched with equally strong policies and measures aimed at protecting natural ecosystems from destruction by conversion to meet the displaced energy demand.</p><p>  The other really important issue relating to energy is that there must be clear and legally binding energy efficiency targets.  That is really crucial.</p><p>  Other ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation are adaptation strategies for wildlife, in terms of wildlife having to adapt to climate change.  There must be buffer zones around our existing Natura 2000 nature conservation sites.  Also, there must be catchment-based flood attenuation.  This is important because wetlands provide a really important service to attenuate flooding.  With regard to increasing the resilience of forestry, there must be a pile of actions in the forestry sector to improve the extent to which forestry is mitigating climate change.  At present, there is an over-reliance on single species monoculture.  Much more could be done.  Studies throughout Europe show a great deal more carbon sequestration can be achieved by continuous-cover forestry approaches.</p><p>  I have rushed through the submission because I cannot read from it, so I referred to some of the key points.  The overarching point is that ecosystems are a very important ally in our fight against climate change.  They are also consistent with a pile of other benefits.  This is an opportunity for Ireland.  Ireland depends a great deal on its clean, green image, particularly in agriculture and tourism.  Currently, our performance with regard to environmental legislation is atrocious.  We rank at the bottom of the European scales.  We have a great deal to achieve if we are to benefit from maintaining a clean green image.  Having specific targets and incorporating biodiversity and environmental considerations into those is essential.</p></speech>

In general, I agree with the key points she made about legally binding targets, five-year roadmaps, giving the expert advisory group the power to publish its results and so forth.</p><p>  On the issue of forestry, we are relying on one type of tree, which is conifers.</p> <p>Is that a serious problem?  Is the lack of diversity in our woodlands a problem?</p><p> I hope that forestry stays in State hands.  This is a recent battle and I hope that those in favour of retaining it in State ownership will win.  How important is that?</p><p> I wish to discuss peatlands and the controversial turf-cutting.  According to the Government, only 2% of peatlands are used for domestic turf-cutting.  Typically, the bogs are small and dried out because turf has been cut on them for 200 years and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to restore them.  I agree with the delegation that scientific evidence has implied that bogs are a great asset for absorbing carbon and their biodiversity is very important.  However, huge tracts of the 98% of boglands not used for turf-cutting are not protected SACs.  They should be protected SACs, and I can name some of them if the delegation so wishes.  The bogs are wet and are actively growing.  I am not a scientist but I know from a brief reading of the reports on different bogs that once the bogs are wet then all of them share the same type of fauna and biodiversity.</p><p> To an extent, some environmentalists have missed the point.  We should protect the bogs, particularly in view of their importance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  That point has been missed.  In most cases the wrong bogs were designated and large bogs were missed, particularly the large, wet actively growing bogs that nobody wants to cut turf on any more.  Bord na M&oacute;na might have harvested them for peat moss 20 or 30 years ago because they were unsuitable for fuel, but the company has moved away from that idea.  </p><p> I have a question on the habitats of cutaway bogs and their value in absorbing greenhouse gas emissions.  Any cutaway bog that I have seen, particularly those that have been left static for five, ten, 15 or 20 years, have became active habitats again in the space of a couple of years.  Many of them are now wetlands, but no thought has been given to restoring their habitats.  They have great potential to deal with greenhouse gas and carbon emissions and probably have the same value as raised bogs.</p><p> There has been great conflict between turf-cutters and the State, and aeroplanes have even taken to the sky over an issue that concerns just 2% of bogs.  The conflict continues, but we are missing the remaining 98%.  I know that not all of the remaining 98% of bog is suitable, because some of it was harvested by Bord na M&oacute;na.  I also know that massive tracts of bogs, far more than 2%, can be utilised and preserved.  The bogland would be of greater benefit because it is wetter.  Does the delegation agree that we must examine that idea?</p></speech>

Studies have been carried out in the UK and across Europe that show that mixed forestry and continuous cover forestry are more beneficial for storing greenhouse gases in the long term.  Most of the climate-polluting gases are stored in the leaf litter and soil beneath the forest, not in the timber, and much of this is released when a forest is clear-felled.  Mixed forestry provides continuous cover and allows for more species and selective harvesting of species, but entails more work, skill and expertise and makes a greater return economically.  It is also better from a climate change perspective, and the literature supports that view.</p><p>  We need to examine different ways of approaching forestry.  I have outlined the mitigation side of forestry and will now talk about resilience.  A large monoculture is more susceptible to attacks from drought, fire or pests.  Mixed stands in forestry are more resilient to climate impacts, as we shall see in the future.  For example, we have had dry springs lately, which is a big issue.  Even without climate mitigation there are many good reasons to have more mixed forestry.  Ireland is wedded to monoculture forestry stands, but we need more mixed forestry here.</p><p>  With regard to peat bogs, the present fight over turf-cutting relates to designated SAC raised bogs which are mainly in the midlands.  They were designated in 1994.  The best sites for nature conservation were chosen, boundaries were delineated around them and they were protected for nature conservation.  Turf-cutting continues, along with many other damaging activities such as afforestation on blanket bogs.  The blanket bogs play a great role in storing and actively sequestering greenhouse gases.  The focus has not been sufficiently wide, as it has been mainly on raised bogs in the midlands and turf-cutting.  For a number of years BirdWatch Ireland has called for the focus to be widened.  We need to stop turf-cutting on the designated raised bogs in the midlands.  We also need to examine other pressures and threats to cutaway bogs and blanket bogs.  Our website contains a ten-page submission from the Peatland Council that details all of those issues and outlines why we need a wider scope.  Climate change is a very important part of our argument, along with other issues such as water quality.  Peat bogs do a great amount to filter and purify water.  Lowland peat bogs also do a lot to soak up heavy rainfall and prevent flooding further downstream.  One can attach a real economic cost to that range of services.  Raised bogs are more than just a nature conservation issue; the focus should be cast much wider.  </p><p>  Deputy Stanley asked whether the wrong bogs were designated, and my answer is definitely "No".  The bogs were designated for species and habitats that are very rare and are increasingly rare across Europe.  We selected the most pristine bogs, not the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  We selected the bogs in which people cut turf using the traditional implement called a slean up until the 1960s, not the ones in which people were engaged in turf-cutting with tractors and sausage machines.  The right bogs have been designated for nature conservation.  </p><p>  With regard to climate change, there is a strong argument for seeking wider protection for bogs.  One EPA-funded restoration project focused on a cutaway bog in County Mayo, and its emissions of greenhouse gases were capped.  That is just one study in Ireland, but many have been carried out in other places.  Belarus has engaged in such conservation over millions of hectares as a climate change response, and we need to do a lot more of this in Ireland.  I must emphasise that this is not instead of other actions to reduce emissions but in addition to them.</p></speech>

The only justification I saw for choosing one bog over another was that it was deemed to be the most southerly raised bog within the midland group of bogs.  A number of other raised bogs lie further south on the globe in Ireland than that designated bog.  The people who made the designation ignored that fact or were unaware of it.

Why does the delegation think the expert advisory group should be independent?  Why should it have the power to publish its own results?</p><p>  Nothing focuses people's minds like costs and quantifying costs.  Is there a way to quantify the damage to biodiversity caused by climate change?  Can Ms Murphy estimate the cost?  Has a model or work been done on same?  It would be useful to know its economic value.</p> <p>Some of the issues that were referred to in regard to ecosystem-based approaches are really land-use planning issues which are more properly dealt with by local authorities.  Do the delegates consider this legislation the right place to include such provisions or is there a need to strengthen other legislation in tandem with this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anja Murray" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500028#CC00200"><p>I will take the question on why the expert advisory body should be independent.  After ten or 15 years working in this sector, most NGOs will observe that serious difficulties can arise when advisory bodies are constrained by being too tightly contained within a particular Department.  The fiscal advisory council is a very good example of a body that is capable of releasing statements, highlighting scientific evidence and making recommendations to Government which the latter can choose either to accept or reject but must, in either case, give an explanation for its decision.  That is the importance of having an independent body.  Many of the measures that will have to be taken if we are to meet the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be politically unpopular in the short term.  It is important that recommendations are not curtailed politically before even being put in the public domain.</p><p>  The question regarding the economic value and cost of peatland restoration efforts is an excellent one.  Several studies in this regard have been carried out in the United Kingdom.  For example, the commission of inquiry established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature carried out a cost-benefit analysis of peatland restoration and found a return of 30 times the investment in terms of carbon value.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, water companies are funding peatland conservation because it is cheaper for them to supply clean water if it comes from a catchment with an intact bog as opposed to having to treat water which contains peat sediment.  There are many similar examples right across Europe.  On one occasion when I raised this issue at an event, a representative of Bank of Ireland who was in attendance expressed considerable interest in the possibility of investing in peatland restoration.  There are strong economic arguments for it.</p><p>  In terms of land-use planning, issues include the location of renewable energy responses and so on.  It is important that this Bill would state very clearly that there shall be no negative environmental impacts on protected species and habitats from mitigation and adaptation strategies.  We are seeking an overarching commitment in this regard within the legislation.</p></speech>

Ms Murray also mentioned the Mayo experiment where there was success in capping greenhouse emissions.  What is the possibility not only of capping emissions but actually making deposits of greenhouse gases?</p></speech>

In the case of a cutover bog, for example, where there is very little peat layer remaining, one would seek to cap emissions.  If a bog is capable of proper restoration to an active bog, the greenhouses gases can be stored as the bog starts to grow.  My colleague, Ms Caoimhe Muldoon, might expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-05a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe Muldoon" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013070500028#CC00700"><p>The top layer of bog is the active layer and is comprised mainly of sphagnum mosses.  As the mosses grow, they absorb the carbon from the atmosphere.  Where the bogs are waterlogged, the carbon will be retained in the inactive layers below.  Once the active top layer is in place, it will start to act as a carbon sink.</p></speech>

The bogland report gives very specific figures, which are included in the initial submission from BirdWatch Ireland to the committee, including an average figure for both blanket and raised bogs.  The average figure for the whole of Ireland is 57,000 tonnes of carbon per year which can be actively sequestered.  The summary section of the bogland report is four or five pages long and sets out much of this information.  Again, it is a question of how waterlogged a particular bog is.  In Canada, active restoration efforts involve the use of small pellets of sphagnum moss to reseed the bog and make it grow again.  In Wales, meanwhile, strips are deployed to stop the water from running down the mountainside.  There are different ways of doing it, some more cost efficient than others.  There is a range of factors at play in deciding which method to use.</p></speech>

However, I have yet to come across any environmental proposal, whether relating to wind turbines, wave energy development or otherwise, where there has not been some type of complaint.  For instance, the construction of turbines off Arklow prompted objections on the basis that spawning grounds would be impacted, which might lead to the death of migrating birds.  There is concern right now in locations in the midlands regarding wind turbine flicker.  The difficulty is in striking a balance between the overall benefit of installing wind turbines or developing tidal energy, for example, as against the potential impact of such initiatives.  There seems to be a negative impact from everything we propose.  There is clearly a level of urgency to be met in dealing with climate change, but this question of striking a balance must be considered before including any provision in legislation.  As I said, I do not recall any proposal that has not prompted objections from one source or another.</p></speech>

A greater degree of strategic planning will help the roll-out of renewable energy.  BirdWatch Ireland's sensitivity mapping project is identifying areas where there is a higher or lower risk for wind energy specifically.  That is one tool out of a range of tools which can be used by developers and regulatory agencies to facilitate roll-out.  As I said, BirdWatch Ireland is absolutely supportive of Ireland meeting its renewable energy targets, including in the area of wind energy.  We are particularly supportive of wind energy being rolled out in locations where there is no conflict with birds and habitats.  That is entirely possible.  I referred in our submission to a BirdLife Europe report entitled Meeting Europe's Renewable Energy Targets in Harmony with Nature.</p> <p>It lays out a range of specific tools as to how we can deploy renewable energy in harmony with nature, including better spatial planning and strategic planning on which Ireland has not been particularly good so far.  Some counties have wind energy strategies while some go into more detail on spatial planning than others.  That is the main tool about which we talk in terms of nature conservation issues and renewable energy.</p></speech>

Again, it depends entirely on where it is.  I do not think miscanthus is commonly grown on peaty soils.  Where forestry and other species are planted on peaty soils, for example, there can be more emissions from the soil than benefit from the growing crop, so it is very site-dependent.  Anaerobic digestion is an excellent idea when it is based on waste products but taking up land to grow crops specifically for anaerobic digestion is a bad idea from a number of perspectives.  When anaerobic digestion is using waste products, it is an excellent idea.</p></speech>

At the moment it is the source of some debate.  The studies done to date show that there is a positive net benefit in terms of greenhouse gas emissions being absorbed by the growing forest but those studies have not taken account of aeration of the soil, the oxidation of the soil which occurs when one drains and plants.  We have said they are not painting a true picture of the emissions from afforestation.  Again, it very much depends on the site.  We support increasing forestry in Ireland, as we have very low forest cover.  However, we should move away from over-reliance on sitka spruce plantations and the clearfell replant system.</p></speech>

I do not think there would be a conflict in anything there counteracting what we do.  The SEA directive has a specific clause stating that climate change and bio-diversity elements shall be incorporated into strategic environmental assessment.  A number of those already have a statement.  What we want here, as we develop strategies, is that an onus is placed on each sector, so that there are sectoral action plans which reflect the need to meet bio-diversity and climate change targets simultaneously.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Monica Gorman, programme support and development officer at Oxfam Ireland, Mr. Sorley McCaughey, head of policy and advocacy at Christian Aid Ireland, and Mr. Gavin Harte, from the Stop Climate Chaos secretariat.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  They are asked to read the document relating to privilege which has been circulated to them.  The opening statements have been circulated and should be considered as read.  I call on Mr. McCaughey to address the committee.</p></speech>

We are a coalition of agencies which are campaigning to ensure Ireland plays its part in preventing runaway climate change.  We have worked slowly on climate change since our launch in 2007.  The coalition is a diverse group of developmental, environmental, youth and faith-based organisations, ranging from Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and Oxfam through to BirdWatch Ireland, the Climate Ireland Action Platform, CIAP, Sustain West Cork and Cultivate, an organisation based in County Tipperary.  We are a national organisation with a diverse membership.  My colleagues and I will now address any questions members may have based on our submission.</p></speech>

On targets, the submission refers to a target of reducing carbon emissions by 95% by 2050.  How realistic is this target in the case of Ireland, particularly considering the quantity of food the country produces and is expected to produce in the short and medium term?  The document also notes that an Irish citizen produces 93 times more carbon that a citizen of Malawi.  While I am not questioning the figure, if accurate, it is staggering and should be viewed in the context of the proposed 95% reduction in carbon emissions.</p><p>  The submission states that a business-as-usual approach to climate change will result in a catastrophic increase of 6&deg; Celsius by the end of the century.  Most other commentators cite a figure of between 2&deg;C and 4&deg;C.  An increase of 6&deg;C would wipe out millions, if not billions, of people and would have catastrophic effects on agriculture, the environment, sea levels and so forth.  On what is the figure of 6&deg;C based?  I concur with many of the views expressed by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, members of which I have met previously.</p></speech>

The European Council has agreed we must make cuts of between 80% and 95% and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agrees.  When the Deputy asks whether this target is realistic, we must ask whether the question relates to whether it is realistic if we are to avoid runaway climate change or realistic in terms of what Ireland can achieve.  We have to be guided by the former requirement or Ireland will not have an agriculture sector worth talking about.  That is the way in which we should view this issue.</p><p>  Ms Gorman will discuss how the target ties into Ireland's commitment to agriculture.  As Irish citizens, we acknowledge and fully understand the importance agriculture plays in the economy.  However, as Ms Gorman will explain more fluently, the business-as-usual model we are currently following is not sustainable.  We must acknowledge that things need to change in terms of both how we approach agriculture and how we will address our requirement to avoid a rise in temperature of more than 2&deg;C.</p></speech>

As Mr. McCaughey indicated, we must also accept that deep changes are needed.  Agriculture is a critical part of the economy.  I am from a farming background and spent the past four years working with Oxfam in Tanzania.  I see both sides of the argument and I accept that this is a difficult circle to square.  Our agriculture is becoming increasingly focused on livestock.  While our dairy industry is extremely important for exports, we must have a vision involving a change in direction in the medium to long term.</p><p>  How should agriculture be shaped from an economic, social and environmental point of view?  We are asking whether there is scope for rebalancing and a shift in the agriculture sector.  Further reductions in carbon emissions could be achieved in certain areas of the livestock sector, including through innovative technology such as the use of methane in energy production. </p><p>  Irish farming has always responded well to the policy environment that supports it.  In the past 30 or 40 years, Irish farmers have always adapted and changed in response to rural development policy and the Common Agricultural Policy.  Our politicians must show vision and leadership by accepting that we cannot maintain intensive livestock-based agriculture and must move towards a more multifunctional type of agriculture.  We must also realise that climate change will mean we will not have a strong agricultural sector.  The fodder crisis earlier this year has been a wake-up call for everybody.  Business as usual is not an option.</p></speech>

It is not a surprising figure.</p> <p> It is also important we take a look at some recent studies on how actual measurements relate to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections.  We can consider scenarios around emissions, ice loss and other issues, which indicate that current business as usual trajectories have us on the worst case scenario.  When we consider the range of temperature increases over the next 100 years, it is fair to argue that a 6&deg; Celsius potential warming above pre-industrial temperatures is possible.  Other commentators are working at a level of 4&deg; Celsius, which is the mean, but if we include external feedback into the system - when nature joins the warming party - it is very possible that we could reach those sorts of targets.</p><p> When considering where we need to be, we must take into account the factor of 2&deg; Celsius and we must set our targets accordingly.  Best case science from 2007 is now suggesting a reduction of 80% in levels by 2050 if we are to hold within the 2&deg; Celsius.  That is where science is telling us to go so it is up to the policy and political representatives in these Houses to show leadership in that space and take society on an innovative and competitive path to a low carbon economy, as this Bill is attempting to do.</p></speech>

Will he elaborate on this and speak of its benefits?  We have had a variety of witnesses before us today which included the Irish Dairy Council.  I take the point on board regarding the balance of agriculture and the extent to which the sector is livestock-based.  The council made the argument that because we have a very sustainable model from an international perspective taking into account the unit of production, the targets could be spread across Europe.  I would like to hear Mr. Harte's opinion on whether agriculture should be catered for within our national envelope of responsibility, for the want of a better description.  A Green Paper is expected in 2015 and there is an idea that Europe is moving towards an approach taking in the whole of Europe as opposed to an individual country.  I value any contribution in this regard.</p><p>  Many of the constituent organisations before us include young people, for example, and the intergenerational aspect has been raised today.  Given that young people will predominantly pick up the tab on the far end if we do not get policy right, how will we engage them in a more inclusive way?  They have more of a stake than we who may be a little beyond youth.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the benefits to this being independent and the answer may be in the question.  The value of having an independent body is, among other things, the ability of the body to publish its own reports rather than having the Government decide when it should do so.  We have highlighted that aspect in our submission and to most minds that is not a particularly outrageous request or suggestion.  It has probably been met with some sympathy by members of the committee and others.</p><p>  Another benefit of an independent advisory council is that we would draw in specialists and experts from outside State bodies.  The relevant Minister would have it within his powers the right to nominate people to bring a diverse range of specialisation and expertise to the advisory council, which may not be the case in what is currently envisaged.  The advisory council could incorporate a wide range of specialists, including people from the private sector through to climate scientists.  It would be up to the Minister to determine what he or she sees as being the most representative for a council.  We would not like to under-stress the importance of having the independence of that advisory council.</p></speech>

There must be a cross-sectoral sharing of responsibility.  There is a wider question, and I accept that, because we have a grass-based system of cattle and sheep production, it is a somewhat more efficient way of growing meat than that which is grain-based.  Nevertheless, to exempt agriculture would be very difficult and it may not be accepted across other sectors of industry.  There must be scope within agriculture for cuts as well.</p></speech>

There are certainly people alive now who will feel the severe impacts of climate change.  We are experiencing some effects already and it is fair to say the number of extreme weather events is increasing with a warming atmosphere.  In effect, we are experiencing climate change today and the impact is likely to worsen if we only carry on business as usual.  From an intergenerational aspect it is really important for the Bill to have a long-term target.  If we consider other areas of similar legislation, the Disability Act is setting very clear legislative targets for hiring people with disabilities.  There are similar stories in the likes of the restructuring of the Anglo Irish Bank bond, which happened in February, as that has a target of 2038 for the first capital repayment, with final payment of the bond in 2050.  The idea of setting long-term targets is not a new phenomenon for legislators and it is fair for us to say that similar to a financial target, we can have targets for carbon emissions.  The restructuring of the Anglo Irish Bank bond may be for this generation and we are forgetting about the future but we should not repeat such thinking when it comes to climate change and carbon emissions.</p></speech>

I will not dwell on targets, as we have had much discussion about them, but in the submission the target is an 80% to 95% reduction on 1990 levels by 2050.  Is that a realistic objective?  The delegation obviously believes it to be if it has made the recommendation.  Nevertheless, we have a large agricultural sector.</p> <p>The delegates have argued that we must change the direction of agriculture in this country, yet Food Harvest 2020 identifies a potential 12% increase in emissions.  As legislators charged with implementing provisions in this area, we have a duty to ensure any recommendations we make are realistically achievable.  Do the delegates have further recommendations on how the target they have set out might be achieved?  It is fine to set a target; the challenge arises in finding ways to meet it.</p><p> The delegates made no reference to EU proposals regarding compensation for loss and damage.  As organisations concerned with climate justice, I would assume this is one element of their agenda.  Why then have they not recommended compensating countries which, through no fault of their own, are most affected by climate change?  When one looks at the footprint per head of population for some of these countries, it is nowhere near the corresponding figure for Ireland.</p><p> A 4% rise in temperatures will result in a decline in crop yields.  Given our location, there is a possibility that Ireland might be better suited to cope with that change than are some other countries.  Certainly, a 4% rise would result in a huge decline for countries at the Equator, Mediterranean countries and so on.  Might it fall to countries in more favourable geographical locations to compensate those experiencing the greatest decline?  In other words, is it possible that Ireland might in future be charged with feeding a greater portion of the global population?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is generally the countries that have contributed least to the problem that are paying most dearly for it.  As global citizens, we have a role in leading on this issue by way of a recognition that we cannot keep consuming at the expense of the vast majority of the world's poor people.  The compensation element is one part of that effort.</p><p>  Coming back to the question of where we see the future for agriculture in this country, the Food Harvest 2020 vision has very much been a response to the growing market among the middle and richer classes in emerging countries for dairy and meat products.  Whether or not that vision will contribute to a sustainable agriculture sector for Ireland in the long term has to reviewed.  We must constantly review and question the underlying assumptions here.  It probably is not possible for us to reach our carbon emission reduction targets if we continue on the path of intensive dairy production.  However, the innovation, imagination and capacity are there within the sector and among our young people in terms of thinking differently about the agriculture industry and where it is going.  More and more people are seeing the reality of climate change and that is pushing the drive for innovation.  We must have an agriculture sector that is driven by more than just market opportunities.  It must include an element of sustainability if it is to thrive into the future.</p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Harte, might comment on whether the target of a reduction of 80% to 95% is achievable.</p></speech>

Ireland has a unique profile in terms of its agriculture sector, while Germany, for instance, has a unique profile in regard to industry.  It is not a case of selecting one element and claiming it deserves special treatment.  In that scenario, Germany could well argue for special treatment for its industrial sector.  There must an equitable division in terms of effort, which will require a national job of work for all of us in this process.  It comes back to how legislators devise a roadmap for sectors, as laid out in the proposed legislation, in terms of setting innovative targets.  Those targets should be achievable but they should also be challenging.  We need to see this as something that will stretch innovation, particularly from the point of view of business.  Businesses which embrace sustainable and green enterprise identify the resulting competitive advantage as their gain from taking that approach.  On the other hand, companies which are slow to embark on green enterprise would perhaps see financial savings through reduced energy costs as a reason for embarking on change in this regard.  It is clear from the Irish profile that if we want to generate that type of innovation within the agricultural sector, then legislators must send out clear signals and devise clear targets.</p><p>  On the specifics, there is great potential in the area of anaerobic digestion, for example.  There is also a good opportunity in terms of diversifying the output of our agricultural sector, which would mean less of an emphasis on grass-based animals.  I am hopeful that our strong agricultural sector, the backbone of the Irish economy, will, if given clear leadership, rise to the challenge of reducing our emissions.  I realise there is great fear and concern about the changes that are required.  None of us wants to change.  Anybody who gives up smoking knows the challenge of change.  We must have supportive structures and legislative clarity to assist people in making the transition.  I believe agriculture can rise to the challenge.</p></speech>

She is correct that we have not included the issue of compensation for loss and damage in our submission, but we did not set out to cover everything.  The principle of climate justice has been signed up to not just by development organisations but also by the Government, most recently by the T&aacute;naiste at the Dublin conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice.  That undertaking has implications, one of them being a requirement to honour commitments to developing countries to assist them in adapting to the changing climate.  To that end, we would like to see climate justice set out as one of the guiding principles of the Bill, together with a commitment to policy coherence across the Government.  These are the principles which should be guiding the development of climate policy.  Policy coherence is important to ensure that Ireland's emissions are not undermining the development work of Irish Aid and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

Where do the delegates see the benefits from the Bill?  What is positive about it from their perspective?  We are in a progressive minority in Europe in embarking on this process.  While some states, including Austria, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom, have legislated in respect of climate change, many others have failed to take any action.  Will the delegates guide us through the aspects of the Bill they see as representing progress, as opposed to the current position where there is an absence of any legislation?</p><p>  What is the witnesses' view on the proposed climate change commission?  We have looked at the model of the Fiscal Advisory Council, which is a robust and respected body comprising an august group of wise and independent heads formed to advise the Government on fiscal policy.  It is a welcome innovation.  However, in one case, where it made recommendations to Government on front-loading deficit reduction, its advice was ignored.  This was the correct decision, in my view, because of the social cost that would arise from following its recommendation.</p> <p>That was one instance in which the council's advice was not taken because of the impact on broader policy.  Where would the delegates stand in a situation where an advisory body on climate change, mirroring some of the functions of the Fiscal Advisory Council, had one of its recommendations rejected by the Minister, whether in this or future Executives, simply because it did not fit with his or her policy direction or preferences?</p></speech>

In fact, some of my preconceptions have been challenged through the course of the discussion.  </p><p>  The delegates referred in their submission to legally binding targets.  I agree that there must be such an element.  After all, legislation which is not robust is meaningless.  It is one of the reasons I favoured the automatic inclusion of our commitments under international agreements, as set out in head 3.  This will ensure the 2020 target and what is negotiated in 2015 will have a legislative basis, which will enable everybody to see the direction in which we are moving.  The example of the IBRC was given.  Agreement in that regard was negotiated and subsequently transposed into Irish legislation.  There is also the constitutional argument which I can appreciate, that inclusion of the targets will mean that they cannot be challenged by international agreements.</p><p>  We have the 2020 target and will also arrive, through negotiation, at a target for 2030, another for 2050 and so on.  I am in favour of a strong independent committee overseeing action on climate change.  The Fiscal Advisory Council model is a good one; the notion that a recommendation is given to the Minister and must be published within ten days, etc.  We should be using that type of language in the Bill.  The Minister would then respond to the recommendation, indicating, where he or she did not propose to implement it, why that decision was being made.  This will ensure transparency and clarity on whether we are moving in the right direction.  I am a little concerned, however, by the delegates' proposal that we should aim for a higher reduction target of 80% to 95%.  We have already discussed the possibility that we may initially see emissions rising before subsequently beginning to fall drastically.  Will the delegates comment on this?</p><p>  An issue that has jumped out at me from the submission is that the target of a 20% reduction by 2020 is based on the 2005 baseline.  The delegates, however, are talking about a 20% reduction below the 1990 level.  Taking into account the current economic climate, how do they see us achieving an even more onerous target for 2020?  We must be realistic and seek to devise targets we can actually achieve.  As it is, we are not on target for 2020.  It will take a great deal of work for the Government and the next one to hit the target for which we have already signed up, but the delegates are recommending it be increased by referring to the 1990 figure rather than the one from 2005.  What effect do they see for the broader economy in striving to meet that more onerous target?  Have they taken account of the potential shock?</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with this because it is part of democracy.  In any such circumstance the Minister will have to explain to the Houses of the Oireachtas why the decision was taken to take a different path.  The council would be fulfilling its function and the Minister would be responding accordingly, as is his or her mandate.  I do not foresee an issue in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy's question about the positives in the Bill, as proposed, is a good one.  A criticism that could be levelled at NGOs is that we are always pointing to the weaknesses rather than the strengths of Government efforts.  I suppose it is our job to do so.  The process which led to the development of the heads of the Bill has been useful because it is has been participatory.  It is a template that should perhaps be repeated in other areas.  We now have a statement of intent from the Government, as reflected in the Title in the Bill.  That in itself is something because it places efforts in this area within a legal framework.  It will be of use to citizens in the years to come.  What is most important is the big picture.  There are elements of the proposed expert advisory board, as it is described, which are positive.  We believe it does not go far enough, but it is a broadly positive proposal.</p></speech>

Each of those proposals included elements of what good legislation would look like.  Our view is that the proposals we are discussing fall short of what is required.  There are positive aspects of the previous proposals which we would like to see included in this Bill.  The major positive we would see is that something is actually being done.</p><p>  Regarding legally binding targets and how they are included in the Bill, the approach being taken stands out to me as essentially a means of building a compliance strategy into legislation.  However, for a climate action Bill to be genuinely effective, it requires more than compliance.  We must move beyond compliance to a targeted approach which facilitates innovation and the competitive advantage to which Irish agriculture and enterprise can aspire.</p><p>  In terms of specific targets, anybody concerned with definitions in this area, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, would say a low-carbon economy was one which achieved an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050.  The notion of a longer term target is not new.  As I said in reference to the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank bonds, for instance, we do reach out those distances to give ourselves direction and focus.  The Bill would certainly be strengthened by the inclusion of that type of commitment, as well as the compliance targets, as Deputy Kevin Humphreys suggests, for 2020, 2030 and so on which are negotiated under future agreements.  All of that is very helpful and the two processes are not in any way exclusive of each other.</p></speech>

In fact, we are reeling as a consequence of several, largely external, factors which have impacted on us greatly.  Climate change will follow a very similar story if we do not make ourselves indigenously resilient to the shocks coming down the line.  The interesting aspect of climate change is that we can actually see these shocks before they hit.  Our agriculture, industrial and residential sectors - the economy at large, in fact - will be under significant threat in 2030, 2050, 2060 and beyond.</p> <p>In a way, whereas there will be a shock and business must adapt to it, respond and find competitive advantage, in a way we need to manage those shocks.  The Bill should be seen as something other than a challenge.  That comes back to leadership, which I cannot emphasise strongly enough, and political leadership is essential to the process.  That is why parties such as the Labour Party, which I see as a progressive voice in Irish society, have a responsibility to show leadership on the issue.</p></speech>

We are looking at our part in the process.  It is a technical matter as to where we take a reference but ultimately the purpose of the Bill is to achieve a reduction in our emissions in the long term.  We are looking to achieve a low-carbon society, which in our view would be an economy with an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050.</p></speech>
