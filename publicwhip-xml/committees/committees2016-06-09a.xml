Apologies have been received from Deputy Dooley.  I draw members' attention to the need to switch mobile phones off completely or put them in airplane mode.  This morning we are considering the draft report for a reasoned opinion and motion on COM (2016) 198, proposal regarding a directive on the disclosure of income tax.  At our meeting yesterday, the committee agreed that a breach of subsidiarity had arisen in this regard and agreed to send a reasoned opinion to the EU institutions on that basis.  We are meeting today to consider and approve the draft report for a reasoned opinion and a motion to be sent to the D&aacute;il on COM (2016) 198 for approval.  These documents were circulated to members in advance and I propose we go into private session to consider them.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p></speech>

The committee has agreed a report for a reasoned opinion and a motion, proposal for a directive of the European Parliament to the Council amending directive 2013/34 regarding disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches.  In accordance with Standing Orders, the report for the reasoned opinion will be laid before the Houses and forwarded by way of an agreed motion to the D&aacute;il for approval, upon which the reasoned opinion will be transmitted to the EU institutions.
