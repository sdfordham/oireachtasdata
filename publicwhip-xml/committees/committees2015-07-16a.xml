We begin today's hearings with Mr. Paul Gallagher, former Attorney General.  I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearings of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.</p><p>At this morning's sessions we'll focus upon the legal advice given to the Government during the crisis period.  At our first session we will hear from former Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher.  Paul Gallagher was Attorney General of Ireland during the period of 2007 to 2011.  Mr. Gallagher's appearance here today has been facilitated by a decision of the Government to waive legal privilege in respect of his oral evidence to this inquiry, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the important mandate of this committee to inquire into the financial crisis.  This of course cannot be interpreted as encroaching on the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, which cannot be waived by the Cabinet.  In addition, the waiver does not extend to discussion of legal advice that could prejudice any litigation pending or anticipated regarding matters the committee may seek to inquire into.  Mr. Gallagher, you're very welcome before the committee this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these are documents and that they are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Gallagher please.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#C00400"><p>Thank you.  Chairman and members of the committee, I am here to assist the committee in any way I can and to address any questions which the committee may have.  The committee will be aware that as Attorney General, under Article 30 of the Constitution, my role was to advise the Government in matters of law and legal opinion and it may be helpful to the committee to know that prior to my appearance here today, I have spent some considerable time in preparing for the appearance and I have also reviewed the core documents which the committee has furnished to me.  I don't intend reading my statement, which I prepared for the assistance of the committee unless of course the committee would like me to do so, it's admitted into evidence and the committee have it.  There are, however, a number of matters which I mention in the statement and which, with the committee's permission, I would like to mention before commencing my evidence.</p> <p>  I served as Attorney General between June 2007 and March 2011.</p><p>During two and a half of those years, Ireland experienced an unprecedented financial and economic crisis.  And one of the defining features of that crisis - and, of course, there were many - was that Ireland truly stood alone throughout that period.  It had the sympathy and goodwill of other countries but, ultimately, it had to rely on its own resources to find its own solutions to the crisis.  And I think that may be an obvious point but, I think, it is frequently overlooked and it is an important lesson of the crisis.  My abiding memory, at critical times during those years, is the sense of Ireland's isolation.  Much was expected of Ireland.  It was required to save its banks and it was required to use its own resources to do so.  Ireland had to make its own decisions and to do the best it could it the circumstances.  On the night of the decision to avail of the bailout - the Cabinet meeting of 20 November 2010 - it was very apparent that Ireland, again, was very much on its own.  Ireland's isolation was encapsulated in President Trichet's letter of 19 November and in Minister Lenihan's journey to Brussels on 21 November.</p><p> So far as the guarantee is concerned in the events of that night, I address that in my statement.  Subsequent to the night of the guarantee, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 - referred to as CIFS - which was initiated in the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 September, was enacted by 2 October and this legislation empowered the Minister to provide the guarantee.  The proposed guarantee scheme was notified to the European Commission in accordance with Ireland's state aid obligations under the EC treaty and the European Commission approved the guarantee, as being necessary to remedy a serious economic disturbance in Ireland, on 13 October 2008.  On 15 October 2008 the guarantee scheme was published by the Government and it was formally approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 October.  On 20 October it was introduced by way of statutory instrument and that set out the terms and conditions on which the participating institutions could benefit from the guarantee.  On 29 October the Minister, by statutory instrument, specified the banks covered by the guarantee scheme.  And the Act, and the statutory instruments made thereunder, provided the legal basis for the guarantee.  On 8 December 2009 the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme was introduced, having been approved by the Oireachtas.  This refined the instruments that were covered by the guarantee, it ... guarantee no longer covered asset-backed securities or dated subordinated debt.  The ELG scheme was extended in 2010, 2011, and 2012, until 20 December 2013.  It ended on 28 March 2013 for any new liabilities but, as I say, continued to cover liabilities until 30 December 2013.  Any new liabilities, as and from December 2009, were covered under this eligible guarantee scheme rather than the earlier CIF scheme - that continued in existence to continue the guarantee in respect of instruments that were issued prior to the coming into force of the eligible guarantee ... liabilities guarantee scheme.</p><p> As I comment in my statement, I believe it may be of interest to the committee to note the response of other countries and the European institutions to the crisis as I think it provides both a legal context and an understanding of some of the difficulties which arose.  I don't believe this has been addressed by any other witness in any detail - but I may be incorrect - but there were very significant developments, particularly at a European level, subsequent to October 2008, and the committee may consider those relevant to its inquiry, and, in particular, relevant to the issue which it has to consider as to the relevant structures and measures that might assist in avoiding a recurrence of a crisis of this nature.</p><p>In my statement to the committee I also touch on the fact that the European legal architecture, which was provided for in the Maastricht treaty and which set up the European Monetary Union, was significantly lacking in important respects.  Control of money matters and, in particular, money supply rested with the ECB.  However, the legal responsibility for each member state's financial system rested with that state.  Interest rates were set by the ECB having regard to the overall situation in Europe and not by reference to the individual situation of any member state.  The ECB, in discharging its function, was always very concerned and of course rightly concerned of its legal obligations and legal constraints and, in particular, to have a necessary legal base for its actions.  Each state, however, was at the time individually in control of, and responsible for, its banking system.  What is called supervision and resolution was the exclusive responsibility of member states and that position did not alter until 2013 when the ECB adopted a role provided for in Article 127 of the treaty, that is, the role of supervision of financial institutions.  Article 127 empowered the ECB to contribute to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the stability of the financial system and the delay in the introduction of this supervision and supervisory regime is partly explained by a concern on the part of many that combining monetary policy and supervision created unavoidable conflicts of interest.<br/><br/>It was not until 2014 that a single resolution mechanism and a single resolution fund was set up, and the delay there arose because of the concern of the lack of any explicit legal basis in the treaty for such a role.  In between, the European Banking Authority was set up towards the end of 2010 and it was designed to increase the transparency of the financial system and also to identify weaknesses in banks' capital structures.  And the European Systemic Risk Board was also set up in late 2010 and it had responsibility for the macro-surveillance of the financial sector in the EU.  Perhaps of particular interest to the committee is the fact that it was not until 2014 that the banking recovery and resolution directive was introduced at a European level.  The benefit of that directive is that it provided a sound legal footing for resolution actions which have very considerable and financial implications and which as a consequence can create uncertainties and systemic instability.  An EU-wide structure for banking resolution provides an <i>ex ante</i>structure for dealing with troubled banks.  This is important because it removes uncertainties and reduces the basis for legal challenge.  Markets recognise and expect that these actions will be taken and that limits the contagion effects of actions that might be taken.  And the introduction of that important measure, I think it's worth nothing, was six years after the commencement of the great recession.  The recitals to that directive explicitly state and recognise that the financial crisis had shown that there was a significant lack of adequate tools at Union level to deal effectively with unsound or failing credit institutions.  It says the financial crisis was of systemic dimensions in the sense that it affected areas ... or it affected access to funding of a large proportion of credit institutions.  So that provides a very brief overview of the system as it was in 2008 and subsequently, and I am happy to address any questions if the committee thinks that that may be of help in its deliberations.<br/><br/>Before speaking on other topics, I wonder if I could be permitted by the committee because I think it is both important and fair to refer to it.  And it's a matter I touch upon in my statement and that is the performance and commitment of the civil servants with whom I worked closely during the crisis.  I think it is important because they are part of the institutions of the State and I think it's fair because so many of them worked so hard to find solutions to the crisis.  In particular, I mentioned the people involved in the Department of Finance with whom I had much contact in relation to legal issues arising from the financial crisis and those people have given evidence, I think, before you, Chairman and members of the committee, and also the people in my own office, which includes the Chief State Solicitor's office.  And coming from the private sector I had the opportunity, I suppose, of a look at their performance from a different perspective.</p><p>And I think it is important to say, in a context that was so difficult and created so many difficulties for everybody, that their performance was of an extremely high standard; that I never met people who wouldn't make decisions, who were afraid of making decisions, who said, "This isn't my job" and I didn't meet people who weren't prepared to do their very best for Ireland.  And that was, for me, a remarkable feature and my abiding memory of my period in office.</p><p> As I understand the Government's waiver, Chairman and members of the committee, in relation to my evidence, it's been agreed, as you have said, that, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the very important mandate of the committee, that legal privilege should be waived, so far as my oral evidence goes, and that I am relieved from my professional duty to respect the confidentiality of the client which extends to confidential information entrusted to me by the client in the course of my ... in the discharge of my obligations and I'm also relieved from the obligation to protect legal privilege.  That is subject to one qualification that you have identified and that relates to the continuing obligation not to prejudice any existing or anticipated litigation.  Subject to that, my ... I just want to note that my written statement, as the committee will appreciate, respected the obligations of confidentiality and legal, professional privilege.  I'm now released from those obligations in that way.  I'm permitted to answer any question which the committee might like to pose to me and I will do so.  Thank you very much, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#F00300"><p>Good morning, Mr. Gallagher.  Mr. Gallagher, you refer there to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, enacted by the Oireachtas on 2 October 2008.  Can you recall when work commenced in the Attorney General's office on the legal provisions which eventually became enshrined in that and, just to put it in context for you, I refer to a scoping document dated 24 January 2008 within the Department of Finance.  The paper is called Financial Stability Issues - Scoping Paper, beginning to scope out the issues of crisis that are beginning to emerge and, under "Urgent Next Steps", it says, "Seek legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General as a matter of urgency on the legal issues highlighted in this paper."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#F00400"><p>Yes.  I think, in fairness to the Department, Deputy, they contacted my office on 30 November 2007 and raised a number of legal issues that are then referred to in this scoping document which I believe, but subject to correction, was January 2008.  I think the committee will also have seen what I might call ... not spreadsheets, but slides, where various issues were identified with regard to the challenges that existed and those slides, I'm not sure precisely what date they came into existence, but they noticed that there were legal challenges and legal issues but no legal impediments ultimately.  Between 30 November 2007 and 29 September 2008, the Department was in constant contact with my office, looking at possibilities, identifying different options.  I believe that it was on 16 June 2008 that there was a particular emphasis on producing the necessary legislation that would provide legal options that included, Deputy, in particular, nationalisation legislation and also the provision of a legislative basis for any guarantee that might have to be offered in respect of any institution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00100"><p>Okay.  And referring to those very slides, Mr. Gallagher, there were some from February '08 and then a further presentation - all this has been in evidence previously but we don't need to take the time to put it up.  I just want to ask you one thing in relation to that ... in this ... that the February slide said, &quot;open-ended [...] State guarantees [exposing] the Exchequer to the [...] the [...] significant [fiscal risk] are <i>not</i>regarded as part of the toolkit for successful crisis management and resolution&quot;.  But then, come February, there is added ... or sorry, come April, there is added, &quot;there are circumstances where such guarantees may be unavoidable to maintain confidence in the overall financial system.&quot;  That's the first time that this is mentioned in this way.  Can you throw any light on that development of thinking in the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00200"><p>Well, my information came from the briefing documents from the Department and originally, it is true to say, Deputy, that the focus was on individual institutions.  As 2008 progressed - and, particularly, I think, by April, 2008 - there was a concern with regard to systemic risks across the financial system. I think as and from that date but, more particularly, later and in August and September, there was a preparation for the possibility that a guarantee might have to extend beyond the individual institution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00300"><p>Okay.  And, Mr. Gallagher, can we fast forward then the night of the guarantee in September 2008?  And the evidence from the senior bank executives, who were in and out of meetings in Government Buildings, is that they brought a draft guarantee on the night.  And Mr. Gleeson's evidence is, to quote, "we furnished our draft guarantee [...] to the Government at [a] very early session."  And Mr. Cardiff, who was a senior executive in the Department of Finance, recalls working on a draft guarantee.  Can you throw any light on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00400"><p>My specific recollection, Deputy, and I want to be very careful in relation to this, is set out in my statement.  I can't be certain of every detail.  That, to the best of my recollection, is true in the sense that the instruments that might require to be covered by a guarantee were part of what the banks brought to the meeting.  So, an identification of the particular instruments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00500"><p>And, Mr. Gleeson, or Mr. Gallagher, sorry, Mr. Gleeson, to quote him again, he makes that point but then ... and he says, "This formula was eventually adopted later in the night pretty well word for word".  And what I want to put to you, Mr. Gallagher ... if it's extraordinary, or not, that you, perhaps, and the Government wouldn't be coming with written formulas in relation to what needed to be done rather than the banks coming in and presenting their agenda and that being then worked on by Government officials?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00600"><p>Well, Deputy, if I may answer that.  Firstly, I was asked to come to a meeting that evening late in the afternoon ... that the banks were coming in to meet with the Government.  Obviously, it was apparent something serious was going to occur but not what precisely occurred.  Secondly, the Department of Finance had given very careful consideration to the guarantee.  That had been carefully considered.  What Mr. Gleeson is referring to are the specific instruments, the technical description of what needed to be covered.  In relation to that, both the Department of Finance and the Governor had the specific expertise with regard to the type of instrument that need to be covered.  The banks had their view on what needed to be covered.  There was an interaction with the banks and their views were considered and taken into account.  But I want to make one thing very clear.  The interaction with the banks were that they were invited into the meeting, they were asked certain questions, they were given an opportunity to say certain things.  Very appropriately, in my view, they were then asked to leave.  And anything said by the banks was carefully and independently considered by what I might call "the Government team".</p><p>And any decision that was made with regard to what should be covered was made, as I set out in my statement, after very careful consideration as to what the Government thought was necessary to address what was described by Governor Hurley as the real possibility of a meltdown of the financial system. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#H00200"><p>And, Mr. Gallagher, do you remember having sight of that document or having the document in your hand that the banks said they brought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#H00300"><p>I don't precisely remember that.  I'm sure I did see it but I certainly remember drafts that were prepared by Mr. Cardiff.  And I think the Taoiseach drew the distinction between what's called the guarantee and the statement.  What was being prepared was a statement, which was identifying the instruments that would be covered and the Government's position, and there were various drafts of that, and I certainly looked at that.  And one of the things I was particularly concerned about, Deputy, was to ensure that that statement made clear to everybody when it was ... that this was going to be subject to terms and conditions, because that was a vital protection for the State that any guarantee of any instruments was to be subject to the terms and conditions, and those terms and conditions were, ultimately, set out in the scheme that was approved by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I think there was ... the Government was in the difficult position that the statement it issued the following day before the markets opened had to be very careful and very precise and it had to achieve the objective which was desired to be met, namely to protect the banks.  It, therefore, had to ... and you'll see it's a very measured statement, because it didn't want to create uncertainty; it didn't want to create a lack of confidence in the very banks that were being guaranteed.  And, yet, there was a concern not to say anything that might have market implications and that was a very fine line that had to be tread and I think that the ultimate statement that was issued actually achieved that very difficult objective.</p></speech>

You state in your opening statement that president Trichet of the European Central Bank "had evidently made it clear that the Government should stand behind its banks, and that the banks were the State's responsibility".  Do you remember being advised of the rationale given to you to accept the position of Mr. Trichet?</p></speech>

Under the treaties, the member states had the sole responsibility to protect their banks.  The ECB had no function and couldn't legally step in to protect the banks, but I think the significance of what president Trichet was saying was it was unambiguous - "You are on your own; you must save your banks", and that is the position.  I also make clear in my statement that the Taoiseach and, I believe, also Minister Lenihan questioned that and interrogated that and asked: "Is there any prospect of a European solution, a European measure?"  And they were explicitly told that while ECOFIN was meeting, I think, two days later, that there were no proposals before ECOFIN to address it.  Governor Hurley was also meeting with the governing body of the ECB in a few days and there were no proposals.</p><p>So one thing was clear: the ECB and Europe were not going to do anything to resolve the issues that faced the Government that night and the responsibility was solely on the Government to make the decision that it thought appropriate to address the crisis.</p></speech>

Can you throw a little light then on what happened subsequently?  We had evidence yesterday from Mr. Corrigan of the National ... formerly of the National Treasury Management Agency writing to the Minister for Finance in November 2010 at a later stage outlining &euro;20 billion and &euro;12 billion tranches of various kinds of debt which he felt that an aggressive approach should be taken to reducing that liability.  So did the Government decide of its own volition not to introduce burden sharing or was there pressure from the European institutions?</p></speech>

On the basis of the information which I saw, as of 30 September 2010 when the guarantee expired, very careful and serious consideration was given at that stage by the Government to, if I may use the phrase, "burning" the unguaranteed senior bonds.  And my recollection is, and I think evidence has been given to this effect, was the NTMA weighed up the consequences of doing that.  This, as you know, coincided with the decision in October 2008 of the NTMA to step back from the bond market and cease to attempt to raise further funding for the State.  The decision was taken that the benefits that might be achieved from burning those bondholders at that stage could well be outweighed, and would probably be outweighed, by the disadvantages in terms of the continued funding of the State.  There was also obviously a continuing concern about contagion effects as to what it would mean for funding of the banks but it was really the funding of the State.  That changed dramatically at the time of the bailout.</p></speech>

On the other hand then, Mr. Gallagher, you said it wasn't a legal or constitutional impediment.  You had these other considerations and pressure from Europe.  But what was your reflection on putting a &euro;64 billion burden of bad bank debts onto the shoulders of the Irish people, taxpayers and the consequences of austerity and so forth that flow from that?</p></speech>

My role as a legal adviser was not to make a policy decision in that regard.  But one thing just has to be understood, because I think it has become part of the narrative and I think it is fundamentally wrong.  And that is that decisions were made to save the banks.  Well in my interaction with Government, it wasn't about saving the banks, it was about saving the financial system.  And the calculation had to be made as to what would have been the consequences for the people if the financial system collapsed - that was the decision.</p> <p>  And when it came to the bailout the Government was determined to burn the bondholders.  And in fact I wrote to Mr. Lenihan, Minister Lenihan, on 29 November when I was finalising what is called the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act and I said, "We can include in that Act a provision to burn the senior bondholders but I understand that the troika have forbidden that."  I said, "Nevertheless the position might change and we are dealing with the burning of the subordinated bondholders and one thing, if you would like I can include is I can emphasise in that Act the protection of the deposit holders."  Because the idea was to burn the bondholders and protect the deposit holders.  And in the recitals to that Act, or the preamble, we emphasised that for Ireland, a core objective was to protect the deposit holders. And that was to begin the creation of legal structures that if the position changed with the troika, we could then introduce specific legislation to burn the bondholders.</p> <p>  Now, it would be foolish and misleading to suggest that that wouldn't give rise to legal difficulties; it would.</p><p>We considered those very carefully, and indeed, post the bailout, I had various meetings to look at that.  I had meetings also with IMF representatives and specialist lawyers to consider that and we confirmed repeatedly that that could be done in legal terms, notwithstanding the legal difficulties, and it depended solely of the approval of the troika to doing that, and that as you know was prohibited and was a condition of the bailout.</p></speech>

Just before I bring in Deputy O'Donnell, just on a related matter with the timeframe being earlier, Mr. Gallagher, you state in your own opening statement that "President Trichet had evidently made it clear that the Government should stand behind its banks, and that the banks were the State's responsibility."  Can I ask you please to advise the rationale given to you to accept the position as, as said of Mr. Trichet?</p></speech>

The European Court rejected that but the one thing the ECB could not do is bail out the banks and the provisions of the treaty were interpreted, actually as preventing other member states doing so.  There was a change in perspective and further legal solutions were sought in 2010, precipitated by the Greek financial ... sovereign debt crisis.</p></speech>

So far as the consequences for the sovereign were concerned, that was a matter for the financial and economic experts in the NTMA to advise, the documents that I've seen recorded the realisation on the part of the Government that of course that had implications for the sovereign.  Because, if you had to provide moneys to save the financial system, those moneys had to be either borrowed or raised and that had consequences.</p></speech>

I think the significance of what President Trichet said, is that he was making it clear that while it was a matter for the Government to do that, the Government shouldn't let any bank fail.  I think that was the significance, that you shouldn't let a bank fail, the responsibility for saving is yours, that was something the Government already knew.  But the emphasis was, don't let a bank fail because if a bank fails, nobody can predict the consequences and the contagion effect.  I think that was the significance Chairman.</p></speech>

The other was could the Minister consult with the Central Bank to ensure that it provided it, if it wasn't going to provide it.  The other matter that was looked at from an early stage was the possibility of nationalisation of a failing institution.  The other matter that was referred to was a private sector solution.  And I think one thing that does need to be clarified is the Department of Finance and the Government were very concerned, if at all possible, to get a private sector solution which meant getting somebody else to take over a weakened solution from the private sector so that the taxpayer would not be at risk.  Those were critical issues that were looked at.  In that context they had to look at the competition issues because if you had to take over an institution suddenly, you had to ensure that you got competition approval.  That was being very carefully looked at.</p></speech>

But, Deputy, I make clear in my - and I think it's important to address this - I make clear in my statement burden-sharing was not a feature of the legal system of any of the European countries at that stage.  The United Kingdom brought in burden-sharing in 2009, Germany in 2010, Spain in 2012, France in 2013, and, most importantly of all, Europe in 2014.  Secondly, bailing in involves a failure of the bank, so you start bailing in because you say the bank is going to fail.  That, of course, creates huge issues of contagion and systemic risk; it's not a thing that is lightly done, and, even now, it is an issue that creates difficulties.</p></speech>

The purpose of that was to provide legal advice to the Government on the state aid.  My concern was to marshal all of the facts that needed to be provided to the Commission to get state aid, which was a very serious legal concern.  And those facts involved the basis for the decision - what were the concerns the Government had to address, why this was necessary ... because remember, to get state aid approval, and none of this could have been brought into law, you had to satisfy the Commission that the decision and the measure was necessary.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02200"><p>Yes.  So, this was the position.  The position changed, I don't know what was brought to the meeting.  I arrived at the meeting late, as I made clear.  Before I arrived, there was a discussion of the worsening situation.  I wasn't there for that but I quickly picked up on what was said because much of it was repeated and I have recorded in my statement what was repeated and what was said.  And I think it's very clear from my statement, the position had now changed.  It was quite clear to everybody that a guarantee of deposits was not going to avert the risk of what was likely to happen the following day.  The best advice available to the Government was that the guarantee that was offered was the minimum that could be done and what was said is  "We're not sure this will actually save the financial system.  So, if you don't get it right and you put something more limited, then you're facing into a situation where the collapse has started and it may be too late to do anything".  Secondly, Deputy, the guarantee was extended subsequently after review in 2009 and it always covered senior bonds and the reason was, this was a liquidity crisis and the purpose was, not just to protect the depositors that you might do when the banks are about to collapse to make sure the depositors, it was to get liquidity into the banks to keep the banks going.  Because the view that was taken was that if Ireland, with a sophisticated and developed economy, didn't have a financial system, that the economic position would be worse.  And there's a remark in my statement that was seared in my memory and that is Governor Hurley said, and I remember this, "If this is not done, Ireland's economy will go back 25 years."  And he said that because it was clear to anybody there, that what was being said was if you have a collapse in the financial system, how do you ever pick that up?  You don't pick it up again and the whole trading and commerce of the country fails.  And I want to be very fair to Governor Hurley because everybody says Governor Hurley advised and he did advise.  Firstly, he was there and he was prepared to make a decision and he was prepared to give advice.  He had come back from being sick and that's a matter of record, I don't want to talk about his personal circumstances, but he was there and he was unstinting and fearless and clear.  And he gave very clear and unambiguous advice to the Government and the Government was told the economy will go back 25 years, this is the best you can do.  I don't think any government or any politician ever wanted to have to be faced with a decision like that or have to make it and politicians don't necessarily have the skills to, I think, well, don't have necessarily the economic skills and financial skills.  So that's how it came from a deposit to that, Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02400"><p>Just on the night of the guarantee, it's reported that the Minister for Finance, then the late Brian Lenihan, and Kevin Cardiff were in favour of nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Was that the case and was there any legal impediment to the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide on the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02500"><p>There was no legal impediment and I think as the committee have heard, we had the legislation ready to go.  That was the case and I think what was interesting and what was important is that the decision arrived at was made after considering the various options and everybody was listened to.  I wasn't privy, as I make clear in my statement, to discussions that took place between the Taoiseach and Minister Lenihan privately.  I remained in the Taoiseach's, I think, conference room or consultation room throughout.  I went out for various bits and pieces but I never got involved in any of the political discussions.  So, I can't enlighten the committee any more in relation to that.  But Minister Lenihan never said to me that he was overruled and a decision was made after considering all of the options.  Nationalisation was one of them and I think I outlined in my statement why it was considered that was not the route to go.  Sorry, Chairman, thank you.</p></speech>

Just two matters before I move on to the other questioners.  In earlier engagement with Deputy O'Donnell, you spoke about notes on the meeting of the night of the guarantee.  If possible and if legally permissible, can you provide the inquiry with any contemporary notes of this meeting, which you did not record as legal advice sought or given to you?</p></speech>

Just one other item as well, Mr. Gallagher, earlier this morning when we discussing matters with you, you stated that in June, the draft legislation - this is the nationalisation legislation - was redirected to cover more than one ailing bank.</p></speech>

This would seem to coincide with the NTMA's refusal to put deposits into Irish banks and can I ask you to comment was this cognisant of that fact or was that just a coincidence and what was your contact over this period directly or indirectly with the NTMA?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N03500"><p>Okay.  Firstly, what happened on 16 June was they said go ahead and draft.  It was still focused on a particular bank because that's what you would do with nationalisation legislation.  Secondly, I would have had no direct contact at any stage with the NTMA, their contact was with Finance, we get our instructions from Finance.  Thirdly, the issue in relation to putting deposits in banks, I think, was somewhat earlier, if I recollect what Dr. Somers said.  I think it was in late December 2007 and I think that then continued to that period, so far as I'm aware and certainly wasn't aware at the time there was any connection between the two, Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Gallagher, the memorandum from Merrill Lynch dated Sunday, 28 September - was your office requested or asked to assess the options that were outlined in that in terms of legal impediments or was it a piece of paper that just appeared along with other ones?</p></speech>

My office had already advised, which is the way it's done, that the various options are put forward to see if there is a legal impediment and we had advised there wasn't a legal impediment.  So that wasn't furnished to me to advise in relation to that.</p></speech>

It wouldn't have been my concern as to which bank was asking for it and I wasn't involved.  We said there is no legal impediment to the Central Bank providing ELA.  Of course, in providing ELA, as you know, it is subject to the statute of the ECB.  There are ... I think it's Article 14 ... imposes limitations under the circumstances which ELA ... but in principle, so far as the Irish legislation was concerned, this ... it would permit the Central Bank to provide ELA.</p></speech>

But of course, banks are different because ... that's why you have emergency liquidity.  There are times when banks need liquidity to meet their obligations.  Their assets at a balance sheet level make them solvent but that's why you have emergency liquidity for the very purpose and that is given to solvent banks.</p></speech>

We are not concerned with the policy as to whether it's good or bad.  But it says, ''Here are the issues, can we do this legally?''

That was raised at a very early stage, whether if a guarantee had to be given, it could be done under the State Guarantees Act 1954.  The advice was unambiguous, it could not be done, so that enabled specific guarantees in respect of scheduled bodies and in any event, this was of a different nature than what was envisaged by the Act and it was made clear that would require a separate and independent legal basis.  The Department accepted that, knew that and we had that ready to go on the night of the guarantee.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Gallagher and you made the point very strongly about Europe leaving Ireland on its own and so on and indeed, a currency that had been circulated since 1999, only in 2013 was Article 127 of the treaty implemented.  Did that propose particular legal challenges for Ireland in ... it was a dangerous area, certainly and that ... did we discard the policies and mechanisms and laws that had ensured there were no bank failures from 1783, Grattan's Parliament and Bank of Ireland, right up to 1999, when this new currency started?</p></speech>

So your options for resolving a crisis and a systemic crisis in particular are greatly reduced.  That was a big deficit in the legal architecture.  My understanding of the architecture was it was designed to address situations where Government deficits and Government profligacy in managing the economy would result in threats to the financial system and that was catered for under the excessive deficit procedure.  But they hadn't addressed this and this is, as is now very apparent, was a very significant restriction in the legal architecture.</p></speech>

The countries were very ... and you have seen one of the reasons it took 'til 2013 for the single supervisory mechanism was that countries were reluctant to pass over the supervision of their financial system to an EU body, the ECB.  And secondly, with regard to the resolution, there was very serious political concern.  So I think it was known but I'm not sure there was the willingness to address it and I think that there may have been a failure of imagination because I don't believe that people really envisaged the sort of situation that did in fact arise here and throughout Europe and the United States in September 2008.</p></speech>

And I think those are very interesting.  I think you have already heard that Prime Minister Brown was on and he was very annoyed, I think because they said this ... they were all worried about its effectiveness, in other words, that it would be so effective it would take deposits from their banks into Ireland.  And this was said at a time when the UK, unknown to us at the time, put in I think something like &pound;30 billion into RBS and was putting a huge amount of money into HBOS.  So every country was taking steps and that wasn't announced at the time.  So while they were complaining about Ireland taking steps to protect its financial system, they were busily off doing it and it wasn't announced.  So there was a concern in relation to that.</p><p>The EU Commissioner, Ms Kroes, was concerned about its competition effects, and that for me was a real concern of ensuring that we could convince the Commission that this was consistent with the state aid provisions and wasn't anti-competitive. And fortunately we were able to do that within a very short period of time, by 13 October.  So while other countries were giving out ... you'll remember that the G7 meeting, I think, took place in early October and following that there was an announcement that all countries were going to stand behind their banks.  Chancellor Merkel announced it.  They announced it in France and they announced it in Denmark. </p></speech>

It was introduced in the Oireachtas on 30 October.  We just went ahead and finalised that.  One of the things that we were very concerned about was to ensure that it was watertight and in particular that it terminated as of the end of September 2010 and didn't extend beyond what was intended at that time.  And that was prepared and went ahead, and we also went ahead with our submission to the European authorities.</p></speech>

After all, if they're presenting the State with this huge burden, could the State not take it on on its terms?  And I'd be concerned about how much the cost escalated from what we thought at the beginning to the eventual.</p></speech>

I suppose there's two things to bear in mind.  Firstly, the guarantee did provide very significant conditions with regard to the commercial activities of the bank and for the public interest directors.  And of course that ensured that other banks didn't regard - that didn't need help - didn't regard the guarantees as desirable.  You heard evidence that various other banks were looking to be included in it, but the conditions were tough and they were stringent, which made it non-attractive.</p> <p>  Secondly, the issue as presented was that before the markets opened you had to have a solution.  Thirdly, people talk about the &euro;64 billion hole but, as the committee has heard, that no matter what investigation had been done by the banks, wouldn't have been apparent on 30 September.  The extent of the losses increased over time, as I think some of the witnesses have said, because you not only had the liquidity issue but you had the great recession which continued far longer.  The market disappeared.  You then had the valuations in NAMA.  And you had a series of attempts to get to the bottom of the hole but the hole was deepening the whole time.  I think Mr. Corrigan graphically described it as a "falling knife".  So at a point in time that wasn't the deficit.</p></speech>

Were there never any documents or would they have been removed between the guarantee and the time that NAMA took them over?</p></speech>

Nut, I mean, I think as NAMA said one of the problems was a lot of the security documents were just never there.  They weren't in place, they hadn't been properly signed off and that of course had a big impact on the value of the assets NAMA was purchasing.  And that is part of the explanation for the larger haircut than was anticipated.</p></speech>

I ... the Minister asked me one evening to come to a meeting with Ulster Bank, who were trying to be included, but they weren't.  And one of the decisions the Government took, and it's provided for of course in the legislation, that if a bank had the basis of support from its parent, as Ulster Bank had, there was no way the Irish State was going to provide the guarantee.</p></speech>

You go back then on 20 October, the guarantee scheme was introduced by way of statutory instrument and three days before that the guarantee scheme was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and prior to that the legislation that allowed for a scheme to be introduced was approved, about two weeks before that.  So can you tell me, when the banks signed up to the scheme, the deed, the deeds, which was the 24th, which was in between the scheme being introduced by way of statutory instrument and the Government specifying the banks, was the assets of the banks and liabilities of the banks guaranteed at that stage?</p></speech>

The Act provided that provided that financial support could be provided individually or through a scheme.   The Government opted for a scheme.  That was approved.  And to avail of the scheme you had to become a participating institution.  And to be a participating institution you had to be designated.  So that's when the legal effect of the scheme-----</p></speech>

So just to clarify that now, the ... we understand that the institutions signed the deed of acceptance on the 24th and returned it to the Department as such.  Would that have been when they were legally covered by the guarantee?  I know it took a ... it was backdated but that's the day that they were legally bound.

So what possibly could happen in terms of law if the Minister decided in that four weeks that, "Look, I think this is a bad idea, there may be more loan losses", or whatever, and decided we're not proceeding with that?  Would the banks have a call, given that the Government made a commitment, a political commitment to introduce this?</p></speech>

I suppose what you would have is you'd have people who lent money perhaps making claims against the Government on the basis they did so on foot of representations.  But more particularly I think the issue always was what would be the effect on the financial system.  And for a Government to renege on what was clearly a statement intended to quieten the markets would have had very serious consequences and presumably, though it's not a matter for me to say, the very consequences that were sought to be avoided on the night of the guarantee.</p></speech>

How confident are you, given the earlier testimony, that we could have ... the State could have, under law, protected depositors while at the same time burning senior bondholders?</p></speech>

And the reason was that it wasn't a legal issue about burning, because of course they didn't want to burn the senior creditors, they wanted the senior creditors to provide liquidity to the banking system.  So that wasn't an issue at all.</p><p>What was made clear, consistently, is that if you wanted to differentiate between and senior creditors and the depositors, you would have to change the law.  That was not without complication, but I believed it could have been done.  Interestingly, when the Europeans brought in, what is now the legal obligation, in the 2004 directive, they don't distinguish between the depositors and senior creditors, as such.  The eligible deposits are protected, but depositors and senior creditors, as such, are not differentiated against, and the critical limitation on burning there was that nobody should be worse off than they would be in a liquidation situation.</p></speech>

Can I ask you, in relation to the night of the guarantee and your attendance at that meeting, you talk about, in your statement, in relation to, on page 8, "There was a basis for the concern that the fact that the six Irish domestic banks were perceived by the market as having a very significant and, in some cases, enormous property exposure and consequently were perceived to carry a very high bad debt risk."

There was, of course, the realisation that if you give a guarantee, you have an exposure.  But the belief was that these banks were solvent.  It was hoped that this would solve the liquidity situation, and it was hoped that there wouldn't be a call on the guarantee.  But, of course, that risk couldn't be excluded.</p></speech>

And, therefore, the focus was very much on ensuring that we got state aid approval, because this was absolutely vital.  But it wasn't a legal issue, as such, that would have arisen if it hadn't been approved, but a very serious policy issue would have arisen at that stage.</p></speech>

And, if the financial system of a developed economy like Ireland, so dependent on financial transactions and investment, collapsed, then you are back to the 1980s.  That was how I understood it, and, I assume everybody else understood it in that way, but I remember it because it was such a bleak and unforgiving picture.</p></speech>

That's what it conveyed to me, and in my mind, whether accurately or not, I had the picture of the 1980s and a different Ireland because, without a financial system ... and also, I think ... I don't think it was explicitly said, but I think everybody had a very serious image in their mind of social cohesion.  If the financial system were to break down, was society going to survive this?  And, I don't think anybody stated that; I don't think it needed to be stated.  You had very experienced people there.  That's, I think, the image that people had.</p></speech>

Otherwise, if any one of those defaulted, the group couldn't let a subsidiary default because that would ultimately ... might well result in a default for the group, but, certainly, would pose an enormous risk for the group.  So, I think that followed.</p></speech>

And, therefore, if they are effectively supporting banks that should have been supported by the State, that is equivalent to monetary financing.  That was a very big issue in relation to Anglo and the whole resolution of the promissory note issue, and the very beneficial deal that was, ultimately, achieved by this Government in relation to the promissory notes and the replacement with the government bonds.  So, legally, he was absolutely correct.</p></speech>

I suppose it's the huge question ... it's a matter for Government, but, I suspect most governments would say, "We don't actually gamble with our country's fortunes", and it would have been an extraordinary step, I would have thought, but that's for others to judge, it's not a legal matter, to say, "We'll call your bluff".  And, the difficulty - and I do mention this ... I mentioned it today - the ECB was concerned, and very understandably and rightly concerned, of the legal constraints.  And, if it took a legal view it couldn't do it, and we see an example in relation to Greece at the moment, whether they could continue ELA no matter what the consequences.  So, I think the Government decided that's a bluff, if it is a bluff, that we won't call.  But, that's what was at stake.</p></speech>

I mean, if ELA was withdrawn, all of the banks were gone so you were back to the same situation.  So it's a very big bet and my experience of dealing with the institutions  - and I dealt with them in the Lisbon treaty and the guarantees - they take a very legalistic view and the other countries ...  and this is why I said you have countries sympathetic to Ireland saying Ireland is a great country and you've done very well, but every one of them will, ultimately, look after their own interests and they are not people that can be easily beaten down in negotiations.  Every country is looking after its own interest.  There is the Community spirit and the Union spirit and that will be adhered to.  And I think that's all very positive but, at the end of the day, in critical matters, they will look after their own interests and that is certainly the position with the ESB because I had a subsequent involvement for another client in relation to dealing with ECB - and I do not want to say anything for client confidentiality - and my experience of the ECB is they took the legal situation enormously seriously, as they were bound to do, no matter what the consequences.</p></speech>

Why was a different timeframe not put on it?</p></speech>

That was teased out very, very carefully.  There was considerable concern in giving a guarantee for two years and six months was mooted, a year was mooted.  And, as I explain in my statement, a judgment call was made because they were told and the banks were also ... about this said, "We have to reassure the money markets and we're not sure a shorter guarantee will do."  In the event, it transpired, even when the position was known with much better clarity regarding the losses in the banks, this guarantee was, ultimately, extended to December 2013, albeit with a narrower focus with regard to the instruments to be covered.</p></speech>

I'm not sure I would agree with that, Chairman, in the sense that that seems to me ... whenever you stop the guarantee, if you just leave it there, you will have a funding cliff, unless everything has righted itself.  Everything hadn't righted itself but, as of middle of 2009, as you know, legislation was brought in to enable the period to be extended.  As of December 2009, you had the ELG; 2010 they extended the period; 2011; 2013.  So the fact that the funding would stop as of September 2010 was anticipated far in advance and measures were put in place to ensure a continuation of funding.  And, in fact, the CIFS scheme itself, as you heard, was extended I think until December, and the application for that was made in good time, so measures were taken to avoid the funding cliff.</p></speech>

If Anglo was just left to go bust on the night and was kept outside of the guarantee, what would the legal considerations have been?  Would this have been very, very complex, very, very messy or would it have been, "Here's a legislation; let's make it happen"?</p></speech>

And one of the things that was apparent from the information given to the Government by the other banks was the other banks were distinguishing between Anglo and INBS and themselves and understandably so.  But the report that they gave us of the reactions from the money markets was Ireland was untouchable.  And if you have one bank go, given what was known as the over-exposure to property, the ready consequence I assume - and others are better positioned to advise on this - was they'd say, "These other banks have huge exposure to property.  There may be distinctions but we're not convinced and the whole lot goes."  And that was the calculation made with regard to Lehman Brothers and it went so badly wrong and I think there was a huge fear that if that gamble is taken, that things would just be out of control.  And those are the judgments that have to be made and were made.</p></speech>

Can I just clarify one thing?  The ... it's often stated that the guarantee was a &euro;440 billion guarantee.  The Nyberg report, on page 77, gives a breakdown of the guarantee.  The guarantee was &euro;375 billion.  Is that your understanding as well?</p></speech>

There was a very careful consideration as to whether that was appropriate.  There would have been a desire not to include it, if that were possible.  And in the end a judgment was made if we omit that, is that going to impair the effectiveness of the guarantee?  There's also, I've seen subsequently but I didn't see it, the e-mail which the committee has seen from Mr. McDonagh, I think on 6 October, explaining why it was important to have that included.  But I don't remember that particular consideration being raised that night.  My recollection is it went more to the effectiveness of the guarantee and people understanding what was included, and also this was a method of providing funding for the banks.  That's my understanding.</p></speech>

The issue of the promissory notes for Anglo Irish Bank.  To what extent was the sovereign fully standing behind those promissory notes?  Would they have had the same legal standing as sovereign bonds, for example?  Can you just give us a legal perspective on the status of those promissory notes?</p></speech>

The State was the obligor under the promissory notes and, therefore, they were the equivalent, in my view, as bonds.  I think the reason why they were chosen was - and I think the committee have heard this - it enabled capital to be put in, on a staged basis, to the banks.  It provided the banks with the necessary injection of capital but the cost would be met on a staged basis and that was what was behind it.</p></speech>

If, on the night of the guarantee, there was knowledge that ... that a bank had essentially failed and the decision was made to just let it go, in the absence of specific legislation, a bank would just then have been liquidated under the Companies Acts in the normal way.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has to be informed in advance of an application.</p></speech>

So just going back to that issue of special resolution legislation and, as you said, there are different types of resolutions and some resolution-type options were available on the night of the guarantee.  But the scenario I want to raise is if ... if a decision had been reached that a bank had essentially failed and instead of having a disorderly wind-up of a bank ... just collapsing the following day, that the decision was to have an orderly wind-down of that bank, what legislation would have been used in that scenario - that if you wanted to, let's say, let Anglo go, but in an orderly way and in a way in which we will seek to separate the depositors from the senior bondholders, to give preference to depositors and bail in other creditors such as senior bondholders?</p></speech>

The law at that stage was they ranked equally but I don't think that was even impinging on people's consideration because the view was taken - and governor Trichet had said "Save the banks" - and the view was taken that any wind-down, orderly or otherwise, would have a contagion effect that might not be capable of being controlled.</p></speech>

But that was never put as a proposal and they were never told that there was a legal impediment to doing so and, as I say, even as of today there are legal issues surrounding that.  I believe, ultimately, those legal issues can be overcome but, in fact, the 2014 directive explicitly refers to the legal issues and refers ... because the charter, the European Charter and the European Convention of Human Rights create similar problems to our Constitution.  So the constitutional issues, if I can put it that way, are recognised at a European level.</p></speech>

And the effect of that, if I can just clarify, because, I think, Mr. Corrigan said correctly that, in fact, most of them were bailed in through liquidity management exercises, but it was the fact that the legislation was there which enabled the State to bail them in, that encouraged them to accept voluntarily, as part of the liquidity management exercise, a very substantial writing down of their entitlements.  There was only one case where the Act had to be used.  That was in the case of AIB.  There was a legal challenge.  That was compromised -I don't want to say the detail of it - but on a very satisfactory basis for the State.  So it was the existence of the powers and the tools that were critical.</p></speech>

And, very finally, you said that the ECB had the power and the right to withdraw ELA support for the Irish banks.  But when you saw the letter of 19 November 2010 to Minister Lenihan, when the ECB linked the continuation of ELA to the introduction of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, financial sector restructuring, did you have any concern that in making that link between ELA and issues that would be perhaps outside the mandate of the ECB, that it had extended its reach too far?</p></speech>

I don't believe so for this reason: as you know, when the ECB subsequently introduced the outright monetary transactions, in ... I think it was 2013, which had a great effect on stabilising the markets, what saved them from legal challenge - and the European Court has pronounced on it recently - is the conditionality that is involved.  So, in other words, the ECB said "We will continue to lend to you but you must put your house in order and you must agree to fiscal conditions to set the legal basis, otherwise it'll be monetary financing".  And that has been the consistent position of the ECB and ... from day 1-----</p></speech>

Good morning still, Mr. Gallagher.  I've a few brief questions.  Most of what I wish to ask has been asked already.  In response to Senator Barrett earlier you said that because Ireland didn't have huge resources, it needed to give a legal guarantee to make it credible.  Do you accept the view that some people would hold that, ultimately, perhaps because of the nature of the guarantee, that the markets passed a judgment on it that it ultimately was incredible?</p></speech>

I think it lost its credibility over a period of time.  I think it did and I think - this has already been identified by other witnesses - as problems emerged in the banks and as it was clear that it was difficult to get to the bottom of what the deficit was ... so while there's uncertainty as to what the deficit is, there is uncertainty in the markets and they became very concerned about the contingent liability of the State on foot of the guarantee.  But the point I wanted to make was, it seems to me ... and, again, it's the financial experts whose views on this matter but if you are Germany, you have enormous resources, you can pout &euro;50 billion into the banks.  And I think it announced - Germany - a &euro;500 billion package for its banks very shortly afterwards.  The UK did the same in terms of its support of its banks and it was in a different position, it was outside the euro.  Ireland wasn't in that position.</p></speech>

I can't ask, perhaps, a leading question ... but ... of the guarantee, that the nature of it was such ... and the failure on the night to have full information as to the possible exposures in most of the institutions, or certainly a couple of them, meant that the liability opened on the sovereign was such that the markets deemed that it was incredible?  Did you ... what I really want to ask is, did you offer, on the night, a view as to an investigation that should be carried out immediately into the exposure that possibly the sovereign was being opened up to by the nature of the terms of the guarantee, as agreed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.325" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#U03600"><p>Firstly, I think the Merrill Lynch report, which you have seen, made it clear to everybody that there was the exposure of the sovereign.  So that was well known.  Secondly, the Government was in the position ... it had to make a decision on the basis of the information that was available and the advice was "You can't postpone this decision."  And, as I say, the Taoiseach repeatedly asked: "Is it possible to defer this - not to make a decision?", and was told "No."   But it's not just the guarantee.  Anything that I've read subsequently ... and, indeed, the whole structures that have now been introduced for bank resolution are to deal with the fact that even those countries that didn't give a guarantee, because they ultimately had to save their banks and put the money in, the whole banking crisis is regarded as a strain on the sovereign.</p><p>So, even if you haven't given a guarantee, if you have a banking crisis, the markets know you must solve that because I may be wrong in this and the committee will know better but I'm not aware of any country that allowed, in this period, a systemic bank to fail and therefore so far as the markets are concerned, you're behind your banks.  If your banks are in trouble - that's what happened in Spain - that impinges on the sovereign and then the cost of borrowing goes up.  So unfortunately, you're presented with a difficulty that the banks are in a mess.  It has to be addressed and ultimately the cost to the sovereign is unavoidable.</p></speech>

They have given ... several members of the NTMA have given evidence to the inquiry that they had serious concerns and wouldn't have gone down the route of the guarantee which was ultimately chosen.  Did you inform the meeting that perhaps that evidence should be directly given rather than through a third party?</p></speech>

Governor Hurley understood it, the Taoiseach was a very experienced Minister, Minister for Finance, he could not but have known it.  I think it was obvious to everybody that that was a risk and I think the judgment was made, whether right or wrong, that this is the best ... I think somebody has said the least worst option.</p></speech>

Briefly I want to turn to a book that was published by former Green Party Member of the Oireachtas, Dan Boyle, where he issued ... levelled a number of criticisms at ... indirectly, I suppose, and perhaps directly at yourself in your role in the Government which you were Attorney General.  The book was called <i>Without Power or Glory: The Greens in Government, </i>2007-2011'.  One of the quotes I want to put to you-----</p></speech>

Were you aware at the time that you were viewed by a component part of the Government as an obstacle?</p></speech>

When I was alerted by a member of the press that Mr. Boyle was going to say this, I contacted Mr. ... Minister ... Mr. Ryan, as he was then, to say that I was very surprised by that and he assured me it was not so.  In the publication in <i>The Irish Times</i>commenting on the book, it specifically said that senior Green Party sources said this was not the case.  I take the greatest of exception to that, because I prided, above all, my independence.  I had no political connection and have no political connection.  I've never been a member of the party and I didn't know what constituency any member of the Government was from.  So I took the gravest exception and I gave, I believe equally, but I'm happy to be judged by Minister Gormley when he came in, whatever assistance I could to every party to try and assist them with the legal solution to problems that arose.</p></speech>

I won't go any more into that particular publication.  Paragraph 58 was referred to by Deputy Higgins earlier, of your opening statement, where you said that there was no "constitutional impediment to introducing [further] legislative measures to provide for further burden-sharing".  Was your opinion ever sought on the introduction of legislation to impose burden-sharing on senior bondholders and if so, when was it first sought and by whom?</p></speech>

It came to the fore again, as I said, at the time of the bailout and on 29 November 2010 I confirmed in writing it could be done.  It wasn't done in the meantime, I think, because of the NTMA view.  I had meetings with IMF people and I think that I should make clear to the committee my understanding of the IMF, and certainly the people I met, they were very much in favour of it and thought it was appropriate.  That is, the people at the lower lever, there were obviously people, different people, but they were very supportive and took the view Ireland needed to do this because of the debt burden.  I had meetings again in February before I left office and we went through what could be done.  Doing that, of course, is a very specialist exercise and we had our own ideas but we also had the benefit of a specialist lawyer, whose name I cannot remember, that the IMF very helpfully sent over to meet me, who had done a lot of debt restructuring and his services were available to us as to how that might best be done so as to avoid legal challenge.</p></speech>

So the NTMA, certainly, and their reputation is such that they would have had a very great understanding of that.  Whether anybody else had a better understanding, I don't know.  People in Finance who would have been interacting with them and who would have been involved in this would have had a good knowledge, as would of course Governor Hurley, because one of the functions of the ECB was financial stability so they would all have an understanding of these matters.</p></speech>

It wouldn't surprise me and it was a prudent thing.  If an issue arose on which assistance was required that hadn't already been addressed, then they were readily available to Government.  That frequently arises, people are asked to be available so if some unexpected issue arises.  So far as the issue of their opposition to our preference for nationalisation was concerned, and concern about the sovereign rating, that, I believe, was well known and is recorded in the Merrill Lynch report.  So I assume, but this is only an assumption because I didn't know they were out there, that people believed they had the information, understood that, that was clearly inputted into the decision that was made, taken account of, and as I said, had to be balanced and a judgment made.</p></speech>

Thank you.  The markets had come to a position in relation to the liquidity in relation to Irish banks.  The Morgan Kelly theory is that it wasn't anything to do with the US sub-prime, or the freezing of the liquidity markets, that it was a matter that the markets had decided that the exposure to property, in particular commercial real estate, that the Irish balance sheets of financial institutions were compromised.</p></speech>

What is a documented fact in anything that I've read is that the money markets froze after Lehman.  Nobody was prepared to invest.  So you look at Ireland and you say "There is a problem there, they are overexposed to property."  So you're not going to invest anywhere and you're certainly not going to invest in Ireland so I don't think they're incompatible.</p></speech>

The deposit guarantee scheme went from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000, a fivefold increase.  Was there over-exuberance in terms of the attempts to deal with matters?  Very few deposit guarantee schemes were increased by fivefold internationally.  And then, just to follow on from that is, was there an over-exuberance in relation to banking, in relation to guaranteeing everything: bonds, deposits etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#V02600"><p>Firstly, I don't remember being involved because obviously it was a policy decision in raising the guarantee.  But I do know that one of the concerns following Northern Rock was that the existing scheme went to &euro;20,000 and 90% of your deposit, and I think it may be in some of the documents.  When depositors see that they're going to get 90% not 100%, well somebody says it's rational to queue outside banks.  So you don't want to lose your 10%, so you queue.  So one of the things was the guarantee was increased from 90% to 100% of the limit.  The other view that was taken and in fact, if anything, it seems to me to show foresight, because as of 2009 the EU brought in a directive, and I mentioned this, increasing the cover to &euro;100,000 throughout Europe.  Admittedly, that wasn't to take effect for a while because it's the form of directives that they don't take effect for a while, 2010.  The view was taken that, because there had been some queues outside banks, I think it's been mentioned there was a media issue and queues had been forming and I think there was a real concern.  Even Dr. Somers said the one thing you don't want to see is a queue outside the bank, so you try and stop that.</p><p>I certainly, going on to the night of the guarantee, didn't witness exuberance of any sort over ... or any type whatsoever.  They were people, so far as I could see looking on, that were being faced with a decision that nobody wanted to be there to have to make and the options were explored, very careful consideration was given to those options, and so far as I could see, a judgment was made on what is the least worst option, on the basis of a fear of what might happen the following day.  They may have been right or wrong, but that was what they face.  And, in a sense, we'll never know, because nothing happened the following day, but if the guarantee hadn't been given, who can predict what was said, and what I say in my notice, we were told that New York Stock Exchange was expecting the markets in Dublin wouldn't open.  Now, if there's a run on the shares of the banks, that effects the shareholders, but as soon as anybody sees that run, it's all over the media and nobody is going to do anything other than queue outside a bank and try and pull their money out because if the shares are tanking, then the bank is about to collapse.  So that's what was at issue, but there was certainly no sign of exuberance that I saw; far from it.  I think what was impressive was people remained calm in what was a crisis situation and worked through the options.</p></speech>

I think there were two issues there.  Some people said, "You shouldn't have guaranteed existing indebtedness", and a view can be taken in relation to that, but I'm not sure where that gets you because even if you don't guarantee it, when that indebtedness - and these were all short term, as I understand it, in any event - so if you didn't guarantee the existing indebtedness and next Friday, the debt accrued and became due and had to be paid, well then the bank had to pay it.  And if it didn't, that was the problem.  And can I just say as well, I'm not clear, but I would defer to experts, that any other country had to deal with a challenge to its entire domestic financial system.</p></speech>

A view had to be taken as to whether that level of differentiation was being made by the markets, and, as I say, from what they told us, that wasn't the case.  That's a judgment call.</p></speech>

I would be surprised if the ECB were purporting to advise us on what was or was not constitutional.  It was quite clear to me from any interaction I had with Minister Lenihan that the objection was not a legal objection, that the objection was that they were afraid of the contagion of the markets.

What was the concern?</p></speech>

That was a matter for the politicians as to whether they said they were in negotiations or not.  But I know there was a concern to protect whatever leverage there was.  It was felt that if we said, "We're in negotiations", then you're just there for the taking, you can't negotiate anymore, you've said you're going in and they set the conditions.  And Minister Lenihan told me that there was very considerable pressure for Ireland to forego its tax rate, and the view was taken that, not only was this wrong but the economic revival that the package or the bailout was meant to encourage would itself be undermined, if Ireland had to forego it's autonomy over that.  That was a very real issue, as I understood it.</p></speech>

They couldn't affect it but people saw this as an opportunity, "You want a bailout, you need a bailout, and we're going to impose this as a condition."

I think some of the major countries that have been giving out, if I could say about that, for a long time.  And if you go back to the record, I think quite a number of countries, including, I believe, Germany ... but I don't want to say because I can't remember now which countries, and I don't want to create any storm that anybody had any particular animus.

My understanding was the view was taken by Minister Lenihan and the Taoiseach, that if you say, "Yes, we're now entering negotiations for a bailout.", whatever little leverage - and you've very little leverage in that situation - was gone.

So when it comes to then ... January-February 2011, and the agreement that was already in place for the capital injections in the banks, is it a straightforward thing for the Minister to say, "I'm going to wait until the new Government comes in", or did that have to be renegotiated under the MOU?</p></speech>

You could talk to them and, indeed, changes were subsequently made.  I think the important thing was: you communicated with them, you maintained there trust and support which was vital.

I mean, I think we're aware with the higher level details, like, for example, that ... sale of State assets, half the proceeds would be used to pay off the debt, you know, trying to find lower costs in the legal services, for example, but one requirement I was interested in, was the requirement in the programme for "an economic analysis of the potential impact on competition and consumer prices, of eliminating or relaxing the floor space cap on retail premises".

One was I was told IMF was insisting on a priority.  I couldn't see that in the IMF rules.  We had a conversation late on that Saturday night, on 20 November, about 2 o'clock, with the chief counsel of the IMF, a Mr. O'Hagan, and he explained it wasn't anywhere explicit but that's how the IMF dealt with the matter.  And the other issue that I did raise was whether there should be included, or whether there would be agreement to include, what's called a "most favoured nation clause" dealing with interest.  Because there was concern the interest rates were high.  A most favoured nation clause would mean that if anybody else got a lower interest rate, because the Portugal bailout was something that night happen, we would automatically benefit from that.  That had been explored, it was refused but I think you've already been told that there was, at least, an expectation that an improvement would be achieved on the interest rates but they were ... wouldn't put that clause in.</p></speech>

And an example of such would be what legal action could the ECB or Commission have taken against Ireland if we had decided to burn bondholders or let a bank like Anglo go bust?</p></speech>

They may have complained under, I think, it's title 8 of the treaty where each member state is obliged to contribute to financial stability, but, ultimately, they couldn't, in my view, have taken legal action.  Certainly it wasn't an issue that was raised for me to advise on, but my best understanding is they couldn't have.</p></speech>

The concern of the Government was quite clear to me.  It had nothing to do with protecting the industries.</p><p>The view was taken, whether rightly or wrongly - and it's for others to judge - that this was a very important aspect of Ireland's economic recovery.  That's how it was expressed to me ... that if you do anything to interfere with foreign direct investment, you are postponing the recovery for everybody's benefit.  And that was the only consideration I was aware of and no moral issue arose that I knew.</p></speech>

Do you believe it's a good idea to make monumental decisions in the middle of the night?</p></speech>

The possibility and alternative of not making that decision was explored fully by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and the advice was, it wasn't possible to delay the decision.  I heard what Dr. Somers said in that regard.  I mean, that's correct in so far as it goes.  Nobody does want to make those decisions but there are times - and I've experienced it in other, far less significant situations - where the decision has to be made.  That was the position.</p></speech>

I notice there was a meeting of the ECB the following day, on 1 October - in your statement, page 6 - if &euro;10 billion was being provided by the banks effectively to fund a liquidity position of Anglo, if the decision had been taken to basically cover that liquidity position, and Governor Honohan had brought up the issue in the ECB meeting the following day, was there any legal impediment to the ECB assisting Ireland in a solution to deal with Anglo and the banking crisis?</p></speech>

I think Governor Hurley said that.  But I do want to make things clear: resolution legislation was available.  When you talk about an orderly wind-down, an orderly wind-down involves a liquidation.  It was quite clear to everybody that you couldn't take the risk of winding down a bank in whatever fashion.  That was absolutely clear.  And nobody was prepared to take that risk because of the consequences for other banks.  It was as simple as that.  And all of the banks were regarded as being exposed to property ... you see one bank winding down and the concern was that, within a matter of hours if not days, that would be the position of all of the banks.  And, as I said, the unique position was you had the six domestic banks - our whole domestic financial system - under threat.  That, to my knowledge, was quite unique and certainly that demanded an approach that addressed the threat to the financial system.  And that's the decision that was taken.</p></speech>

I did mention, in an article that I wrote for the book on Minister Lenihan, that, as of 23 December 2010, we went over to the Merrion Hotel, and it is something remarkable ... I was constrained in what I could say in the book because of the obligation of confidentiality, but here was a man under the stress and the clear knowledge of what the future had for him, and there was only one thing that concerned him: and that was making sure that the legislation that was required to meet the bailout obligations was enacted before the Government fell.  And, in a sense, it's relevant to what Deputy Murphy said, there was that conscious ... that was the only thing that was on his mind.  And subsequent to that, I wrote to the Taoiseach and copied it to the Cabinet, and asked that I get every assistance from all of the Departments to prepare for the incoming Government the legislation that was required to make sure that there was no breach of those obligations because of the consequences Deputy Murphy has identified.  And I got full support from the Taoiseach and the Ministers in getting that prepared.  And I think that was something that was very important.</p></speech>

Or maybe timing was an issue, but we were ... that bouncing wouldn't be a fair reflection of what actually happened?</p></speech>

And when we're talking about burning bondholders, it's important to remember that they were talking about burning bondholders in the future and the effect on the cost of borrowing rocketed.  I think that set the seal for the bailout   I think it was probably then a matter of time.  I think the Government was trying not to be bounced into it by saying, "Yes, we're applying for it" because then, as I said, you're locked in but that was the situation.  But, so far as I could see, that was what was of concern at the time and those are the matters that immediately precipitated ... of course, you can't isolate, Chairman, as the committee will know far better than I do, any one factor.  There was all of these factors coming together.</p></speech>

The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session, and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  At this session we will focus again on the legal advice given to the Government during the crisis period.  I would like to welcome two witnesses from Arthur Cox limited firm, Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Mr. Eugene McCague.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is ... was managing partner of Arthur Cox from 2003 to 2011.  He led the Arthur Cox team which advised the Irish Government on the Irish banking crisis.  Eugene McCague is a partner with Arthur Cox since 1988, he served as managing partner from 1999 to 2003, and served as chairman of the board of Arthur Cox from 2006 to 2013.  The witnesses' appearance here today has been facilitated by a decision of the Government to waive legal privilege in respect of their oral evidence to this inquiry, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the important mandate of this committee to inquire into the financial crisis.  The waiver is limited to advices relating to the bank guarantee provided to the Government during September and October '08.  In addition, the waiver does not extend to discussion of legal advice that could prejudice any litigation pending or anticipated regarding matters the committee may seek to inquire into.  Before hearing from the witnesses, I wish to advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  And I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning, and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  If I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to both Mr. McCague and Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.</p></speech>

I would like to start by giving an overview of Arthur Cox's role in addressing the issues which arose in the banking sector.  Arthur Cox was engaged by the Department of Finance on the morning of Wednesday, 24 September 2008, to advise in respect of the emerging banking crisis.  Prior to that I had no involvement in the banking crisis and was not aware of its depth.  I understand that the Department contacted me as it was familiar with my role ... with my work, through my role as chairman of the financial legislation advisory forum, which I had undertaken at the Department's request on a <i>pro bono</i>basis from 2007.  I led the Arthur Cox team throughout this period.  Arthur Cox was engaged to act as external corporate legal adviser to the Department and its agencies.  In executing our role we worked closely with the Department, the NTMA, the Office of the Attorney General, as well as other Department advisers, including Merrill Lynch, PwC, and later, Rothschild.<br/><br/>Over the seven years since the onset of the crisis, Arthur Cox's role has included advising on and helping manage legal risks relating to the State following the guarantee, assisting the Department of Finance and its agencies to map out the legal landscape applicable to the banking sector, undertaking legal due diligence exercises in respect of a number of the banks which the State was supporting, identifying legal obstacles and risks, as well as potential solutions to them in policy under development by the Department, contributing to the design of legislation being prepared by the Office of the Attorney General, helping execute policy decisions by legally implementing banking sector transactions and undertaking the High Court applications required to effect Government policy, working with the Department to satisfy the requirements of external agencies such as EC Directorate General for Competition, and finally, defending the State in litigation taken against it arising out of the execution of its policy.  The legal work required to perform this role was uniquely complex and extensive, with each legal action or solution integrally connected with all others over the years of the crisis.  In summary, Arthur Cox's job was to help design the legal architecture required to support policy decisions made by Government, and then help provide the legal engineering required to implement those decisions.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the crisis, in 2008, in common with many European countries, the Irish Government had available to it no specifically designed legal infrastructure or powers currently in law to intervene in, or resolve, banks in financial difficulty.  Indeed, EU-wide legislation dealing with bank recovery and resolution has only been implemented this year, in 2015.  As a consequence, this legal infrastructure had to be built, often under intense time pressure, from the ground up, as the crisis progressed.  This was a very extensive and complicated exercise, combining statutory, contractual and judicial avenues with the major milestones being the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013.<br/><br/>The common threads running through all of the work in the design and implementation of the required legal infrastructure were to enable the Government to take the actions it deemed necessary to ensure financial stability, while observing the legal integrity of the banks and their stakeholders, and ensuring the central objective that there be no default by any of the banks in relation to any of their obligations which could impact the guarantee.  Any default by the banks, even inadvertent, could have triggered cross-defaults on their financial instruments, leading to a failure of a bank and a call on the guarantee.  This risk became most pronounced in the first half of 2011, when the banking sector was substantially reorganised in accordance with the troika programme.  Each action taken by the State, therefore, had to be robustly designed to implement policy measures, legally and effectively, while ensuring banker sector ... banking sector stability.  This was legally challenging in circumstances in which the State was required to intervene strongly to maintain financial stability, even where that required the alteration of other stakeholders' rights.  The legal solutions adopted by the State in response to issues caused by the banking crisis navigated a narrow path demarcated by the Constitution, European law, IFSRA, which was later the Central Bank, and banking regulation generally, ECB requirements, stock exchange rules and the EU Commission's Directorate General for Competition, as well, of course, as the legal rights of depositors, bondholders, shareholders, derivative counterparties, bank boards and employees.  These solutions had to legally optimise the position of the State, comply with the requirements of the troika programme from 2011 onwards and take into account the responses of rating agencies and sovereign bond markets.  Over the period of our engagement, more than 120 Arthur Cox lawyers in total worked for the Department and its agencies on this crisis, with specialist teams required in corporate, litigation, capital markets, finance, financial regulation and insolvency-restructuring.<br/><br/>The direction I've received from the committee directs me to provide evidence on 13 lines of inquiry relating to themes of crisis management system and policy response and regulatory, supervisory and Government.  I look forward to answering your questions on these themes, following Mr. McCague's opening statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman,</p></speech>

So, with both opening remarks made, I now invite Senator Marc MacSharry to open the questioning today.  Senator, you have 25 minutes.</p></speech>

Thanks for being here today.  Can I ask, first of all, as former chairman, this is Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, of the legislative advisory forum, can you comment on the extent to which Irish financial regulation policy was geared towards the development of the IFSC and do you believe this in any way compromised the regulation that would otherwise have been put in place in respect of domestic banks?</p></speech>

We didn't really look at that ... in fact, we didn't have any brief to look at the policy or the direction of any of that; it was actually just nearly an administrative exercise to consolidate what was already there so it would be hard for me to comment on the bigger picture in terms of the overall policy and direction.</p></speech>

In terms of the purpose of that, whether that was just directed at IFSC I would say that ... just as an observer. I would say that was an element of the regulatory response at the time but how much it was a core or essential feature of policy as that was communicated to the Central Bank, I don't know, but, certainly, if you look at the contrast between then, which is light touch, and now, which is quite different from that, I think you do see that contrast.</p></speech>

As I think I explained in my written statement, I only arrived to the meeting shortly before the representatives of Bank of Ireland and AIB came into the room.  So I suppose the first people I heard expressing their concerns were those representatives, and it was absolutely evident from them, and you've heard this evidence yourselves, that they were extremely concerned about Anglo and the contagion effect of Anglo.</p></speech>

Sequentially, they were the first people I heard expressing concerns.  They were extremely concerned.  They had ... I recall Mr. Gleeson of AIB making the point that if the share price in Anglo the following day when the markets opened fell anything like it had fallen that day, that there was a serious risk that people would take that as a proxy for deposits and that there would be people queuing outside the Irish banks so they had a very serious concern about that.  They wanted the nationalisation of those two institutions.  I think they used the phrase, "taken out", or some such phrase but it was clear that it was nationalisation they were talking about.  I don't recall them actually using the words ,"These institutions are insolvent", but my sense was that that was certainly the view that Mr. Gleeson was putting across in what he had to say and the liquidity issue was speaking for itself. And, indeed, they had their own concerns in relation to their own positions as a result.</p> <p>  When they left the room there was then a further discussion among the Government side, if you like, to call it that.  What was evident to me was that I was coming at the end of a long meeting, near the end of a long meeting, rather than at the beginning of a meeting, because it was quite clear that the Government representatives had been thrashing this out for a number of hours.  I mean, I was told the meeting had been going on for some hours beforehand and, therefore, this was ... the main focus was whether anything new had been learned from Bank of Ireland and AIB and I suppose what those banks had done was reaffirmed a position that was already known that it was a very serious crisis.</p> <p>  And I don't recall ... so the issue then really became do you nationalise Anglo and Irish nationwide or don't you?  By the time I was there, that had become the crux of the issue.  I don't recall anyone arguing the case that they were insolvent on the night.  I do recall Mr. Cardiff strongly argued the case for nationalisation.  I've read his statement, which you kindly sent me, and I recall that.  I don't know whether he based that on solvency but there was clearly concerns in relation to it.  And I recall that the most significant event of that next session was that the Taoiseach pulled the discussion together and said that he felt a decision needed to be made and he turned to the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Hurley.  In quite a formal fashion, he said, "Governor, as Taoiseach, I am entitled to rely on you for advice.  Is Anglo Irish Bank [I think probably also Nationwide, I remember Anglo] is it a liquidity issue or a solvency issue?", and the Governor was quite unequivocal that it was a liquidity issue.  And to some extent from that point on, the direction which the rest of the evening took, which I'm sure we will get to in due course, took its shape.  So I don't remember anyone making an assertion that either of the banks were insolvent but, certainly, the nationalisation of the argument was implying that to me.</p></speech>

Again yourself, if it's okay, what was the practice of the Department of Finance during September 2008, and subsequently, regarding the seeking of legal advice?  Did they seek legal opinion on all policy opinions being considered or on a specific policy option selected by them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene McCague" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#DD01100"><p>Sorry, I could deal with that for September and if you need, I'm sure P&aacute;draig could deal with it for subsequently.  In relation to September, I suppose the policy issues that were being considered were the ones that Merrill Lynch had laid out and they're in the document you sent.  And of those, we were asked to look at two of them.  We were looking clearly at the option of the legislation for the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  That was what my main, if not sole, focus over those days was, so we were certainly asked what were the legal issues in relation to that one.  And the other one was a lending scheme, an emergency liquidity scheme, a collateralised lending scheme.  It was called a secured lending scheme, I think, in the Merrill Lynch paper.  They were colleagues in Arthur Cox were asked to look at that and what were the legal issues on drafting on that.</p> <p>  In relation to the other issues on the Merrill Lynch paper, if I recall correctly, there was a good bank-bad bank option.  We were never asked to look at that but I think the Merrill Lynch paper itself specifies that that was a second stage solution, if you like.   And liquidation, we were certainly never asked to look at because it was a second stage one.  So that leaves the one, the option that was, ultimately, followed, which was the guarantee of the six institutions.  We weren't asked to give any advice on that prior to the decision being taken on the 30th.  I know P&aacute;draig and some of his colleagues did some work in relation to legislation after it.  We weren't asked for advice on that.  I should say that the Bill which we were drafting in relation to nationalisation did have a section in it which was giving the Minister very wide powers ... a wide power to give financial support to a credit institution and financial support included the word "guarantee" but that section would not have been adequate to deal with the type of blanket guarantee that was introduced on 30 September.  I just mention that because I think I saw when I was reading that either Mr. Beausang or Mr. Cardiff or one of those gentlemen had mentioned that there was a section in the legislation.  And there was, but it was dealing with just a broad power for the Minister to give financial support to institutions; it wasn't in relation to the guarantee.  So the short answer to that is we were asked to give advice on nationalisation and on a CLS scheme and we were not asked to give advice on any of the others.</p></speech>

To your knowledge ... well you said it wasn't and you were not asked to consider it, so I will rephrase it:  Would it have been legally possible to let Anglo and INBS fail and create a State bank by nationalising the other four?</p></speech>

I mean, the issue with nationalising institutions which are solvent ... I mean, it happens in countries like Venezuela and various other places but if you are in a constitutional democracy with a written constitution and with property rights and by nationalising, you're taking people's property rights away, you would face extraordinarily significant legal challenges but, in legal principle, you could introduce legislation to nationalise banks.</p></speech>

I think you probably know that.  It was based on the Northern Rock legislation, we were working on it over those days.  It was always said to us, from the first day we arrived, that this was contingency planning.  We were never given a date or we were never said, "This must be done."  It was contingency planning but that was what we were working on.  I don't think the legislation, of itself, to take your point, Senator, would have required a declaration that the bank was insolvent.  I'm merely making the point of the practical challenges of nationalising a solvent institution.</p></speech>

So, on the 24th, when you came in, it was about contingency planing.  I know we spoke briefly there about the night of the guarantee.  But did you have any sense when you were engaged on the 24th that, "Look, things are in a very, very grave situation and we expect to need to do something within a week, two weeks, a month, a year"?</p></speech>

I think that, on the morning, certainly, when we came in, we were asked to come in that morning at relatively short notice and we were briefed at the same time as Merrill Lynch was briefed.  And I have to say that I ... the briefing was quite shocking in relation to the position particularly of Anglo and INBS.  And therefore the potential knock-on impacts on the rest of the system, you know, were clear, but particularly on Anglo and INBS.  But at that stage again, as Eugene said, the timing as to how that would play out all depended on things like liquidity flows and all of that. And obviously the Central Bank would have had all of the information in respect of that and that was being monitored on a daily basis.  So it was very hard, when you saw the initial briefing, to predict exactly where this would go.</p></speech>

The banks, Senator, that we would have traditionally done most of that level were ... so let's call it board-level work, would have been Bank of Ireland.  From time to time, we would have done some work for EBS as well, I think, at the same type of level.  But I'm not that conscious that we had done that much in 2008.  So I think Bank of Ireland really would have been the bank.</p></speech>

How do legal firms, and indeed Arthur Cox, reconcile any potential for conflict of acting for the banks and, say, in the context of what we're talking about here, then also advising the Government on guarantee and other related issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#EE03300"><p>Well, the very first thing that we do is to see whether we're advising on the same issue, because if it's not on the same issue, then the issue doesn't arise so much. And then the priority always, obviously, is to inform both clients.  So, what you would do in those circumstances, you'd go to both clients - so in this case the Government, or the Department of Finance at least, and the Bank of Ireland - and explain to each of them what you're doing, how you're acting in relation to that and what the client actually wants of you.  And then if both clients, in those circumstances, agree that actually each of them is happy with that arrangement and the arrangements that are put in place to, you know, separate teams completely and preserve confidentiality and all those types of things, it's the client's decision then, or the client's choice, to go ahead on that basis.  I think, in the type of crisis that we had, Senator, every firm would have acted ... would have been acting for other banks, it's just the nature of it.  Because it would have been very difficult to provide the type of legal advice and expertise that the Department required if you'd never acted for any banks. So the inevitability would have been that any law firm would have been in a similar position.  Therefore the key is, well, how do you handle that conflict and the very first thing in relation to handling a conflict is, obviously, informing fully your clients and making sure that they're aware and letting them choose.</p></speech>

I think that, in general terms, if we had been advised to ... asked to advise on the guarantee, we certainly would have been qualified to act on the legal aspects of the guarantee.  And, you know, for example in the implementation of the guarantee afterwards, Senator, which happened in the first three weeks of October, where the statutory instrument that was ... that brought the guarantee into law was created, we were very involved in that.  So I think that bears out that, on the legal side, yes.  But I think there's ... and this comes back to a question you asked Eugene earlier as well, I think there's a very important distinction - certainly in terms of our role - between what the policy is, in terms of what you choose to do in terms of supporting the banking sector, and then the legal implementation of that.  And they're actually two fairly distinct points.</p></speech>

So on that week we ... we gave some advices in relation to the legislation itself because that was continually in development.  We did things like prepare step plans, for example, in relation to what ... how'd you practically ... what practical steps do you take if you do nationalise?  So what are the things you do one day 1?  And that's actually quite an extensive list.  We also did things like helped, you know, draft the expenditure memorandum.  All those types of things and also, as I said, contributed to the Act itself.  On the collateralised lending scheme, we certainly had the expertise and, again, we were advising how that could be constructed to provide liquidity to the banks on a general basis.</p></speech>

Because it was written as "O'Riordan" earlier.

It would have depended a lot, from time to time, on what precisely the work was.  There would have been quite a few partners involved but I don't have the numbers to hand.  It's important ... that 120 were not always ... were not working at one given time or another.  So that was over a period of seven years where we needed specialist teams to do specialist things.  So, for example - very clear example - we'd a ... we had a litigation team that had to do some of the high court applications in relation to direction orders, those types of things, and then we'd have corporate and capital finance teams dealing with, for example, recapitalisations of the banks or the reconstruction of the banks in 2011.  So the 120 lawyers is over that period of time in total.</p></speech>

I want to reference your opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  Paragraph 13.1 and quote it directly, where you said in the middle of that paragraph that "we had a limited interaction with the IMF in respect of the legal manner in which senior bondholders could participate in burden sharing."  Can you, within the parameters that were operating in here today, outline to the inquiry the nature of that interaction that you had?</p></speech>

But on ... basically, when the IMF came in at the beginning, they very much were focused on burden-sharing with senior bondholders and I think that they saw that - at least the teams that I interacted with - saw that as being an integral part in the overall approach in solving the problem.  So we did have some meetings with the IMF in relation to that and the ... there was an IMF ... a lawyer that the IMF had used previously in relation to exactly this work called Lee Buchheit, from Cleary Gottleib, who was brought in and, actually, he gave advice over a day or two, in respect of, you know, how this had been done elsewhere, for example, in Latin America and various other places.  So, certainly at that stage, it was quite a focus of the IMF.  From my perspective then, that disappeared back into a policy discussion and then it came back from the troika on the basis that there wouldn't be any burden-sharing with the ... with senior bondholders.</p></speech>

But if we're talking really about the liabilities, I suppose, until the decision was taken, the responsibility ... or the potential liability on the State would have arisen potentially in relation to the deposit guarantee scheme, where the increases had gone from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  And so if a bank had defaulted on deposits, to the extent there's intended to be a fund to cover that - I don't know what state the fund was in - but to the extent that that fund wasn't able to meet it, then the State I think would have had to step in.  So, until the final decision was taken, that would have been the extent of the State's liability.  Once the decision on the guarantee was taken, I think it's, again, fairly straightforward which is that for all of the categories of liabilities which are mentioned in the guarantee in relation to the six institutions and for the two-year period of the guarantee, the State was basically saying that they would pay up to creditors to the extent that an individual bank failed to do so.</p></speech>

In reference to a comment that you made in answer to Senator MacSharry earlier, you said that you - and I think I'm quoting you correctly - you don't remember anyone making an assertion that on ... banks were insolvent on the night of the guarantee in the meetings that you attended.  Was there an extensive discussion around the matter of insolvency or the potential for insolvency or that the illiquidity which everybody has acknowledged existed could ultimately lead to insolvency?</p></speech>

I wouldn't say there was an extensive discussion by the time I had arrived but bear in mind that this was getting quite late now - the banks had come in, they'd gone out and so on.  I had the clear sense there had been an extensive discussion and there certainly was, to take your last point, a discussion on the fact that, you know, in some ways, it isn't quite binary liquidity versus solvency.  I know people have set up the debate, if you like, as such.  And, you know, serious illiquidity will ultimately lead to insolvency.  So there was a view that if the liquidity issue wasn't dealt with, then obviously it would lead to insolvency.  But I don't recall anyone calling it directly and saying, "I believe this bank is insolvent as of tonight."</p></speech>

I just want to rewind, there's one point that I forgot to ask Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in earlier.  In relation to the full extent of the seven years that were ... that you're referencing in your opening statement - and you spoke about the 120 lawyers who were employed over that seven-year period, or were working on these matters within the firm - can you inform the inquiry how you were instructed for each of those engagements?  Like was there a tendering process for each of them and which of them there were not ... was there not, potentially, a tendering process?</p></speech>

There was no tendering process at the very beginning because it clearly was an emergency when this happened.  The ... over the period of this time I think we did about 19 different tenders, some ...  many of which we won, some of which we lost.  That would include, for example, tenders in relation to work for NAMA and those types of things as well.  So there was ... there was quite a bit of tendering.</p></speech>

If I can find it myself.  Yes, subsection (e) of your statement, you say that the legal consequences of a failure of a bank could have included the capacity of the ECB to seize the banks collateral.  Can you, maybe, briefly outline what that would have entailed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#FF03900"><p>Absolutely.  So this is just one of the consequences of a bank becoming insolvent.</p><p>So what would have happened ... and the ECB would have been in no different position, really, from other types of ... well, actually, sorry, it had priority ... would have been in a similar position to other types of derivative counterparties whereby, in order to get liquidity, what the banks would have done is that they would have repoed some of their assets to the ECB.  And what happens in that case is that if there's an insolvency event or a bank becomes illiquid, the ECB or, indeed, other derivative parties, would actually then seize that collateral so that they own it, essentially, as collateral for the lending that they'd given.</p></speech>

And that was one of the issues that the banks faced in relation to liquidity because they couldn't just package loans and give them to the ECB.  So that was the position in respect of that.</p></speech>

The promissory notes, for example, that were held at the Central Bank of Ireland at the time ... the Central Bank would have become the owner of the promissory notes and then they were restructured from there.  So that's probably the primary example.</p></speech>

At paragraph 6.3 of your statement you say "Anglo posed the greatest risk to the guarantee and the stability of the banking sector".  Again, can you maybe elaborate on that particular statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GG00700"><p>Certainly, Deputy.  I think ... and, again, I'd need to be a little bit circumscribed because I'm conscious that there's litigation ongoing in relation to Anglo.  But, essentially, once the State guaranteed each of the banks, then the State was, obviously, vulnerable to any default by any of the banks.  And, therefore, when it came to Anglo, once confidence started to erode in relation to, you know, the manner in which Anglo was being run, that obviously had quite an impact in relation to whether the guarantee could be triggered.  And, you know, a guarantee could be triggered if there was any default in any of the covenants, for example, for ... in any of the financial instruments that the bank held.  So when you guarantee like that, you ultimately are responsible for the bank and that, therefore, once the confidence in a corporate governance began to really erode in terms of Anglo, then that really was a trigger, I think, for the State to say "This is really is our obligation, our liability, ultimately, in terms of the guarantee and, therefore, we need to take more extensive control than we have taken in relation to the other banks."  And then that's when you nationalise.  So you become the owner.  You control the board - at least, you appoint the board.  And, therefore, you regularise the governance of it to a much greater extent.</p></speech>

So that judgment would be made by ... from the financial perspective.  So that would be Department of Finance, I suppose the Central Bank.  My lens in terms of all of this would be much more just the legal perspective.</p></speech>

In evidence to the inquiry, Professor Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank, spoke about the merger of EBS and AIB and the merger of Anglo and INBS and he said it "seemed a largely pointless cosmetic exercise".  That's from page 7 of his statement that he gave to the inquiry.  He also said that the exercise was "pressed on the Irish authorities by the Troika".  You would have been involved, obviously, at the time in advising the Department.  Were you aware of those pressures that Professor Honohan ... external pressures that he alleges to have been coming from outside?</p></speech>

So what happened was when the troika came in, the troika required that the banking sector would be reorganised in a sustainable manner.  And at that stage, INBS, for example, was still out on its own as an entity and it needed to be resolved.  It needed to be put on a footing that actually was sustainable in the longer term.  And the decision was made to roll that into Anglo to form IBRC and that combined essentially perhaps the two most troubled banks.  So the purpose of that at the time, certainly as I understood it and as, I suppose, we executed it or helped execute it, was that the ... that the idea was to reform the Irish banking sector into the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  And then EBS ... then ILP as a third bank, which actually had a potentially sustainable future.  So I have to say that I would see logic in that because clearly something had to be done with INBS and EBS too was a very, very small institution at that stage and clearly also was troubled.</p></speech>

I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but you have a difference of opinion as to what Professor Honohan said?  His quote again was that it "seemed a largely pointless and cosmetic exercise".</p></speech>

So he has a lens of the ... you know, financial stability and finance generally in terms of the country's economy.  My view is just I would say that there's a logic in saying that if you have a number of banks that seem unsustainable in the longer period of time, you do need to consolidate them or you need to take them off the pitch in some way.  This was just the way that it was decided to do that.</p></speech>

So why was that that you were brought in at that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GG02700"><p>Well, Senator, it's a very good question.  The reason is this. The Department of Finance ... we advise the Department of Finance.  So if you take the Attorney General's office which did a really great job in respect of the entirety of the crisis, their job is to provide the legislation on the infrastructure.  But in a crisis like this, there's a lot more to be done, essentially.  So, for example, in terms of understanding, you know, banks' capital, their financial instruments, transacting with banks - so a lot of this is contractual as well - there's a lot of other legal work that needs to be done which the Attorney General's office wouldn't generally do.</p> <p>  In terms of our input in terms of the legislation that the Attorney General's office was producing, our job really was to say "Well, how does this work, you know, out in the banking world?"  So, in other words, that we would bring the experience of how this would actually legally impact the banks, how ... you know, how the legislation could be drafted in a way that actually affected, in practical ways, in the actual banks themselves and the banking sector, what it was that the policy needed to achieve.</p> <p>  There's also a question of resource.  I mean, for example, you know creating that step plan in the ... and this was only the first week, but creating that step plan for nationalisation, what do you actually do, you know, when the legislation is brought in?  Those types of tasks would not be tasks that the Attorney General's office would, generally speaking, do.</p></speech>

There was absolutely a general urgency that everything needed to get done and the preparation that needed to get done, that it needed to get done as soon as possible so, you know, over those days we all worked as a team, not just our firm but, as a team, worked extremely hard over those days.  We didn't know precisely when, you know, the work that we were doing would be needed, but we knew that there was a decent chance it would be needed imminently.  And obviously the function of the Department of Finance at the time, who we were advising, was to make sure, I suppose, that they had the options in place in terms of any Government decisions that might be made and we were working to that.</p></speech>

So there was ... when we came in there was already a very advanced Bill that had been prepared by the Attorney General's office, which dealt with nationalisation and which also had sections in there enabling the Minister to provide financial assistance to individual banks.  So that was all very much in train.  So the work that we did, essentially, over those couple of days was just to maybe help, you know, perfect that and give our views in relation to it so the Attorney General's office could take that on board.  But that legal infrastructure was already prepared.</p></speech>

There was further discussion on the loan books of the banks, particularly of Anglo.  Following that meeting, we continued to progress the draft Bill.</blockquote>So how did that meeting inform or change the way in which you were working or did it?  What was the purpose of the meeting?</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting, I think, was, in fact I've now learned, although I didn't know earlier, that the purpose of the meeting was a follow-up from a meeting on the Friday, which we hadn't been at.  But it was essentially, as I say, a series ... there had been a series of meetings, of briefings as to how ... what the loan books were like, the first one being on Wednesday, the 24th which was our first day.  It's in the core documents.  It's dated Thursday, 25th but I think our view is, as others have, that it was the 24th.  So the general discussion that day was a further update on what was happening.  Merrill Lynch had produced the paper, the slideshow if you like, on the 26th I think and then they had the narrative paper that morning and I think the ... they didn't go through it in detail but they went through the options, which were the same options that had been discussed before.</p></speech>

Made it worse, made it better, <i>status quo</i>for the actual banks, do you remember?</p></speech>

I don't recall at that meeting, maybe I'm ... not to mix up two stories.  I don't recall at that meeting there being updates on liquidity, I mean, we weren't necessarily being told about liquidity.  But to the extent that there was a theme or a tone around the meeting, it certainly was that things were getting worse and not better.</p></speech>

Did they make that view known to you, not necessarily in the succinct way they've done it here, but in the conversations were they making that clear?  Because obviously you were at a meeting with them, more than one possibly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#HH00900"><p>Will I take that?  Senator, I certainly recall that view.  I don't recall whether that was at that particular meeting because of course there were so many meetings afterwards but certainly I recall that view.  And the view was a very straightforward one and, of course, in hindsight it was absolutely correct, which is that, you know, both INBS and Anglo funded their book with short-term debt to a certain extent and, in fact, to quite a material extent.  And that meant that they were relying on the international capital markets being open to them at any given time.  So, put very simply, they would borrow money for three months and lend it to you for seven years, and therefore they had to keep renewing that money.  Once the international capital markets closed, then obviously they ran out of funding.  And that was why it was quite broken and also, of course, both Anglo and INBS were just pure property lenders, so they were monoline lenders.  So the combination of those two things, I think, is exactly what the NTMA was pointing to and certainly that was a theme from early on but whether it was at that meeting or not, I can't recall.</p></speech>

Did you have to stand back yourselves and go, okay these banks are solvent or they're not solvent, or were you just able to rely on, as it turned out, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator's observation?</p></speech>

Just taking up Senator O'Keeffe's point and it's covered in paragraph 9.8 of Mr. McCague's presentation and it says that "the Taoiseach asked Mr. Hurley on a number of occasions for his advice as to whether, in the Central Bank's view, Anglo was insolvent".  Didn't the Taoiseach ask the wrong person?  That was Mr. Neary's responsibility, he was micro and Mr. Hurley was macro.</p></speech>

But I'm fairly sure that it was Mr. Hurley was asked first.  He asked both of them and they both gave the same answer.</p></speech>

Well, that was because Mr. Neary wasn't there.  My recollection is, and I think actually this is borne out in their own evidence, that Mr. Hurley left at some stage and then Mr. Neary came in at some stage.  I can't remember the exact details.</p></speech>

It was an issue at the time, as to whether that division was ... ever made any sense.  And Senator O'Keeffe has spoken with you about the issue of whether it was liquidity, as Mr. Hurley said, or in fact it was the wrong business model, insolvency, and the NTMA believed that and they were in the building.  And certainly the other ... the major banks believed it and they were in the building so unfortunately, it was ... it may have been a minority view, the one that prevailed, that it was liquidity and not solvency that ... the business model being unsustainable.</p> <p>  In Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's presentation, and I thank him for it also, at 6.1, "the State ... formally accepted responsibility for most of Anglo's liabilities when it issued the guarantee in September 2008".  Didn't the State believe, and everybody believe, that was for &euro;1.5 billion and not a bill for &euro;30 billion?  Could anything have been done to say, we understand, as of now we're accepting &euro;1.5 billion and not any higher number and certainly not &euro;30 billion?</p></speech>

But the point I was making is that actually the State was already on the hook for Anglo, from the time of the guarantee, essentially, so therefore in, in nationalising Anglo, it wasn't taking on any more liability.  But, certainly, I mean, my recollection of the early days was clearly it wasn't known that there was going to be a &euro;30 billion gap.</p></speech>

So, you know, the guarantee and the overall the ... financial sector generally did leave the taxpayer with that bill.  I think too it's very important in that analysis, Senator, to remember that the losses that had occurred in the system, you know, predated the guarantee and were there in any case, so they had to fall at some stage.</p></speech>

That was, ultimately, done by the Central Bank, for example, in its PCAR and it's PLAR exercises, and that is a very, very extensive exercise.  The other thing to remember at the time is that things were moving very quickly, so I suspect, and this is more of a financial question rather than a legal question, but if you had gone into the banks at the time and assessed the assets, you'd have been assessing them against probably the conditions over the previous number of months, as opposed to the conditions that were to come.  So, again it's hard to say, I would say, whether that would have ... even if you had had the months that it would have taken to do that job, whether it could have been benchmarked correctly in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Has that been rectified?</p></speech>

I mean, it's been rectified.  Firstly. we brought in ... well, the country brought in, in 2011, a domestic resolution scheme and the troika had required us to do that.  But more fundamentally, just this year, from 1 January, the European Union has brought in the BRRD, the banking resolution and recovery directive, which actually does that in a comprehensive way.  And it took the European Union, you know, five or six years just to formulate that.  So that is a resolution regime that involves bail-ins, for example, that involves bad banks, that gives all the tools that are required.  In 2008, Senator, across Europe, most countries were actually without banking resolution legislation, and it's important to remember that no retail bank in the eurozone had ever been liquidated, so that's why at the time there wasn't, in any country, for example, in the UK as well, that there wasn't a pre-existing resolution legislation.  But that is there now on the basis primarily of the new directive but also of our domestic legislation.</p></speech>

I think the NTMA were ... provided the room, so to speak.  In fact, I think I read some other witness gave evidence that it was to ... there were too many photographers and various other people gathered around the Department, so the meeting was held in the NTMA, but we were retained by the Department.</p></speech>

There was further discussion on the loan books of the banks, particularly of Anglo.  Following that meeting we continued to progress the draft [nationalisation] Bill.</blockquote>So, at that meeting, what views were given by the National Treasury Management Agency, what views were given by the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance as regards doing legislation around the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide Building Society?</p></speech>

Was there a discussion around that time ... two aspects: No. 1, around the solvency of the banks, more particularly Anglo.  And was the discussion around that ... were you under the impression that it was still policy to look at putting in place legislation to nationalise Anglo?</p></speech>

That was the information that was coming through.  There was some, you know, concern that the advisers hadn't been in place that long.  This was all very, very much-----</p></speech>

But, perhaps, to come back to a point which somebody else asked me, that might explain it, even if it had have been declared, let's state objectively everybody had agreed it was solvent that day, I don't think, logically, they would have stopped the legislation being prepared because, as I think we said earlier, iliquidity can lead to insolvency, so even if their balance sheets were very strong, and even if their assets greatly exceeded their liability, if the liquidity crisis continued and it wasn't addressed in some way, they could have ended up being insolvent and never having to be nationalised.  So I think that probably explains why the work was being continued-----</p></speech>

But in terms of the guarantee, it was still in the mix as one of the Merrill Lynch options, but it wasn't ... in fact, an awful lot of that meeting, Deputy, was really about the loan books and what was going on.

So the question I suppose I want to ask you, is No. 1, you were brought in a week before the guarantee took place, you were brought in the 24 September.  Was there in any way a discussion around putting in place a mechanism to allow an orderly wind-down of an insolvent institution?  Obviously, I'm speaking specifically about Anglo and Irish Nationwide.</p></speech>

No there wasn't, Senator, because the ... I think the ... the policy the entire time was to stand behind the banks and I think that the feeling at the time, and you'll see it actually in the rest of 5.5, if you go through what actually would happened at the time, seeing an insolvency, even for example the &euro;100,000 guarantee scheme, there was two things; firstly those depositors would not have got their money for three months and in addition, there was a question of funding that, that scheme, so the Government would have had to come up with the cash to fund that immediately.  So I think ... and that's only ... and that's the least of the problems.  You then see how that would impact the other banks and depositors in other banks.  It would have complicated the problem very significantly I would have thought.  So as a result that ... that week it was not ... that was not part of the ... of the discussion.</p></speech>

But as I said that was true throughout Europe and also bank resolution regimes are very complex things to put into place and as I said, the European Union took five years to do it, which is just in place now.  So I think two things to be clear; firstly there wasn't ... the resolution mechanism, that wasn't part of the policy and the direction was more a nationalisation and with the supporting liquidity scheme, the CLS scheme that we've been discussing.</p></speech>

Could it have been nationalised in a night?  Would it have been required that, you just ... you would have put the liquidity funding in place to fund Anglo in terms of over the next number of days?  What's the practical procedures in terms of nationalising?</p></speech>

So in terms of ... of nationalising a bank it's very important always to make sure that you retain confidence and certainty in the sector generally speaking.  So you would tend to pass the legislation that was there on the night of the guarantee and was there that week, and ultimately, a version of that was enacted in January 2009.  So essentially what you do is you ... you remove the ... you go in, you take the shares, so the shares transfer from the shareholders to the State.  You then change the board, which means that ... that there's new controls in relation to it and you just take ownership of the bank.</p></speech>

Did you form a view, I suppose on the night of the meeting in question, we've had evidence that the NTMA weren't directly present in the room, as to why they weren't there or did you have a view as to whether they should have been physically in the room giving their opinion or ... rather than having it filtered though a third party?</p></speech>

But in relation to the discussions that took place, were there discussions on restructuring with respect to the sovereign or was it specifically on the issue of the possibility of burden-sharing?

I'm not sure in what exact capacity he was there.  He was there as simply somebody who had done this in other countries.  He was there I would say quite briefly in relation to this, so we, we had, we had worked out - and I don't want to get into advices for example here - but certainly in terms of burden-sharing the legal structures would have been available in Ireland to do that.  And then a lot of ... a lot of it was actually about well, how do you deal with the bond markets in respect of this and, you know, those types of issues.  And Mr. Buchheit advised on those but, as I say, over a relatively brief period and that was the period that I mentioned earlier where the IMF were still focusing, at least to my ... in my experience were quite focusing on burden-sharing with senior bondholders.</p></speech>

Chairman, I make this statement on foot of your request to assist you and your colleagues in your deliberations inquiring into the banking crisis.  You requested that I address certain issues from my position as Taoiseach during the 28th, 29th and 30th D&aacute;ileanna.  For my record, my tenure as Taoiseach over the time extended over three Governments: from 16 June 1997 to 6 June 2002; from 6 June 2002 to 14 June 2007; and 14 June 2007 to 7 May 2008.</p><p>You requested I address a number of specific topics in my evidence which are of interest to the inquiry.  The first one is the nature and effectiveness of the operational implementation of macro-economic and prudential policy.  The available evidence supports a strongly positive conclusion under this heading.  The main economic problems facing Ireland in the mid-90s were high unemployment, net emigration, relatively low incomes and the need for increased productivity.  A decade later these problems were substantially solved.  GDP growth in real terms averaged about 7.25% in the decade or so to 2006, and the corresponding rate of growth in GNP was nearly 6.4%.  Such rates of growth were substantially above those experienced in other EU member states, and indeed throughout the OECD area of the time.  <br/><br/>The 2005 annual report of the National Competitiveness Council reported that Ireland&rsquo;s rate of growth in this period was more than double that of the US and triple the average rate achieved by other eurozone countries.  They also noted that labour productivity had been growing by 5% per annum and that the taxation and regulatory systems had developed to become key competitive strengths of the economy.  Furthermore, with Government investment in infrastructure being significantly higher than in other developed economies and countries, a previously important and long-standing weaknesses was being addressed.  As a result of these developments, employment in Ireland increased from 1.38 million in 1997 to over 2 million by 2006, and the unemployment rate declined from 10.3% to 4.3%.  Net inward migration accelerated from 19,000 per annum in 1997 to 70,000 per annum a decade later.  <br/><br/>A key indicator of the progress that was achieved in this period was that by 2007 the National Competitiveness Council would report that Ireland was ranked fourth in the world in the UN&rsquo;s human development index, based on strong improvements in income per capita, life expectancy and educational levels.  These achievements were made against an international background of a slowdown in growth in Ireland&rsquo;s main export markets from 2001 to 2003, and ongoing fears of a steep decline developing in the United States. <br/><br/>Furthermore, at home the aggregate fiscal position was managed in a highly conservative, prudential way.  Thus, total Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP actually declined from 39.8% in 1997 to 39.2% in 2007.  Government gross current expenditure as a percentage of GNP fell from 36% to under 33%, facilitating expansion in capital spending from 3.6% to 6.3% of GNP in that decade.  The overall Government balance rose to a surplus of over 6% of GNP, from 1.3% a decade earlier in 1997.  And finally, to seal this point in relation to prudential financial management, it should be emphasised that the Exchequer debt/GDP ratio fell from 63.6% in 1997 to 25.1% in 2006.  <br/><br/>Budgetary policy was successful also in addressing social inequality.  For example, in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of December 2004 the ESRI concluded: <blockquote>In terms of income redistribution, Budget 2005 has been strongly progressive in terms of the direction of tax measures, social welfare payments and the absence of indirect tax increases.  As regards the Budget's overall fiscal stance.  The most appropriate indicator of the budgetary position is the general government balance (GGB), which we forecast to move from a surplus of 1.1 per cent of GDP this year to a deficit of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2005.  This expansionary fiscal stance may not be inappropriate given that there are potential downside risks to our forecasts over the next few years.</blockquote>A year later, writing in the Quarterly Economic Commentary December 2005, in an article entitled Future Irish Growth: Opportunities, Catalysts, Constraints, Professor Frank Barry of UCD concluded as follows, &quot;It is suggested here that if Ireland can continue to attract substantial FDI [foreign direct investment] and the labour pool necessary to man it, further convergence on US income per head &ndash; which remains well above that of the EU 15 &ndash; should be available.&quot;<br/><br/>Clearly, Chairman, Ireland has been extremely effective in attracting FDI.  At the heart of that success is the operational effectiveness of IDA Ireland, the agency responsible for implementing Government policy in this area.  And, for example, the <i>IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2008 </i>ranks direct investment flows to Ireland at $10.79 billion and 4.22% of GDP as the two most significant improvements in competitiveness of Ireland in that year. <br/><br/>On the second question, Chairman, the appropriateness of expert advice: when it comes to expert advice and high quality economic analysis, the Government have a wide range of sources available - international organisations - including the European Commission, the IMF, the OECD and financial ratings agencies like Standard &amp;amp; Poor's and Moody&rsquo;s.  Each carry out independent assessments of macro-economic and prudential conditions in Ireland, and for the most part these are undertaken about annually and usually highlight what, in their view, are the prospects facing the economy, and the policy initiatives that were required to prioritise to optimise economic performance on a sustainable basis.  These organisations have the advantage of having international perspectives, and the insights they provide are especially valuable when considering economic conditions and prospects in a comparative context.  In other words, they enable us to judge performance relative to countries with whom we compete.  This comparative perspective is obviously very useful from the point of view of assessing if Government policy is on the right track.  <br/><br/>At national level there are several organisation, funded or part funded by the Exchequer, such as the ESRI, NESC, Forf&aacute;s and the Central Bank, which through their regular publications and studies on particular aspects of the economy, provide valuable and continual monitoring of economic performance at macro and sectoral level, and with respect to individual policy initiatives undertaken or proposed by Government.  Increasingly, in recent times, domestic financial and professional services providers have also devoted increased resources to economic analysis, policy evaluation, commentary and economic forecasts.  And while the research of these organisations focus primarily for the benefit of their own clients' bases, it can provide useful insights for policy development and evaluation in public policy terms.<br/><br/>I would like to also mention under this heading - which is in my report, but I won't read it, but it's in the report - the elaborate annual process of soliciting and evaluating pre-budget submissions from interested parties and individuals by the Department of Finance.  This process provides a broad platform from which Government can elicit ideas, potential initiatives and amendments to existing schemes to improve budgetary formation.  In addition, it's always open to Ministers, on the advice of their Departments, to solicit interest from external consultants with respect to particular issues or problems which are foreseen developing.  Furthermore, there is well-developed public tendering processes in place to facilitate the public service in procuring the most appropriate level of expertise at fair value for taxpayers.  <br/><br/>In overall terms, therefore, I hope the committee of inquiry can see from my remarks that aside from economic advice available from the permanent Civil Service, in particular the Department of Finance, there is a very wide range of sources of advice, both from an international and domestic focus, which allows Government to draw a synthesis which one hopes of course is balanced and gives due consideration to the very wide range of views that is inevitably brought forward in such a process.  <br/><br/>Obviously I am not going to present a comprehensive review of the policy decisions that were made in this period, nor the inputs to those decisions.  However, I think it's important that the committee takes due recognition of the information that was available when the decisions were being made to counteract the retrospective narrative that has developed with the benefit of hindsight over the years since the crisis first began to manifest in 2008.  To this end, the table included summarises IMF forecasts and results for real GDP percentage growth in Ireland as published in the World Economic Outlook<i></i>over the period 2004 to 2009.  The WEO is published in spring and autumn and data from successive publications are shown in my statement.  <br/><br/>It can be readily seen, Chairman, that the crash was not foreseen by the IMF, who only realised their outlook when the slowdown was well and truly at hand.  For example, as late as autumn 2007 the IMF was forecasting that the Irish economy would grow at 3% in 2008 after inflation is deducted.  Even when it became clear that there was a severe global downturn, the IMF forecast in late 2008 that there would be no more than a marginal fall of 0.6% in real GDP in Ireland in 2009.  This data indicate the information that was available to decision makers at this time, and the conclusions are clear: even an organisation such as the IMF remained convinced that Ireland&rsquo;s economic expansion was sustainable.  <br/><br/>Inevitably, of course, there were stresses and strains associated with rapid expansion in economic activity.</p><p>The most noted and commented upon at the time was the growing importance of the construction sector in the Irish economy.  At some stage, this growth would inevitably ease.  For example, the ESRI medium-term review of 2003 noted that, and I quote, "At some stage over the coming decade, when the demand for housing has been largely met, it is likely that prices will fall to levels closer to the European Union average, and this will be the signal for a winding down of capacity in the sector ... the inevitable process of adjustment to lower demand [for building and construction output], which is still some way off, will prove painful for the sector", end of quote.  In other words, market forces, which had driven up prices, had led to increased economic activity.  However, as supply rose, some of the increase in prices and activity would be expected to be reversed and this was expected to occur at some stage during the years 2003 to 2013.  In its subsequent medium-term review in 2005, the ESRI noted that no slowdown was seen and there were ... there was "a growing aura of invincibility about the Irish economy", with consumers showing a "high degree of certainly about the future".  And, while, with the benefit of hindsight, this can be interpreted as unwarranted complacency, the ESRI went on to conclude that the "fundamental factors driving the Irish economy ... remain quite favourable".  A note of caution was sounded but the subsequent analysis, which comprised a high-growth and a low-growth scenario, was based on alternative assumptions regarding the impact on Ireland of what were described as "global economic imbalances" which could lead to the US economy slowing considerably and experience a painful adjustment.  Chairman, to an extent, this is what subsequently transpired.  The forecast based on this scenario was that Irish growth would slow to 3.5% per annum in the years 2005 to 2010 and 3.1% from 2010 to 2015.  Unemployment would rise to about 7% in the early years of the slowdown before falling back to the 2005 level of 4%, while the public finances would remain broadly in balance.  Of course, if the US economy did not suffer this painful adjustment, then Irish growth rates were forecast to be higher.  The implication is that no homegrown crisis was foreseen and even an imported one would have relatively mild effects due to the fundamental sound nature of the Irish economy.</p><p> These examples are provided here, Chairman, simply to illustrate what was available to policy makers and it's not my purpose to critique these organisations.  However, the research and conclusions of these organisations constitutes a major input to policy decisions.  Of course, having this research available does not mean that the most appropriate course for policy was always clear.  Some divergences of opinion are to be expected, indeed, contrasting views and opinions were encountered.  The range of views was always taken into account in reaching policy decisions during my time in office but the synthesis of opinions leading to policy decisions inevitably reflects the conclusions of the vast majority of the research.  I believe that this is the correct basis on which decisions should be made.  In this respect, it must be noted that the overwhelming and virtually ... consensus during this time was that Irish policy was moving the economy in the right direction, that the economy was on a sustainable growth path that could be expected to slow somewhat in response to changes in fundamental drivers, that the main risk would be traced to developments in external economies and that the dangers posed by domestic factors represented challenges to be managed rather than the first indicators of a crisis, as subsequently developed.</p><p> Chairman, I'm ... for time reasons, I'm ... I'm skipping some of the sections.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#TT00300"><p>So, to ... to my section with ... on the statement ... the "Context of Budgetary Policy":  In terms of wider budgetary policy and also, maybe, to give proper context to the issues under discussion, I think it's worthwhile to emphasise that during my period as Taoiseach, Ireland finally caught up with and then surpassed average EU living standards.  It was a sizeable national achievement to raise our living standards from a historically low base of two thirds of the EU average.  The downturn did have a very hard impact on individuals and families, especially those who lost their jobs and, of course, that saddened me and I wish the recession did not happen.  However, it is disingenuous to suggest that all the gains this country made have been wiped away.  Between 1997 and 2008 this country thrived, and, not only did Ireland enjoy record economic growth but living standards were raised across the board and this drove social progress.  This rising tide was essential in lifting hundreds of thousands of our people out of poverty, to reversing forced emigration, to significantly increasing pensions and child benefit, to modernising schools, health facilities, roads and communications infrastructure around our country and creating well-paid jobs for young people at home.  This represented a positive change to the lives of many people and, despite the recession, a lot of this progress is still there, benefiting thousands of our citizens.</p> <p>  I am glad that Government allocated - that I led - huge amounts of money in this period into regenerating traditional areas of poverty, such as Ballymun and Fatima Mansions in inner-city areas, and parts of Limerick, Cork, Waterford and other cities.  I am glad we put money into the islands, improving electricity, sewage and building infrastructure and piers and ... in rural areas.  Throughout the country, people now drive on better and safer roads.  The motorway network that Government supported during my tenure has cut journey times and is a vital economic and social artery of our people.  People also travel on better trains, our school and hospitals have more staff working in better buildings.  All the time as Taoiseach, what I wanted to do, Chairman, was ... with budgets, was to improve the quality of life for ordinary people and to provide services that our country did not have before.  Those who say we squandered the boom forget that in my time as Taoiseach we actually recorded budget surpluses in ten of our 11 budgets.  We balanced sustained increases in spending with the need to reduce our national debt.  As a result, Ireland paid a billion euro less every year in ... in interest payments.</p> <p>  I want to remind members of this committee that when I first came to the House, in '77, and for ... right through the 80s, our national debt was an unsustainable milestone around the neck of taxpayers.  It was a barrier to national progress, as huge sums of revenue had to service interest payments.  In 1997, the year I became Taoiseach, 20% of all taxes raised in the State were used to service the national debt.  In 2007, my last full year as Taoiseach, that figure stood at 4.3%.  During my time as Taoiseach, we continued to pay into the National Pension Reserve Fund, so that, when the downturn came, we had &euro;20 billion saved which provided some protection when the recession came.</p> <p>  There is zero credibility in suggesting that an open economy like ours could withstand the global recession and the collapse of the global investment banking system.  This was not just an Irish experience, it was a worldwide recession that affected America, Japan, Britain and China, and most of the developed economies in the world.  In 2007 the International Monetary Fund maintained that Ireland's economic growth would be strong over the medium term.  The IMF directors said our economic performance was robust and was supported by sound economic policies.  When I left office a year later, the IMF and other financial organisations, such as the OECD, along with national ones, such as the ESRI, were all predicting growth in the Irish economy in the region of 3% for 2009.  In June 2009, a little more than a year on from my resignation, they were predicting contraction of between 8% and 10%.  That illustrates how unprecedented and unforeseen this global crisis had been and how quickly it took shape.</p> <p>  It is true that we had some warnings about over-reliance on ... on property.  But it is important to be clear about the record.  In October 2004 the IMF alluded to a possible overheating in the housing market, even though, subsequently, they themselves, and other economic commentators, implied there was no bubble.  In the budget two months later, Brian Cowen, the Minister for Finance, announced a review of tax incentive schemes.  In the next budget we announced a termination date for all existing property-related tax incentive schemes, with the exception of private hospitals, registered nursing homes and child care facilities.  Our stamp duty was already the largest transaction tax on property in the European Union and despite a concerted campaign by some to get rid of the tax, or to reduce it substantially, we refused to go down this route and we listened ... we'd ... if we had listened to those calls, this would have added fuel to the housing market and we would have experienced a far greater difficulties than we ultimately experienced.  We were, Chairman, able gradually to remove incentives from the property market but membership of the euro meant that we were unable to raise interest rates.  Accordingly ... according to the IMF report in the summer of 2009, the housing boom was caused mainly by cheap credit due to low interest rates, along with rising incomes and a strong demand for housing.  There is no doubt that this created a structural weakness in the economy and the international downturn ensured this has turned from a soft landing into a very hard one.  I wish this didn't happen and, with hindsight, of course, I would have done things differently.</p> <p>  I did make mistakes, Chairman, I admit that.  But, so does everyone who governs.  I know that during my time as Taoiseach, while I did not get everything right, I can honestly put my hand on my heart and say I did try my best - my very best - to do the right thing by the Irish people.  Of course, I apologise for my mistakes but I am also pleased that I did get a lot of things right.</p><p>The winds of the greatest international recession since 1929 did batter our country after my departure but now, as that storm abates, it will become increasingly clear that a lot of the progress the Irish people made in the first decade of the 21st century, such as modernising infrastructure, investing in our roads, schools and hospitals has not been washed away.  I make these points not to take away from the fact that Government has had to do Trojan work in recent times and that the Irish people have endured many sacrifices in a national battle for economic and social stability.  I want to conclude by saying I respect the work done by my successor, Brian Cowen, and the late Brian Lenihan.  I also admire the efforts of the current Government and I think the Taoiseach, Minister Noonan and Minister Howlin have shown a lot of commitment and courage in tackling the financial crisis.  I think one of the lessons we should all take from the crisis is that, maybe, our politics needs to be less partisan and that, as a small island, we should pull together.  The last few years have been extremely tough on many ordinary families and that breaks my heart, but the work of our democratic political system must prevail and the problems we faced on a massive scale of unemployment, emigration and the banking crisis are on track to being resolved.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, can I just invite you to look at a table that I'm going to bring up?  It comes back to your own testimony with regard to indicators and this shows a huge increase in public service allocations between the years 2000 and 2008, a plus 141% in total expenditure, which was precisely double the growth in GDP over the same period.  So what you see there is under the headings of social welfare, education, health, capital investment, total expenditure and GDP, the measurements are there and the figures are as outlined.  Can I also bring to your attention another graph that will come up, where when you combine it with the statistics on the parallel major growth in construction-related lending, the bottom, kind of, amber-beige line is standard lending or other lending and the blue line is property lending?  And you can see there on the graph it increased quite significantly from, sort of, '01 period peaking into '07-'08 quite significantly.  When you look at these two sets of figures alone, were these not enough to warn the Government that a bubble was being created?</p></speech>

The GNP on the expenditure side ... I always, Chairman, looked at what our spending to GNP was and GDP.  I tended in my political life, as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, to look at GNP more so because of the repatriation of profits but, as you know, in the European Council or in ECOFIN, which I attended for many, many years, it was always GDP.  We always had to make the adjustment but, either way, while our revenues were growing, I was always conscious that we should keep our percentage right and if I recall, even on the highest year 2006 or 2007, I think only Estonia had a lower expenditure than us so ... I'd like to go on with, maybe, what a lot of people have said to this committee and say, "Well, expenditure was out of control", but I have to say, Chairman, at the time, I did not see that view because only Estonia had a higher ... and we were way lower than everywhere else.  Now, on the other chart, it was quite clear, Chairman, that the property markets - I'm sure it will come up after - but it was quite clear that the level of indebtedness and the lending to the property section was growing dangerously.</p></speech>

I've the different view on the level ... in the level of indebtedness, I'd a different view on that.  If you ask me what my view now is, it ... I probably would have battened down the hatches in 1997 and said no to everything, so therefore we would have had such a big surplus we would have been like Germany, we would have been able to take the whole hit.  But, I'm afraid, Chairman, I wasn't blessed with that view any time while I was in office.</p></speech>

I don't think I argued for the abolition.  Remember, there were about 24, was it, 24 different taxes.  Some of them were expensive; some of them were not.  Some of them were very beneficial; some of them were dubious whether they were or they weren't.  And the view, when Minister Cowen, and I remember him well, he was very anxious to deal with them.  It had been a departmental view, I think Mr. McNally has informed you of that, and that was the view of the Department.  But I think, as you know, Deputy, from the time a lot of the incentives came in, in the urban renewal in 1986 by the Garret FitzGerald ... the late Garret FitzGerald's Government, they were forever being extended.</p></speech>

There were other sectors of the economy growing very strongly, even to the end, and if you look at 2008, my last period, 28,000 jobs were created.  We lost 20,000 in construction and still, just at the time I was leaving, there was a speech, I think, one of the papers, where I was talking about that, that we were actually managing still to create jobs and managing to see it slow down, the construction, and still manage it, so I still thought we could manage it through.</p></speech>

I had broken my back from 1997 to try to get the supply side ... when I came in as Taoiseach, there was, in the Central Bank's terms, a bubble, or at least shortly afterwards.  we had moved from building 20,000 houses in 1990 to 42,000 houses when I came into office.  It was believed at that time by all the experts that we needed to get to 50,000 to take the heat out of the market.  Everything we did, and the Bacon reports and all of the other efforts that were made, were all to try and get supply up and we believed that if we got supply up, we'd get an equilibrium that would balance the situation-----</p></speech>

We know from evidence that house prices and construction started to decline in the first quarter of 2007.  Can I just talk to you about your speech at the opening of the new headquarters of Treasury Holdings on Monday, 10 December 2007?  This was an attendance, just before Christmas, with Johnny Ronan and John and Richard Barrett was there.  You talked about the outlook recognises "the difficulties facing the construction sector in the light of recent and ongoing developments in both ... international and domestic economic environments" and you go on to say, "That is why last week&rsquo;s Budget underscores the Government&rsquo;s determination to deliver ... its housing commitments under Towards 2016".  You go on to talk about how you've increased spending above 16% on the 2007 Estimates for social and affordable housing.  You go on to talk about changes in stamp duty regime that were introduced that would significantly improve ... sorry, "provide a significant stimulus to the market by boosting purchasing power generally".  You go on to say how you ... your Government, from 1 January, is increasing the ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers, for married people and also increasing income tax relief for rent payment by 11% and increasing the threshold for rent-a-room scheme and so on, "and are continuing with the generous tax reliefs for landlords investing in private rented accommodation".  You go on to say, "Taken together, these measures testify to the Government's commitment to the [continuing] development of the sector".  Now, is this not you telling a number of developers and whoever else was there that the Government are intent in trying to reflate a property bubble that had already bust?</p></speech>

What we did in the budget of 2007 for 2008, we made a number of changes to try to help first-time buyers.</p><p>We wanted to keep economic growth going and to keep it strong.  And we wanted to stimulate the economy as much as we could to keep it strong.  I don't think we made too many changes that would have made too much difference to most of the developers.  And, of course, at that stage we did know since August 2007, once the liquidity problems did start in the banks, that life was getting more difficult.  And it did get more difficult but it was based on liquidity.  At no stage in those months up to that budget was anybody saying that the bubble was going to bust.  And in the discussions around the budget of 2007, or the budget of 2008 in November, October-November, nobody was talking about the bubble busting. </p></speech>

You said, "This is why in last week's budget we introduced these measures."  You go on to say, "To provide a significant stimulus to the market [which is the construction market]," and you go on to say that, "These measures taken together testify to the Government's commitment to the continuing development of this sector."  You're after giving evidence saying that you wanted to see a decline in the number of house price ... or houses from 2006 on and you tried to do that.  But you're giving a different speech to Johnny Ronan and a number of others in December 2007, which is saying that your Government are introducing measures to actually boost demand at that time.</p></speech>

I disagree with the first point you made that it was only in 2007 that property started easing.  It was in 2006 and it was generally being talked about since probably the second quarter of 2006 that property was easing up.  But unemployment was building fairly rapidly in the construction industry after the summer of 2007 and into 2008.  And, you know, there were 230,000 people working in the construction industry, and that day, whoever I was talking to-  I'm sure it was a well-attended function, like all other functions you'd attend as Taoiseach - it was necessary to try to keep our construction industry as strong as we could.</p></speech>

This is the year 2000.  And further measures were proposed to you personally via an internal memorandum by the assistant principal in the Department of the Taoiseach to counteract this.  One of the recommendations was to impose credit controls on lending.  Can you remember if the proposal to impose credit controls and lending via the Central Bank was further discussed with you, or considered by you?  And can you tell us why it was never introduced?</p></speech>

But I remember the discussions around that and the official that was dealing with those issues in my Department, I think is now Ambassador O'Leary, if I recall correct.  And we ... now ambassador ... we gave those views, which was the views of my officials in the Department, to the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment.</p></speech>

I've no doubt that those views went into it.  But I did meet the Central Bank Governor on a number of times.  I don't believe I raised it with him.

Mr. Ahern, in your statement, you didn't address the key line, 5D, which you were directed by the inquiry to do.  So can you now describe the main aspects of the relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il and the building and the construction industry, and give your view on the purposes and outcomes of a substantial number of formal and informal meetings with representatives and leading persons of this industry?</p></speech>

But I had a lot of dealings through the social partnership process with all of the main trade union-employer bodies and the CIF were quite a strong lobby as part of that process, as was IBEC and as were the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland, along with all the farming bodies.  So I would have had dealings with them and from time to time, and they were most of my meetings because the CIF group represented, except the House Builders Association, but I don't ... I used to have a lot of dealings with the house builders when as Minister for Finance; I don't think I had too much dealings with them when I was Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Quinn lent you his helicopter to go canvassing in Donegal at one stage and there's many other stories that appear in the media.  And, indeed, actually, one of them if I can refer to, in 2009. as part of the promotion for your autobiography that I've already mentioned, <i>The Irish Times</i>on 28 September 2009 reported on one of these interviews that you did, and it said that Mr. Ahern said:<blockquote><br /><br />...it was untrue that the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway races was full of big developers. The best year for the tent was 2005 and only 19 of the 635 people in it on the main day of the races that year, he asserts, could be classified as developers or big builders. Another 30 could be considered builders &ldquo;and the rest are the fellas you&rsquo;d get in to do a small job on your house&rdquo;.</blockquote>So, now we know from the Nyberg report, Mr. Ahern that the aggregate exposure of the top 20 customers as of 31 May, as of the time you left as Taoiseach in 2008, they had 50% of the &euro;41.7 billion loan book.  And we know from Nationwide that they had 51%, 25 of them had 21% and we know that the top 25 borrowers had &euro;25 billion between them borrowed at that time from the banks.  So, when it comes to the property-State-finance nexus in the State, are we dealing with a small number of developers, less than 30 it seems?  But you were quite precise in your interview, about the 19 big developers.  Do you have the names of those 19 big developers that attended on that one day on the Galway tent and do you want to share it with the committee?</p></speech>

So there was always that connection.  Some of them were builders; some of them were tradespeople; some of them were farmers; some of them were other.  But there was no big deal.  There was literally no big deal between the connections in the Fianna F&aacute;il tent and the construction industry.  It was a social occasion and I wish I had been able to influence maybe some of those people but I don't ... I heard your questions previously about this and you seem to have a bit of an obsession with the Fianna F&aacute;il tent, as many people have.  But it wasn't any big deal and there was no big business done.  And I assure you this, Deputy, I assure you this.  And I wish it had been different, that I had known the extent of the exposure from some of those people, and there was some of them, that they had to the banks.  Because in the last seven years, as you'd appreciate, I have had good, sensible conversations with many decent people and they believe that not alone did I know the figures but that I had the files, and that I knew exactly what every developer in this country owed and what exposure with the banks.  But the fact is, as you know, Deputy, I had none of that information because I wasn't entitled to any of that.  That's a matter under AK33, which is totally confidential and only the Central Bank and the regulator had it.</p></speech>

I did deal a considerable amount with the CIF.  They were one of the social partners.  Regularly I dealt with them in the sectoral meetings of social partnership and, as your book of evidence shows, I had a number of meetings with them, not that many, but they did come in to state their case.

And we also know at the ICTU conference, unfortunately you talked about sitting on the sidelines ... people sitting on the sidelines cribbing and moaning and you unfortunately said, &quot;I don't know how people who engage in that don't commit suicide.&quot;  The reason I raise this, Mr. Ahern, is how do you reconcile that with your witness statement, with the fact that as the crisis was starting to emerge, it appears that you were quite willing to confront rather than engage with alternative views, yet your witness statement talks about listening and responding to proposals and criticisms?</p></speech>

In my entire political life, I think I've ... from the time I was Lord Mayor of this city of Dublin and through being Minister for lots of things, but particularly Labour and Finance, I spent my time giving a positive message about this country.  I travelled on trade missions.  I spoke internationally.  I did thousands of meetings talking up the benefits of our country, giving factual positions but also trying to explain all that we could do, particularly in the years ... in the bad years when ... in the late '80s and in the early ... when I was Minister for Finance when matters were very, very tight.  So I was always giving a positive message, trying to give ... if the Minister ... I used to be chairman of the committee for employment back in the late '80s and early '90s and, as Finance Minister, if I was going out giving a negative message or a downbeat message, then what hope was there for the rest of us?  I would always try to be positive.  I would always try to keep a confident message and talk about the glass being half full.  And, as you know, Deputy, in this country, an awful lot of people, even when the glass is full, want it to be half empty.  So I make no apologies for always trying to be positive and sometimes when it was difficult.  And if you ... you see in the papers that you had sent to me, many of the areas where the Department of Finance were advising their own Minister to keep it positive, because there were domestic issues.</p></speech>

In your last question you ... about can I address ... I had two very good friends who died from suicide in the '90s.  I never should have said that.  And three minutes after I came off the stage, I apologised for that.  That was just a totally wrong thing to say.  But what I was talking about that day was confidence, that yes things were getting more difficult, and was before liquidity.  But I was talking to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Donegal and I was saying "Listen, we have to have confidence, we have to have belief, we have to work together, we have to pull together."  And I'm sure you've seen that speech.  And, unscripted then I, unfortunately, said that and, of course, like lots of things in life, everyone forgets what I said in the rest of that speech.  But I think that speech was a speech of trying to give confidence and stability and I don't think there was anything wrong that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, in 2007 and 2008 there was a number of things happening.  We know from 2007, the Government was investigating possible responses to the emerging credit crisis.  At the same time, both commercial and residential properties had stalled.  In March 2008, INBS was frozen out of the wholesale markets with no access to normal ECB funding.  In March 2008, Seanie FitzPatrick was lobbying the Governor of the Central Bank for the form of ... some form of bank guarantee.  In April, the Government was working on draft legislation for a systemic guarantee and we know by September what happened.  Now, you were Taoiseach during all of this period.  You've said to the Chairperson you believe, I think, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound when you left.  Given what I'm just after saying, do you still believe that the economy was sound?</p></speech>

Because in all the discussions I had between August 2007 and up until I left, which was after the collapse of the share prices on St. Patrick's Day - St. Patrick's Day massacre as you like to refer to it - it was not ... it was about liquidity.  I got very concerned from August 2007 and I had discussed it with the Central Bank, discussed it with the Department of Finance, discussed it with many, many people outside of it as well, and the issue was about liquidity.  At no time, and I can honestly say this to you, at no time did any of the agencies or any of the officials for that matter, say "Get ready for boom or bust."  That was not what was-----</p></speech>

He was telling people not to ... to move away from the likes of Anglo at that time because of over-exposure to the property market.  Were you completely unaware of the banks' over-exposure to the property market, given the fact that you believed that it was only a liquidity problem?</p></speech>

Anglo, I think, had ... 40% of its loan book was in property in Ireland and 40% of it in property in England and I think we had ... at 60%, we had probably the highest ... I think we had the highest ratio of lending in one sector.  So they were all different points.  What you asked me did I see that we ... that this was heading for bust and the answer to that "No."</p></speech>

And the reason, Deputy ... I could give you many examples.  I've given you a good few.  But if you looked at the growth and stability programme that was just issued at Christmas to the European Union, that Christmas of 2007, from the Department of Finance which, as I said earlier, is ... always takes ... rightly takes a conservative view, that was showing that we were going to grow by 3% to 5%, so it wasn't that I thought ... the IMF, the ESRI were all saying the same - that, yes, there was a problem but not that we were going to see a collapse.  And the figure that we're talking about in that Growth and Stability Pact figure was 50,000 to 60,000 houses and the Department of Finance said well, they thought under 50,000 was more likely.  We were not talking about down to what happened a few months later.</p></speech>

In the currency crisis, well, it went to 13.75% and, of course, the overnight went to whatever you like ... it went to all kind of rates - 80%, 90%, 100%.  But the view was, as I recall it, that we should come down to around 7%.

What we actually see in the years for 2000, 2001, 2002 is public expenditure increasing far beyond what was being recommended by the Department of Finance.  So did you actually rein in public spending?  Because what I see in this report is it increasing.</p></speech>

Moving forward then through to before 2007.  In an interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in November 2014, you said:<blockquote><br /><br />...competitiveness had certainly been lost for three or four years by 2007 ..... Investment in residential property went to 13pc of our national output in 2006.  That's about double what it should have been.  The share of employment in construction was too high.  But the OECD didn't pick it up at the time, and from reading their reports, which I used to do, I didn't pick it up.</blockquote>The 2003 OECD report said that tax incentives that boost demand in an already overheated residential market should be cut.  The 2006 report stated:<blockquote>Domestic risks were important too, of which the most prominent was the risk of overshooting housing prices.  Although a soft landing was considered the most likely scenario, a sharper fall could not be ruled out.</blockquote>Did you miss these warnings when you were reading the OECD reports?</p></speech>

I ... but you know ... Deputy, you've been reading these things massively and I ... I admire you for all you have to do in that, but you ... you can see what they do.  They give the upsides and they give the downsides and they give conclusions, they give some criticism, they give some praise.  But I do accept what I said in that article is true.  Competitiveness, of course, is a loose term that's thrown around.</p><p>But competitiveness, when I was talking in that article and many other times that I have accepted, and this is what I do accept more so than I accept the expenditure argument, I accept that we got the competitiveness issue wrong.  Competitiveness in its broadest sense, it covers a wide range of factors, it includes productivity, quality of output, innovation, sales, marketing expertise, quality of infrastructure, and I suppose, mainly salaries.  That's what competitiveness is, and we did, I think from the period 2000 on ... miss out that we were losing market share and we were losing our competitiveness and, you know, if you were doing things differently, that issue, I would argue some of the other issues, but I think that issue I don't argue about, because I think that broad definition of competitiveness, we were letting, we were switching, we were switching from exports, which in most of my political career in Finance, I was always ... my paranoia was keep exports high, because that gave us more consumption, that gave us domestic demand.  But then we lost on the export and we moved to domestic demand and that was the mistake that we made.</p><p> If you look at what Germany did in the same period, they went the other way, gained 10% competitiveness.

Capital, we were being advised by all the organisations that that was the right thing to do, that we still had infrastructural deficits, so I think on the current side, we should have tightened up, on the capital side, 10% was high, because overall, we were working to a 5% on infrastructure, 5% of GNP.  On the current side, it was time to be getting tighter at that stage.</p></speech>

The amount of taxation that was directly related to the residential ... to property was too high ... too high and, you know, I accept responsibility for that.  I was head of Government ... 24%, almost 25% in the economy, you know ... you know, that was ghastly when you look back at it ... you see it.  On the other side, you look at what the banks did ... you know, the Nyberg report, all that happened on the banking side.  But the bit I'm not too sure of ... the international crisis that came on top of it ... talk about all the cards being played against you in one go, Chairman.  I think sometimes we forget ... internationally ... just the extent of what was happening worldwide in those few months.  Rightly so, we looked at what was happening in Ireland and how it was effecting us and the banks ... and ... but look at what was happening worldwide, the extent of the investment bank system ... the banking system put the world under ... to get that on top of our problems ... I'm not defending our problems.  I've said the two vulnerabilities that were there - one I take for responsibility for, I take no responsibility - none - for what was happening in the Central Bank or in the Financial Regulator because I had no knowledge or control over it, despite what people think and accuse me of.  But the international hit ... the international hit was just massive and I think that ... to, kind of, say that had nothing to do with it does ... I'm not ... if I was here with him, I had have an argument with him but he's not.  But I just think that is too harsh a statement and I would like be able to argue that point with him.</p></speech>

And then, just about mistakes that you think were made by your successors in government in the Department in Finance... if you thought any mistakes were made?  Because again, from that same interview in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in November 2014, when you were asked about the pressure that Jean-Claude Trichet was putting on Brian Lenihan, you said:<blockquote><br /><br />The reality in life is when you're around a long time, maybe the mistakes you make the first time, when you do them about the sixth time [you don't do it again].  When you're doing it the first time, it's not so easy. But that's what's called, in inverted commas, experience.</blockquote>Did you feel that Brian Lenihan did not have enough experience to be the Minister for Finance and if mistakes were made, what mistakes were they?</p></speech>

I think they did their very best in the circumstances that were there.  But it wasn't easy for them.  You know both ... they ... I remember during the currency crisis the then Governor of the Central Bank saying to me that, ''I was unlucky in one way and I was lucky in another'', and I asked him what did he mean and it was Maurice Doyle, a very good Governor of the Central Bank.  And he said "You are unlucky to be here when there is a currency crisis to the extent and the level that it is.  But you are lucky to be here to gain the experience in this particular time" and, you know, it was that time that we had the group which afterwards, was like the domestic banking group.  During that whole currency, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, Sean Cromien, Michael Somers, who was head of NTMA, Maurice O'Connell who was, who was later Governor of the Central Bank, we met three, four times a week working and getting through that crisis.  So, you do, you do I think, Deputy appreciate, you gain a lot of experience from that for me to say would it have made any difference.</p></speech>

You must have seen the files."  I know you people here are experts on this issue now.

Mr. Ahern, you were a renowned constituency worker, and you had a huge reputation in that area and as somebody who had a very, very strong relationship with their constituency.  In that regard, I'd imagine that you would have had a very busy advice centre or centres during the course of your term, even as Taoiseach, not ... besides when you were a backbencher.  Did you have people coming into your constituency clinics who were saying that it was getting harder and harder to buy a home, that the affordability of buying a home was becoming beyond their reach?  We have evidence that's been before the inquiry that shows that the average house went, in a ten-year period, up ten times, and that the difficulties of getting a mortgage were going out from 20 years to 35 years, 40 years, which meant that when their child was going to university, which should be at the latter end of a 20-year mortgage, was now half, only midway through a mortgage, and these type of difficulties.  Did your constituents bring these concerns to you?  And, if they did, can you tell us how you reflected that in government then?</p></speech>

That was the reason we spent an enormous amount of time ... maybe we did too good of a job on the supply side, but ... to trying to build up supply.  It was our view, maybe mistaken, but ... that if we got the supply side right that that would solve that problem, and that we would get equilibrium and we would get the prices. to drop down.  But what did we do?  I mean, all the initiatives, the serviced land initiative, all the affordability issues we put ... I personally put a huge amount of time with the members, social partners, and trying to talk to some of the construction sectors about trying to help the affordability issue, giving State land, doing the SZC, the zoning areas in the land, trying to narrow down what were the designated taxes.  I should have said earlier, sorry, I think, when I was answering a question to Deputy Doherty, but we were attempting to narrow down the designation to try and get more affordability into the issue.  I had changed the section 23s.  I saw them one of the days when I was watching the hearing.  Section 23s; I limited that back to designated areas.  Before that a builder could get a section 23 loan anywhere.  We changed that.  I think I changed it back when I was in Finance.  And then we changed it again to bring in the integrated areas, so all the time we were trying to ... and we were trying to help on affordability.</p></speech>

But there were a ... there were a lot of reasons for this, Chairman, that, you know, in '99, if you see the ... where the curve starts going up in 1999, that's the year we made the change as well from gross to net, which meant that a person on the average industrial wage could get up to about 400,000 pound ... or euro, we were euro then, &euro;400,000 for a mortgage.  So that one decision drove the ability of that gross to net, and the age structure when the building society extending the loans.</p><p>So, we were ... and these weren't issues that I agreed with, but they were putting pressure on us.  And back in 2005, Chairman, when the loan to value went to 100% ... I mean, the loan to value, if I can just say this, Chairman, because I think it's an important point, and I didn't hear it here but may ... I've watched as much as I could, the loan to value, when it went to 100%, the only reason a bank gave a loan to value for 100% is because they wanted the price to go up.  Because, banks don't give money to ... for no profit, and by it's very self, if you give 100% loan, and if it doesn't go up, you're making no profit.  So, by their very practice they were pushing it up.  And yet at time when we were cooling it - and we did say this, and it was said to the banks and it was said by the Department of the Environment - they were pushing this up and then it takes off again.  So there were a number, along with supply and demand, there were a number of policy decisions that were made that drove that and made it more difficult.  And the policy would have only worked if we had have started getting ... decreasing which didn't happen until 2007.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Ahern.  You have apologised for mistakes that you made during your tenure as Taoiseach and so far in your evidence what I have picked up is an acknowledgement of a mistake in terms of public spending, that it was too much, the loss of competitiveness, and I think an acknowledgement of the over-dependence on construction and property.  Are there any other areas where you believe mistakes were made, or do you believe that those are the key ones?  Is that what you're apologising for?</p></speech>

The expenditure late on.  I defended it on the percentage but I think when you go late on definitely that wasn't a wise issue and it was wrong.  And I suppose as I said I can't ... I can't apologise for issues I hadn't got control over.  But I do apologise to myself that I didn't know about them because at least you might have been able to do something about them and in the Office of the Taoiseach you would have been able to do about that.  I mean I don't think it's good enough for the future that the data that's available to us now, about the size of loans, looking backwards, I don't think that's data that shouldn't be there on a current basis in future, because then you don't have to put names on it, but at least you would have been able to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

Of course, my defence on that, of course it was too high, can't ... can't defend that, but remember, Deputy, where we thought we were going was back to 55,000, 60,000.  And I had regularly looked at what the adjustment would be if you were going from 80, 75, I mean, I think that's in some of the papers that it's 0.5% in the short term, 1% in the longer term.  And that would have pushed up employment, but it seemed to be reasonable that, yes there would have been some unemployment in the construction industry, we wouldn't have had 230,000 people, we wouldn't have had 13.3%, we wouldn't have had investment to 16%, but it did seem sustainable, if we were on 55%, to be able to still have, cyclically, a balanced budget, or near to balance, and still not put up the debt-GDP ratio.</p></speech>

As you know, there was a principles-led approach or "light touch" as it has become commonly known.  Did any of that have its origins in Government policy, in legislation?  Could the Government have dictated that ... "We want a more intrusive approach"?</p></speech>

And they are allowed - both from a banking stability point of view and from a prudential point of view - to be able to deal with their own affairs exclusively.  And I think that's the situation we have.  And I know from my long experience - maybe it'll change in the future and maybe it should - but if you ask me ... my long experience dealing with governors of central banks, and I've dealt with a lot, you don't ... they will not allow you ... even if you ask a vague question or a broad question, they will not allow you inside their remit.  I'm not saying I ever tried but that is something that is guarded by them and guarded, in particular, in the European Central Bank.  When the European Central Bank were formed, they very early put down their foot and boot that they were independent and that they were going to hold this strong position into the future.  So I don't think that the political system could have done anything about that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, you've acknowledged that the property industry turned, as such, in 2006 and that you were very concerned by August 2007 about the overall economic situation.  Now, as we know, a lot of ... a lot of your time was presumably taken up with the Mahon tribunal.  Between September and December 2007 you made a number of appearances and the issue first broke in September 2006, when <i>The Irish Times</i>published an article that the tribunal was examining some issues relating to your own personal finances.  But, given that you were entering into a crisis period in government, to what extent, if any, did the backdrop of the Mahon tribunal and the amount of time that you must have had to devote to it and the worry it must have presented for you personally ... did that impact in any way on your performance as Taoiseach, on the attention which you were able to give to the issues which were emerging?</p></speech>

I, kind of, ignored the tribunal to my own detriment later because I didn't realise what the game was down there but it did not affect my job as Taoiseach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GGG01000"><p>But in your statement on 2 April 2008 - you cited it -my reading of it is essentially the main reason why you were resigning:<blockquote><br /><br />It is a matter of real concern to me [you said] that the important work of government and party is now being overshadowed by issues relating to me at the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.<br /><br />The constant barrage of commentary on tribunal-related matters has and I believe will continue to dominate the political agenda at an important point for our country.</blockquote>So it came to that point at the end where you felt you had to go because of the extent to which the Mahon tribunal was dominating political discourse.  But, in the months leading up to that, was it not also a dominant part of your life, that you were having to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

I'll just clarify it.  It didn't affect my job because I didn't give much time to it, to be honest with you, other than maybe Sunday nights or answering the endless letters I used to get from them.</p><p>But it was ... it became a daily issue, not just for me, but for my Cabinet colleagues and it was, you know ... and as I say in that statement, I think you've read a piece, where I say that it is a serious time.  There are serious economic problems and serious economic difficulties and the attention has to be on them, on those issues, not on me.  And it was the case ... I mean, I know it's natural and I don't say this as a criticism because I'll get more criticism if it's meant as that but, like, if I went out to say that there was a severe ... a serious issue on liquidity and that we need to be careful where we're going economically, the first question I was asked was not about the liquidity.  And then it became an issue that every one of my colleagues, if they went out and said it, that was the question, and that was the reason.  I had no intention other than ... those last few months.  I would have stayed on, not like some former leaders, as I said, 'until they were 80, but I certainly would have stayed on for another 18 months.</p></speech>

We had grown massively.  The effects of the change in the availability of cheap money.  The fact we were growing in employment so fast.  We grew from, I mean, 1.4 million, I think, when I came into office ... like, if you go back when I was chairman of the Cabinet committee 20 years ago, there was 950,000 people working.  In a very fast period, we went from 950,000 to 2.1 million.  We were growing ... in the 20-year period from '87 to 2007, we grew by about 7% a year.  You know, the scale of the budget and the economic catch-up, and then surpassing the catch-up, was just enormous.  So I think the jumps we made, and we made many of them successfully, but when you take the collective magnitude of them, it caught us in the end.  And so many of them came in that 2008 period.  There was no breaks, and that's why I'd a lot of sympathy for my colleagues when I was gone, because never could I see a situation where so many things, where the investment banks of the world, the banks were falling all over the place - big banks, big institutions that were there for generations - and all of that coming against what we had achieved, it was just too big and that's ... so it wasn't any one thing.  It wasn't that there was, you know, there was tax designations and there was tax breaks or that we were just ... you know, we were building too much.  It was ... just wasn't one thing; it was the collective enormity of probably seven or eight of those things coming together and ... as they did, all in 2008.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Ahern.</p><p>Firstly, can I ask you: in the late 1990s capital gains tax and profits from land sales was reduced to 20% to boost supply in the residential rental market.  When it became apparent that land prices had soared due to speculative demand for housing in the years between 2003 and 2008, was there consideration given to increasing capital gains tax?</p></speech>

It was considered at the time that it was a beneficial thing to do because the rules were streamlined as well.  As you know, there was a huge amount of legislation and regulation governing capital gains but from the time it came down until the crisis, I don't think there was consideration given.</p></speech>

And as well, as you know, it was a very cumbersome system, there were all kind of ... it was a great business for accountants at the time, ducking and diving around the legislation and the laws around the capital gains, so Minister McCreevy, who was very familiar with it, thought this was a, a straightforward way of doing it.  You'd reduce the taxes but also simplify the whole regulation ... regulations around it.  And then, I'm not sure about the ... if capital gains obviously would have brought in more revenue.  To be frank, I think that, I wonder would it have been better for us if, when I amended ... I mean there was a property tax issue there from the '80s and I changed it again in '92-'93, and then it was decided not to pursue it and then we didn't ... when I came in I didn't pursue it either.  I think it would have been better if we had kept a property tax there.  That would have been more effective to be honest with you.</p></speech>

I'd ... I'd have to say my self-proclaimed socialist principles haven't changed either but I think we should have kept a property tax.  It would have, that from '93 ... because of course the Department of Finance idea was to bring it in at a certain rate and then to change it and I did that in '93.  It would have made more sense to keep that there because it would have been a good revenue buffer and it might have simplified things too.</p></speech>

When we were building 88,000 houses in 2008, affordability was a bigger issue.  I think the affordability, it just ... it kept on creeping up.  I mean we had the initiative in the social partnership of 15,000 affordable houses but in the '98 - '99 period, that's when it really crystalised, and the Chairman is correct in this, where you had ... it's always the example when the teacher was marrying the nurse, you know, or maybe the nurse marrying the teacher but - politically correct - but it, it was that they couldn't afford a house, even taking their salaries in.  The response to the lenders that time was to change it from gross to net.  Now that substantially increased the amount of the mortgage that they could get.  I'm not sure that was a good idea, but anyway it, it helped at the time.  And then they increased, immediately afterwards, the 25.  Twenty-25, 20 was the regular at that time, there was very few on 25, they switched that up.  But I think that ... that was the affordability issue, which I distinguish totally from the other issue.</p></speech>

I don't know where it took place, inside or outside of a tent ... but, on 2 August, 2000 ... by a Mr. Michael Walsh, who was a senior person in lending, I think, in EBS, in relation to the introduction of the SSIA scheme.  And it was followed up by a detailed letter from the chief executive of EBS at the time, Pat O'Reilly, on 29 August, in which he referenced the meeting that had taken place between Minister McCreevy at the time and Mr. Walsh.  What was your own view with regard to the introduction of the scheme?  Were you involved in its drafting?  And were you aware that, at least from the documents we've seen, the genesis of it seems to have been in race week in Galway in 2000?</p></speech>

One, it would take money out of the system, take heat out of the system, and, you know, disposable incomes were far higher.  And, as well as that, it was a good thing for a new generation of people</p></speech>

Oh, I liked to have savings schemes. Now I think Deputy McCreevy said he thought it all up himself, and nobody else thought about it.  Well, you know, maybe so.  I'm not claiming that I thought it up, but there were a lot of people talking about it at the time, so if he wants sole rights of inventing it, I'll give them to him, but I think there were a lot of people talking about a savings scheme, and that this was a way of taking inflationary pressures out.  And I did agree with it.  Okay, you'll say, the only downside, I suppose, which we didn't know at the time, was that the very time when people were maturing their saving and were going out into the system, that, maybe was when you didn't need the heat that was there.  But, you know, I don't think that was seen at the time.</p></speech>

I think you can, you see it there, with the policies that brought the success we have to make sure that we respond to the problems such as affordability for some buyers.</p><p>I had been making a number of speeches.  And in the D&aacute;il, more than anything, the issue of affordability was a major issue.  And that group of developers came with a number of ideas about how it could help and they had ideas about getting land or ... you know, in areas in the greater Dublin area where the biggest problem was ... where there were big ... the old corporation schemes, council schemes, where there was land and that if ... a lot of these areas were causing social problems.  That if the land ... if the local authority would give it to the developers, they could build houses which the local authority then could give to people on the local authority list who wanted to buy houses.  So it wasn't a bad idea or if the State would give land where they ... so you'd take ... and part of the reason for that, as you know, Chairman, in the late 90s the cost of land was about 13% of a price of a house and it went up to about close enough to 25% of the price of a house.  So it was a big factor on affordability.  In fact, many of the economists at the time were saying that we should be looking at the land issue as much as any other issue.  But that's what that meeting was about ... it was particularly they advocating that they had a social conscience and they would play ball to try to help to deal with the either social-affordable housing.

Mr. Ahern, you're welcome.  There were two reports, Indecon and Goodbodys, and they outlined the effects and the costs for the State for the property tax incentives in February ... and they were published in February '06.  Indecon reports stated "extremely high-cost and wasteful mechanism to achieve objectives", and recommended an immediate end to tax breaks for student accommodation, multistorey car parks and hotels.  Can you outline the costs and/or benefits or were there benefits, in relation to these tax incentives prior to the reports?</p></speech>

There was always this issue about ... which I used to argue with Finance about the issue of tax foregone.  The reports show the costs, I think, and you know the tax ... the incentives were around from '86 on.  I mean, the whole concept of that in 1986 was that the ... it was an ... it came from an American scheme, the urban renewal.  It came from American cities where there were ... where they were looking at old docklands and old rundown areas and then it moved to the dockland in England, the Isle of Dogs and all these places.  Now they're very ... very expensive parts of Canary Wharf, isn't it, where the troubles were?  And you know, that ... that's were the designation concept came.  Then it came into us here, too.  It came in too broad and then there was agreement that the section 23 be changed to narrow it down.</p><p>Then it was narrowed down again, only into integrated area plans.  I worry a little bit, if I can say, Chairman, that the idea floats out that designation was given anywhere.  Like it ... in ... it had to be an integrated area plan specified by the local authority to an area where they considered there was extremely high deprivation and were money wouldn't otherwise come.  Like, in the old days, when section 23 was there, you got the same tax benefit if you built in Howth or Foxrock as you did for my constituency.  So nobody built in my constituency.  So when it was narrowed down, that's where the whole thing came from.  And, yes, there was a cost.  Now, Finance used to say - now, Finance do a good job and I was always pro-Finance and I liked Finance when I was there, I'd a great time - but they would say, ''That's a tax forgone''.  But if somebody has &euro;10 million to invest and they invest it into a deprived area, a development into the designated areas as we did; yes, there was a tax on it but if they put it into some other country ... and remember &euro;10 billion ... &euro;10 billion, which is a big figure even today, was going out of this country per annum into developments in other countries.

In evidence previously, in evidence yesterday, actually, Mr. McCarthy, your Secretary General, said he didn't read the financial stability reports.  In previous evidence Ministers - your Ministers for Finance, Minister Cowen and McCreevy - both also clearly stated that they didn't have any handle in terms of the commercial real estate sector, in terms of Anglo Irish Bank.  You said previously today that you looked at the deficit and income and expenditure when you were preparing for budgets.

I think I had a reputation, and it's well known within officialdom, if not politically, that I used to read a huge amount of documentation, so I tended to ... I tended to read, because of my finance days, and I'd been dealing with finance issues from the time I came into government in '87, because I worked with the then Minister for Finance on the social partnership arrangements, so we ...

Dan McLaughlin has said that was the sector that collapsed the banks.  Your Ministers for Finance, both of them, have said they didn't know what was going on in commercial real estate sector or with Anglo.  Your Secretary General said he didn't even read the reports.

Like, I'd have to tell you this, and I don't want not to say it because it wouldn't be honest, like, there were 750 people in the Central Bank, or Central Bank-regulator.  When I was in Departments, staffs were small enough.  Finance was hard-pressed.  I thought there were loads of these people and I thought they had loads of time to be checking this and reading this and reading that.  And then I see that if you take the main five banks they've about 15 or 20 is all that was supervising.  I was horrified when I saw that, horrified.</p></speech>

You said you read the financial stability reports, and you can ... if you can bring them up, the '04, '05, '06 and '07, which was the final report, and I've ... I've pursued this line with other witnesses.  In 1997 the level of household indebtedness was 71% of GDP.  In 2007, the final FSR report, the level of indebtedness had gone to 248%, highest in the OECD.  And you said, as you were preparing for budgets, you were there to protect the budget and put in place an expenditure programme but who was supposed to protect the citizens when there was over-borrowing to that degree that we were, that the citizens of this country-----?</p></speech>

I think there's sometimes, even now, now, even today there's an over-concentration of what happened - I'm not talking about the committee, I'm just talking about the debate - in the residential side.  I mean, look, look what happened in the ... in the ... in the commercial property side.  I mean, there ... there was where the madness really took place, where it zoomed from nearly nothing to extraordinary increases, with no collateral behind the individuals that had it, to the property was all over the world.  It was doled out like confetti or snuff at a wake, right?</p><p>And, that ... I think, that was a bigger issue.  Now, who should have seen it?  Well, the job ... it was the job of the regulator.

The Chairman, earlier, stated that there was a period in '05 ... a lot of witnesses have said there was a period in late '05, early '06, that if steps had been taken, that the downturn here wouldn't have been as severe.  But anything beyond that, it was only a question of how severely the downturn was going to be.

Thanks very much for being here.  Mr. Cowen mentioned, in his statement, when he was in, that his budgets were based on responsible fiscal targets at the time.  However, during the course, we heard about the Wright report, and it said that the Minister was advised that the country was depending on unsustainable tax revenues and the economy had been dramatically overheated, and that problems would emerge, which were due to domestic policies, and that a more sustainable fiscal position had to be maintained.

In the early times, that was probably seen as a good thing.  You know the old "neither borrower nor lender be" but that went out the door and really the banks moved to a position where they could get without exchange risks ... I mean in the old days, when I was in Finance, the exchange only went at that stage, so it was a very tight position and it was not just because of borrowing and lending because it was the exchange regulations.</p></speech>

It says, in the article, the then Minister for housing, Noel Ahern, spoke of Irish housing, &quot;banks and financial institutions of 'greed' and 'reckless behaviour' and of 'hyping up' the property market with 100% mortgages and interest [rates]&quot; - I am quoting continually here:<blockquote><br /><br />Despite the record supply of new homes in 2004 and 2005, Ahern said the prices of houses was likely to increase by more than 10% again this year.  &quot;The rampant competition from market share between financial institutions is one of the factors why all predictions for house prices have been wrong.  They are creating a false demand which developers are cashing in on,&quot; the minister said.  [I am just going to finish now in a second.]  The banks hyped it up at a time when everything was going well.  It's all about market share.</blockquote>It goes on, in the same article it happens to say where the regulator, Mr. Liam O'Reilly, chief executive of the Financial Regulator, &quot;had warned that 100% mortgages were niche products that should not be marketed at a mass audience&quot;.  It goes on significantly from that.  You would have been aware, not least of the role of the other Deputy Ahern at the time of his role as Minister for housing, that these were valid concerns and how right he seems to have turned out to be.  What actions would have been taken or what was your view of his views at that time, which, as we have heard from Senator D'Arcy was still at least to some peoples' minds within a timeframe that action could have been taken to usefully reduce our exposures?</p></speech>

The one that was always alight was the 100% loan-to-value scheme, it wasn't the only one, there were other ones.  He believed strongly - or his Department - that prices were decreasing at that stage and there was stability in the system and at least they were getting to some stability in the system and that this was going to hype it up again.</p><p>And the Minister of housing and his officials felt very strongly about this and they wrote to the regulator and they wrote to the Central Bank, I think, and the Department and they made quite an issue about it over that summer.  And to the best of my recollection, there were a number of meetings held between the Department of housing and the regulator at that stage about those issues.  There were guarantees being given.  I know about ... that the 100% loans weren't that much, though I saw in some of the correspondence I think you sent me that in ... there's one stage it's mentioned that, in 2006 or 2007, there was 100% ... or a third of the loans were given out on the 100%.  So there wasn't much control over that.  But the view was, their view, that it was only to be used in very isolated ways.  But the Minister of housing - it happened to be my brother at that stage - felt very strongly that this was a disaster, that they were hyping it and going against the trend of where we should be.  But he wrote and there were meetings and it was followed through and-----</p></speech>

Would it have made a huge difference?  I think it would have made some difference, I'm not saying it would have ... but it certainly ... the banks were looking for market share and I think I said, in reply to the Chairman earlier on this afternoon, the very fact that they gave 100% loan-to-values, or anything near it, meant that they were speculating against an increase.  Because you don't give 100% with no guarantee because you were going to make no profit for the banks unless you believed that the price was going to go up.  So his point, his central point, and that of his officials - because I know there were a lot of letters and documentation at the time about it - was that this was hyping the price.</p></speech>

I think we were very responsible.  You asked me, in hindsight, if I knew that when there was a hole in the budget would we, as Germany did ... built up a surplus that you would deal with that difficulty.  Of course, in hindsight, you would do that.  But each year I, and Ministers, and I think the country ... economic analysis of Ireland ... remember we were held up as the model worldwide for a long time, that we were doing the right thing.</p></speech>

Did you make any plans to deal with the "Well, what if some of those do come to pass?"  Or, did you read them and make a decision to keep going?</p></speech>

I was always concerned that, as we chased supply ... and all our efforts were to try to deal and build enough houses to deal with the demand that was there, that was the right thing to be doing ... supply.  When it went over that figure, I was concerned.  Like, when we went to 65,000 - whatever it went, 65,000, 77,000, and 88,000; I think they were the three years - I was very concerned about that because I couldn't understand why the sustainable level that all these reports had been telling me for years would have been between 50,000 and 60,000.  Now, I did discuss that and I remember being told that I didn't factor in ... I didn't factor in the supply side correctly, because between 2004 and 2006 the population went up 300,000.  So if you factored in that, the 55,000 would go up.  And that was a credible enough answer, in fairness.</p></speech>

I think you have these documents, DOF03151.  This was a briefing document ... so I'm assuming that these would have been briefing documents you would have known about.  The Department was saying &quot;We are now factoring a &euro;2 billion shortfall in taxes but have not publicised this as yet.&quot;  This is May 2008.  &quot;This represents a significant worsening of the position for this year, with serious consequential impacts for next year.&quot;  And then it goes on to say in relation to the banks:<blockquote><br /><br />There's a virtual cessation of normal wholesale lending activity.  There is general negative international sentiment against Ireland.  The concerns that initially led to credit markets seizing up last August are persisting.  Major financial institutions continue to disclose major write-downs.</blockquote>So these were the briefing notes passed between Departments at this point.  What does that tell you about the state of the economy as you closed the door and left?</p></speech>

I think the entire second half, maybe even the three quarters of 2007, houses ... the number of houses, and thereby the revenues, were going down.  It was showing that we were going to be stretched in 2008 and all the reports show that.  But equally, as I said earlier on, even in the growth and stability pact of December 2007, the Department of Finance, which would have been going to Brussels in January 2008, the Department of Finance were indicating that we would grow 3% in 2008 and 3% in 2009.</p></speech>

I believed that the place was in good order but that we had problems and the problems were the liquidity.  We had that ... while houses were coming down, that didn't upset me, but we were still going to grow by 3% and 5%, and, as I said before, in 2008, even though we lost 28,000 jobs in construction, which was because of the houses coming down ... sorry, 20,000 jobs ... we were able to take all of those up in financial services.  So we were still managing to deal effectively with what was the turn down in houses.  And that was my view maybe until the summer.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, under the terms of reference of the banking inquiry, one of the issues that has to be looked at is the role of the Oireachtas in the matter of regulatory and supervisory systems and practices.  During your term as Taoiseach, do you believe that Oireachtas committees were structured so as to have sufficient authority to effectively examine financial matters, fiscal matters or regulatory matters?</p></speech>

And, I think, one of the advantages of the committees is that they can call people in and they can discuss it but, as you recall, Deputy, there were very ... there was very little debate on these issues in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#XXX03000"><p>And, Mr. Ahern, issues that witnesses at this inquiry have identified as causing the inflation of a major property bubble - and then which caused a major crash - for example, exponential increase in lending by banks, particularly in property, major speculation and profiteering in building land and rocketing house prices, can you remember being challenged, either by committees of the Oireachtas or even in the Houses of the Oireachtas in a significant way on any or all of these issues that caused you to have serious pause for thought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#XXX03100"><p>No.  No.  On the issue the Chairman raised earlier on about affordability of housing and the inability of the ordinary, you know, Joe and Mary to be able to get their mortgage and to be able to get a house ... on the affordability issue, that was raised, you know, probably every week in questions.</p><p>But on the banking issues or you know the ... the major issues as they turned out to be ... very little, issues about speculation ... land speculation, the land issue.  As you know I, I was pressed in the House to go back and look at land prices when it was showing that land prices had moved from 12% of the cost of house to 25%, to go back and look at the housing report names ... the Kenny report of years earlier and I did that.  I spent a considerable amount of time with the then Attorney General looking to see what could we do short of a constitutional referendum on property rights, which we weren't very anxious to get engaged in.  So that issue was raised a lot.</p></speech>

You may remember in 2004 it was raised in the Oireachtas, where a syndicate of rich people had bought 11 acres of building land in Stillorgan only four years before, had got planning permission and then sold it for a gain of &euro;32 million, and your Government had reduced corporation ... capital gains tax to enrich them further.  Why didn't you take action to stop that type of profiteering and speculation?</p></speech>

I mean you're correct in in was there an anti-speculation tax to stop that.  There wasn't but what we had been endeavouring to do from 1997 on was to try to get more land and to try and streamline the difficulties there were to try and get more land built on, not zoned, because there was more than adequate land zoned.  But it was to try to get into a situation where we would have more building where we could get supply up.  And we were very active in doing that.  But because the prices kept going up ... were developers making more money on that?  Of course they were.</p></speech>

Establish the relationship and then make the question.</p></speech>

But I don't believe that in trying to build supply and trying to get more houses built ... yes, you could say you're encouraging builders to build more houses because we had to move from a situation where we'd 40,000 houses to 60,000 houses or 55,000 houses.  But it was our position to try and get more and more supply.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern ... two issues in regard to that.  Ms Elaine Byrne in evidence to this inquiry, found that between 1997 and 2007, of the &euro;1.8 million donated to Fianna F&aacute;il, and anything &euro;5,000 or under did not have to be notified, but of what was notified, 35% or &euro;635,970, was from property and construction interests.  Is that not significant?  And, secondly, did tribunals show the corruption of councillors, some from your party, by property and developer interest, who were bribed by these profits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#YYY00800"><p>It did.  And that is a matter of record.  But I don't believe that anything we were trying to do as a Government, other than trying to encourage supply, was wrong.  We had to get to ... house prices, or the demand for houses were going up for many reasons; people had more money, people had jobs, the demographics of the country.  We were ... we'd only 1.1 million houses at one stage, we got it up to 1.9 million houses.  But even at that, <i>pro rata</i>against other countries we hadn't got enough of houses.  So what happened was too much of it came together.  But I don't think we were wrong in the early years in particular to try to get up supply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#ZZZ00100"><p>Mr. Ahern, you said earlier that you take no responsibility for what the banks, or indeed the Central Bank or the regulator did.  You don't take responsibility for alleged perhaps ... whatever, in that regards.  But I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that you have to take responsibility for this reason; that you launched the Better Regulation in 2004 and in your foreword it's quite clear that regulation was to be subordinated to allowing the banks to have sharp competition for profits.  And, secondly, can I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that in a speech to the Irish Bankers Federation in March 2006 and the federation of international bankers, you said the following, "I know that your industry is bottom line driven and I can assure you that the Government is very conscious of its role in assisting you to maintain a healthy bottom line."  So the points that I would ask you to comment is this; that you were a main sponsor of light-touch regulation which allowed them to do what they did and not only that, but this shows that you were encouraging their profiteering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#ZZZ00200"><p>Well, dealing with both issues, I never launched or wrote a foreword to any document that was to do with light-touch regulation.  The document of 2004 was for good regulation, for better regulation, based on the OECD efforts at the time that countries should not be regulating in areas that were not necessary and that for poor regulation which was affecting economic progress and stability of economies.  So there was no ... the principles that were laid out in the better Government regulations or was entirely different.  So I think the purpose that you've put on it is just misleading it, either intentionally or deviously.  What was your second question?</p></speech>

I did ... I ... though at times I'd be a bit like yourself I think nationalising banks mightn't be a bad idea, but even if you were ... they were nationalised they'd need to be profitable so I wasn't against the banks making a profit.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern you said in your opening speech page 2:<blockquote><br /><br />The main economic problems facing Ireland in the mid-1990s were high unemployment, net emigration, relatively low incomes and the need for increased productivity.  A decade later these problems were substantially solved.</blockquote>And then you said Mr. Ahern in page 19, reminding younger Members of the Oireachtas, when you came to the House in '77:<blockquote>National debt was an unsustainable millstone ... 20 % of all taxes raised in the State were used to service the national debt.  In 2007, my last full year as Taoiseach, that figure stood as low as 4.3%.</blockquote>Can I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that it would be delusional to think that that, or to allow that, or hope that that would be your legacy, when the gigantic property bubble which happened on your watch, created a situation where a few years later, you had the return of precisely the evils that you described of unemployment, mass emigration and a huge national debt and 20% currently, unfortunately, of taxes going to service that debt?</p></speech>

Unemployment ... but thankfully we didn't go back to where we're going, we're back at 9% now and in fairness to the current Government, this year's current budget deficit will be down to 2.5%.  It's going to take us a while to get the debt-GDP ratio down.  But, Deputy, I have to say if the corrective action over many, many years was not taken to decrease what was a very, very high debt, we would have been in a really difficult position.  I do accept that some of the very good indicators that I'd worked most of my political life to achieve were badly reversed.  I accept that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, the programme for Government and social partnerships created a need to finance pre-agreed commitments from available revenues.  Can you discuss the extent to which, in your opinion, such long-term political commitments influenced and constrained the Government's budgetary decisions?</p><p>And I'm referencing, Chairman, page 101 Vol. 3, and also page 81, Vol. 3.  So page 101 initially, which is from the Wright report.  And that's basically, Mr. Wright basically says that <blockquote><br /><br />the Programme for Government and Social Partnership ... helped overwhelm the budget process.  Instead of providing an appropriate fiscal framework for [privatisation] of competing demands [prioritisation, rather,] ... the Budget essentially paid the bills for these dominant processes.  Relatively clear advice to Cabinet in June on the risk of excessive spending and tax reductions was lost by the time of December Budgets.</blockquote>And specifically figure 26, on page 81, encapsulates this and that's really, I suppose, what I want to ask Mr. Ahern about.  Can you explain, first of all, you continually speak about taking responsibilities for the areas that you're responsible for.  Do you take responsibility for the budgets in your time as Taoiseach?</p></speech>

Can you explain why in all the budgets, we'll say, between 1999 and 2008, the amount that gave rise, the actual budget day outcome, the amount that was spent in the budget itself, was significantly more in many years than the actual document, the fiscal framework, that was presented to the Cabinet by the Minister of Finance in June?</p></speech>

Just one matter I just want to deal with in general with regards to Mr. Cowen's testimony and then just an item that comes back to your earlier comment there, Mr. Ahern.  In a statement to the banking inquiry, Brian Cowen discussed the announcement of the restructuring of tax incentives to the end of 2005 stating:<blockquote><br /><br />This decision did not gain favour with many interested parties in the property market.  It also represented a decisive policy shift, because over a long period, successive Governments since 1985 had added more new property incentives rather than engage in wholesale abolition of existing incentives..</blockquote>Would you interpret this remark as a criticism of your role in Government over the proceeding years?</p></speech>

I think the Minister wanted to bring an end to the incentives.  He was right to bring an end.  As we have said, it went too high.  When it went over 50,000, the number of houses being built too high and anything that created ... that led to that had to be looked at.  And one of the big issues that he believed was the property incentives.</p></speech>

And what you will see there is how cyclical taxes, by the late 1990s, were in around 15% or so, or just maybe a little bit above it.</p><p>And by 2006 had rose to 30%.  They had doubled in that period of time.  So that would be the total tax take of corporation tax, capital gains tax, but in particularly it relates to stamp duties and other cyclical tax measures.  Would you consider that to be a proportionate or disproportionate percentage of the tax take in terms of tax balance? </p></speech>

So even in regards to your earlier comments that there was a banking crisis coming down the tracks, was there not also a fiscal crisis coming down the tracks?  Because these were what might in layperson's terms be called consumption taxes, and as soon as the economy slowed down consumption would stop, and cyclical taxes would stop with it.</p></speech>

Neither did I believe ... I think in 2012 that came down to 11%.  As I said earlier on, the judgment was that we would have to correct somewhere from 55,000 to 88,000 which was the figure that everybody gave.  We couldn't have controlled the situation of bringing it from 88,000 to 8,000 which is what happened, but that was never a consideration because we never believed we'd have to make that correction.  Unfortunately, unfortunately that correction had to be made ultimately.</p></speech>

So we had that expenditure running ahead of GDP, we had this massive cyclical tax thing, we had a difficulty in the banking section.  But would you have a view that Ireland's crisis was not ultimately a banking crisis in isolation, that there was a cyclical tax crisis that was coming down the tracks, or not?</p></speech>

But the position, Chairman, at the time, and I know your committee knew ... I've heard you several times saying you're anxious to know what the state of mind was at the time, and what the state of mind is now.  But if I could give you at the time: at the time was 30% of unsustainable taxes was too high, but the proportion of what we believed would be sustainable was something building about 30,000 ... 55,000 houses.  And it was ... if you take it that roughly 1% per 10,000 houses, we were talking about an adjustment, on the budgetary side, of 3%, or maybe 3.5%, which we believed was totally sustainable, and that the employment effect would have put up employment up to 7%.  And what I've said in my statement, not to dwell on it, but what the ESRI pointed out, where they saw the vulnerabilities, and they were quite critical, and a very good organisation, and their independence I accept and admire and worked under for many years, but they looked at what the period was by 2005 to 2010, and 2010 to 2015, and they were looking at even a less tough hit.

I do acknowledge Morgan Kelly got it right more than [the] others.</blockquote>Could I contrast that with a few pages earlier, on page 52, where you say:<blockquote>I wasn't responsible for the Central Bank or ... the Financial Regulator.  They're independent under the 1941 Act.  I wasn't privy to what was going on in the boardrooms of the banks.  There were plenty of very important people there.  No bank director ever came to me to say that there were problems.</blockquote>Didn't you need a Morgan Kelly to tell you that there were problems, the loan to value, the loan to deposits, credit growing at 20% or 30% a year when Germany was 4% in the same currency area, that you did need that kind of advice and you should have, as Taoiseach, taken on all the people there and said &quot;We cannot allow you to run this country over a precipice&quot;?</p></speech>

It's a report by Maynooth; it'll come up on the screen if ... or I think you have the hard copies: "What the data reveal is a pattern of development that ran counter to what one would have expected or hoped for - those local authorities that had the most vacant stock in 2006, subsequently built the most new housing, now have the highest surpluses of stock and have the most land zoned for future use."  So, a gross policy of housing, you know, had all those defects which that report from Maynooth, which is in your volume, show.  Could we have targeted it better?</p></speech>

I mean, I wouldn't sign my name to their ... to the report.  I don't accept that local authorities, just to get levies, property levies, started zoning houses all over the country.  I wouldn't accuse local authorities of doing that, or members of local authorities of doing that.  But, yes, I suppose the end result is that, for the next number of years, we have enough of ... the zoning of the land wasn't the problem, but, even in the height because there ... I think many of the reports had shown that there was sufficient zoned land around.  What there wasn't was sufficient serviced land.  As you recall, Senator, the amount of effort we had to put in in the early years, '97 to 2001, in getting the necessary infrastructure, not just transport infrastructure, but the North Fringe, which was responsible for zoning about 370 hectares of land in north County Dublin just to try to ... and in several other places as well.  and there was a lot of capital expenditure in those years put in to service land that was actually zoned so that housing could be built.  That's not a loss; as housing resumes again, a lot of that infrastructure and the road network and all that is all in place now to allow that organised and sustainable development over the next decade.</p></speech>

Do you think auditing standards in Ireland are high enough in banks?</p></speech>

I mean, in the end of the day, a lot of this was about risk and they had to have been taking the banking figures that ... you know, right up until the end, Senator, the banks were, when they were being asked questions by the regulator, and I criticised the regulator earlier on, but when they were asked questions by the regulator, they were standing over their figures.  They were saying, "These are net worth individuals.  These individuals don't have difficulties", and, even when there was collateral changes between one bank and another, the banks were defending that.  All's I can assume is that the auditors must have been accepting that the capital that the banks had said they put aside to cover those loans was adequate.</p><p>As we all know, and you know in this committee better than anybody, they were far from that.</p></speech>

I tried today to give you how things were.  I certainly wouldn't for a second defend how they should be.  And your question is that ... is it correct that the regulators were fobbed off to the extent that they were, which is what your question is.  And it shouldn't be ... I mean, but to do that, which I think the banks should pay for ... I mean, I think the banks should ... should pay a levy on their profitability for evermore, based on the necessity of the banks being able to employ the experts that they require.  I mean, if you take in these years ... or in the other years were talking about, the profitability of the individual banks was massive.  They were considered to be the most profitable banks in the European Union.  And, still, in the regulatory system, which I didn't know - and, okay, people think you should know everything - but that there was only a handful of people regulating them and the auditors didn't have the ... well, then there has to be another system.  There has to be a way where that information is given - either the regulator has far more power and has the power to be able to do it.  But you can't continue on with the way it used to be.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, between 1998 and 2000, Mr. Peter Bacon recommended in his reports ... Dr. Bacon ... at the end of a certain property-related tax ... sorry, recommended in his reports an end to certain property-related tax incentives.  In December 2001 you and your Finance Minister announced the unwinding of some of the implemented changes.  This related, in particular, to the reduction of stamp duty and tax deductibility of interest for investors.  Mr. Bacon, when he was before this committee, told us that he was not consulted before these measures were taken and maybe you can discuss with us this afternoon why he wasn't consulted and who was consulted with regard to these measures and these decisions being taken.</p></speech>

But it was a decision taken by the Minister for Finance.  I was consulted.  The ... I think Peter Bacon stated at the committee that they were done ... that the changes were done too soon and, you know, I wouldn't argue with him in that.  I accept that.  But the reason, Chairman, was that while the prices stabilised for period, the rent zoomed up.  The rent of apartments and flats went up something like 85% in a relatively short period.  And I recall well, because I live in the city, before the university students came back, there was an outcry by the students union, by the way, as there is now - they've posters up around the city again asking for landlords to give them ... if anyone wants to let their property to get on to them - because the rents were going through the roof.</p><p>And a third ... people tend to think, okay, it was the immigrants, they can pay a bit higher rents because they're working or it was people in jobs, but a third of the people in private accommodation, in landlord accommodation are supplementary welfare cases - they are people on social welfare.  So it wasn't some abstract thing that it didn't ... it didn't matter, it was the ... it was ... the people were suffering most from some of these changes were the poorest people in society.  And I represented a lot of those poor people and I was, you know, very conscious that we were hammering ... because the supplementary welfare officers wouldn't give the increases and Joe Public, who was in rental accommodation, was being screwed.  So ... like, when the model ... and the theory was ... and I'd a lot of regard for Peter Bacon ... might have said one thing, the effect of it was ... was hammering people who were at the bottom and that's why we changed it. </p></speech>

I think the general figure was there was about &euro;1 billion going into rent supplement at its peak, and one could put forward a proposition that the buy-to-let investor had a very, very preferential mortgage compared to the home buyer because the interest rate rebate that they were getting were better than the home buyer.  So the State, through one measure and another, was assisting the buy-to-let purchaser to purchase the property and was also putting &euro;1 billion in the other side to help the person to actually rent the property.  Would you have any comment on that?</p></speech>

Well, I think you're right, but the wizards in the IMF and the OECD, by the way, say we shouldn't be building any social housing, we should be doing it all through buy-to-let properties and that that's the way we should be dealing with social housing, which I entirely disagree.  But, yes, we were subsidising it and no doubt the taxpayer was subsidising it.</p></speech>

If you look there at quarter ... it's quarter 1, 2001 to quarter 1, 2002.  The ... this is the period in which the Bacon report measures are implemented and we see there was a significant increase in property prices and then it plateaus and even begins to drop somewhat over that annualised period.  Then we see the removal of the measures and we see house prices escalating very, very rapidly right up until 2007, both in the blue line, which is the new house prices, and in the red line, which is in the second house price market ... coming back to our earlier discussion of today with regard to affordability.  Given an examination of that graph, did the removal of those Bacon measures make house prices more unaffordable for people on average incomes?  These are average house prices.</p></speech>

But the reason ... the main reason was the increase in rents.  I mean, that's why it was changed.  I mean, I've seen somewhere that there was lobbies ... and there were lobbies maybe about the stamp duty but the rents astronomically increased in that period.  What we're looking ... I've no problem with the graph and I accept that the graph ... but I'd like to see what the graph showing the rents.</p></speech>

If they're cohabiting there's another income, and that's done over a 20-year period.  But the calculation for rents historically has also been about the ... 12 times the value of the property.  So it would work ... there was a calculation process there, so if the price of a house went up, rent would go up as well as ... because if I was purchasing a house in the morning in the buy-to-let market, as a second-hand house, the valuation of that, usually, would be a multiple of an annual rent by 12.  So if I was paying &euro;10,000 a year in rent, I would multiply that by 12 and the house should be worth about &euro;120,000.  That was the old sort of model as well.</p><p>So on that basis, because house prices were going up, it was inevitable that rent was going to go up because it was actually tied in with price.</p></speech>

It's the period of stabilisation of the price is when the rent zoomed.  So what happened was there was a direct transfer in that period from ... the escalating price of the residential stopped, we had equilibrium for a while, but the rent zoomed and Joe Public who was in a rented accommodation, including a third of them who were on supplementary welfare allowance, were screwed and that's the fact.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the affordability issue, now, as we spoke about earlier and that's affordability of mortgage loans in terms of home buyers as opposed to buy-to-lets.  It seemed that you related this to the ability to get a loan from the bank, as you referred to the discussion, to 100%, loan-to-values, net income calculation and also the extension of the maturities of mortgages and so forth.  Were you at any time ever worried about people being able to get a loan and were you also worried about people actually being able to repay those loans?  Because what we had was people on ... you take the ordinary industrial wage, the multiple of that person buying their home went up to ten times their income, and it was stretched out over a very, very long period.  So was the affordability ever a concern?</p></speech>

But, as I said earlier on, in 1999 when the loan-to-value changed and there were a number of changes ... 100% only came 2005.  But it went to 80%, a far more general 80%, as I think you mentioned, if not today, on another day.  There was also the gross-to-net, which I think is not to the extent focused on as it should be because that made a huge difference in the amount of the mortgage that a person on the average industrial wage and their partner, whoever ... whatever circumstances they were in, were able to borrow.  It gave a huge ... it was something like &euro;140,000 more, which was an enormous amount of money.  Like, if you were looking and, somebody goes into the mortgage person, and they've said, "No, you can't get an increase on your mortgage", and next month you come back and you can get &euro;140,000 more and you're on the same income; that's what happened.  That had a huge impact as well and I think when ... those few things coming together in '99, 2001, is what zoomed that graph up, up substantially.</p></speech>

And, in Cork, at the peak, the affordable housing had gone up to &euro;250,000.  That was subsidised housing through the State.  And mortgage approval had to be granted through three different institutions.  And so somebody who was on a social housing, affordable housing list had to go through this very technical process before they'd even be considered for one of these.  Given that people in that type of circumstance were being facilitated through and affordable home programme that was being run where subsidised housing was costing as much as &euro;250,000 back at that date, was that ever a warning sign that there is something maybe very, very difficultly and fundamentally problematic here that would have to be addressed?</p></speech>

You had to be within a certain income group to qualify for it, if ... a nurse and a guard couldn't get onto the affordable housing scheme because of their incomes.  And we were ... for people on low incomes, the scheme was actually operating on &euro;250,000 a year.  Was that not considered to be ... that there's something wrong here?</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, you said ... you were critical of the Financial Regulator and you also said that you'd be damned to take responsibility for something that wasn't your responsibility.  And it's been put to you by Deputy Higgins that you sponsored or were aware or promoted light-touch regulation.  Given that statement, how can you wash your hands of, or how can you not take responsibility for the type of regulation that was happening in the Financial Regulator's office?</p></speech>

I don't know where you get the notion that the Better Regulation White Paper, had anything to do with light-touch.  It was not light-touch; it was good regulation.  It was to ... based on an OECD model to improve regulation.  I had done, I think, considerably good work on the statue law revision of the Oireachtas on both legislation pre-1922 and the statutory instruments, where we updated the entire Statute Book and legislative book going way back to ... hundreds of years.  And as part of that initiative, we wanted to get to a situation where the easy option wasn't always taken, that a statutory instrument or regulation would be the first thing that was looked at.  And there were five principles or six principles set out in that White Paper.  But it was not light-touch, it should not have been considered light-touch; it was better regulation.</p></speech>

And at that, you were accompanied by the Financial Regulator, and in your address to them, you say, "International benchmarking studies show that Ireland is very lightly regulated compared to most of our European colleagues."  You were telling the financial services sector in New York to come and invest in Ireland, and as I quote, you were saying that Ireland is "very lightly regulated."</p></speech>

The whole ... I'll tell you, Deputy, I remember as Minister of Finance, when the Bundesbank finance committee came to this country because this country's financial services centre, which was only in its infancy, was being talked down by others, mainly Luxembourg, which ... I don't criticise them for it because they saw this was a new opposition.  And they came here and were amazed to find out that it wasn't a brass plate operation, that we had good regulation, that we were well-regulated.  And one of the reasons that the financial services industry in this country has been a success, that it has billions upon billions under fund management and that has been one of the great success stories of the last quarter of a century in this country is because it's seen internationally as a well-regulated, not light regulated, well-----</p></speech>

So do you accept that you were aware that the Financial Regulator who accompanied you there was pursuing light-touch regulation with the banks?  And if you were aware then how can you say that you'd be damned to take responsibility that wasn't your responsibility?</p></speech>

We're talking about better regulation so that we're seen as a modern country, to be able to manage the funds of something like 100 banks worldwide as we have done successfully here even in the downturn.  Our banks here ... our foreign banks who work in the IFSC, that employ 30,000 or 40,000 people are well regulated and that isn't about light touch, they are well regulated ... and they're seen internationally to do that.  But we had to, Deputy, work hard for a quarter of a century as I did, as the Taoiseach before me did ... to win that reputation, and as a former Taoiseach, is there in the financial service industry today doing a good job on it.  So I would almost resent, Deputy, if I can say it respectfully to you, the idea that our international financial services industry is considered to be light touch in the way that you put it.</p></speech>

If I can ask you, we've seen the graphs in terms of the explosion of credit into the market.  And you yourself talked about that the commercial property was where the madness really took place.  Mr. Ahern, your Government introduced the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Act 2007.  It's reported that you were lobbied by the financial institutions, and the Minister for Finance was lobbied by Anglo Irish Bank.  This is all on the public record and it was introduced in 2007.  It was introduced in the statement in the D&aacute;il it says that the banks were relying in the past in relation to deposits which is no longer available.  What this Act did was allow for commercial mortgages to be rolled up into a bond and new funding to be secured on the basis of that to allow these banks to release more credit into the Irish market.  Now this was in March 2007 at the peak, or close to the peak, of credit flow.  Do you take any responsibility for introducing that Act which encouraged more credit into an overheated system at that point in time?</p></speech>

I didn't deal with that legislation.  I heard the Minister answer it and I think the Minister gave the reasons why that was, so I don't want to add anything to what he said.</p></speech>

But I would have been very well on the side of "leave well enough alone", because there was concern in the Central Bank but at the same time, there was an impelling argument because of the difficulties that had come out of the DIRT report that we should make those changes.  There was a compromise, and I accepted the compromise, so ... I don't intend to say that to you it was the cause of the issue.  I don't believe I said that, and if I did say that, that's not correct.</p></speech>

I don't see anything wrong with that, I know there's been an issue made about this, was that in some way tied his hands.  I don't really see that.  We're a country that hasn't got huge resources in the administrative system for having separate agencies and separate organisations, and if people can double up in their promotion, of it, the Central Bank, working together.  In the early years, all the people that were in the Clearing House Group, the Central Bank was there, the regulator was there, Revenue were there, Government Departments were there, I don't really think that that created any weaknesses in the system.  I know there's been some changes now, and from what I can hear, the changes don't add up to a lot in so far as the system works very much the same.  They have two different groups, one group meets now and then another group meets separately, it, the changes aren't substantive.</p></speech>
