My name is Jake Proctor and I studied at Strangford Integrated College in County Down from September 2008 until June 2015.  I am eternally indebted to NICIE and those brave parents, governors and teachers who took a brave stand to create an integrated school on the Ards Peninsula.  Strangford Integrated College has changed my life for the better.  From the outset I felt like I truly belonged there.  There is a real community feel at Strangford and the word "school" is not used.  We use terms like "community" and "family" instead.  It is an inclusive learning environment, like all integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  We need more integrated schools and more places in them so that a greater number of young people can have their lives transformed by integrated education.</p> <p>  One of the key aspects of integrated education that I identify with is that it engages with division and celebrates difference.  Sectarianism is combatted in integrated schools.  For example, I have strong friendships across the divide, friendships I did not have before I joined Strangford and which I would never have had if I had gone to a controlled school.  It is not just a buzzword or tick-box exercise; difference is actually celebrated in integrated schools.  Just last month, I took an assembly at Strangford where I asked the younger students to find a person who was not like them and to find out three things that made that person who he or she was.  I have seen very positive outcomes of this including strengthened friendships and better understanding of the past and of where we are going in future.  Integrated education works as it encourages children to work with people from other communities and backgrounds from an early age.  It has been a pleasure to be part of that.  Educating children together works well to break down myths, stereotypes and perceptions, which is crucial if we are going to have any type of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Better than any of that, integrated education prepares young people for a very diverse life in the 21st century.  It has helped me to prepare for a rapidly changing world and an uncertain future.  I feel ready for third education and to start my degree at Queen's University in September thanks to Strangford College and integrated education.  I do not have to think about mixing with the other as I have done it since I was 11 years of age.  If I had gone to a controlled school, I guarantee that I would not have this luxury or this weight off my shoulders.  I know this because I was the only one from my friendship group from primary school who went to an integrated school.  The other four went to grammar schools in Belfast.  Academically, we have performed equally over the last seven years but as far as making us 21st century citizens is concerned, they all agree that I have the upper hand.  The notion of the other is not in my mindset or vocabulary.  I am a non-believer so people's religion will never be a question I ask.  The notion of the other has proven to be a challenge and an obstacle for the other boys.  They know that when we walk into Queen's in September, we will enter an integrated environment.  Each of us knows what we will face but thanks to integrated education at Strangford College, I am more than equipped with the tools to deal with this.</p> <p>  What do I blame the boys' fear on?  It is a failure of the education system.  The current segregated system of education in Northern Ireland is, as NICIE puts it, a key component of a negative peace.  Is it fit for a society emerging from conflict?  No.  Are integrated kids better prepared for life in the 21st century and the diversity of university and the workplace?  Absolutely.  The last time I researched it, I found that 92% of school kids in Northern Ireland were being educated separately.  Of every 100 young people, 92 are being denied the opportunity to learn together.  In 2010, I made a speech at Stormont through our education committee and told the members that I believed the time was right for a fully integrated system of education.  I still do, but I respect parental choice.  The fact is, however, that parental choice is being denied.  It is void and hollow for many people in Northern Ireland.  Underfunded and oversubscribed integrated schools as well as vast areas across Northern Ireland which have no integrated option is a situation which is, frankly, unacceptable.</p> <p>  I place the blame for this firmly at the feet of those who are failing to implement the Good Friday Agreement and a framework for the peaceful, equal Northern Ireland that 75% of the population pledged to support.  Not all young people are going to be world leaders, doctors or teachers, but we are all going out into a very diverse 21st century.  Integrated education gives us a helping hand.  Mahatma Gandhi said that if we wanted world peace, we should start educating children.  Jake Proctor says, "If we want progress in Northern Ireland, we need to start educating children together".  The assumption is true that children learn better in a place where they are fully accepted.  At age 12, I very much fitted the Protestant working class underachieving schoolboy stereotype.  I had failed my 11 plus and no one had high hopes for me.  Strangford College transformed Jake Proctor.  It accepted me and in the space of five years, I fell in love with school again.  I was in the top 10% in Northern Ireland at key stage 3 level.  I got first place in Northern Ireland in GCSE business studies, and I got three As at AS level, including 100% in two subjects with a similar outcome expected in August.  Working in an open, honest, caring environment has helped me and I feel I have excelled in integrated education.  I have found a new confidence and belief in myself.</p> <p>  I hope a time comes in Northern Ireland when educating children together will be the norm and not the exception.  We all need to work together to achieve this.  We have the framework as integrated schools exist and we have organisations like NICIE and the IEF here for support.  We clearly have the interest as existing integrated schools are oversubscribed while many controlled and maintained primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland are showing interest in joining the integrated movement.  Yes, there are problems and barriers, but let us leap them.  In five years, when I hopefully re-enter education as a history teacher, I will want to work in an integrated school.  I want to send my kids to an integrated school.  For the sake not only of my kids but of all our young people and future generations, let us leap the barriers and solve the problems.  We have ignored article 64 for 17 years.  Let us not leave it any longer.</p></speech>

Before I begin, I once again offer apologies on behalf of Noreen Campbell, who would have loved to be here today.  I am trying to fill her shoes albeit I ask the committee not to go with the mental image that creates.  I will try to summarise the report she has presented.</p> <p>  Our overall concern within NICIE and the IEF is that some of the principles contained within the Good Friday Agreement are not being delivered in keeping with the way the agreement was designed and what was in mind when it was drafted.  That is the overall framework for what I have to say today.  There are missed opportunities and work to be done and we urge the committee to use its influence to try to bring about positive change in terms of that process, notwithstanding that time has passed since 1998.  Our concern is that the education system in Northern Ireland remains one built on the basis of segregation while divisions between different sectors remain as strong as they ever were.  Jake quoted the statistic that 92% of schoolchildren in Northern Ireland continue to be educated within what is essentially a segregated system.  With all the time that has passed and, indeed, the funding that has been poured into various projects since 1998, we should surely have expected to see greater progress.</p> <p>  In her paper, Noreen Campbell quotes Professor Brandon Hamber who talks about the absence of violence without underlying reconciliation and genuine peace-building.  He describes this as a "negative peace".  The absence of violence is not the true peace we seek for Northern Ireland.  If one adds to that the concept Jake has touched on that one of the key drivers to real and sustainable change within Northern Ireland has to be children and the educational system, the deficiencies within the current system suddenly appear stark and urgent.  Ms Campbell quotes in her paper research which shows that sectarian attitudes are formed at a very early age and she quotes Hayes and McAllister who said that individuals who attend integrated schools are significantly more likely to have friends and neighbours from across the divide.  These friendship networks translate into a more optimistic view of future community relations.  Hayes and McAllister conclude, therefore, that an integrated education system is not only a fruitful place to start, but should be a key element within a wider strategy to address community divisions.  I would like to pause over that.  The first time one sees research which concludes that children coming out of integrated schools are more likely to have friendships from across divides, it sounds relatively unsurprising.</p><p>However, if one considers the ripple effect, it becomes very exciting because the children who are learning to grow up without barriers and the baggage of the past and willingly build friendships with children from all parts of the community and across the divides, as used to be the case, are the ones who, like Jake, are growing up to become the future generations.  Whether Jake goes into teaching or becomes a politician - I share the Chairman's feeling that perhaps he should - he is one of the shapers of the future.  If he is coming into adult society without the barriers and divisions of the past and becomes one of the shapers of the future society of Northern Ireland, suddenly we may feel we are in good hands.</p><p> We need an education system that encourages the attitudes Jake is carrying into his university career from September onwards.  The concept of children building firmer friendships within an integrated school is central to a better future for Northern Ireland and is a key way of fulfilling the Good Friday Agreement.  The current position is that the segregated system in Northern Ireland is not sustainable.  It has been made very clear from within the education Department that we cannot afford, even at a financial level, the education system we have in place.  In these times of austerity, we are funding multiple schools, all with their own identity and all within one relatively small town or part of a city, when it could all be much more financially economical.</p><p> The real cost, however, goes way beyond the finance involved.  It is about whether we are genuinely transforming the hearts, minds and values of young people.  There is a raft of shared education projects which have been funded and which continue in Northern Ireland today.  Some of them are very good, while some of them are not, but they all boil down to one single question: what is the genuine impact and quality of what is going on and is it, therefore, money well spent?  We have found during the years and throughout the history of integrated education that by bringing children together under one roof, day in, day out, they sit in class together, play football together at break time and the barriers are dismantled day by day.  They are genuinely coming through an integrated system and leaving to move into the adult world with the barriers removed.  They have a positive outlook.  They think, "I can do this; we can do this."  They move into society ready to play an active role, not only in changing the historical picture of Northern Ireland but, again, as Jake mentioned, in the increasingly diverse and multicultural society Northern Ireland has become, with the rest of Europe and the world.  </p><p> Ms Campbell goes on in her paper to talk about a number of opportunities she believes are open, even now, within the remit of the Good Friday Agreement and to those charged with fulfilling it.  She speaks, first, as I mentioned, about the economy and the fact that we simply cannot continue to maintain this duplicating system.  Second, she talks about the concept of identity and the fact that the idea of identity as it applied 30 years ago in Northern Ireland has changed and that society demands that we keep step with the changes taking place.  We now live in a multicultural society.  There are increasing numbers of younger generation parents and families coming through who are saying they do not want these labels to be applied to them.  Some of them only have recourse to describing themselves as "Other".  Surely it is time we moved forward to a slightly more positive concept.</p><p> Ms Campbell goes on in her paper to talk about the concept of human rights, by which she means the belief of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education that a right to an integrated education is a human rights issue.  It is the right for which the young person has to be prepared in a diverse society and world, wherever they may spend their working careers, and the right of parents to be able to say they want their child to have an integrated education.  The picture today in Northern Ireland is that not all parents have this right either because there is no integrated school within their geographical location or those that are available, including the one of which I am principal, are too small and, therefore, routinely turning children away when they have asked to join to receive an integrated education.</p><p> Ms Campbell goes on to talk about educational administration.  The committee may be aware that recently the structure of the five Education and Library Boards in Northern Ireland was replaced with a single Education Authority.  Therefore, massive change is under way.  What better opportunity is there to take a fresh look at the concept of integrated education and give it more formal backing than when we are designing a new education authority?</p><p> There is also within Northern Ireland the concept of area-based planning.  This, essentially, is where one looks at a single area as, perhaps, the cake with the different slices which are given to different sectors.</p></speech>

She refers in the section to such issues as the economy, the concept of identity and educational administration.  As she notes, the establishment of a new education authority presents opportunities for change.</p> <p>  The report goes on to discuss the process of area-based planning which has been established in Northern Ireland for the past four years, whereby the planning of educational provision within an area is strategically identified and explored.  Unfortunately, under this system, we still have different sectors fighting for their own interests.  The process remains partisan and there is no sense of a genuinely fresh look at educational provision within an area or any consideration of what is in the best interests of that area.  Moreover, it does not take on board in a wholehearted or honest way the concept of integrated education.  As such, it is a deeply flawed system.  We ask the committee to consider challenging the basis on which area-based planning was designed and is being implemented.</p> <p>  Ms Campbell goes on to talk in her report about the fact that the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, of which she is chief executive officer, has designed a new pathway into integrated education - Positive Partnerships for Integration.</p><p>This is a way in which schools that are not currently integrated can express an interest in gradually taking steps towards becoming integrated schools with the support of the Northern Ireland Council.  Ms Campbell states that on a first request for expressions of interest relatively recently, more than 50 schools expressed a interest in exploring this as a way forward.  There are ways of developing the concept of integrated education within Northern Ireland.  She went on to talk about the Stormont House Agreement and the capital funding package of &euro;500 million.  We are not sure where we are with the Stormont House Agreement at the moment, but if it does goes through we would love to think that some of that funding would be diverted specifically into integrated education.  In addition, PEACE IV will come online in September.  The figure of &pound;45 million has been allocated for shared education.  One of our questions is how to ensure that a healthy proportion of that is put towards integrated education.<br/><br/>Ms Noreen Campbell is asking that we explore the possibilities of the PEACE IV funding, specifically addressing integrated education and the possibility of calling for an independent commission to be established to reform the education system in Northern Ireland.Our concern is that, within the current remit of the different political parties and sectors, it is almost a mandate for no change.  Because the existing bodies are being given the task of looking at the system we have, there is very little hope for substantial change, whereas an independent commission could look at it with fresh eyes and say that it proposes a way forward - it would be a different approach entirely, with a fresh look at the whole system.  <br/><br/>Ms Noreen Campbell's final paragraph states:</p><blockquote>The embedding of peace needs constant attention; the dangers of following a path of 'separate but equal' must be challenged.  The endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement by the vast majority of people on this island represented vote for a 'shared future'.  Educating our children together is a critical building block of such a future.</blockquote><p>I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

I want to outline briefly why the Integrated Education Fund, IEF, exists, why we no longer want to exist and then I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Paul Caskey, to make a few concluding remarks.  The Integrated Education Fund, which was established in 1992 as an independent charitable trust, seeks to bridge the gap between finance and support that is available from the government and what it takes to set up an integrated school.  Twenty three years later, the IEF still exists with that core aim and we seek to increase the number of places in integrated schools and also to meet demand and advocate for structural reform of our education system, with the objective that the IEF will no longer be needed in the future.  If that financial gap were met, we would no longer need to exist.  We would not need to fund-raise continually for integrated education.</p> <p>  Since the Good Friday Agreement, we have spent more than &pound;20 million in seed funding for integrated schools, and today, despite the Good Friday Agreement, we are still needed.  It is parents who set up integrated schools, not the Department of Education.  We provide support to parents to establish schools.  For example, we funded the school that Mr. Proctor attended, Strangford Integrated College.  We funded it for two years as an independent school; it is established now and it is very much oversubscribed.  </p> <p>  The fund also provides capital support for 13 new integrated playgroup facilities.  The Department, for the first time ever, funded an integrated playgroup this year.  It is big positive achievement for us.  We funded the rest to date and it has all been in terms of capital.</p> <p>  In the last three years we have provided more than &pound;2 million in funding to help existing integrated schools grow.  We know the demand exists and they want to grow.  We provided additional capital funding for additional classrooms, and they then meet the demand and can prove to the Department of Education that the demand exists.  </p> <p>  We also fund and encourage transformation of existing schools that want to become integrated.  To date, 20 controlled schools, which are mainly Protestant schools, have transformed to integrated status.  However, the first Catholic school recently applied to transform and was refused approval from the Department of Education to do so.  The Department provides some financial support but it is not enough to do this work.  It is challenging and it takes time to transform a school</p> <p>  Transformation is cost-effective and sustainable with respect to integration, which can help resolve the over-provision of school places.  It was recently identified in a Northern Ireland Audit Office report that there is over-provision in respect of at least 20% of the places.  Transformation offers a school the opportunity to increase enrolments through working with the entire community, but it needs to be effectively supported.</p> <p>  We have supported the grant-aiding of cross-community education programmes during the past 15 years.  We had a programme called PACT, Promoting A Culture of Trust, and we spent more than &pound;1 million and more than 500 schools were involved during those 15 years.  The programme is a precursor to some of the shared education programmes that are currently being funded.  This work was important for us at the time and it still is important as it demonstrates the appetite for this work, but the time has come for more ambitious programmes with the potential for sustainable structural change.  We have put money into this for 15 years and we could do it for another 15 years, and it is great that children have an opportunity to meet each other, but there is no structural change and it is not sustainable.  Unfortunately, the PEACE IV programme suggests a similar type of funding, this type of shared education approach, and this will continue to dominate both policy and funding, but we would question whether this is another lost opportunity.  Should we not be able to do more?  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Paul Caskey, for some final comments.</p></speech>

One of the observations we can make is that there is tremendous support for educating children together in Northern Ireland across all political perspectives, but what we need now is structural reform and change.  We believe the appetite is there for that.  Much of the cross-community education work that has gone on for many years shows that the appetite is there, but we need more ambitious reform.  We need integrated education to be properly planned.  Seventeen years after the Good Friday Agreement, it should not be beyond us to ask communities and parents what types of school they desire in their area and not just rely on the current existing sectors and institutions to provide that.</p> <p>  We need a vision for the future, which is sadly lacking.  We need a roadmap on how we will get there.  If we could plan for integrated education, we could start to meet that demand.  It is not imposing anything on anybody; rather, it is reflecting what communities want.  PEACE IV could present a big opportunity.  Shared education has been agreed.  There is a good deal of money available.  I know it has not been ratified yet, but it would be pleasing if we could see some element of support for integrated education just as in the Stormont House Agreement.</p> <p>  I have one final request.  I would love if the committee would consider visiting an integrated school in Northern Ireland, perhaps even Mr. Proctor's old school, Strangford Integrated College, which might be amenable to such a visit, as there is nothing like seeing this in action to get a feel for what it is about.</p></speech>

We would be delighted to accept Mr. Paul Caskey's invitation to visit an integrated school.  Our secretariat will work closely with him on that.  We go on many outreach visits to Northern Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, when she was Chairman of this committee, pioneered many of those visits, which were very worthy and interesting, and they have given us an in-depth knowledge of what is happening.  I thank Mr. Caskey for the invitation and we will be delighted to accept it.  We will fit that trip in.</p> <p>  I have one or two questions before I bring in the members of the committee.  Ms Tina Merron said that the first maintained Catholic school recently applied for and was refused approval to transform by the Department of Education.  Why did that happen?  Second, regarding an independent commission to reform the education system in Northern Ireland, could our guests expand on who they consider should be members of such a commission?  Why do they consider it has not been progressed?  Is there any way this joint committee could be of assistance to them?</p></speech>

Clintyclay is a small school that was refused approval to transform by Department of Education based on its size, and it is also in financial deficit.  There was subsequently a judicial review and the decision was quashed.  We are not sure where it sits at the minute.</p></speech>

She has not gone into detail in the report.</p><p>The basic principle behind it is that it needs to be led by someone and composed of a group of people who are prepared to rise above the tribal politics that presides in Northern Ireland.  The power-sharing Executive is, on the one hand, a brilliant step forward from where we were before, but, as we can see even in the current wrangles and difficulties it is facing, it has flaws built into it.  When there are sectors representing their own interests, there is no agreement or synergy.  We are looking for something that is beyond this.  I apologise because I cannot comment further on the proposals for the mechanics of this.</p></speech>

We recognise that how we educate children is a very sensitive issue for many.  We are all very proud in most cases of the education we received across the various sectors.  It is a question of trying to remove education from the difficult, sensitive space and using external, independent expertise to help to examine all of the various issues involved.</p></speech>

It is good to explore what has held back to some degree the development of integrated education.  The delegates have said there is sometimes a halfway house in dealing with issues.  How does one develop the concept of integrated education in an area?  Do the delegates regard the shared education concept proposed and talked about by Minister John O'Dowd as a benefit or an obstacle to integrated education?</p> <p>  With regard to the educational benefits of integrated education by comparison with the community benefits, how do the academic benefits of integrated education compare with those of mainstream education?  How does one judge the after-effects of community involvement in trying to develop a new society in the North?</p></speech>

I will take the very first one, on how we assess demand for integrated education.  In the past parents' groups came to us stating they would like to open an integrated school.  That has now become more difficult with over-provision of places and too many schools.  We would like to see a mechanism whereby the Department could assess parental demand.  We are examining some pilot schemes that would allow us to carry out a community audit in an area and to ask parents and the community what they actually want in their area.  In that way, what is desired by the whole community, rather than just one section thereof, could be identified.  We are piloting a mechanism to assess parental demand.</p></speech>

If it is a controlled school, it is given the option to amalgamate with another controlled school.  If it is a Catholic school, it is given the option to amalgamate with another Catholic school.  The parents are never presented with the option of an integrated school that might be more beneficial for the community.  We would like to see it becoming an option for parents in such circumstances.</p></speech>

Shared education is regarded by many as an alternative to integrated education.  There is a dangerous line of thought suggesting it is easier than integrated education.  Let me unpick that suggestion.  For me, it really boils down to the question of quality, by which I mean the impact on the values of young people.  At its worst, shared education becomes a kind of sticking plaster on a broken leg, whereby schools can tick a box and access funding allowing them to say they are providing shared education.  The real question, however, is whether the delivery of what they are calling shared education is having any meaningful or lasting impact on the young people involved in it.  Second, we must ask whether it is sustainable.  If the pot of funding comes to an end, does everything collapse or is there something being developed that has momentum and can be continued?  Quality, therefore, is about genuine contact between children from different areas of the community or across the divide.  It is a question of what is actually happening to shape them to help them to prepare for a meaningful future and their roles as citizens when they are adults.</p> <p>  Let me give an example of a practice in my school that might perhaps serve as an instance of what I am talking about.  Every year before Ash Wednesday, one of the questions asked is about how the school should approach a practice often regarded as rooted in one part of the community and deliver what is required within an integrated school.  For us, the Ash Wednesday service is a service held for the entire school community, including Protestants, Catholics and others.  Staff, students and even the canteen staff gather together in the hall.  We invite clergy from all sides of the community to help run the service.  I begin the service every year by saying we have come together on the day to explore the ways in which we are living our lives and ask ourselves whether we could be doing so better than we have been.  We then reach a point in the service where both Catholic and Protestant clergy speak to the children.  Without using the terms "Protestant" and "Catholic", we say, "You now have an opportunity to receive the ashes if you wish, and if you would rather not, that is your choice and you may remain in your seat."  We play a PowerPoint presentation and some reflective music while the ashes are being dispensed and we invite those present to think, reflect or pray; it is entirely their choice.  Those who wish to receive the ashes, queue for them in a very dignified manner and those who would rather not receive them remain in their seats.  After this, we close the service.  It is a beautiful, dignified occasion on which students from all parts of the community can see each other in action and deem it to be okay if their friend goes up for ashes if they do not.  I always invite the clergy for a cup of tea afterwards.  Approximately three years ago the Catholic priest said, "My goodness, the presence of the Holy Spirit in your school this afternoon was phenomenal."  I believed that was an interesting reflection.</p> <p>  That is an example of what I am talking about.  I refer to children who are genuinely learning to tolerate and respect one another and the differences in the various communities.  Where else would they receive that experience?  My challenge to those delivering a shared education project is to determine whether the quality of what they are doing will match this and, consequently, whether the funding being poured into their project is worth it.  Putting it bluntly, we offer shared education under one roof from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and beyond every day.  We see the transformation in children's values that we believe should be the aspiration of any shared education project.</p></speech>

People's perception will be based on five GCSEs, with results from A to C in subjects including English and mathematics, and the barometers associated with examination results.  The big divide in Northern Ireland in terms of that crude barometer is between selective and non-selective schools.  Most schools are on a par with one another, be they Catholic non-selective, integrated non-selective or controlled non-selective.  There is a difference of approximately 1% at GCSE level.  Catholic schools are approximately 0.5% ahead, followed by integrated schools, with controlled schools being marginally below that level.  Sometimes it is presented that certain schools in certain sectors are outperforming others because of their ethos, but it is important to note that it is really about selection and non-selection.  There are good, well performing Catholic schools and also poorly performing Catholic schools.  It is no different in the case of integrated schools, controlled schools and grammar schools.  Sometimes it is a very complex area, but these are the facts.  Is that a fair description?</p></speech>

Ultimately, the only way forward is through what is called a value-added system.  We talk a lot at Drumragh about personal best.  We need a system that evaluates.  Children are benchmarked academically when they join the school, which is not difficult, and then one measures the extent to which they are over-performing based on the initial predictions.  A value-added system would determine whether each youngster had performed below, on a par with or above what had been expected initially.</p><p>Out of that, one has a value-added system which asks whether a youngster achieved below par, on a par or above par, with regard to their initial expectations.  If we could design a barometer that picked up on that system rather than asking how the grammar schools did or how the non-selective schools did and all of that, we would have a way of genuinely measuring the quality of each school and its delivery.</p></speech>

Many of the challenges faced in the North are not a million miles away from the challenges we face.  We are looking at the issue of the predominance of faith patronage.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and we have discussed whether there should be an increase in the diversity of patronage or whether to provide one model to cater for all.  It is very welcome that a recent call for expressions of interest received a positive response from more than 50 schools.</p> <p>  Will the delegation clarify whether the integrated schools are state schools under private patronage or a mixture of both?  Do the integrated schools tend to be co-educational?  I am aware that the North also has the phenomenon of single-sex schools but since the 1990s, no new school in the Republic is allowed to be established as a single-sex school.  Any single-sex schools are legacy schools.  What is the position in Northern Ireland?  Are the integrated schools multi-denominational, non-denominational or a mixture of both?  In some cases, schools here that are non-denominational describe themselves as multi-denominational and vice versa, which can cause confusion.</p> <p>  We have published new legislation on a schools admissions policy.  The current legislation has been in place since 1998, under which schools must publish their enrolment policy.  The new legislation, if passed, will put further requirements on schools to be open and transparent in their policy in order to limit, to a certain extent, barriers and discrimination against children.  Is similar legislation planned or in place in the North?</p> <p>  One phenomenon which sometimes occurs here is when parents decide to set up a school with the ideals of Educate Together, for instance.  These schools are often predominately middle class.  However, it is not always the case because Educate Together schools contain a mixture.  Is this an issue in integrated schools?  Is there an equivalent of vocational educational schools in the North?  These schools have a much broader mixed socio-economic background.  Mr. Proctor referred to the pitfalls of parental choice.  This is an issue of concern to me.  Some parents can use choice to the advantage of their children while other parents are not able to do so and their children are disadvantaged as a result.</p></speech>

I was inspired listening to Mr. Proctor.  I am deeply interested in education and I spoke on the subject of junior cycle reform in the Seanad this morning.  Education is for everybody and every career path is equally valid.  That is what we are moving towards here.  There was an elitism in education but now, we value things like self-esteem and a path for life so that a person can start as an apprentice and end up being a doctor in one's subject.  Integrated education is part of this process.  I commend the work of Mr. Frith.  Last year or the year before, we had a community audit in the South in a number of towns.  I was struck by the number of people who wanted to retain the <i>status quo</i>.  I ask the witnesses to comment because it is a big question for me as to why people wanted to retain the <i>status quo</i>in terms of the management and the control of schools.  I am not criticising any of the bodies which manage schools.  However, change is happening in other areas, such as the introduction of marriage equality and many other social changes, but in the area of education, it seems that parents are reluctant to change.</p><p>I was in Derry last summer when people were celebrating the fact that their son or daughter got into the school of choice by means of the 11-plus exam.  They were booking holidays in Tenerife because it was a big celebration for all the family.  I was also struck that one of the schools in Derry had stipulated that as well as academic achievement, a student had to be able to play a musical instrument.  I do not know whether that is right and I suggest to Francie that he should discuss this with his Minister.</p></speech>

I am only sorry I was unavoidably detained and did not hear all the presentations but I enjoyed listening to the members and Mr. Proctor, whom I believe gave a very powerful speech.  He is a credit to integrated education and I wish him great success with his exam results and into the future.</p> <p>  As a former teacher I find this subject fascinating.  I will follow on from Senator D'Arcy's point about why he could not understand why people would have to be able to play a musical instrument.  As a former music teacher, I would strongly advocate that every child in school from four to 18 years of age should play a musical instrument.  For many years I saw students starting school who did not play an instrument and I was particularly delighted when I saw them leaving school, not only playing an instrument but continuing to become musicians and to study for degrees.  Some of them even became lecturers in music at university.  Music is the universal language.  A person with a musical instrument under his or her arm is always welcome in every house in this country.</p> <p>  I am a strong advocate for music.  Until recently, part of the criteria for entrance to primary school training was that one had to play a musical instrument.  This change may have had a knock-on effect when I see students who have had no or very little music in primary school.</p><p>To be able to play an instrument is a great string to one's bow.</p><p> Can the witnesses comment on the criteria for entry?  In the notes it states that, to date, no Catholic school has transformed to become an integrated school.  Can they elaborate on why that is?  I understand one school applied for the process and that it is going through a judicial review.  How can we as a committee help implement the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement?  It is the way forward when one sees the calibre of student it produces and Mr. Proctor is certainly a good role model.</p></speech>

However, I have gone through the documentation.  Shared housing and integrated education are contained in one sentence in the Good Friday Agreement but there has not been progress on shared or mixed housing to the extent we would like either.  In the early 1990s the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which the Chairman was co-chairman with a member of the British House of Commons, visited Lagan College which was one of the first integrated colleges.  A founder member of the Alliance Party was very much to the fore as a champion of integrated education at that time and in 1993 or 1994 a number of us from the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the British House of Commons visited various educational establishments.  We met with unions, management bodies and the governing body of Lagan College, who had a very progressive programme.  I see that Ms Scott-Wills taught there</p></speech>

Are there still big numbers attending?  Am I right that the initiative is not intended for whole schools but there are shared classes such as where students are together in a campus or adjacent in a town?  Is it intended that this initiative move forward incrementally, with shared classes rather than a shared or integrated school?  It seems, unfortunately, to be a slow process.  Is there any willingness on the part of the Department of Education to push the boundaries?  Has any Minister shown any interest in driving it forward?  I am from Cavan-Monaghan and my constituency borders a number of counties north of the Border.

The problem is that the Department of Education demands that schools prove there is the demand and one of the few ways it can prove demand is to put up another mobile and encourage other pupils to come in.  If that can be done the Department will subsequently fund it but we have to fund the mobile initially.  In the past couple of years we have funded some 13 additional mobile classrooms for schools to prove demand.</p></speech>

When Lagan College opened in 1981 a lot of schools were single-sex but Lagan wanted to make sure it was mixed at all levels so it became co-educational.  All integrated schools are co-educational.  On the question of multi-denominational status we have a statement of principles, dating from 1991, in which we state we are Christian in nature but we are there for children who come from the faith, from other faiths and from no faith at all.  We cater for them too.  While there is a Christian ethos and the religion taught in schools, because it comes from the Northern Ireland curriculum, is Christian we have always been open in a multi-denominational way.  People would be concerned about this at times and we have had a lot of discussion about what it means.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nigel Frith" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015071600002#P02400"><p>An integrated school follows the same religious education curriculum as any other school in Northern Ireland.  The difference is that, like the history syllabus, it is delivered in an entirely balanced way because the staff are aware that there are Protestant and Catholic children in front of them in the class so there is an imperative to deliver the subject in a completely balanced and harmonious way.  In our RE curriculum we follow a philosophy and ethics route.</p><p>The older the children get, the more we are adopting this route which is fundamentally about not only understanding world faiths and religions but also asking huge questions and, out of that, exploring what one's own values and beliefs are going to be.  It seems to me that that is a healthy outlook for children to take out into the sometimes very confusing world in which we live.</p><p> In terms of the socio-economic make-up of integrated schools, we often find that integrated post-primary schools attract higher numbers of special needs children than any other sector.  In our own school, for example, we have something in the region of 70 children with statements of special need, which is the most acute level of special need there is, and an entitlement therefore to a classroom assistant.  Some 35% of our intake are on the special needs register somewhere with some form of identified special need.  That is significantly above average.</p><p> The difficulty is that because we are competing in a system where the grammar schools are creaming off some of the more academically able children, rightly or wrongly - in my view wrongly.  We are therefore competing to ensure our intake is entirely balanced with all ability levels and all gifts and talents.  For that reason we have introduced a gifted and talented programme whereby staff are tasked with ensuring gifted or talented children in their classes are offered additional challenges.  When a child finishes a piece of work, do not offer them more of the same, but ensure they are given an extension activity which builds on what they have already achieved.  We must ensure we are offering extracurricular activities, which might be a science competition or a maths challenge, that allows them to go beyond what their peers are doing.  We compile a gifted and talented register every autumn where staff identify the gifted and talented children in the school.  As I will explain in a moment, that is also built into our admissions criteria.</p><p> I see integrated schools as a great leveller.  When we have prospective children and parents looking around, I will often ask the child whether he or she thinks this is a grammar school or a high school.  They will screw up their chins and have a little think for a minute.  The answer is, however, that we are both under one roof.  Therefore, not only do we have all faiths and none under one roof, but we also have those who might have gone to a grammar school or a high school.  It is a fully integrated education system whereby every child can then be nurtured, supported and developed according to their personal capacities.</p><p> I think it is immoral to rubber-stamp a child at the age of 11 with the words "pass" or "fail".  The damage some children carry into their adult lives because they were told at the age of 11 that they failed is irreparable.  At the age of 40 or 50, some of them are still carrying the damage to their self-esteem that test at the age of 11 inflicted upon them.  It should never have made it into the 21st century.  It is wrong that we have a system that still does that.</p></speech>

It is a rather crude indicator, but free school meals are one way of measuring.  There are issues about uptake within particular communities.  Some 28% of children who attend integrated schools in Northern Ireland are entitled to a free school meal.  Within selected schools it is about 8%, while the Northern Ireland average is around 25%.  It depends where the school is located.  We have schools in working-class communities and schools that sit on the interface in Belfast and other places.  We also have some schools that sit in very affluent communities.<br/><br/>One of the myths about integrated education is that this must be a middle-class phenomenon.  The truth of the matter is that working-class communities are perhaps more receptive to integrated education than middle-class ones, because middle-class communities do not like to admit there might be an issue around some of the schools in the area.<br/><br/>A point was made about auditing, but we are not afraid of auditing.  That is the one thing that is missing from the area-based planning process.  We want communities to be asked what type of schools they want.  If they want something else, that is fine.  As I said earlier, it is not about imposing this on anyone.  If they opt for the <i>status quo</i>that is fine, but give them a choice and a voice.  Ms Merron spoke about transformation and that allows parents to have a democratic ballot overseen within their school.  That process is delivered in many integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  Faced with that realistic choice, we should not be afraid of auditing.</p></speech>

When one drills down into the reasons, much of the time it is because there is not an integrated choice in their area.  Many would say that if the local school transformed, they would send their child to that school.  There is not that much choice for parents, especially when one moves outside Belfast.  Therefore, while they would want integrated education, the only choice given to them is either a controlled school or a Catholic school, and then they send their child to that.</p></speech>

When I was a child there were a lot of cows in the area where I lived, and one horse.  The horse thought he was a cow.  He had never seen that there was any possibility of anything different from a cow, so he assumed he was one.  The point I take from that is that a vision for change in a place like Northern Ireland has to include a vision of what could be.  On the question why more people are not opting for something different, they have not been given a vision of what could be.  Therefore, the family tradition of opting for the grammar school and that being seen as the pinnacle of achievement persists because it is just that - it is tradition.  There is not a solid vision of what could be.  It is down to organisations like NICIE and the IEF to say that things could be different, but we are not seeing that vision from the political leadership of Northern Ireland.  The political leadership of Northern Ireland continues to deliver the segregated, sometimes tribal, approach that is impeding Northern Ireland's progress.</p> <p>  The second point I want to touch on briefly is the question that was asked about our admissions criteria.  When we are beginning a transfer process, we make it clear that we intend if possible to admit 40% Catholic, 40% Protestant and a maximum of 20% other.  Within each of those groupings we have a series of admissions criteria which we begin with.  First, a child who is coming to us from an integrated primary school has a very easy transfer into a post-primary school because they have begun the integrated journey and it is only right that they can continue it.  Our second one is children of members of staff or governors because there has to be a perk in the system somewhere.</p> <p>  We admit children who are gifted and talented, but not in terms of a transfer test.  It is simply a way of saying that if a child has a gift or talent in two or more subjects, there is an opportunity for them to have some preference.  The point of that is not to recreate a transfer test.  It is this goal of achieving an even ability intake and therefore a way of saying to parents who are thinking of a grammar school that there is an alternative and they could look at the gifted and talented programme operated by Drumragh.  It is not a narrowly academic model and does not recreate the 11-plus.  Children who are sporting, musical, budding engineers or academic all have an equal opportunity to present a case for being gifted and talented.</p> <p>  Our admissions criteria also offer the opportunity for parents to make a special case based on a child's learning difficulties, medical needs or social needs for some reason.  There is an opportunity to say that they are from a mixed marriage and therefore essentially the child is receiving an integrated home environment, and for that reason the parents want the same ethos to be present in their child's education.</p> <p>  Those are the sorts of criteria we have built into the system.  Our regret every year is when we run out of places and then have to say that one child can come in but another cannot.  That seems to us to be entirely wrong.</p></speech>

To pick up on what Mr. Frith said about the 11-plus transfer test and how individuals in their 30s and 40s are still damaged by that, it had really damaged me, and after I got my results I suffered depression for a brief stage.  I spent a long time alone in my bedroom.  I was very upset about that but when I went to Strangford, which was a non-selective school, I got a fresh start academically and socially, and that has helped me achieve academically.  I do not want to repeat what I said at the outset but that is one of the main benefits that has aided my development.</p> <p>  Another benefit would be that we explore culture in classes such as history, religion and citizenship.  We explore culture in physical education, PE, by playing Gaelic football, something I would not have had the opportunity to do in my own community.  In terms of language, we were laughing coming down on the train because I said I was not much of a linguist but I would not have had the opportunity to learn the Irish language if I had attended the local controlled school.  I got that opportunity through integrated education at Strangford.</p> <p>  In terms of friendships, as I said at the outset, I would not have made the friendships I have made across the divide had I gone to the controlled school.  That is another opportunity integrated education has given me.  I could go into more detail but I am aware we do not have much time.  </p> <p>  Those are the four points I wanted to make.  Integrated education has aided my development.  I know it is not easy for the members to grasp that in the brief time available to us but they have to understand that when I came into integrated education, I did not know one Roman Catholic person.  Now, my four best friends are Roman Catholic.  My four best friends went to a maintained primary school.  My friendships now are across the divide and in my mindset, as far as Jake Proctor is concerned, there is no divide.</p></speech>

It was awful stuff.</p> <p>  I spoke about music earlier.  Two of my three children have degrees in music and play with the Cross Border Orchestra, which is an integrated project.  Music breaks down barriers also.  Having an extra criteria to allow a child get into a grammar school through playing a musical instrument favours the middle class because it is middle-class children in primary school who get the extra tuition in music.  That is the point.</p> <p>  In 50 years from now people will say: "Imagine there was a time when one chose one's school on the basis of one's religion."</p></speech>

We see this as a step in the right direction, and we have funded it for the past 15 years, but it is only a step.  We need them to progress further.  Currently, they can get funding to work together but there is no expectation that they will go any further than that.  We would like to see them move on to the next steps to ensure an outcome.  In that way it will be sustainable.  Currently, that cohort just work together.  There is no sustainability in it, and we would like them to progress to the next step.</p></speech>

We believe that would be a strong starting point.</p></speech>

At worst, it becomes an excuse to avoid the real issues, and that is a huge concern for us looking at the amount of funding being poured into shared education as opposed to integrated education.  If the two concepts could be given even a level playing field in terms of political support and funding, we would be a lot further forward from where we are now, and we could be in danger of putting the Integrated Education Fund, IEF, out of business as it would like to happen.</p></speech>

From my experience in Dungannon, I thought it was another part of the educational programme because it gives young people the opportunity of working with other children who have disabilities.  I was greatly impressed by that when I was a member of the council in Dungannon.  It is something we do not see enough of.  When I was in school I never met someone with a disability whereas in the school in Dungannon, the children were helping a child in a wheelchair and helping another child to get about.  That experience is very useful.</p> <p>  I live close to Moy and Clintyclay, and therefore I am between two situations.  If a school is failing, and particularly a primary school, the danger is that people come up with the idea of creating an integrated school, but there must be more planning involved in that.  In the Moy situation, it was envisaged that this would be the first step.  It could have become integrated in the future.  The intentions of those who were planning it and the ideas behind it were good in terms of how it would develop.  There was too much emphasis on the fact that there would still be two schools on the one campus, but sometimes that can be a good development.  In the Omagh example, the Irish language and the other schools were put on the one campus.  Instead of building new schools, if schools can share the one facility it can lead to an integrated school in the future, which would bring people together who would not normally meet.  Do the representatives agree that can be an advantage in the future?</p></speech>

It was a small rural school and it did not have financial problems, as outlined in the judicial review.  It is a small rural school which could, if it transformed, open its doors to the other community.  It would have been a welcoming presence, and it could have grown.  I would point out that transformation is a process of helping with the oversubscription problem in the area.</p> <p>  In terms of shared education, it is certainly a step in the right direction but there must be something more to it.  It has to progress to the next stage.</p></speech>

The system is so rigid in Northern Ireland that it does not cater for real children.  I can tell the members about Grace, who is in year 9 in our school.  In terms of her mathematical ability, she is at the very top of the scale on the tests we ran with her when she joined the school.  Cognitively, she is extremely high functioning.  She was in the top ten of a competition for writing in <i>The Guardian</i>last year, and yet she has a statement of special educational needs and needs a classroom assistant.  Where else would we find a school that caters for that child's needs?  She spans the divisions that are built inherently into our education system.<br/><br/>A question was asked about the shared education campus.  I refer again to the question of a vision and purpose.  The shared education campus in Omagh will be built on what used to be an army base site.  Obviously, there is some significance to turning an army base into an educational site, which in itself is great.</p><p>Those schools will be built on that campus with their own front doors and fences, with their own badges and forms of governance.  They will be as separate on the site as they are on their existing sites.  Ours is the only post-primary school in Omagh not invited onto the campus.  It comes down to money and the fact that we moved into a new building six years ago.  We have accepted this, although we do not necessarily agree with it.  However, the remaining post-primary schools in Omagh will move onto the campus within the next four or five years.</p><p> Nobody has yet answered the big question: what will happen there?  There will be three shared blocks on the site and a great many separate classrooms behind their own front doors.  The big question which will not be answered for years is whether it will gradually become an integrated campus or remain a set of separate schools built on one piece of land, with the tribal politics continuing.  Nobody has answered that question.  If it does become an integrated site, I will applaud it, but my fear is that that is not part of the vision at present.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank the delegates for meeting us.  The discussion has been very informative on an issue of profound importance to long-term peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland for future generations.  Looking to the future, as distinct from living in the past, the presence of Jake today clearly demonstrates how the issue is about the future.  The delegates' articulate engagement with the committee and its powerful message give great hope for the future of Northern Ireland.  The committee looks forward to travelling to Northern Ireland to visit a school of their choice.  It is great to create links.

Regarding mobile telephones, I remind people that it would be appreciated if they were switched off or put in aeroplane mode.</p><p>Our first session is with the representatives of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  I welcome Dr. Maura Pidgeon, the chief executive officer and Ms Ursula Byrne, who is the deputy chief executive and acting director of regulation of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland. </p><p>Our meeting arises from delays in the registration of nurses and midwives, which is having a knock-on effect in the delivery of essential health care services.  A number of committee members have had meetings with different sectors of the health services regarding the issue.  The committee has been monitoring the issue closely.  I wish to apologise to the witnesses for the delay but the private business of the committee took longer than normal.  I thank them for coming before us this morning at short notice to discuss the delay in registration of nurses and midwives.</p><p>I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>With that, I thank Dr. Pidgeon and Ms Byrne for coming before us and I invite Dr. Pidgeon to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I will read an extract from my opening statement in order to keep within the time allocated.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware of the impact that delays in the registration of overseas nurses is having on the recruitment of nursing staff in the health services across all of the sectors.  The extent of the problem is that there are currently 2,016 applications being processed, 70% of which cannot progress due to incomplete documentation having been received by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland from all of the applicants.  All of the applicants who did not send complete documentation have been notified and are notified and updated on a regular basis.  Some 35% or 698 applications have been in the system for more than 12 months.  </p> <p>  Reflecting the lift in the economy, some 974 applications were received between January and June of this year, which compares to 302 applications received in the same period last year.  Notable contributory factors to the delay include staffing levels and funding at NMBI, with revenue being significantly less than expected for 2015, due to a lower than expected annual retention fee for the year.  This funding crisis has created uncertainty and insecurity among staff in the organisation with the subsequent increase in staff turnover for the first half of this year.  Eleven staff have left between January and June 2015.  This has added to the challenges of processing applications.</p> <p>  To get on the NMBI register, which is a legal requirement for anybody wishing to work as a nurse or a midwife in Ireland, the individual must demonstrate that he or she has met and achieved a level of competence in practice, educational preparation and would be prepared to work in accordance with the NMBI code of professional conduct and ethics.  This standard applies to all applicants, regardless of whether they are students graduating from Irish nursing undergraduate programmes or from overseas.  It is in the interest of patient safety that the process of registration must be rigorous and therefore cannot be compromised or undermined in any way.  </p> <p>  There are two major streams to registration.  Irish registration is about first-time registration for nurses and midwives following successful completion of their undergraduate programme and the annual renewal of registration of individual nurses and midwives.  The annual renewal process allows for restoration of nurses and midwives to the register if an individual has been removed for non-payment of fees.  If a nurse or midwife requires verification of their registration for the purposes of working overseas, a certificate of current professional status is issued.  Issuing of these certificates does not mean that the individual has actually gone to work abroad.</p> <p>  Students of nursing and midwifery in Irish universities and institutes of technology on successfully completing their education programme must apply to get on the register by submitting an application for initial registration in the Register of Nurses and Midwives, which is signed by the head of the nursing department in their educational institution and the director of nursing of the partner hospital.  This process takes place throughout September and October each year and the average time from receipt of application to confirmation of registration for students is seven days.  The number of students graduating each year is 1,500 in total.  Of that number, 860 are general nursing students, 290 psychiatric nursing students, 180 intellectually disability students, 100 children's general integrated students and 140 midwives. These are all registered within 15 working days.  There is no delay in this part of the system.</p> <p>  For nurses and midwives who have trained outside of Ireland and wish to practice in Ireland, the registration process is best described in four steps.  The first step involves the completion of a request for application and a payment.  This is followed by the issue of a personalised application pack to the applicant containing a formal application form and a full suite of supporting documentation, setting out all of our requirements together with full instructions.  The third step is the validation and verification of the application.  This stage requires a thorough visual check and validation of all documentation provided by the applicant.  The next step is that the application goes through an educational assessment for recognition of their qualifications and finally the application is assessed for determination of registration.  The decision can be one of three outcomes, namely registration, refusal, or successful completion of a period of adaptation and assessment, during which the individual's competence to practise is assessed.</p> <p>  The period of adaptation and assessment can be undertaken in any health care facility that has been approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, having met the standards for overseas adaptation.  These standards are available on the website.  On successful completion of this adaptation period, the applicant will have his or her registration confirmed by the board and his or her personal identity pin number is issued.  All applications from EU member states are processed within 90 days, as set out in the EU Directive 2005/36/EC, providing all documents are in order.</p> <p>  In regard to the current situation, the number of applications in January to June this year is 974 compared to 302 for the same period last year.  At the same time the budgeted revenue for the organisation was reduced by 33% as a consequence of lower than expected annual retention fee.</p><p>In addition, natural attrition of staff from the organisation was in the region of 23% of the organisation&rsquo;s complement.</p><p> Delays are also being experienced in Irish registration in respect of issuing certificates following restoration to the register for non-payment of fees.  The removal of nurses and midwives from the register for non-payment of fees and subsequent requests to be restored to the register is an annual event.  This year the numbers requesting restoration increased from 159 in 2014 to 1,472, with approximately 300 requesting a waiver of the restoration fee.  This volume of requests, against the backdrop of the resourcing issue outlined above, has given rise to delays in this process, which are currently being addressed.  These delays have not prevented the individuals concerned from practising.  Once an individual can produce evidence to his or her employer of completion of the restoration application and payment of fees, the registration is restored and the individual is able to practise, with the certificate being issued subsequently.  We are introducing an internal mechanism to allow staff to track individual applications online, thus enabling a more efficient response to queries.  Furthermore, the new restructured website will provide some online functionality, including the ability for individuals to track their own applications and payment options for applicants by the end of this year. </p><p> We have engaged in a collaborative process with key stakeholders so that we can further improve the process while maintaining the integrity of registration.  Those involved in the process include representatives from the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland, independent private hospitals, directors of nursing and midwifery, human resources experts, systems analysts and NMBI registration staff.  Moreover, our revised spending plan has been approved by our board, and the Department of Health has recently authorised additional resources to assist us in respect of the overseas registration delay backlog.  To clear the current backlog and ensure sustainability into the future as the demand on our organisation increases, we now require three additional full-time positions and funding for a web-based integrated case management system and register.</p><p> To sum up, while there are indeed delays in the registration of overseas  nurses and midwives, these delays have come about as a result of a combination of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, all of which have been or are in the process of being addressed urgently.  We are making progress, but much remains to be done.  In 2015 to date we have registered 253 nurse applicants from within the EU and 158 from non-EU countries, to a total of 411 nurses.  In 2014 we registered 344 nurses from within the EU and 161 from non-EU countries.  In the past 18 months, therefore, a total of 916 nurses registered with us.  A total of 2,016 applications are currently in the system, of which 818 are from EU member states and 1,198 from non-EU countries.  The number of applications received between January and June this year was 974, compared to 302 during the same period in 2014.  The number of applications in process for more than 12 months is 698, and the number of applicants with incomplete documentation is 1,398.  Of the 473 applicants who have received decisions, 330 were deemed to require adaptation, 43 have had their registrations refused, 55 were deemed to require further information following the initial assessment and 45 were recommended for registration.  Progress is being made but it is not quick enough, and this gives rise to the need for additional resources.  We welcome the support provided by the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in our minds about the importance of the work they do.  We and our loved ones depend on the verification process to validate the capacity, professional training and expertise of nursing staff, who are often the people with whom we have the most significant engagement in our health delivery settings.</p> <p>  The correspondence we received from Dr. Pidgeon in advance of the meeting refers to a decision to fill nine vacancies on an interim basis.  The issues relating to the protracted process and the delays in bringing people through the system have been evident for some time.  In her opening statement, she presented a picture of a less than stable or happy work environment, with an exodus of 11 staff over the period in question.  She also referred to uncertainty and insecurity among staff.  That is unsettling for any organisation.  Why were posts filled only in the relatively recent past and what exactly does "interim basis" mean in real terms?  I would expect the positions to be on a full-time basis.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland appears to be late in responding to an identified need.  While Dr. Pidgeon referred to a lower than expected annual retention fee, this has been a controversial issue in the past year or two.  I ask her to elaborate on the purpose of the annual retention fee and any other funding the board might secure to carry out its work.  If it is not solely dependent on the registration fee, perhaps she could help us to understand exactly where the funding difficulties arise.</p> <p>  There are 62,909 nurses and midwives on the active register.  I expect that some nurses and midwives may for their own reasons maintain registration even though they are not active in the health delivery system.  How does that relate to the numbers directly employed by the HSE or in private settings, including primary care and other practice roles?</p><p>Does Dr. Pidgeon have that information and statistics on the breakdown of nurses in the categories of general, psychiatric, intellectual disability, children and midwives?  If she does not, would it be possible to forward it to us subsequently?  I would welcome that.  </p><p> The number of students graduating each year is 1,500.  I expect that is the number coming through and graduating in this jurisdiction.  Are the numbers coming through at full capacity?  Does Dr. Pidgeon have information on the retention rate within our health system in recent years?   Could she give us a sense of that?  Has the retention percentage improved in recent years, particularly in the recent past with the lifting of the recruitment embargo, compared to previous years?  What has the direct impact of that been?  </p><p> Dr. Pidgeon referred to EU and overseas applicants.  Is it the case that Irish trained nurses are grouped within the EU classification within the NMBI's role and responsibilities?  I note the number of overseas applicants in the first six months has more than trebled compared to the same period in the previous year.  How does that statistic reflect itself in terms of Irish-EU applicants?  That figure does not appear to be given in the presentation but I could be wrong on that. </p></speech>

I am interested in the comparable position between Irish and EU applicants and the number of overseas applicants.</p> <p>  I will close on this point.  I can understand that time is required to properly evaluate and adjudge the bona fides of the suitably trained and qualified applicant getting through.  Is  there a verification process in place for the documentation presented by overseas applicants?  In layperson's terms, is there any fear of somebody presenting fictitious, forged or wrongly acquired documentation, and can we have certainty as to the veracity of the information and documentation being presented in every case?  Is verification by the issuing institution, in whatever setting globally, part of the work of the NMBI?  I thank the witnesses for giving of their time to come here.</p></speech>

The presentation appears, to some extent, to paint a picture of difficulties almost amounting to a crisis level within the organisation.  The presentation states, "This has created uncertainty and insecurity amongst staff in the organisation with a subsequent increase in staff turnover for the first half of this year, with 11 staff having left in the first half of 2015".  How many staff does the board have overall and what percentage of the overall staff would the 11 staff who left in the first half of 2015 constitute?  That statement is quite broad and I wonder if there are particular reasons for that turnover of staff.  There is a bigger workload within the organisation as we can note from the figures but it appears the staff numbers have decreased significantly.   What is the background to that?</p> <p>  There is the question of replacing those staff and  the number of applicants is increasing but staff numbers are  declining.  Dr. Pidgeon might elaborate on what she means by interim staff.  Are they temporary, part-time or long-term staff and how are they appointed?  Is there a long recruitment process for these staff or what is the exact position regarding their appointment?  How long are  those appointments for or are they long-term appointments?  </p> <p>  Dr. Pidgeon might elaborate on the financial position and the resources generally.  What are the difficulties?  What factors have brought about a situation where the level of funding is not adequate in terms of the number of applications with which the organisation is dealing?</p> <p>  On the issue of the number of nurses being trained, and this may not be relevant to the issue under discussion, does the NMBI have a role in the training of nurses?  Does it have a role in making recommendations?  In the area of gerontology and dealing with the elderly, it appears we will have a significant deficit in the number of nurses being trained.  I am not sure if that comes within the remit of the NMBI or whether it has any input into that.  Can Dr. Pidgeon see a time when the application and registration process will be manageable again within reasonable timeframes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#F00500"><p>I thank Dr. Pidgeon for her comprehensive presentation.  I wish to raise a few issues.  I fully accept there are 62,000 nurses and midwives on the register and each one of them has to renew their registration every year.</p> <p>  Dr. Pidgeon gave a summary in regard to the people who  are qualifying in Ireland and that they registered within 15 working days.  That system seems to be very well set up.  What is the staffing level dealing with the number of applications from people outside Ireland and from those  who are non-EU citizens?  Is there a gap between the time an application is received and when it is assessed to ascertain if inadequate documentation has been submitted or, on receipt of applications, are they assessed to determine if all the required documentation has been submitted, while not fully examining the application but merely identifying that if eight of nine items of documentation are required, they have been submitted? </p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of adaptation courses.  I understand from Nursing Homes Ireland that more than 330 people have to take adaptation courses.  Is there an adequate number of adaptation courses available and, if not, what mechanism is being put in place to ensure there will be an adequate number of them?  I understand there is a long waiting list for them and that even if it is agreed and approved, people can practice in Ireland who must complete an adaptation course.  What is the process for getting on to an adaptation course and what is the waiting period involved?</p><p>This question of the availability of adaptation courses is an important factor in addressing the broader issue.  My understanding is that the HSE is not providing an adequate number of courses and Nursing Homes Ireland has had to enter into discussions with other organisations about putting courses in place.  That needs to be clarified.  We can complain all we like about delays in registration but if the adaptation courses are not in place, we are not really achieving anything.</p><p> Although it is not a matter for the delegates, I am aware of a case involving a medical doctor who, after graduating in Ireland, went to work in New Zealand.  Within two weeks of applying for registration there, this person was eligible to practise.  By contrast, when the individual returned to Ireland two years later, the registration process was still not completed eight weeks after the person had applied to the Medical Council.  We seem to have a problem in terms of putting in place appropriate mechanisms for processing applications to register as health care professionals in this country.  I fully acknowledge the difficulties that have arisen for the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland as a result of the sudden increase in applications and the staffing issues it has to address.  I am concerned, however, about what is being done in respect of the provision of adaptation courses.  Even if we deal with the first problem, that issue will remain to be resolved.</p></speech>

Essentially, we have a number of full-time staff working on a short-term basis - that is, for a period of six months.  My comments regarding the workplace environment causing some uncertainty and unsettled feelings were in the context of the unexpected shortfall in revenue to the organisation, which meant I was not in a position to guarantee staff on short-term contracts security of tenure.  Naturally, some of those staff left for secure and permanent employment elsewhere.  Having said that, of the 11 staff who left, three were permanent staff who left for promotional grades and opportunities in other organisations.  There was an element of natural attrition, in other words, and my comments about uncertainty and an unsettled feeling related to staff on short-term contracts.</p> <p>  The NMBI is a completely self-funding organisation and relies on members' annual retention fee and other registration fees for its functioning.  We have had no other sources of revenue, except for two years ago when the Department contributed &euro;1.6 million towards the implementation of the new legislation.  We were then in position in which the revenue stream to the organisation was unexpectedly reduced.</p></speech>

Was that a once-off allocation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maura Pidgeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#G00400"><p>No.  The contribution of the HSE towards the careers centre is a long-established provision for the recruitment of students into the university programmes.  It had been significantly higher over the years but was reduced when nursing education went into the universities.  It is specifically targeted at mature applicants.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the increase in the annual retention fee.  Following consultation between the board, the Department of Health and key stakeholders, and in the interests of the continued provision of services through nursing care in the health service, the decision was taken to reset the fee to its original level of &euro;100.  There are ongoing negotiations between those parties on how the board can be funded to meet its obligations under the legislation.</p> <p>  There was a question about the total number of nurses and midwives on the register.  The figure of 62,000 relates to what we call the "live register".  An additional 20,000 nurses, including those who are retired, people working overseas and so on, are listed on the inactive register.  In regard to the breakdown of the employment status of the 62,000 nurses on the "live register", we have been in the process of collecting those data in recent months.  Having more comprehensive figures will help to inform workforce planning for the organisation.</p> <p>  There are 1,500 nursing and midwifery students in training in the Irish education system.  We do not have data on their retention within the workforce.  At the time of completion of their programme, all new graduates apply to come onto the register, but we do not have information on where they go thereafter.</p> <p>  In regard to EU applications, those numbers are over and above the number of home-grown Irish students.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Byrne to deal with the question of the verification of documentation.</p></speech>

Every document that is received from an applicant or on behalf of an applicant is scrutinised with a view to ensuring the information we require is there and that the document does not raise any concerns as to its authenticity.  That verification process involves examining not only the document itself but also the envelope in which it arrived.  In some instances in which we have had concerns regarding the authenticity of documentation, they have arisen on the basis of the envelope in which the papers were submitted.</p> <p>  There are several steps we go through to verify a document, depending on what it is.  For example, we require proof of English language competence for non-EU applicants through the International English Language Testing System, IELTS, test, and that this proof comes from source.  From the introduction of the IELTS mechanism in 2003 until very recently, that was done by way of IELTS posting us the results.  Now, however, we are able to access the results online.</p><p>However, there are 15 different steps in the process of authenticating the document.  If we identify a document about which we have doubts, we write to the applicant and say we have concerns about this document and ask them to provide an explanation or clarification of it.  In a large number of such cases - it is not a huge volume - we never hear from the applicant again.  A note is put on the file that we could not verify the authenticity of documents and the file and application are closed.  The application does not progress.</p></speech>

Then there are a number of supporting documents which must be received directly from source, such as the transcript of their training, a reference from their current or most recent employer and proof of their valid registration in other jurisdictions and their good standing.  As each of these documents come in we notify the applicant that we have received the document and we notify them of what is still outstanding.  They get a letter, but we are now moving towards e-mail communication with applicants as far as possible to speed it up.  We tell them we have received their application and that it appears to be complete or that they have not filled out a certain page or section.  When we receive their verification from other regulatory authorities we acknowledge receipt of it and we identify whether there are problems.  This is the primary area where, with additional resources, we wish to speed up the process of feedback to the applicant.  As Dr. Pidgeon said, we are also developing a facility on our website, which we hope will be live by the end of the year, whereby the applicant will be able to log on using a unique identifier and monitor their application and the receipt of documents.  That will cut down-----</p></speech>

It is simply the sheer volume of applications coming in and the ability to do even the initial identification of a shortage of documents.  This is one of the areas that the working group, which includes our partners and colleagues from the employers and their agents, is drilling into in terms of working together to address this issue.  In addition to targeting the backlog that has built up, another requirement is to work with employers if they wish to identify somebody and help applicants in the application process while they are overseas.  It is complex.  We have provided additional and more simplified information in that respect, but the issue is to work with them in identifying that before the forms even come in.  They are two elements of trying to deal with the backlog over time.</p> <p>  I will respond to Deputy Healy's questions.  To add to my response in respect of the staffing issues, it was 11 staff out of 51 that had left in the first six months of this year.  The process of recruitment is in hand.  There are internal mechanisms because there have been some promotional grades available, an opportunity for staff within the organisation, so it will be dealt with by the end of this month.  We are working closely with the Department of Health and the HSE in respect of utilising the Public Appointments Service as well as HSE deployment in order to select and recruit staff into the organisation.  That is in hand.  Further meetings, even tomorrow, on the logistics of getting additional staff into the organisation are taking place.</p></speech>

It is a self-funding organisation and, given the current circumstances with regard to the annual renewal fee, we are in discussions with the Department of Health about the ongoing funding of the organisation.</p> <p>  With respect to the number of students in training, that is determined at Department or Government policy level.  The number of students is not determined by the regulatory body.  However, the number of students has not decreased for several years and is still at 1,523.</p> <p>  Regarding a solution to the problems, several measures are being taken as we speak to address the criticality of the situation.  One of them is the board's approved spending plan.  The Department of Health has been very supportive with additional staff.  We have also reviewed, and had been reviewing, our internal registration processes in regard to simplifying the process and providing greater clarity of instruction and guidance to applicants.  That was in tandem with the development and restructuring of our website to have greater online capacity.  That will come on stream by the end of the year.  There will be a completely new website.  It is not just about a fancy page.  It is about the restructuring and the development of core applications to enable us to do our business online as a modern organisation.</p> <p>  Most importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we have listened to our colleagues in both the public and private sector in regard to the establishment of this working group.  It has met and the sub-groups are working on two focused areas.  One is to reduce the cycle time for overseas registration and the backlog.  The second relates to the area of adaptation courses and the maximum utilisation of those courses.  In addition, we are, and had been, using a call centre to deal with the volume of calls coming into the organisation and e-mail inquiries relating to registration and restoration.  The Department is supportive of our expanding that facility to address customer need in terms of responding to calls.</p> <p>  On the other areas of work, I believe we will get the situation under manageable control.</p><p>There is an increase in demand.  We are aware of a potential additional 1,500 vacancies to be filled throughout the sectors.  With regard to coming here from overseas, the applicants will advise through the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals.  We are putting systems in place and we have identified an internal manager to support the overseas project so we can clear the backlog and develop a robust and sustainable process to prevent further backlogs of this nature.</p></speech>

I was told when visiting nursing homes in Dun Laoghaire that some of them may have to close beds because they do not have nurses.  HIQA instructed one nursing home to stop taking in residents until it is able to fill its nursing vacancies.  I am particularly worried about nursing homes.  I understand that public health is of huge importance.  What is the status of the applicants who have been in the process for longer than 12 months?</p> <p>  I am delighted to hear there will be an online facility.  It is how one applies for many careers.  One must fill in the form on screen to progress.  It is something the witnesses should examine.</p> <p>  A number of care staff working in nursing homes are qualified nurses who do not have registration.  They have been waiting for 12 or 18 months and feel totally frustrated.  They are nurses but they are not recognised here as such.  I have been told they make an application but there is no response until they are told the application is being reviewed six months later.  It is a very untimely process.  I absolutely understand the staffing issues but if we must close down nursing homes and hospitals are backed up with acute beds being kept by patients we have a serious problem.  This is why we want the witnesses to sort it out or tell us how to sort it out.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the midwives, nurses and other staff in the maternity hospitals across the country.  They do a wonderful job and sometimes do not receive half the recognition they deserve.  What further information is required to be submitted by the 55 applicants?  Is there a deadline before people have to return the relevant information?  How will it be processed?  How long will the entire process take?</p><p>Regarding the recommendations for registration<b></b>in the final stage, for how long more will applicants have to wait to have their forms processed?  Incomplete documents were submitted by overseas applicants in 70% of cases.  There were 1,398 applicants with incomplete documentation.  One would regard people applying for a job in this area as being very professional and as having considerable education.  One wonders why it is not simple to provide the right documents or information.  Is it a simple process of ticking a box or is it more complicated?  It seems the form is complicated.  How many live applications is the board dealing with at present?  I am not too sure.</p><p>The board said it had 55 staff and is down 11 but that it hopes to recruit 11 more.  Is the board seeking another three staff in addition?</p></speech>

This is obviously a much more challenging time than in the days when six or seven Irish nursing schools provided all the graduates that were needed.  Circumstances are now very different.</p> <p>  Having had extensive representations made to me by individual nurses and their representatives at the time of the proposed increase in the retention fee, I learned they have a number of concerns that need to be addressed.  There was a sense that increasing the fee by 80% over two fee cycles in two years seemed hard to justify.  The nurses asked repeatedly what extra they were getting for the 80% increase in the retention fee over the cycle.  It is important that the delegates and members know that a consistent refrain I heard from many nurses - I am not saying I agree with their perspective - was that the board appeared to have two functions, the first of which was to take nurses' money and the second of which was to discipline them.  This was certainly a widespread opinion among registrants.</p> <p>  Nurses felt they had suffered disproportionately the effects of personal circumstances cutbacks during the recession.  Like everyone else, they were subject to the universal social charge.  Since they were mostly public servants, they sometimes had very substantial decreases in pay.  Many of them had depended on what had been non-discretionary overtime, which disappeared.  More important, many of them felt they were working much harder.  They were working harder because there were fewer replacement posts being filled and people were being allowed to retire.  The increased attention paid to the capping of staff numbers within publicly funded institutions meant retiring colleagues were not being replaced.  These were all concerns of the nurses.  Many of them asked where the board was when these issues were arising.  They wanted to know what position of public advocacy it was taking.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions.  The board tells us it is understaffed, which I accept.  We are well used to hearing that a body run by the public service is likely to be either understaffed or "malstaffed".  By how many is the board understaffed?  What is the budgetary shortfall required to refill the positions?  I am not trying to be provocative but feel this is an opportunity to bring points to the attention of the board that were brought to my attention.  Nursing members had concerns about how the board's money was spent.  They wanted to learn how much was being spent on public relations, travel and other items.  I am sure all these expenses were legitimate but the nurses questioned whether there were opportunities for cost savings.  At the time, they were wondering whether the cost savings could have been passed on with smaller retention fees.  Could the cost savings be passed on by hiring extra staff to do what is required?</p> <p>  Many Irish graduate nurses train in medical schools with which the board is very familiar.  The board knows all about these schools and the individuals concerned, who have been with the board for many years.  Re-registration of somebody with this background should be very simple by comparison with the registration of somebody who may have come from a medical school on a different continent, bearing in mind the interrogation of credentials.  A foreign nursing school may be a very fine one, but the board may not be familiar with it.  Is there any degree of cross-subsidisation of the current expenses?  Are the relatively simple registration requirements of Irish and EU-trained nurses being used to subsidise the appropriate interrogation of the credentials of nurses coming from schools that are less well known?</p> <p>  I have raised the question of fees on several occasions when it looked like we were facing a shutdown in the health service on this issue.  Many nurses said they would not pay the increased fee.  I am thankful that there was an outbreak of compromise and common sense.  The then Minister gently reproached me and said I misunderstood the function of the board.  I was told there was one function only, namely, to protect the public.  I kind of get that.  There is a need to protect the public but if one is entirely protecting the public, the public should pay for it.  If one is protecting the public and also defending the standards of the profession and individuals in the profession, then it is appropriate that those in the profession should pay some component of the fee.</p> <p>  We have in Ireland a tendency to follow the tombstone principle, which is the principle enunciated in the world of air safety.  Rather than trying to prevent crashes, most of the great air safety organisations wait until a crash has occurred and then investigate what happened.  In air traffic circles, prevention would involve advocacy of telemetry and real-time monitoring of cockpit management, etc.  I get the sense we do in our health service what is being done in the world of air safety.  We have a very unsafe health service.  We have a health service which, in all the critical front-line areas, is grotesquely understaffed.  Staff are overworked and expected to do jobs they are sometimes not trained to do at all.  In these circumstances, there is a higher frequency of adverse outcomes, lawsuits and general quality queries than in other equivalently sophisticated health systems.  I have made the point to HIQA, and now make the point to the board, that it is important that those concerned prospectively rap the knuckles of the people who hire the nurses and make decisions.  It is important that they tell them there are problems they need to fix and that they should not be depending on the board to come in as the police force afterwards to investigate people who, sometimes in difficult circumstances, produce outcomes that are not as good as they should be.</p></speech>

I will have to blame traffic.  However, I read the witnesses' document.  Just to point out, "An Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann" is spelled wrongly at the top, but that is a minor point.</p> <p>  Like Senator Crown, I had serious concerns at the start of the year about the registration retention fee and how that issue was handled.  I have had greater concerns since about the way the organisation is being run.  The statute requires that it be run independently.  At the time when we in the Seanad were raising the issue of the extortionate increase in the fee, the Minister for Health was telling us he had no role whatsoever in it.  However, the witnesses have told the committee that the organisation changed the policy in consultation with the Department of Health.  Under what statutory provision was that done?</p> <p>  I am also interested in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland seems to be a party to it, as nurses have been given the commitment that there will be no increase in fees until 2019.</p></speech>

Was political pressure put on it?  The corollary of my second question is whether the Department is forcing the board down a particular route to reduce its income stream, resulting in it not being able to carry out its functions while being unable to replace that income.  The Department seems to be forcing it on various issues, including that of fees, contrary to its statutory independence and reducing its income without replacing that income.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I will go straight into my few questions.  It was mentioned that the board received &euro;1.6 million to help implement the legislation.  I note that the witnesses stated the legislation also provided for a mandatory competence assurance scheme, which has not been commenced yet.  We are nearly three years on.  Why has it not been commenced and when is it likely to happen?</p> <p>  I noted that, according to the document, it takes approximately one week to register 1,500 new nurses.  It also mentioned a backlog in the re-registration of the approximately 1,400 people who left the list.  Given that 1,500 can be registered from scratch in seven days, surely it should only take a couple of days to re-register the 1,400 and issue their certificates.  I am sure it is only a few clicks of a button, although perhaps not.  Will the witnesses go through this issue?</p> <p>  I do not know whether my next point is relevant to the board, but I will make it anyway.  There are 1,500 graduates, but it sounds as if we need more and that, if we had more, we would not have issues with applications from EU and non-EU countries and the constant problems with paperwork.</p></speech>

Perhaps I will respond first to Senator Crown's questions as we await the return of other members.  I thank the Senator for his questions.  The rationale for the increase in the annual retention fee has been well documented.  The fee was increased in two consecutive years due to the low cost base on which the organisation had been operating for some time.  In 2013, the board proposed to increase the fee to &euro;140 in 2014.  Given the circumstances, however, it decided to leave the fee at &euro;100, with a view to increasing it in 2014 for the 2015 annual retention process.  The reason for the fee increase was simply the cost of implementing in full the new legislation and the subsequent need to modernise the organisation.  This involved the development and replacement of old information and communications technology, not to a highly sophisticated level but to a level that would allow a modern organisation to conduct its business.  The fee was primarily due to the cost of implementing the new legislation, which amounted to more than &euro;8 million in a four-year period.</p><p>The cost as a result of the new legislation was in excess of &euro;8 million over that period of time.  The issue of how the organisation and regulatory body is viewed by those we register is of concern.  We are mindful of it and one of our objectives, as we work our way through the implementation of the new legislation and conduct our business, is to create greater awareness of what it is to be regulated and how regulation can support individual nurses in the advancement of their practice on a daily basis.  </p><p> The sole of objective of the regulatory body is to protect and safeguard the public from people referring to themselves as nurses who may not have met the competencies or who have impaired standards.  We do that through the setting of standards for education, continual professional guidance and the code of professional conduct.  In that respect, the public interest is addressed through the setting of standards for nurses and midwives.  </p><p> In respect of value for money and the costs of running the organisation, the nursing board, under the new legislation, comes under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The board's accounts have been audited by it for 2012 and 2013 and the process has not made any adverse findings to include in the report of the accounts of the public services that were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The accounts for 2014 have recently been completed and no matters of substance emerged during the course of this audit.  </p><p> With respect to the costs of replacing staff who have left the organisation, the overall cost would be in the region of &euro;500,000.  These costs had been budgeted for in the business case for the original fee of &euro;150.  </p><p> With regard to travel, as the Senator would be aware, international work is a routine and normal part of the work of the regulator, in particular regulators of health professionals which is very much a global activity.  The recognition and appreciation of the developments of nursing and midwifery in Ireland is recognised across the world and in order to sustain that development and apply evidence-based practice to our regulation, it is important the board continue that international work.  The international work and participation in international forums and networks is no different to that of my predecessors over the years.  I am contractually obliged to carry out this work.  As I said in regard to auditing, all of the travel costs have been audited and are in compliance with Department policy.</p><p> With respect to the tombstone approach, there are three elements and I appreciate that nurses and midwives do not always see the middle element of regulation.  First is registration and second is maintaining nurses' competence while on the register.  We have continued to do that during the past four years through the launch of a new code of professional conduct and ethical practice.  We recently approved a new scope of professional practice for nurses and midwives which will enable and facilitate greater latitude in the work nurses and midwives can do.  We have revised the practice standards for midwives.  Our revision to the undergraduate standards and requirements for the education of nurses and midwives will go to the board for approval in the autumn.</p><p> We are, in conjunction with the HSE, revising our guidelines for the management of medications.  A multidisciplinary forum is revising the policy and standards on nurse prescribing.  We address the professional development of nurses and midwives.  On registration and renewal, I will defer to Ms Byrne who can provide some of the detail on that and can explain why it is more complex.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ursula Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#Q00200"><p>In terms of the comparison in timelines between Irish trained registrants and those who trained abroad, when Irish trained registrants start their education programme, they go on our candidate register.  We already have them on our database and have assessed their identification document.  Once they complete their programme and are signed off as being suitable to register by the head of the college and the director of nursing in the primary hospital where they had their placements, that process is very quick.  </p> <p>  In terms of individuals who were taken off the register for not paying their fees and their restoration to the register, once we receive their application for restoration forms, which they can download from the website and send to us by email, and we have received payment of the restoration fee their restoration is complete within three working days.  The issuing of a certificate of registration takes a bit longer than it would have done in previous years because of the volume this year, but they are legally entitled to be back in the workplace after three working days because their employer will be able to see on the online register that their registration has been restored.</p> <p>  A number of committee members asked about incomplete documentation.  This does not just involve issues with the application form which the applicant nurse submits to us.  It also involves issues to do with the supporting documentation which they must get from other sources.  Somebody who is Irish trained will find the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is somewhat of a one stop shop in that we provide verification that the person is registered, is in good standing with us and that his or her education programme met certain requirements.  Somebody coming into the country may need to go to three different institutions to get that information and send it into us.  He or she does not get all of the information from one place, depending on what country he or she comes from.  </p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned people who are already working in this country.  Ironically, that may work against them because if they are in their home country and there is a delay in getting documentation from third parties, they can visit the offices of that third party and speed up the process.  There are great difficulties in some countries which are outside of our control, in terms of applicants getting documents.  There are also some countries where the documents come to us in a format that raises persistent queries about the content of the documents.  This is an area where we work with recruiters so that if they are going to a particular country to recruit we can advise them as to the particular issues in that country.  If the documentation is incomplete, we try to speed up the process of informing the applicant of exactly what is missing or needs to be clarified.  </p> <p>  There was a question about what might be the issue after the assessment process.</p><p>This is information that primarily relates to the content of the transcript of training that the person sends in to us.  It is only when that has undergone detailed scrutiny that questions arise, usually in respect of particular countries where there are issues, where it is not possible to make a decision until certain queries have been raised about the content of the person's education programme.</p><p> The other issue raised about education programmes relates particularly to the numbers undertaking their education programmes in Ireland.  The number of places on courses is a matter for the Department of Health.  It would, however, always consult with us on this matter.  Programmes must also meet our requirements and standards so that we can be satisfied that at the end of the programme the student has had the requisite education and clinical experience.  One of the key issues in respect of the number of students on programmes is that there must be sufficient staff in the clinical sites to support the supervised clinical practice and assessment of students.  If in the morning there was to be a vast increase in the number of students, the clinical sites would not be able to support that.  These are the same clinical sites that support overseas applicants undertaking adaptation placements.  It is a question of getting that balance correct.</p></speech>

That is why we have been listening and have engaged in open information sessions and workshops to deal with the timeframes around the cycle and the adaptation programmes.  The restructuring of our website will provide for some online capacity in the initial stages this year.  The procurement of an information management system for registration will allow for infinitely more online capacity and the development of a smoother system for registration of all calibres.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Byrne, we fully endorse his acknowledgement of the work of midwifery.  There has been a huge emphasis on the work of midwives across Ireland, and in May we revised the practice standards for midwives.  The standards for education and training of midwives will soon go before the board.  One of the key elements of the change in the legislation is the acknowledgement of midwifery as a profession independent of nursing.  It is important and appreciated that Senator Byrne appreciates the work of the midwives.</p> <p>  I apologise for not picking up on the typo.</p></speech>

In respect of the Senator&rsquo;s point about the concerns about the running of the organisation, I hope it is clear that the organisation has been going through an enormous period of change and during that period there will be considerable stresses within the organisation at different times.  The exceptional circumstances that the organisation has had to cope with over the past six months have not helped that situation.  Given the circumstances, I have to acknowledge the enormous work and commitment of the staff in the organisation in registering the number of nurses we have now.</p> <p>  As a State agency, we are self-funded.  Independent regulation is a cornerstone of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011, as it is for all the health professions.  Needless to say, within that structure there are reporting and oversight mechanisms in the parent Department, and there would always be consultation and discussion about issues pertaining to the organisation, funding and policy direction.

Under the new legislation, we brought the staff, or some of them, from that organisation into the board.</p> <p>  The mandatory competence assurance scheme is part of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  It has not yet been commenced.  The development work is quite substantial and costly.  We have had to defer a large part of the development.  We can develop the model, but the roll-out and management - the business model - have had to be deferred, given the funding arrangements.</p> <p>  With regard to the question about having more graduates, as I said in response to a previous question, that is a matter for the Department of Health in respect of number of students.</p></speech>

Can Dr. Pidgeon respond to that point, please?</p> <p>  I have received communications stating that health care assistants, whom I mentioned earlier, are frustrated at the length of time it takes to register.</p><p>They are leaving the country and going to the UK, where they can be registered within a matter of weeks.  Is the documentation they use in the UK not accepted in Ireland?  Why can they be registered quickly there when it takes so long to do it here?  We have 1,398 people with incomplete documentation.</p></speech>

What was the role of the board in that?  What on earth is role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in that organisation?  Is the board being told not to collect money?  We have been told that under statute it can and must collect money to fund the organisation.  It has, however, been told politically not to do so by the Government, which is not giving any extra funding to make up the difference.  The result is that the witnesses have been dragged in to this committee to hear a load of complaints from all of us about how they are running the organisation.  I am not trying to defend the fee increase, by the way.  Is there political interference going on to suit a Government agenda which is having a negative impact on the organisation?</p></speech>

I am delighted they have come before us to clarify some points.</p> <p>  Going back to the first response Dr. Pidgeon gave on the nine recently recruited staff, she said the contracts were for six months and used the phrase "full-time".  Those are not permanent posts.  There is no security.  One of the issues that contributed to the departure of 11 people over the first six months of the year was insecurity and the general sense of things within the organisation.  Surely the anchorage that is needed is job certainty and security.  Does Dr. Pidgeon hope to be able to make these temporary positions, as they clearly are, into permanent posts?  Is that something she envisages in the short term?  I would be of the view that the numbers currently presenting are likely to maintain themselves for some considerable time.  Surely this is a requirement in order to deal with the work levels that are presenting for the NMBI now and into the future.</p></speech>

However, closing files requires resources and we took a decision to prioritise trying to progress those files that are still active and ongoing, rather than diverting resources to closing others.  When our staffing numbers are back to the required levels, we will review whether those files can be progressed or closed.  It is not in anybody's interests to have applications through the system.</p> <p>  For those who are working as care staff in Ireland and have applied, the fact that they are physically in this country does not change the dynamic of their applications, except that they may find it more difficult to get their supporting documents.  We are trying to increase the level of feedback to applicants on where their applications are in the system and how they are progressing.  We have very long-standing, ongoing communication with our colleagues in the UK.  The UK system, which was recently revamped, is on a par with our own in terms of the documents required and level of complexity of the process.  I would question whether people are able to get registered in the UK within a matter of weeks.  There are no short cuts in the UK and their process is as rigorous as ours.</p></speech>

The communications contract also includes the web restructuring.  It incorporated a member of staff because we do not have a full-time communications person, which we needed for a period of four months, and an annual retainer.  The amounts budgeted for have been in the region of &euro;300,000 for last year.  That is the public relations spend.  It is now considerably reduced because we do not have the staff member there and the web project will be coming to a conclusion at the end of October.</p> <p>  In regard to-----</p></speech>

I am not putting Dr. Pidgeon on the spot because she may not have all this information at her fingertips, but is it the same company?  Web design and public relations are very different skillsets.

The staff that we are replacing are temporary staff on a short-term contract for a period of six months.  The reasons for that are, first, that we have to finalise the funding of the organisation - creating permanent positions in the absence of firm funding arrangements into the future would not be very prudent.  The second reason for the short-term contracts is that we wish to address the current crisis in terms of the backlog and fixing and enhancing our processes.  On that basis, we will evaluate the progress being made because with enhanced systems and with more online capacity as we get towards the end of the year, there may not be the need for the same numbers of staff.  It will be evaluated over that period of time.</p></speech>

We look forward to meeting him on the first Sunday in September.</p><p>This meeting is an important and extremely topical one on the issues of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, which are faced by many families and communities.  Members of this committee are aware of the issues which arise when one is growing old.  Our elderly population are a pivotal part of the health system, so it is important to examine the issues involved.  Today's discussion is therefore opportune and welcome.</p><p>Before we begin, I must advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Professor O'Shea to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamon O'Shea" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#V00800"><p>I will start by providing a national perspective as a lead-in to Dr. Crowe who will talk about the South Tipperary Dementia Pilot Project, including some current ideas and realities about dementia.</p> <p>  Dementia is an ageing problem and there is still a great stigma attached to its diagnosis.  The financial, emotional and social costs are high.  Public knowledge is improving but attitudes remain largely negative.  People with dementia and their carers are certainly one of the most vulnerable and invisible in society.</p> <p>  Ireland has an ageing population and therefore the numbers with dementia are likely to grow, particularly among the very old.  The fastest growth area in the population is that aged 80 or older, so we are likely to see an increase in dementia numbers.  There are just under 50,000 people with dementia in the country.  By 2041, that number will have trebled to roughly 140,000 people.  The numbers will increase, so the big challenge is to find ways of addressing some of the needs associated with dementia.  The South Tipperary Dementia Pilot Project is about trying at an early stage to get to the heart of caring for those with dementia in their own homes.</p> <p>  We have done some work on the main costs of dementia nationally and, relative to other diseases, dementia has a huge cost.  Our calculations show that the annual cost of dementia is about &euro;1.9 billion, which is a significant cost relative to treating heart disease or cancer.  The main driver of those costs are family carers who essentially provide most of the care for those with dementia.  Approximately 50% of the costs are associated with family carers when a value is put on their informal care.  This makes it different from other diseases whose treatment is associated with technology.</p> <p>  Residential care costs are also high but, interestingly, primary and community care costs are pretty low.  This is because we have not yet got to the point where we are providing such services.  This is an important point to note in the context of what Dr. Crowe and Ms Leonard will say later.  Dementia is a different type of issue than the normal things we come up against in health where many costs are taken up by high technology and acute care.  This is what makes it different.</p> <p>  The current realities include a lack of focus on preventing dementia, which is not often talked about.  Some dementia issues have a preventative aspect, especially with regard to heart disease and stroke.  We therefore need to concentrate on what we can prevent.  Diagnosis is still largely poor and there is a stigma associated with it.  Many people are unaware of the disease.  The majority of the 48,000 I spoke of earlier would not have a diagnosis, which makes it very different from other illnesses.  If it is unknown, we do not do enough about it.</p> <p>  Community care is largely fragmented and incomplete, although some valuable work is being done.  We need to put the focus firmly on home-based care, supporting families and individualised and personalised care.  Dr. Crowe will say that having that link to the clinical lead and having a focus on individualised and personalised care is a new dimension for caring for people with dementia in this country.</p> <p>  We know the Government's policy and we have just had a national dementia strategy, but the key is how we implement it.  It is good that the strategy is there and the objective is to keep people in their own homes for as long as possible and practicable.  The implementation of that strategy is the key element.  We are hot on the heels of other countries that have national dementia strategies.  The emphasis is on diagnosis, finding pathways to care that support those with dementia, personalised care, and having adequate residential care.</p> <p>  The national dementia strategy must be framed in a philosophy which is about person-centred care and personhood.  It is also about the capabilities, inclusiveness and inclusivity of those with dementia within the system.  The critical element of the implementation strategy is how to get to the person with dementia and their family carer in a way that will enhance the care experience.  Dr. Crowe will speak later on about the South Tipperary Dementia Pilot Project, which is essentially wrapped up in a person-centred, personhood model.</p> <p>  The focus of implementing the national dementia strategy should be on the person with dementia, the family carer, and looking after people in their own homes.  If we manage to do so, it will not only have a health benefit but will also have a potential economic benefit.  If we can keep people out of residential care, it will be a major and valuable addition to resource allocation.  Dr. Crowe will demonstrate that with some figures.</p> <p>  This brings me to what we need to do differently and why the south Tipperary project is so important.  The current policy is encompassed in four or five key words.  This is not only for Ireland but also internationally, where we need to move to a new model.  Currently, we tend to think about dementia as individual, overly biological, and in terms of residential care, risk, deficits and exclusion.  We must transform care from a world where these words - individual, biological, residential, risk, deficits and exclusion - are in common usage.  Can we transform that world into one where we see dementia in some sense of collective, society and home-based care?  Can we move from risk to examining people's capabilities, what they can still do, and how they can still engage in society and the local community?  If we can move towards thinking of older people with dementia as significant assets in local communities and also moving from exclusion to inclusion, that is the real challenge.  That is what is interesting about what Dr. Crowe is going to say - the transformation of a model from exclusion to inclusion.</p></speech>

That is what should be emphasised in a national dementia strategy.  To have that transformation, we need to challenge the following.  We need to think of dealing with dementia as the most important aspect of ageing.  We can talk about financing and communicating, but dealing with dementia is the really significant issue.  We need to mobilise political and intellectual resources to support a liberating national dementia strategy.  We need to make the national dementia strategy real and tangible for people living in their own homes.  We need to create an understanding of dementia in society.   We need to agree key priorities.  For me, the key priority is to support individualised person-centred care for people in their own homes and communities.  We need to support the practice of personhood.  That is the challenge for everyone.  It is not just for the deliverers of care or families but for the political system.  Do we have the vision, courage and capacity to imagine a new paradigm, a new model, for people with dementia and, more importantly, activate the national dementia strategy to support this vision?  If we were to do this, we could completely transform the lives of those with dementia.  </p> <p>  Dr. Crowe will talk about what the transformation might look like.</p></speech>

I am a consultant in old age psychiatry in south Tipperary and I lead a project called The Five Steps to Living Well with Dementia.  It is a very innovative project and we are delighted to have the opportunity to present it to the committee today.  As Professor O'Shea said, dementia is a huge problem now but it is going to be a much bigger problem when the population with dementia trebles by 2041.  To put this in context, I ask members to step into the shoes of one of our patients.  Perhaps they can imagine being an 80 year old woman looking after an 82 year old husband with dementia.  He has been up all night, trying to get dressed and go home to his own mother, whom he believes is still alive, and when morning comes, both husband and wife are exhausted.  Whom does she turn to or whom can she ring, and, if she rings someone, can they do anything to help?  That person and that scenario are part of our wish to transform things.<br/><br/>As HSE staff, we understand just how difficult the health service can be to navigate, even for those working within the service, so we can imagine how difficult it is for an 80 year old carer to know where to go to find real help - not just a listening ear but someone who can do something to fix the problem.  These are the people who have been at the heart of our project, and it is their experiences we have been trying to change.<br/><br/>We were very lucky in 2012 when we were awarded funding of &euro;700,000 over three years to design new ways of supporting people with dementia.  It was unimaginable for us, as clinicians, to get that funding from Atlantic Philanthropies and the HSE through a charity called Genio.  We had to compete for that funding but we were one of four sites chosen nationally.  We were given that funding to go away and make a difference.  One of the big things they wanted, which really appealed to us, was that people with dementia and their carers would be at the centre of all that planning.  It was a very novel way of doing business.  We were all the table - people with dementia, carers, HSE staff, HSE management and voluntary bodies.  It was a completely new way of doing business, from the bottom up.  It was a matter of looking at what was already there and what was needed.  The aim was to design a better way of doing things, and there was the money to do it.  In our wildest dreams, that would not happen in anyone's career, so it was a huge joy to us all to try to make things better, because anything we could do would be better than the situation at present. <br/><br/>Professor O'Shea talked about the statistics, which are frightening.  We are not doing a great job with the 48,000 people we have at present and we really need to do things very differently in order to make things better.  Over the years, as clinicians, we gave a lot of thought to what might work better and we did a lot of service development.  I set up the old age psychiatry service in south Tipperary, the geriatricians set up geriatric medicine and, jointly, we set up a memory clinic to diagnose dementia, as well as a day care centre for people with dementia.  The more services we set up, however, the more the gaps became apparent, including gaps in information, in support and in respite.  While we could set up the services, where did people go when things went wrong?  That was a big issue that we wanted to fix.<br/><br/>We were very worried about how little support existed at a time of crisis.  It is okay getting regular support, but what if the carer got sick?  If that lady I spoke about broke her leg, where would she go?  We had an example of a woman who was looking after her husband with dementia.  She had to go to hospital with heart failure but took herself home prematurely to mind him because he could not be left on his own.  We have been able to rectify that through the service and the project we put together, and I will tell the committee later how we did that.<br/><br/>We knew the service was fragmented and we wanted to change it in every way.  We were also very mindful of the emerging national dementia strategy and our projects were chosen to provide evidence that would guide the development of that strategy.  In fact, I was asked to be on the working group that developed the strategy and I am now on the monitoring group that is monitoring its implementation.  In every way, the core objectives of the strategy have been absolutely embedded in all our work.  We have not been doing anything that is separate or different.  We were totally prioritising the objectives of the strategy, which are building awareness of dementia and destigmatising it, better diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and better support for people in the community.<br/><br/>The whole consortium of 26 people - those with dementia, carers and all of us - sat down and we asked ourselves what we wanted to do.  We said that we wanted to change the world for people with dementia.  We wanted to transform the life experience of people with dementia and their carers, increase awareness of the illness among the public, dispel the myths, reduce stigma and encourage people to come forward earlier for diagnosis and treatment.  Most of all, we wanted to provide flexible, person-centred care in the home so people could remain living at home for as long as possible.<br/><br/>I want to give a sense of some of our achievements as we are coming to the end of the project.  We have established a single point of contact for dementia.  A person can ring one number in south Tipperary and get a very highly trained clinician - a clinical nurse specialist in dementia - who will answer that call and solve the person's problem.  Therefore, the lady whose husband is up all night will not just get advice; she will get practical care that will resolve the situation for her.  It is transformational.  She does not have to ring 20 people who will tell her to ring somebody else.  We can solve it with an expert.<br/><br/>We ran a huge awareness raising campaign through developing the role of the community connector.  The community connector has worked in health promotion and prevention, as well as in building awareness about dementia through talks in pharmacies, Men's Sheds, resource centres, day-care centres - you name it, she was there.  She has worked with the ICA and Meals on Wheels and run pop-up shops.  She also did a lot of work promoting the prevention message.  The risk factors for heart disease are now the same risk factors as for dementia.  If people manage those risk factors - for example, a bad diet, smoking, obesity and diabetes - they can delay and prevent dementia and even Alzheimer's.  While that is not widely known, it is an important public health message to get out there.  The community connector has been very busy with all of that.<br/><br/>We have run a very effective local media campaign, with monthly interviews on Tipp FM, our local radio station, which are available on our website as podcasts.  Tipp FM is also making a documentary as a legacy to the project.  Our website gets 4,000 hits a month and our Facebook page gets 2,000 to 3,000 hits a week, so there is huge interest.  We were on &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot; and <i>The Irish Times</i>covered a conference in May at which Professor O'Shea spoke.  I was on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning before I came here because RTE picked up on the issue from this committee's press briefing, which is great.  Media awareness has been very important because it is about putting out the word that people can live well with dementia.<br/><br/>One of the biggest things we have done is to develop an innovative service, the dementia support workers service.  The dementia support workers are specially trained and selected people whom we put into people's homes.  For example, we pay their car insurance so they can take people with dementia out of their homes.They are not the home help or the home care attendant, and we do not want to substitute for those services because people need those too.  The idea is that the dementia support workers would re-engage people in the world and get them back doing things they had given up or taking up new interests and activities they had not even considered before.<br/><br/>We know that social stimulation and brain stimulation are as important as diet and exercise in preventing and delaying deterioration in dementia.  For example, we have a man back playing golf again who had given it up.  It is one of our dementia support workers who is taking him out to do that and he is now teaching her how to play.  Other people are going to the gym or swimming, and, for some, it might be a case of just going shopping again.  It is about facilitating them and not letting the disability get in the way, not doing something for them but enabling them to do something for themselves, so they are visible and participating in the world.<br/><br/>We provide routine, short-term care, but the most valuable service these workers provide is crisis care.  If a person is in a crisis situation, he or she rings our specialist clinic, which is a single point of contact, and we can provide care straight away that is responsive, flexible and non-bureaucratic.  There are no forms to fill because we fill in the forms.  It is not like the person makes an application and it goes to a meeting in three weeks' time.  Nobody can wait for that.  If the carer has broken a leg, he or she needs care immediately.  We are able to go out and fix the problem, provide immediate care and help them out until the natural supports take over.  Of course, the natural supports are there in the form of family and friends, who are amazing, but this service has made a huge difference to families who are receiving it in south Tipperary.  If a carer gets sick suddenly, or if a person is coming home from hospital and the carer is not sure whether they can manage if the nights have been disturbed, we can supply the service.  We have had people coming home from nursing homes who use the service.  We are really pleased with it.  The whole project is being evaluated externally by Professor O'Shea and Professor Suzanne Cahill from Trinity College, and in our own evaluations, 97% of people are saying this is keeping their loved one at home.<br/><br/>We have also developed the first memory technology library for dementia in Ireland, located in the grounds of the South Tipperary General Hospital.  It was set up by our occupational therapist and people can come there and view all sorts of telecare and stand-alone products that are helping in managing dementia, such as one-button radios and simple clocks.  That service is open to the whole country.  Everything we are doing is open to anyone who is on our website but the actual service is at the moment just funded for south Tipperary.  We have had many conferences and training days and we have actually changed the mindset of the HSE locally, which means it has really come on board with this and has increased its provision of home help to people with dementia living alone; it is now at a level of up to four times a day in response to our project.  Therefore, the HSE, which co-funds this project and for which we work, is really on board and wants to do things differently.</p><p> The lady who is looking after her husband had heart failure but took herself home from hospital to mind him.  We got a call from the public health nurse and went there immediately.  We put dementia support workers into the house to take care of the husband so the lady could recuperate and get better at her own pace.  He was safe and still at home.  We were able to give that support for a few days until the daughter came home from abroad.  In the pre-project days, she would have had to go back to hospital and he would have to go there too, which he did not need.  This is all in line with the strategy and it is absolutely where we need to go.  It has been hugely successful in south Tipperary.</p><p> We are coming to the end of our funding.  Our project will end on 8 October and our funding runs out on 29 August.  We are involved in very positive discussions with the HSE, locally and nationally.  We have met all the Ministers.  We have met the Ministers of State, Deputies Lynch and Hayes, and the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Our Deputies, Deputies Healy and McGrath, have been very supportive.  There is huge interest in not just sustaining this project but in rolling it out nationally.  We think we have developed this great funding and opportunity, and a solution to supporting people at home which is totally in line with the strategy.</p></speech>

I represent the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  For those who are not sure about what we do, we work across the country, in the heart of local communities, providing dementia-specific services and supports.  In 2014 we provided just over 1 million hours of care to approximately 9,500 people with dementia.  The services we deliver include home care, day care, Alzheimer caf&eacute;s, social clubs, cognitive stimulation therapy, dementia advisors, a helpline, care training and care support groups.  We are also an advocacy organisation and we advocate for the rights and needs of those living with dementia and their carers.  The voice of the person with dementia and that of the carer is at the heart of what we do.</p><p>They are closely involved in our work.<br/><br/>In 2012, only three years ago, the World Health Organization described dementia as one of the most serious social challenges facing the world today.  This is a significant statement and it is against that background that I address the joint committee.  As Professor O'Shea noted, the population is ageing and this will lead to exponential growth in the incidence of dementia in the coming years because age is the key risk factor.  Assuming current trends will continue, the number of people with dementia, which stands at 48,000, will treble within one generation.  We must also remember that 4,000 people under 65 years of age have dementia, and for every person with the condition, three others are significantly affected.  Dementia is, therefore, a major social, health and economic issue.  I am sure everyone present knows someone with the condition, as it extremely rare that a family is untouched by it.  It is useful to provide again, in synopsis, the wider context which Professor O'Shea described.<br/><br/>Professor O'Shea, in outlining the cost of dementia care, pointed out that almost half the cost of care is borne by informal family carers.  The largest share of Government expenditure on dementia care is allocated to long-term residential care, which is provided in the later part of the journey of those with dementia.<br/><br/>Dementia is a progressive illness which may last from two years to 20 years.  An increasing number of people are being diagnosed with the condition in a timely manner and at an earlier stage.  Cognitive ability is greater and different at the start of the journey than it is at its end.  I am generalising in this respect because the journey is different for everyone.  However, with 63% of people with dementia living in the community, the services required range from signposting services, providing links to local health care teams, clubs and caf&eacute;s and other social facilities that allow people to be involved in society and, subsequently, day care and home care.  Only much later and where absolutely necessary is residential care required.  Virtually all Government expenditure on dementia care is focused on the end of the journey and only a tiny fraction of it is allocated to these other services.  We ask the Government to consider how expenditure can be rebalanced to reflect reality.<br/><br/>The reason we all have the same message about community supports for people with dementia is that all of them and their family members express a preference for staying at home and receiving the support they need to do so.  This makes economic sense because it is also the cheaper option.  A recent European study, for example, showed that it was twice as expensive to provide residential care than dementia-specific home care.  This is an important finding.  In addition, there is plenty of expertise available to provide the services required, as Dr. Crowe explained.<br/><br/>The first national dementia strategy was published a little more than six months ago.  While the strategy could be transformative, there are certain limitations to its implementation, not least that only three specific actions have received funding.  We thank Atlantic Philanthropies, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health for providing these funds.  The three areas for which funding has been provided are general practitioner training, general awareness and specific interventions.  Much more needs to be done.  We want to ensure the needs that are not being met in the current system will be met in future.  The current system is characterised by poor rates of diagnosis, low levels of post-diagnostic support, patchy and inequitable provision of care and a society that pushes people with dementia to the margins.  The issue of stigma has been referred to by previous speakers.  There is no pathway of care available for those making the journey I described, which lasts for between two and 20 years.<br/><br/>The two themes addressed in our pre-budget submission are, first, staying at home and, second, promoting independence at home.  With 63% of people with dementia living at home, nursing home care should only be an option when the person needs a high level of care.  People should not enter long-term residential care as a result of poor community-based supports.  With appropriate community supports and interventions, people stay at home for longer, thus delaying the need to fund the costs of nursing home care.  We call for intensive dementia-specific care to be extended beyond the eight pilot sites funded under the national dementia strategy.  Funding of &euro;22.7 million has been provided for intensive home care packages for people with dementia linked to the hospital discharge crisis.  This will positively affect 500 people with dementia living in eight specific geographic areas.  This funding has been provided to enable people in acute hospital settings to return to the community.<br/><br/>We want to promote resilience and independence at home.  With approximately 48,000 people having been diagnosed with dementia, the provision of home care packages for only 500 people is a drop in the ocean.  The individuals in question are a specific cohort of people who clearly have significant needs as they are already in hospital settings.  We call for this pilot project to be extended to all local health regions at an estimated cost of &euro;30.2 million.<br/><br/>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland is a national non-profit, dementia-specific care provider with a presence in every county.  I referred to the different types of services we deliver.  We have experienced a disproportionate decrease in funding from the Health Service Executive in the past seven years.  As a section 39 organisation, part of our funding is provided by the HSE, with the remainder generated through fund-raising efforts.  In 2008, the HSE grant covered the cost of 74.5% of our services.  In 2014, the HSE grant covered only 67% of the cost of our services.  The organisation requires a further &euro;2.1 million each year if it is to return to the 2008 position.  While we have continued to meet the needs of people with dementia, these needs are increasing.  At the same time, our income from the HSE is reducing and we cannot assume that we can make up the difference through fund-raising.  With the general practitioner training and public awareness work that is being financed under the national dementia strategy, more people will present seeking services and support.  There is, therefore, a real picture of need, and funding is required to deliver it.<br/><br/>Staying at home is the first theme of our submission.  The second, promoting independence at home, is strongly related to the first and also falls under the umbrella of community.  It also links in to the contributions of Professor O'Shea and Dr. Crowe.  Post-diagnostic support includes not only traditional methods of care, as these may not be suitable or desired, but additional interventions that help to maintain a person's independence.  Our first recommendation for promoting independence at home is that funding be provided for a national dementia adviser service<b>.  </b>As a result of restructuring in the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, we have been able to fund eight dementia advisers.  These operate as signposters, if one likes, who link in with families to provide information on what services are available.  An evaluation of this type of service in the United Kingdom found that it plays a significant role in enabling people with dementia and carers to re-narrate their lives and find a new life that has meaning, value and purpose.  Our eight dementia advisers deliver a service to almost 2,000 people.  We would like to extend this service to each county and estimate that it would cost &euro;1.56 million to do so.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>Dr. Crowe referred to teams linking up with people with dementia in the community.  In this context, we make a recommendation that centres on case management and collaborative care.  Evidence shows that a case management approach in the community reduces the likelihood of institutionalisation, increases independence and so forth.  One of the priority actions in the national dementia strategy is for a primary care worker to play a key role in co-ordinating the care.  We estimate that providing a case worker in all local health areas would cost slightly less than &euro;2 million.</p><p>To conclude, people with dementia and their families want to stay in the community.  This represents the truth of the situation, yet most of the Government's spend is weighted towards the end stage and long-term residential care.  We need to look at how we are going to address the real needs of people with dementia in the community.  The measures I outlined to the committee would significantly improve the lives of people with dementia and support the implementation of the national dementia strategy.  </p><p> We are asking for political leadership on this issue.  There is a world dementia council as well as G7 leadership and we hope that there will be cross-party political leadership on this issue in Ireland.  </p></speech>

We collectively apologise for all the delays today.  I refer to the quote from the WHO which Ms Leonard cited which describes dementia as one of the most serious challenges facing the world today.  I agree with that opinion and I know only too well the truth of it.  I welcome all the delegates.</p> <p>  I do not have a raft of questions but one of the aspects that struck me with regard to the south Tipperary initiative is its simplicity.  It is not complex and it is very straightforward, which is, perhaps, its strength.  The critical aspect jumps off the paper but it also came across even stronger in the passion of each of the contributions.  I apologise I did not hear all of Professor O'Shea's contribution as there was a vote in the D&aacute;il.  I refer in particular to Dr. Crowe's contribution.  That passion, while it is not written into the text, just jumps out at me.  I refer to such a critical component part in the success of the initiative which is the people; both they and the community have made this difference.  I refer to the five steps of the Living Well programme or the building on those steps.  The five areas are among the achievements of the past three years.  Just two of the five areas, particularly, are directed to the dementia sufferer.  The others are supportive of, or directly geared towards the wider family and then the community in turn, in terms of other supports, technological advances, dealing with the stigma, public knowledge, awareness, acceptance, all of those things.  I ask the delegates to tell us a little bit about the clinical nurse specialist. I ask them to describe the factual position of the clinical nurse specialist - perhaps there are more than one - who is described in the contributions as the single point of contact for people with dementia.</p> <p>  My other question relates to the dementia support worker.  I can readily identify with this role.  I have had a recent experience within my extended family and friends of another case of dementia in the recent past and all that entails.  I see how it can very much limit and arrest another's life because of the support requirements.  I ask for more information about that role.  How many dementia support workers are in the service in south Tipperary?  With regard to the other areas I can readily understand and appreciate and I can apply them without any difficulty in my own community.  I can see how we could all play a part.  The clinical nurse specialist and the dementia support worker are more particular roles.  Is there a training process for dementia support workers?  What degree of preparation is involved?  What is the personal profile of those who are support workers?</p> <p>  I refer to Ms Leonard's contribution and I ask Professor O'Shea to contribute as he thinks appropriate.  I refer to the significant number of people with dementia under the age of 65.  One particular case was represented in the audio-visual room only several months ago.  He was a young man who could only be described as heroic, in my view, as he was looking after his mother who has dementia while still in her 50s.  It can present even earlier than that.  Are particular responses required for the younger age group as against dementia presenting in older life?  Ms Leonard spoke about an estimated number of 4,000 people and that is not an insignificant number of people.  This committee has addressed a raft of different rare diseases over the years that, in some cases, affect fewer than 100 people yet we are pressing, quite correctly, for specific supports and assistance.  However, there is a particular cohort of younger people here and their needs may be slightly different, I would think, than those of the older cohort.</p> <p>  The investment of &euro;30.2 million for dementia specialist intensive home care packages is one of the key component parts of the group's pre-budget submission.  It proposes that this would extend beyond the eight pilot areas and to all local health organisations regionally.  I ask the delegates to identify the eight pilot areas.  I agree that receiving a service should not be dependent on where a person lives.</p> <p>  The people in south Tipperary will not be able to readily identify with what I am now going to say but I live four miles from the Border and I have lived there all my life, born and bred.  Many in my home community, because of the absence of sufficient capacity within support structures and because of where they live, naturally gravitate towards the next little town or community and that might be in Tyrone or Fermanagh - I am thinking specifically of Tyrone and the Clogher valley.  The fair deal support does not allow my neighbours, whose life gravitation has been to Clogher village, access to the use of that nursing home.  There is a deficiency.  We are talking about developing all-island solutions to health challenges and this is a very practical area.  Fair deal should be available on the basis of the need of the individual as against the geographic location, not just of the individual, but of the service.  I ask Ms Leonard to comment from the point of view of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.</p></speech>

This project has done excellent work in south Tipperary and has been hugely successful.  I thank all the delegates for the very thorough, informative and detailed presentations we have heard.  The south Tipperary pilot project has been particularly successful.  It has reached approximately 340 individuals and families who are touched by dementia, which, as all speakers have acknowledged, is hugely challenging now and will be in the future.  The reason the project has been so successful links to what Professor O'Shea said earlier.</p><p>It is certainly well on the way to changing the mindset of society in south Tipperary towards dementia.  In the past, the initial reaction was that a person with dementia needed residential care sooner rather than later, as they were seen to be a risk to themselves or their family members.  That has changed in south Tipperary where people now see services and supports are available which enable a person suffering from dementia to live and be supported in their own homes and their own communities.</p><p> One of the reasons south Tipperary was chosen for the pilot project was because considerable work had already been done there in this field.  The Le Cairde day centre opened in Cashel in 2006 and the Memory Technology Library in Clonmel in 2008.  South Tipperary had form in this area.  The three-year pilot has been particularly successful with single points of contact, the website, the dementia support worker and crisis care system all setting a scene whereby persons affected by dementia and their families see a future at home and in their own community, rather than in long-term residential care.  The focus is to keep people at home living independently for as long as possible.  There was a widespread media campaign undertaken by the pilot project which was supported by the local radio station, Tipp FM.  It is to be congratulated on the success of this pilot project.  This pilot project, with which Dr. Crowe has been involved, should be supported financially, along with the national dementia strategy, and rolled out nationally.  I expect the committee to request this funding from the Minister and the Department and I hope it will do so.</p></speech>

I really liked their empathy towards the patients in question and the language they used.  They spoke about personalised treatment and it being inclusive to the person and their family.  Often when we get these documents, one often just gets budgets and statistics.</p> <p>  The pilot project in Tipperary sounds fantastic.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a strong project, Living Well with Dementia, run by Eilis Hession from the Health Service Executive.  None of us wants to suffer from dementia when we are older.  Tina Leonard said advisers can help slow the onset of dementia.  I did not know diabetic patients are more prone to dementia.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting Tina Leonard as it is important the committee hears from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I know the delegations want a commitment to continue the strategy with a budget behind it.  I will do my best, as will every other member.</p></speech>

Dr. Crowe asked the committee members to put themselves in the shoes of one of her service users.  I have been in those shoes, along with my brothers.  My mam was diagnosed with dementia when she was 89.  It was heart-breaking for the family but devastating for my mam who was very active up to three months before she passed away.  We were really taken by surprise by her condition.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Crowe talk on the radio this morning about not locking people with dementia away but to keep them at home.  My two brothers lived with my mam.  Through their unconditional love and affection, they made her life that little bit easier.  The highlight of her day was going out.  For some strange reason, she became a big fan of McDonald&rsquo;s which she never liked before.  Towards the end of her days, her favourite was chips and tomato sauce.</p> <p>  It is frightening that the figures for people with dementia will double by 2031, with 96,000 people diagnosed with the disease by then.  What is different about this pilot project to what other organisations and many other communities are doing?  Is there any graphic illustrating the national and regional distribution of the number of people with dementia?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is a difficult area and will become an increasing one with our growing aging population.  Up to 990,000 people will be over 65 by 2030 which will mean there will be a growth in the number of people with dementia.</p> <p>  I noticed a significant variation between the number of men and women who have dementia from the 2011 census.  For men, it was 17,391 diagnosed with dementia while for women, it was 30,459.  Why is there such a variation?  Is it because women live longer?  Has any research been done in this area?  Is it an area in which we need to do further research?</p> <p>  An issue raised in the national dementia strategy was that 94% of hospitals have no dementia care pathway in place.</p><p>When reports and strategies are produced, I always worry about the timeframe for implementation of sections of reports and cross checking to see what progress has been made after two, three or five years&rsquo; time.  Do we have enough mechanisms in place to cross check the progress that is made on what is set out in a clear strategy document, which took time to prepare?  Who will audit it?  It is very important.  While it is great to produce reports, the timeframe for implementation of the recommendations is important.  Regarding the finding that 94% of hospitals have no dementia care in place, what progress can be made on it and in what timeframe?</p></speech>

They outlined that in 25 years&rsquo; time, the number of people living with dementia will have tripled.  It makes sense that people should be supported to live at home for as long as possible.  There are waiting lists for the fair deal scheme, and with 20,000 people going over the age of 65 each year for the next number of years, it makes sense for people to be cared for at home.  I was particularly interested in the south Tipperary dementia pilot project, especially in the way the witnesses personalised the stories in the presentation.</p> <p>  The presentation stated that there is a single point of contact in south Tipperary.  I presume each of the eight pilot schemes has this single point of contact.  Do people from outside the Tipperary area make contact?  Have the witnesses considered temporary sheltered accommodation for people who do not have anybody to care for them?  The presentation mentioned that it is possible to delay dementia.  Could the witnesses expand on that?  Ms Leonard mentioned that the project has provided more than 1 million hours of care to approximately 9,500 people suffering from dementia.  Some 50,000 people suffer from dementia.  Are the rest of them living in nursing homes or are many people receiving no service at all?  The eight dementia advisers deliver a service to 1,760 people.  I wonder about all the people who receive no service at all.</p></speech>

I read the submissions, which we received in advance of the meeting.  Given that I have a family member who suffers from dementia, I am familiar with it, and it is sad to see the deterioration at an early stage.  They try to get involved in family conversations, and get in and out of it.  In a one-to-one situation they are only able to cope and one sees the difference.  I agree that information is vital.  In one instance, the person strayed and got lost.  A simple thing like putting a mobile telephone in the person's pocket so one can make contact and know where the person is at any time of the day or night can be effective.  It took three years before the family discovered this.</p> <p>  The person in my family began to suffer from dementia in his early 60s and is in his mid-60s now.  It was a very sad time for his family, when they still had much to look forward to.  He is still in his home and is being cared for.  In Adare, where I live, there is an excellent day centre.  It provides an outstanding service and is greatly supported by the wider community outside of those who may be involved with the families with dementia.  I congratulate the witnesses on the work they are doing and wish them well.  I have read their pre-budget submission and, hopefully, we will be able to further influence those who have the authority to make decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#EE00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I am sorry I missed most of the presentation.  I never knew what dementia was until several years ago when my mother went into a nursing home and I realised some of the people there were suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  I did not realise they needed special care and often wondered what we could do to help them.  I always thought dementia was part of the aging process and that the older one became the more likely it was that one would suffer from it.  Only when I examined the statistics and read Ms Leonard's report did I realise that 4,000 people under the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer's disease, which is very alarming.</p> <p>  As a young person, how can one identify dementia?  We all suffer from memory loss at some stage.  Communication, functional abilities and behaviour are also mentioned.  Behaviour is probably the most common way dementia is discovered.  We need much more care, especially in our general hospitals and residential care.  My mother was old and was in a nursing home because she was coming to the end of her life.  I saw people who needed more than somebody putting them in a wheelchair, taking them to a dining room and feeding them and doing the normal things.  Many of them had behaviour problems and it took two or three people to look after them.  I am an advocate of people staying at home.  I often say if anything happened to my wife or me I hope we would look after each other, and I hope my children look after me.  The statistics are shocking.  Some 48,000 people are suffering from dementia and, as the presentation stated, by 2041 the figure may have reached 132,000.</p> <p>  We are very lucky.  I come from Dundalk.  We got a bad beating last week in Thurles.  I am sure Professor O'Shea was there, and he had his own problems.  There is a centre in Dundalk called the Birches.  The amount of work the people there do is second to none, however they find it very difficult to get money to keep them going and they depend on charity.  We will have to push harder on dementia and let people know it can affect young people as well as old people.  The presentation was excellent.  If the committee can help the witnesses in any way, they need only ask.</p></speech>

It is very moving for us that they are so receptive to what we are saying.  Clinical nurse specialist is a recognised grade of nurse already in the health service.  It is a very senior grade and is equivalent to the clinical nurse manager grade CNM2, who would run a ward.  These people are senior and highly qualified, and they work across a range of specialties such as diabetes, respiratory medicine, midwifery and work at a very high level of expertise and autonomy with the clinical team.  We developed our clinical nurse specialist post towards the end of the project when we realised there was a need for a very highly qualified nurse, who is highly expert in dementia in all the possible complications as well as the simple parts, to be in the community, go out and respond to need, do assessments and put in services.  Being the single point of contact is attached to it but is not the clinical nurse specialist's only job.  When a query comes in, it comes to a person who is very expert, highly qualified and can do something for the caller, not just to a secretary who will tell the caller to go to his or her GP.</p><p> The beauty of the pilot was that we could understand that this was the necessary level of expertise.  It is a recognised grade and we have two fantastic people jobsharing the role at the moment.  One is an advanced nurse practitioner in dementia and the other is a clinical nurse specialist in old age psychiatry.  They are the best of the best and we are lucky to have them.  We are going to mainstream this post as the service goes forward.  It is a recognised, senior and expert grade that is useful for families and people with dementia.</p></speech>

It is not that these people were psychiatric patients.  It was that I was the lead.  It was meant to ensure good governance and accountability and to keep it safe.  As we proceed, there will be no need for all of the patients to be under old age psychiatry.  It is making them psychiatric patients unnecessarily.  A part of our sustainability plan is to move them into community care, with the consultants having an overarching involvement and there being more of a memory team running it alongside HSE management.  We are working on the location and setting.  Our sustainability plan is for them not to be in mental health services, as they do not need to be there, and that they would access mental health services from our clinic and mental health specialists when they need it.  Most people do not have psychiatric complications in dementia, but approximately one third of them do.  People will be located in community care with the proper governance and supervisory structure around it.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's second question, which was on dementia support workers, they are an interesting grade.  We have developed it and their role.  It is based on peer support workers.  Members might have heard of them.  They crop up in many settings.  For example, they are being developed in mental health services.  We recruit them from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Carers Association.  We work closely with both groups.  This is a collaborative project.  We have recruited people who are trained to FETAC level 5, which is a nationally recognised qualification.  We reinterviewed them for the project and checked their suitability.  We had a high threshold.  If I was happy to see them in my mother's kitchen, I would have them in the project.  They had to be special, warm and giving.</p> <p>  We have fantastic people.  There are 19 of them.  We give them further training.  We developed a two-day intensive dementia programme.  We also give them monitoring and mentoring.  We are very fussy about the quality of person whom we have.  We brought them all in last week and they told us how much they loved doing this work.  It is new work in Ireland.  It is different than being a home helper.  Some are home helpers and some are doing other jobs.  Ours is a new model that can be expanded everywhere.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's third question was on the population.  In south Tipperary, there are approximately 1,000 people with dementia.  In or around one third of those are in long-term care, leaving 650 or so in the community.  Our budget of &euro;700,000 has allowed us to provide support to approximately 340 of these over three years.  That is the cost of four or five people in long-term care in the same period.  The cost effectiveness is staggering.  I hope that I have answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

There are four Genio projects around Ireland, including one in Kinsale and another in Mayo.  We are all closely linked and collaborative, so we recognise the fantastic work that is being done in Stillorgan-Blackrock.  It is also trying to be mainstreamed.  I did not have time to mention the other pilots today, but I want to acknowledge their fantastic work.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne's comments about her mother were moving.  We recognise that anything we do as professionals is only a drop in the ocean compared with what families do.  What they do - the love and loyalty that they show - humbles us all of the time.  We support them in continuing to do what they want to do.  Irish families and communities are extraordinary.  We see it every day.  It would move one to tears to see what people do for their loved ones, how much they love them and how much they want to look after them.  I wanted to say this publicly.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me what was different about our project.  It is a collaborative project between us and the four voluntary bodies, all of the HSE staff that one might think of, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Carers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the South Tipperary Community and Voluntary Forum, which is an umbrella group of the 70 voluntary bodies in south Tipperary.  At the core of the project are three people with dementia and three carers.  Some of these carers are former carers.  We got a blank page from the HSE and were asked how to do it differently.  The HSE gave us that money.  It was an amazing opportunity to redesign factors.  We looked a great deal to former carers who explained that something or other was not there when they were caring, for example.  It is a different approach, in that it is bottom up rather than top down, and had never been seen before.  This was a major strength.  People with dementia and carers attended everything we did.  They told us what to do next.  In our memory technology library, former and current carers told us what would work, what not to use, etc.  Much of the expert opinion that I give families on what to do next I learned from other carers.  They found that something worked and they passed on the knowledge to someone else.  The collaborative, bottom-up approach, the person with dementia and the family are at the centre of everything, making our project different.</p> <p>  We had freedom with our funding to change the project as we saw fit.  We did not have to get permission to make a clinical nurse specialist post.  If we recognised that it was needed, we did it.  It was free and unrestricted.  That has been a liberating experience.  We have done amazing work with &euro;700,000 and had the freedom to provide support to 340 people, as we did not need to submit business cases, write letters or explain matters.  It is a great model for how the health service could be in many other domains.</p></speech>

That was encouraged.  If something did not work, one could stop and try something else.  That has been positive.  Everyone working in the project has a day job as well.

Arising from the pilot project and his own work, is there a buy-in for that concept across the strategy?</p></speech>

They have been transformative in the context of individualised, person-centred care.  The new model or, as Deputy Byrne called it, thinking outside the box has been the main lesson.  The national dementia strategy was published last year and is at an early stage.  If we can manage to integrate the ideas, concepts, philosophy and support for home-based care and people with recognising the person with dementia and his or her importance, the national dementia strategy can be equally transformative.  There is a double win here.  Dr. Crowe has emphasised what is good about this work, but the task for the next couple of years will be to support the strategy in being equally liberating.</p></speech>

Men may have more risk factors, but it is women's longevity that has that figure so high.</p> <p>  The implementation element is important.  The strategy's monitoring group will monitor the implementation.  We have a large job to do there.  Professor O'Shea and I are members of the group.  We in Ireland are good at strategising, but we are not always good at implementing.  That is our greatest job.  At least this kind of approach can be implemented and copied everywhere.  We are not precious about it.  We can give everything to everyone.  People have been coming to look at and find out about what we are doing.  We are more than happy to help other groups to set up.  They do not have to do all of the ground work; we have done that and found models that work.</p> <p>  Turning to Deputy McLellan, a single point of contact is important.  As to the eight areas that will get intensive home care packages, those packages are in a novice state.  They are concerned with getting people out of acute hospitals and back home.  We have received funding from Genio for three packages outside of the eight.  They are cumbersome to put in place and there is a great deal of paperwork, but they could be useful in time.  There is no single point of contact yet, but each of the three other Genio projects that Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned has a single point of contact.</p> <p>  We have not set up any sheltered accommodation as part of the project, but there is a small amount of it in south Tipperary and some people with dementia live there as part of our normal practice.  We have not done anything differently in that regard.</p> <p>  Delaying dementia is important.  This is something that we all need to think about.  Four treatments for dementia came out between 1997 and 2002, but there has been no new treatment for it since.  What has come out is evidence to the effect that, if one manages one's vascular risk factors, which we should all manage anyway for healthy hearts and brains, one can delay the onset of dementia.</p><p>That is part of the heart strategy.  It is part of the Healthy Ireland strategy.  We need to emphasise that and let that word go out.  We were always afraid of dementia but at one time TB was not talked about.  People never talked about cancer, HIV and AIDS.  Those are now talked about.  There is no stigma surrounding them.  We need to talk about dementia in the same way as something that one can do something about.  That is not to say that plenty of people who got it went on to live healthy lives.  Therefore, it is not the only risk factor.  If we, as individuals, can do anything, we would be happy to do so, but also acting as part of a wider community can help.</p><p> Deputy Neville spoke of the wandering and the simple contact by telephone, and I appreciate that.  It is often other families who come up with those kind of solutions.  We found that in the project.  We have spaces where families can tell each other and give advice.</p><p> In response to Deputy Fitzpatrick on the question of dementia and Alzheimer's, it is common for people not to understand the difference.  People say to us they do not mind if they have dementia as long as it is not Alzheimer's.  Dementia is the umbrella term and Alzheimer's is the commonest type, but there are approximately 50 different types of dementia.  People use the terms interchangeably and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland does not restrict itself to Alzheimer's but covers every dementia.  The terms are used interchangeably but Alzheimer's is the commonest type of dementia.</p><p> Dementia is different to normal ageing.  People think it is normal ageing and want to say that there is nothing wrong but it is different.  The outcomes for the person are very different.  We all are losing brain cells all the time, probably from our 20s, but that is not dementia.  Dementia is not normal aging.  As anyone who has been involved with it will know, there is a difference qualitatively in terms of the experience.</p><p> In the general hospitals, there are three big Genio projects.  The Genio Trust, the funder of our projects, combines Atlantic Philanthropies and government funding through the HSE.  There are three big Genio projects going on in acute hospitals over three years to improve the dementia care pathway through acute hospitals.  These are in Blanchardstown, St. James's and the Mercy in Cork.  Those are trying to correct the care pathway because general hospitals are terrible places if one has dementia.  Patients get very confused and agitated.  The projects are trying to smooth out and improve such issues as training, understanding and the environment so that the patient has a quicker trajectory and gets out quicker.</p><p> With our project we found it has spilled into the general hospital and one of the general hospital wards has made itself dementia friendly.  Tesco has even set up fund-raising for us using its tokens to make the ward dementia friendly.  It has been done out of donations with no new funding.  The ward has been reoriented, painted in dementia-friendly colours and uses signage and trained the staff.  We found with our project we can get patients out of hospital quicker because we can put in support workers to get them home, and that is a much better outcome.  Those with dementia do badly in acute care.  They have longer lengths of stay suffer higher forms of morbidity and greater mortality and are more likely to end up in long-term care.</p><p> I think I have answered my questions.</p></speech>

I should have said that earlier.</p> <p>  To come to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question first, he asked about the under 65s of whom there are 4,000 and what different needs they may have.  The obvious ones are that many dementia services in Ireland fall under the older age category.  That is the first point to note.  There may be age discrimination or an age barrier in that regard.  Indeed, the national dementia strategy opens with the assertion that everybody in dementia has to benefit from the strategy but then, as one goes to the detail, many of the elements mentioned within the health services are under the services for older aged persons.  Then one begins to wonder whether there is a barrier in that regard, even within the language used within the strategy.  That is a real consideration.</p> <p>  There are other real considerations.  Those under 65 are at a different place in life.  Some of them are working and we have come across those who felt they had to leave work immediately.  Questions arise, such as can workplaces be supportive of those with dementia and can they change the type of work they are doing.  Such persons with dementia may have dependants and then there are financial issues.  Also, there is an impact on public awareness.  In public awareness work that we have carried out and in talking to those with whom we work who are under 65 and who have dementia, one sometimes finds that the level of understanding or acceptance on the part of the public is less because someone is assuming dementia to be exclusively an older age issue.  We have even come across situations where those in their 50s, for example, almost feel they must justify and prove somehow that they have dementia because others do not believe and are not willing to give help as easily as they would for someone who is much older.  All of those issues must also be addressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the eight pilot sites.  These are ones separate to the four Genio living well projects that we have heard about today.  They are provided under the funding available under the national dementia strategy.  The national dementia strategy has over &euro;27 million to deliver three different actions, one of which relates to the provision of intensive dementia-specific home care for which there is &euro;22.5 million.  In that regard, there will be packages in eight pilot sites, four of which are in Dublin  - in north Dublin, Dublin north city, Dublin south west and Dublin south east - and in Cork city, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  As Dr. Crowe stated, these are linked to patients who are in acute hospital settings to enable them to go back to the community.  No doubt it is needed, but it is a narrow focus that needs to be expanded.  Dementia-specific home packages need to be available for those with dementia across the country, not only if one is in hospital but for those already in the community looking to remain in the community.  That is crucially important.  It is worth noting also that currently HSE tenders are for generic home care packages.  There are not dementia-specific tenders.  We believe dementia-specific home care is very important because those with dementia have different and specific needs.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also mentioned the geographical lottery.  It is worth mentioning post-diagnostic supports there.  For example, one woman with whom we work who has Alzheimer's, Helen, is just over 65, but she was under 65 when she was diagnosed.  She was diagnosed in Galway hospital, and lives in Sligo.  She drove home on her own, was not told where to go or whom to talk to, and then, understandably, went into a darkness and almost did not leave the house for the first ten months staring at the four walls, not knowing where to go and what to do.  That is a real experience of only a few years ago.  Another person with whom we work, S&eacute;amus, who lives in Dublin, is in his 70s.  He also has Alzheimer's.  He was diagnosed in the memory clinic in St. James's.  They put him in touch with the primary care team, which linked in with him, called to him and signposted him to supports, such as our Alzheimer's caf&eacute; and working group and the day-care centre locally.  Immediately, from day one, both he and his family were given all that information.  The committee will see from those two cases the difference in being linked in to information from the start and then, as Dr. Crowe outlined, to have that support and co-ordination of care as time progresses.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Colm Burke, Dr. Crowe spoke about the pathway in hospitals.  It is important to mention that almost one quarter of patients in hospitals have dementia and those pilot sites and the three projects to make those hospitals dementia friendly are crucial.  In particular, I am thinking of one person who went into hospital where there is not dementia-specific care and the decline was immediate and quite severe.  When one is aware that those with dementia can continue to thrive with dementia-appropriate and dementia-specific care, that is so upsetting to see.</p> <p>  I should mention as well that the ASI is represented on the dementia strategy implementation review group.  The implementation review group includes not only all of the experts but a member of our dementia working group - a person with dementia - and a member of our carer's network.  It is crucial that the voice of the carer and the voice of the person with dementia are there.  It is part of our policy and all the work, especially all the public awareness work, we are doing right now that we hear from those who are advocating for themselves.</p> <p>  On prevention, which was raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan, recently we published a paper that we commissioned the Institute for Public Health to write on prevention and dementia.  One will have heard about keeping healthy and heart health.  It is about not smoking, not drinking much, etc.  Keeping the body healthy keeps the brain healthy - low education was a factor there.  When the research was analysed it was discovered that if all the related and interacting modifiable risk factors were reduced by 10%, which is a big ask, taking the 2011 figures for dementia, within one year over 1,000 cases could be avoided or delayed.</p><p>That is a huge number.  We call on the Government to ensure dementia and dementia prevention are included as a public policy message across all health messages.  That is to support what members heard earlier.</p><p> Regarding the delivery of services to the 9,500 people we are reaching, and that is not the total number, 5,000 of those call our helpline.  That is one service we provide.  A different type of service could be a social club, caf&eacute;, day care, home care and so on.  Is it a drop in the ocean?  Yes.  The reason for that is that the 48,000 people we mentioned are prevalence rates.  If we are in the same position as the United Kingdom, then only half of those people are actually diagnosed.  Also, we do not have the money to provide more services than those we already provide.  That links in to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about The Birches, our day centre in Dundalk, and what I said earlier.  Our funding from the Health Service Executive, HSE, has decreased.  We cannot plug that gap with fund-raising because the gap is becoming too wide and the demand for services is growing.  Therefore, what do we do?  That is the stark reality.</p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to the numbers in each county.  Deputy Mitchell has the number for each county.  They are prevalence rates.  With regard to all the numbers we mentioned, it is important to point out that we do not have a register of people with dementia in Ireland.  We do not know the exact number diagnosed and where they are located.  Therefore, we cannot tailor services to reach those people.  That information should be available, which is another question for the future.  I hope I have answered all the questions.</p><p> To conclude, individualised, person-centred care is what we in the Alzheimer Society of Ireland are advocating for and what we are about.  All the evidence shows us that interventions, supports and advice at earlier stages and throughout the journey enable people to live well, which is what they want, and it is also economically beneficial.</p></speech>

However, there are two aspects to be considered, the first of which is the large numbers, including the 50,000 who have been diagnosed and the multiples of that who will be affected in the next few years.  How we deal with that will be a seriously significant issue, not only in terms of the issue of dementia but in the funding of dementia supports.  Equally, when we talk about big numbers, it is easy to forget about the issue of dementia and the person-centred, personalised care that recognises the dignity and humanity of the issue for people and their families.  That will be a key aspect in the coming years.</p> <p>  We are in a position now where we have a strategy.  The key issue is the implementation of that strategy, which must be accelerated.  Having a strategy is one thing, but implementing it is another.  We need to recognise what I just mentioned, namely, the number of people affected and the individualisation associated with the illness.  We have some examples of projects in south Tipperary and other areas where there are huge gains to be made from considering the social aspects of the disease and how communities can be mobilised if there is significant public investment in dementia.  If we could merge the notion of the local with the issue of public support for people with dementia, we would be in a position to say we are addressing a significant issue.  The opportunities are many.</p></speech>

It is a problem, and I am sure it is not unique to north Monaghan.  It probably goes along the Border's length, but I am most familiar with a particular case in regard to two homes in the Clogher Valley.</p></speech>

While we said the Government's focus in terms of spending is on long-term residential care, it is important to say that in an ideal world, there would be more options.  The Deputy mentioned sheltered accommodation.  There are no other options for people who need that level of help now, and that is a problem.  People with dementia trying to access a nursing home under the fair deal scheme may, and do, come up against not only geographical problems but also that some nursing homes will not accept someone with dementia.  For example, a member of a family I know was in a nursing home but the family were asked to take the person out of the nursing home because it could no longer deal with the person whose condition had progressed.  Can one imagine getting a call like that?  Even if someone gets a package under the fair deal scheme, there can be barriers in terms of accessing the care.  Issues arise across the journey.</p></speech>
