We begin today's hearings with Mr. Paul Gallagher, former Attorney General.  I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearings of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.</p><p>At this morning's sessions we'll focus upon the legal advice given to the Government during the crisis period.  At our first session we will hear from former Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher.  Paul Gallagher was Attorney General of Ireland during the period of 2007 to 2011.  Mr. Gallagher's appearance here today has been facilitated by a decision of the Government to waive legal privilege in respect of his oral evidence to this inquiry, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the important mandate of this committee to inquire into the financial crisis.  This of course cannot be interpreted as encroaching on the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, which cannot be waived by the Cabinet.  In addition, the waiver does not extend to discussion of legal advice that could prejudice any litigation pending or anticipated regarding matters the committee may seek to inquire into.  Mr. Gallagher, you're very welcome before the committee this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these are documents and that they are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Gallagher please.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#C00400"><p>Thank you.  Chairman and members of the committee, I am here to assist the committee in any way I can and to address any questions which the committee may have.  The committee will be aware that as Attorney General, under Article 30 of the Constitution, my role was to advise the Government in matters of law and legal opinion and it may be helpful to the committee to know that prior to my appearance here today, I have spent some considerable time in preparing for the appearance and I have also reviewed the core documents which the committee has furnished to me.  I don't intend reading my statement, which I prepared for the assistance of the committee unless of course the committee would like me to do so, it's admitted into evidence and the committee have it.  There are, however, a number of matters which I mention in the statement and which, with the committee's permission, I would like to mention before commencing my evidence.</p> <p>  I served as Attorney General between June 2007 and March 2011.</p><p>During two and a half of those years, Ireland experienced an unprecedented financial and economic crisis.  And one of the defining features of that crisis - and, of course, there were many - was that Ireland truly stood alone throughout that period.  It had the sympathy and goodwill of other countries but, ultimately, it had to rely on its own resources to find its own solutions to the crisis.  And I think that may be an obvious point but, I think, it is frequently overlooked and it is an important lesson of the crisis.  My abiding memory, at critical times during those years, is the sense of Ireland's isolation.  Much was expected of Ireland.  It was required to save its banks and it was required to use its own resources to do so.  Ireland had to make its own decisions and to do the best it could it the circumstances.  On the night of the decision to avail of the bailout - the Cabinet meeting of 20 November 2010 - it was very apparent that Ireland, again, was very much on its own.  Ireland's isolation was encapsulated in President Trichet's letter of 19 November and in Minister Lenihan's journey to Brussels on 21 November.</p><p> So far as the guarantee is concerned in the events of that night, I address that in my statement.  Subsequent to the night of the guarantee, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 - referred to as CIFS - which was initiated in the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 September, was enacted by 2 October and this legislation empowered the Minister to provide the guarantee.  The proposed guarantee scheme was notified to the European Commission in accordance with Ireland's state aid obligations under the EC treaty and the European Commission approved the guarantee, as being necessary to remedy a serious economic disturbance in Ireland, on 13 October 2008.  On 15 October 2008 the guarantee scheme was published by the Government and it was formally approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 October.  On 20 October it was introduced by way of statutory instrument and that set out the terms and conditions on which the participating institutions could benefit from the guarantee.  On 29 October the Minister, by statutory instrument, specified the banks covered by the guarantee scheme.  And the Act, and the statutory instruments made thereunder, provided the legal basis for the guarantee.  On 8 December 2009 the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme was introduced, having been approved by the Oireachtas.  This refined the instruments that were covered by the guarantee, it ... guarantee no longer covered asset-backed securities or dated subordinated debt.  The ELG scheme was extended in 2010, 2011, and 2012, until 20 December 2013.  It ended on 28 March 2013 for any new liabilities but, as I say, continued to cover liabilities until 30 December 2013.  Any new liabilities, as and from December 2009, were covered under this eligible guarantee scheme rather than the earlier CIF scheme - that continued in existence to continue the guarantee in respect of instruments that were issued prior to the coming into force of the eligible guarantee ... liabilities guarantee scheme.</p><p> As I comment in my statement, I believe it may be of interest to the committee to note the response of other countries and the European institutions to the crisis as I think it provides both a legal context and an understanding of some of the difficulties which arose.  I don't believe this has been addressed by any other witness in any detail - but I may be incorrect - but there were very significant developments, particularly at a European level, subsequent to October 2008, and the committee may consider those relevant to its inquiry, and, in particular, relevant to the issue which it has to consider as to the relevant structures and measures that might assist in avoiding a recurrence of a crisis of this nature.</p><p>In my statement to the committee I also touch on the fact that the European legal architecture, which was provided for in the Maastricht treaty and which set up the European Monetary Union, was significantly lacking in important respects.  Control of money matters and, in particular, money supply rested with the ECB.  However, the legal responsibility for each member state's financial system rested with that state.  Interest rates were set by the ECB having regard to the overall situation in Europe and not by reference to the individual situation of any member state.  The ECB, in discharging its function, was always very concerned and of course rightly concerned of its legal obligations and legal constraints and, in particular, to have a necessary legal base for its actions.  Each state, however, was at the time individually in control of, and responsible for, its banking system.  What is called supervision and resolution was the exclusive responsibility of member states and that position did not alter until 2013 when the ECB adopted a role provided for in Article 127 of the treaty, that is, the role of supervision of financial institutions.  Article 127 empowered the ECB to contribute to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the stability of the financial system and the delay in the introduction of this supervision and supervisory regime is partly explained by a concern on the part of many that combining monetary policy and supervision created unavoidable conflicts of interest.<br/><br/>It was not until 2014 that a single resolution mechanism and a single resolution fund was set up, and the delay there arose because of the concern of the lack of any explicit legal basis in the treaty for such a role.  In between, the European Banking Authority was set up towards the end of 2010 and it was designed to increase the transparency of the financial system and also to identify weaknesses in banks' capital structures.  And the European Systemic Risk Board was also set up in late 2010 and it had responsibility for the macro-surveillance of the financial sector in the EU.  Perhaps of particular interest to the committee is the fact that it was not until 2014 that the banking recovery and resolution directive was introduced at a European level.  The benefit of that directive is that it provided a sound legal footing for resolution actions which have very considerable and financial implications and which as a consequence can create uncertainties and systemic instability.  An EU-wide structure for banking resolution provides an <i>ex ante</i>structure for dealing with troubled banks.  This is important because it removes uncertainties and reduces the basis for legal challenge.  Markets recognise and expect that these actions will be taken and that limits the contagion effects of actions that might be taken.  And the introduction of that important measure, I think it's worth nothing, was six years after the commencement of the great recession.  The recitals to that directive explicitly state and recognise that the financial crisis had shown that there was a significant lack of adequate tools at Union level to deal effectively with unsound or failing credit institutions.  It says the financial crisis was of systemic dimensions in the sense that it affected areas ... or it affected access to funding of a large proportion of credit institutions.  So that provides a very brief overview of the system as it was in 2008 and subsequently, and I am happy to address any questions if the committee thinks that that may be of help in its deliberations.<br/><br/>Before speaking on other topics, I wonder if I could be permitted by the committee because I think it is both important and fair to refer to it.  And it's a matter I touch upon in my statement and that is the performance and commitment of the civil servants with whom I worked closely during the crisis.  I think it is important because they are part of the institutions of the State and I think it's fair because so many of them worked so hard to find solutions to the crisis.  In particular, I mentioned the people involved in the Department of Finance with whom I had much contact in relation to legal issues arising from the financial crisis and those people have given evidence, I think, before you, Chairman and members of the committee, and also the people in my own office, which includes the Chief State Solicitor's office.  And coming from the private sector I had the opportunity, I suppose, of a look at their performance from a different perspective.</p><p>And I think it is important to say, in a context that was so difficult and created so many difficulties for everybody, that their performance was of an extremely high standard; that I never met people who wouldn't make decisions, who were afraid of making decisions, who said, "This isn't my job" and I didn't meet people who weren't prepared to do their very best for Ireland.  And that was, for me, a remarkable feature and my abiding memory of my period in office.</p><p> As I understand the Government's waiver, Chairman and members of the committee, in relation to my evidence, it's been agreed, as you have said, that, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the very important mandate of the committee, that legal privilege should be waived, so far as my oral evidence goes, and that I am relieved from my professional duty to respect the confidentiality of the client which extends to confidential information entrusted to me by the client in the course of my ... in the discharge of my obligations and I'm also relieved from the obligation to protect legal privilege.  That is subject to one qualification that you have identified and that relates to the continuing obligation not to prejudice any existing or anticipated litigation.  Subject to that, my ... I just want to note that my written statement, as the committee will appreciate, respected the obligations of confidentiality and legal, professional privilege.  I'm now released from those obligations in that way.  I'm permitted to answer any question which the committee might like to pose to me and I will do so.  Thank you very much, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#F00300"><p>Good morning, Mr. Gallagher.  Mr. Gallagher, you refer there to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, enacted by the Oireachtas on 2 October 2008.  Can you recall when work commenced in the Attorney General's office on the legal provisions which eventually became enshrined in that and, just to put it in context for you, I refer to a scoping document dated 24 January 2008 within the Department of Finance?  The paper is called Financial Stability Issues - Scoping Paper, beginning to scope out the issues of crisis that are beginning to emerge and, under "Urgent Next Steps", it says, "Seek legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General as a matter of urgency on the legal issues highlighted in this paper."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#F00400"><p>Yes.  I think, in fairness to the Department, Deputy, they contacted my office on 30 November 2007 and raised a number of legal issues that are then referred to in this scoping document which I believe, but subject to correction, was January 2008.  I think the committee will also have seen what I might call ... not spreadsheets, but slides, where various issues were identified with regard to the challenges that existed and those slides, I'm not sure precisely what date they came into existence, but they noticed that there were legal challenges and legal issues but no legal impediments ultimately.  Between 30 November 2007 and 29 September 2008, the Department was in constant contact with my office, looking at possibilities, identifying different options.  I believe that it was on 16 June 2008 that there was a particular emphasis on producing the necessary legislation that would provide legal options that included, Deputy, in particular, nationalisation legislation and also the provision of a legislative basis for any guarantee that might have to be offered in respect of any institution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00100"><p>Okay.  And referring to those very slides, Mr. Gallagher, there were some from February '08 and then a further presentation - all this has been in evidence previously but we don't need to take the time to put it up.  I just want to ask you one thing in relation to that ... in this ... that the February slide said, &quot;open-ended [...] State guarantees [exposing] the Exchequer to the [...] the [...] significant [fiscal risk] are <i>not</i>regarded as part of the toolkit for successful crisis management and resolution&quot;.  But then, come February, there is added ... or sorry, come April, there is added, &quot;there are circumstances where such guarantees may be unavoidable to maintain confidence in the overall financial system.&quot;  That's the first time that this is mentioned in this way.  Can you throw any light on that development of thinking in the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00200"><p>Well, my information came from the briefing documents from the Department and originally, it is true to say, Deputy, that the focus was on individual institutions.  As 2008 progressed - and, particularly, I think, by April, 2008 - there was a concern with regard to systemic risks across the financial system. I think as and from that date but, more particularly, later and in August and September, there was a preparation for the possibility that a guarantee might have to extend beyond the individual institution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00300"><p>Okay.  And, Mr. Gallagher, can we fast forward then the night of the guarantee in September 2008?  And the evidence from the senior bank executives, who were in and out of meetings in Government Buildings, is that they brought a draft guarantee on the night.  And Mr. Gleeson's evidence is, to quote, "we furnished our draft guarantee [...] to the Government at [a] very early session."  And Mr. Cardiff, who was a senior executive in the Department of Finance, recalls working on a draft guarantee.  Can you throw any light on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00400"><p>My specific recollection, Deputy, and I want to be very careful in relation to this, is set out in my statement.  I can't be certain of every detail.  That, to the best of my recollection, is true in the sense that the instruments that might require to be covered by a guarantee were part of what the banks brought to the meeting.  So, an identification of the particular instruments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00500"><p>And, Mr. Gleeson, or Mr. Gallagher, sorry, Mr. Gleeson, to quote him again, he makes that point but then ... and he says, "This formula was eventually adopted later in the night pretty well word for word".  And what I want to put to you, Mr. Gallagher ... if it's extraordinary, or not, that you, perhaps, and the Government wouldn't be coming with written formulas in relation to what needed to be done rather than the banks coming in and presenting their agenda and that being then worked on by Government officials?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#G00600"><p>Well, Deputy, if I may answer that.  Firstly, I was asked to come to a meeting that evening late in the afternoon ... that the banks were coming in to meet with the Government.  Obviously, it was apparent something serious was going to occur but not what precisely occurred.  Secondly, the Department of Finance had given very careful consideration to the guarantee.  That had been carefully considered.  What Mr. Gleeson is referring to are the specific instruments, the technical description of what needed to be covered.  In relation to that, both the Department of Finance and the Governor had the specific expertise with regard to the type of instrument that need to be covered.  The banks had their view on what needed to be covered.  There was an interaction with the banks and their views were considered and taken into account.  But I want to make one thing very clear.  The interaction with the banks were that they were invited into the meeting, they were asked certain questions, they were given an opportunity to say certain things.  Very appropriately, in my view, they were then asked to leave.  And anything said by the banks was carefully and independently considered by what I might call "the Government team".</p><p>And any decision that was made with regard to what should be covered was made, as I set out in my statement, after very careful consideration as to what the Government thought was necessary to address what was described by Governor Hurley as the real possibility of a meltdown of the financial system. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#H00200"><p>And, Mr. Gallagher, do you remember having sight of that document or having the document in your hand that the banks said they brought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#H00300"><p>I don't precisely remember that.  I'm sure I did see it but I certainly remember drafts that were prepared by Mr. Cardiff.  And I think the Taoiseach drew the distinction between what's called the guarantee and the statement.  What was being prepared was a statement, which was identifying the instruments that would be covered and the Government's position, and there were various drafts of that, and I certainly looked at that.  And one of the things I was particularly concerned about, Deputy, was to ensure that that statement made clear to everybody when it was ... that this was going to be subject to terms and conditions, because that was a vital protection for the State that any guarantee of any instruments was to be subject to the terms and conditions, and those terms and conditions were, ultimately, set out in the scheme that was approved by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I think there was ... the Government was in the difficult position that the statement it issued the following day before the markets opened had to be very careful and very precise and it had to achieve the objective which was desired to be met, namely to protect the banks.  It, therefore, had to ... and you'll see it's a very measured statement, because it didn't want to create uncertainty; it didn't want to create a lack of confidence in the very banks that were being guaranteed.  And, yet, there was a concern not to say anything that might have market implications and that was a very fine line that had to be tread and I think that the ultimate statement that was issued actually achieved that very difficult objective.</p></speech>

You state in your opening statement that President Trichet of the European Central Bank "had evidently made it clear that the Government should stand behind its banks, and that the banks were the State's responsibility".  Do you remember being advised of the rationale given to you to accept the position of Mr. Trichet?</p></speech>

Under the treaties, the member states had the sole responsibility to protect their banks.  The ECB had no function and couldn't legally step in to protect the banks, but I think the significance of what President Trichet was saying was it was unambiguous - "You are on your own; you must save your banks", and that is the position.  I also make clear in my statement that the Taoiseach and, I believe, also Minister Lenihan questioned that and interrogated that and asked: "Is there any prospect of a European solution, a European measure?"  And they were explicitly told that while ECOFIN was meeting, I think, two days later, that there were no proposals before ECOFIN to address it.  Governor Hurley was also meeting with the governing body of the ECB in a few days and there were no proposals.</p><p>So one thing was clear: the ECB and Europe were not going to do anything to resolve the issues that faced the Government that night and the responsibility was solely on the Government to make the decision that it thought appropriate to address the crisis.</p></speech>

Can you throw a little light then on what happened subsequently?  We had evidence yesterday from Mr. Corrigan of the National ... formerly of the National Treasury Management Agency writing to the Minister for Finance in November 2010 at a later stage outlining &euro;20 billion and &euro;12 billion tranches of various kinds of debt which he felt that an aggressive approach should be taken to reducing that liability.  So did the Government decide of its own volition not to introduce burden sharing or was there pressure from the European institutions?</p></speech>

On the basis of the information which I saw, as of 30 September 2010 when the guarantee expired, very careful and serious consideration was given at that stage by the Government to, if I may use the phrase, "burning" the unguaranteed senior bonds.  And my recollection is, and I think evidence has been given to this effect, was the NTMA weighed up the consequences of doing that.  This, as you know, coincided with the decision in October 2008 of the NTMA to step back from the bond market and cease to attempt to raise further funding for the State.  The decision was taken that the benefits that might be achieved from burning those bondholders at that stage could well be outweighed, and would probably be outweighed, by the disadvantages in terms of the continued funding of the State.  There was also obviously a continuing concern about contagion effects as to what it would mean for funding of the banks but it was really the funding of the State.  That changed dramatically at the time of the bailout.</p></speech>

On the other hand then, Mr. Gallagher, you said it wasn't a legal or constitutional impediment.  You had these other considerations and pressure from Europe.  But what was your reflection on putting a &euro;64 billion burden of bad bank debts onto the shoulders of the Irish people, taxpayers and the consequences of austerity and so forth that flow from that?</p></speech>

My role as a legal adviser was not to make a policy decision in that regard.  But one thing just has to be understood, because I think it has become part of the narrative and I think it is fundamentally wrong.  And that is that decisions were made to save the banks.  Well in my interaction with Government, it wasn't about saving the banks, it was about saving the financial system.  And the calculation had to be made as to what would have been the consequences for the people if the financial system collapsed - that was the decision.</p> <p>  And when it came to the bailout, the Government was determined to burn the bondholders.  And, in fact, I wrote to Mr. Lenihan, Minister Lenihan, on 29 November when I was finalising what is called the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act and I said, "We can include in that Act a provision to burn the senior bondholders but I understand that the troika have forbidden that."  I said, "Nevertheless the position might change and we are dealing with the burning of the subordinated bondholders and one thing, if you would like I can include is I can emphasise in that Act the protection of the deposit holders."  Because the idea was to burn the bondholders and protect the deposit holders.  And in the recitals to that Act, or the preamble, we emphasised that, for Ireland, a core objective was to protect the deposit holders.  And that was to begin the creation of legal structures that if the position changed with the troika, we could then introduce specific legislation to burn the bondholders.</p> <p>  Now, it would be foolish and misleading to suggest that that wouldn't give rise to legal difficulties; it would.</p><p>We considered those very carefully and, indeed, post the bailout, I had various meetings to look at that.  I had meetings also with IMF representatives and specialist lawyers to consider that and we confirmed repeatedly that that could be done in legal terms, notwithstanding the legal difficulties, and it depended solely of the approval of the troika to doing that, and that as you know was prohibited and was a condition of the bailout.</p></speech>

Just before I bring in Deputy O'Donnell, just on a related matter with the timeframe being earlier, Mr. Gallagher, you state in your own opening statement that "President Trichet had evidently made it clear that the Government should stand behind its banks, and that the banks were the State's responsibility."  Can I ask you please to advise the rationale given to you to accept the position as, as said of Mr. Trichet?</p></speech>

The European Court rejected that but the one thing the ECB could not do is bail out the banks and the provisions of the treaty were interpreted, actually as preventing other member states doing so.  There was a change in perspective and further legal solutions were sought in 2010, precipitated by the Greek financial ... sovereign debt crisis.</p></speech>

So far as the consequences for the sovereign were concerned, that was a matter for the financial and economic experts in the NTMA to advise, the documents that I've seen recorded the realisation on the part of the Government that of course that had implications for the sovereign.  Because, if you had to provide moneys to save the financial system, those moneys had to be either borrowed or raised and that had consequences.</p></speech>

I think the significance of what President Trichet said, is that he was making it clear that while it was a matter for the Government to do that, the Government shouldn't let any bank fail.  I think that was the significance, that you shouldn't let a bank fail, the responsibility for saving is yours, that was something the Government already knew.  But the emphasis was, don't let a bank fail because if a bank fails, nobody can predict the consequences and the contagion effect.  I think that was the significance Chairman.</p></speech>

The other was could the Minister consult with the Central Bank to ensure that it provided it, if it wasn't going to provide it.  The other matter that was looked at from an early stage was the possibility of nationalisation of a failing institution.  The other matter that was referred to was a private sector solution.  And I think one thing that does need to be clarified is the Department of Finance and the Government were very concerned, if at all possible, to get a private sector solution which meant getting somebody else to take over a weakened solution from the private sector so that the taxpayer would not be at risk.  Those were critical issues that were looked at.  In that context they had to look at the competition issues because if you had to take over an institution suddenly, you had to ensure that you got competition approval.  That was being very carefully looked at.</p></speech>

But, Deputy, I make clear in my - and I think it's important to address this - I make clear in my statement burden-sharing was not a feature of the legal system of any of the European countries at that stage.  The United Kingdom brought in burden-sharing in 2009, Germany in 2010, Spain in 2012, France in 2013, and, most importantly of all, Europe in 2014.  Secondly, bailing in involves a failure of the bank, so you start bailing in because you say the bank is going to fail.  That, of course, creates huge issues of contagion and systemic risk; it's not a thing that is lightly done, and, even now, it is an issue that creates difficulties.</p></speech>

And I did so ... my letter is dated 1 October but I believe I dictated it on 29 October because I note in my letter that I said the opening ... sorry, that it was on 30 October, because I refer to "yesterday" being the 29th so I believe I did that on the 30th.  The purpose of that was to provide legal advice to the Government on the state aid.  My concern was to marshal all of the facts that needed to be provided to the Commission to get state aid, which was a very serious legal concern.  And those facts involved the basis for the decision - what were the concerns the Government had to address, why this was necessary ... because remember, to get state aid approval, and none of this could have been brought into law, you had to satisfy the Commission that the decision and the measure was necessary.  And that's ... so I have a very clear recollection of the evidence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02200"><p>Yes.  So, this was the position.  The position changed, I don't know what was brought to the meeting.  I arrived at the meeting late, as I made clear.  Before I arrived, there was a discussion of the worsening situation.  I wasn't there for that but I quickly picked up on what was said because much of it was repeated and I have recorded in my statement what was repeated and what was said.  And I think it's very clear from my statement, the position had now changed.  It was quite clear to everybody that a guarantee of deposits was not going to avert the risk of what was likely to happen the following day.  The best advice available to the Government was that the guarantee that was offered was the minimum that could be done and what was said is "We're not sure this will actually save the financial system.  So, if you don't get it right and you put something more limited, then you're facing into a situation where the collapse has started and it may be too late to do anything".  Secondly, Deputy, the guarantee was extended subsequently after review in 2009 and it always covered senior bonds and the reason was, this was a liquidity crisis and the purpose was, not just to protect the depositors that you might do when the banks are about to collapse to make sure the depositors, it was to get liquidity into the banks to keep the banks going.  Because the view that was taken was that if Ireland, with a sophisticated and developed economy, didn't have a financial system, that the economic position would be worse.  And there's a remark in my statement that was seared in my memory and that is Governor Hurley said, and I remember this, "If this is not done, Ireland's economy will go back 25 years."  And he said that because it was clear to anybody there, that what was being said was if you have a collapse in the financial system, how do you ever pick that up?  You don't pick it up again and the whole trading and commerce of the country fails.  And I want to be very fair to Governor Hurley because everybody says Governor Hurley advised and he did advise.  Firstly, he was there and he was prepared to make a decision and he was prepared to give advice.  He had come back from being sick and that's a matter of record, I don't want to talk about his personal circumstances, but he was there and he was unstinting and fearless and clear.  And he gave very clear and unambiguous advice to the Government and the Government was told the economy will go back 25 years, this is the best you can do.  I don't think any government or any politician ever wanted to have to be faced with a decision like that or have to make it and politicians don't necessarily have the skills to, I think, well, don't have necessarily the economic skills and financial skills.  So that's how it came from a deposit to that, Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02400"><p>Just on the night of the guarantee, it's reported that the Minister for Finance, then the late Brian Lenihan, and Kevin Cardiff were in favour of nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Was that the case and was there any legal impediment to the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide on the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N02500"><p>There was no legal impediment and, I think, as the committee have heard, we had the legislation ready to go.  That was the case and I think what was interesting and what was important is that the decision arrived at was made after considering the various options and everybody was listened to.  I wasn't privy, as I make clear in my statement, to discussions that took place between the Taoiseach and Minister Lenihan privately.  I remained in the Taoiseach's, I think, conference room or consultation room throughout.  I went out for various bits and pieces but I never got involved in any of the political discussions.  So, I can't enlighten the committee any more in relation to that.  But Minister Lenihan never said to me that he was overruled and a decision was made after considering all of the options.  Nationalisation was one of them and I think I outlined in my statement why it was considered that was not the route to go.  Sorry, Chairman, thank you.</p></speech>

Just two matters before I move on to the other questioners.  In earlier engagement with Deputy O'Donnell, you spoke about notes on the meeting of the night of the guarantee.  If possible and if legally permissible, can you provide the inquiry with any contemporary notes of this meeting, which you did not record as legal advice sought or given to you?</p></speech>

Just one other item as well, Mr. Gallagher, earlier this morning when we were discussing matters with you, you stated that in June, the draft legislation - this is the nationalisation legislation - was redirected to cover more than one ailing bank.</p></speech>

This would seem to coincide with the NTMA's refusal to put deposits into Irish banks and can I ask you to comment, was this cognisant of that fact or was that just a coincidence and what was your contact over this period directly or indirectly with the NTMA?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#N03500"><p>Okay.  Firstly, what happened on 16 June was they said go ahead and draft.  It was still focused on a particular bank because that's what you would do with nationalisation legislation.  Secondly, I would have had no direct contact at any stage with the NTMA, their contact was with Finance, we get our instructions from Finance.  Thirdly, the issue in relation to putting deposits in banks, I think, was somewhat earlier, if I recollect what Dr. Somers said.  I think it was in late December 2007 and I think that then continued to that period, so far as I'm aware and certainly wasn't aware at the time there was any connection between the two, Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Gallagher, the memorandum from Merrill Lynch dated Sunday, 28 September - was your office requested or asked to assess the options that were outlined in that in terms of legal impediments or was it a piece of paper that just appeared along with other ones?</p></speech>

My office had already advised, which is the way it's done, that the various options are put forward to see if there is a legal impediment and we had advised there wasn't a legal impediment.  So that wasn't furnished to me to advise in relation to that.</p></speech>

It wouldn't have been my concern as to which bank was asking for it and I wasn't involved.  We said there is no legal impediment to the Central Bank providing ELA.  Of course, in providing ELA, as you know, it is subject to the statute of the ECB.  There are ... I think it's Article 14 ... imposes limitations under the circumstances which ELA ... but in principle, so far as the Irish legislation was concerned, this ... it would permit the Central Bank to provide ELA.</p></speech>

But of course, banks are different because ... that's why you have emergency liquidity.  There are times when banks need liquidity to meet their obligations.  Their assets at a balance sheet level make them solvent but that's why you have emergency liquidity for the very purpose and that is given to solvent banks.</p></speech>

We are not concerned with the policy as to whether it's good or bad.  But it says, ''Here are the issues, can we do this legally?''

That was raised at a very early stage, whether if a guarantee had to be given, it could be done under the State Guarantees Act 1954.  The advice was unambiguous, it could not be done, so that enabled specific guarantees in respect of scheduled bodies and in any event, this was of a different nature than what was envisaged by the Act and it was made clear that would require a separate and independent legal basis.  The Department accepted that, knew that and we had that ready to go on the night of the guarantee.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Gallagher and you made the point very strongly about Europe leaving Ireland on its own and so on and, indeed, a currency that had been circulated since 1999, only in 2013 was Article 127 of the treaty implemented.  Did that propose particular legal challenges for Ireland in ... it was a dangerous area, certainly and that ... did we discard the policies and mechanisms and laws that had ensured there were no bank failures from 1783, Grattan's Parliament and Bank of Ireland, right up to 1999, when this new currency started?</p></speech>

So your options for resolving a crisis and a systemic crisis in particular are greatly reduced.  That was a big deficit in the legal architecture.  My understanding of the architecture was it was designed to address situations where Government deficits and Government profligacy in managing the economy would result in threats to the financial system and that was catered for under the excessive deficit procedure.  But they hadn't addressed this and this is, as is now very apparent, was a very significant restriction in the legal architecture.</p></speech>

The countries were very ... and you have seen one of the reasons it took 'til 2013 for the single supervisory mechanism was that countries were reluctant to pass over the supervision of their financial system to an EU body, the ECB.  And secondly, with regard to the resolution, there was very serious political concern.  So I think it was known but I'm not sure there was the willingness to address it and I think that there may have been a failure of imagination because I don't believe that people really envisaged the sort of situation that did in fact arise here and throughout Europe and the United States in September 2008.</p></speech>

And I think those are very interesting.  I think you have already heard that Prime Minister Brown was on and he was very annoyed, I think because they said this ... they were all worried about its effectiveness, in other words, that it would be so effective it would take deposits from their banks into Ireland.  And this was said at a time when the UK, unknown to us at the time, put in I think something like &pound;30 billion into RBS and was putting a huge amount of money into HBOS.  So every country was taking steps and that wasn't announced at the time.  So while they were complaining about Ireland taking steps to protect its financial system, they were busily off doing it and it wasn't announced.  So there was a concern in relation to that.</p><p>The EU Commissioner, Ms Kroes, was concerned about its competition effects, and that for me was a real concern of ensuring that we could convince the Commission that this was consistent with the state aid provisions and wasn't anti-competitive. And fortunately we were able to do that within a very short period of time, by 13 October.  So while other countries were giving out ... you'll remember that the G7 meeting, I think, took place in early October and following that there was an announcement that all countries were going to stand behind their banks.  Chancellor Merkel announced it.  They announced it in France and they announced it in Denmark. </p></speech>

It was introduced in the Oireachtas on 30 October.  We just went ahead and finalised that.  One of the things that we were very concerned about was to ensure that it was watertight and in particular that it terminated as of the end of September 2010 and didn't extend beyond what was intended at that time.  And that was prepared and went ahead, and we also went ahead with our submission to the European authorities.</p></speech>

After all, if they're presenting the State with this huge burden, could the State not take it on on its terms?  And I'd be concerned about how much the cost escalated from what we thought at the beginning to the eventual.</p></speech>

I suppose there's two things to bear in mind.  Firstly, the guarantee did provide very significant conditions with regard to the commercial activities of the bank and for the public interest directors.  And of course that ensured that other banks didn't regard - that didn't need help - didn't regard the guarantees as desirable.  You heard evidence that various other banks were looking to be included in it, but the conditions were tough and they were stringent, which made it non-attractive.</p> <p>  Secondly, the issue as presented was that before the markets opened you had to have a solution.  Thirdly, people talk about the &euro;64 billion hole but, as the committee has heard, that no matter what investigation had been done by the banks, wouldn't have been apparent on 30 September.  The extent of the losses increased over time, as I think some of the witnesses have said, because you not only had the liquidity issue but you had the great recession which continued far longer.  The market disappeared.  You then had the valuations in NAMA.  And you had a series of attempts to get to the bottom of the hole but the hole was deepening the whole time.  I think Mr. Corrigan graphically described it as a "falling knife".  So at a point in time that wasn't the deficit.</p></speech>

Were there never any documents or would they have been removed between the guarantee and the time that NAMA took them over?</p></speech>

But, I mean, I think as NAMA said, one of the problems was a lot of the security documents were just never there.  They weren't in place, they hadn't been properly signed off and that, of course, had a big impact on the value of the assets NAMA was purchasing.  And that is part of the explanation for the larger haircut than was anticipated.</p></speech>

I ... the Minister asked me one evening to come to a meeting with Ulster Bank, who were trying to be included, but they weren't.  And one of the decisions the Government took, and it's provided for of course in the legislation, that if a bank had the basis of support from its parent, as Ulster Bank had, there was no way the Irish State was going to provide the guarantee.</p></speech>

You go back then on 20 October, the guarantee scheme was introduced by way of statutory instrument and three days before that the guarantee scheme was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and prior to that the legislation that allowed for a scheme to be introduced was approved, about two weeks before that.  So can you tell me, when the banks signed up to the scheme, the deed, the deeds, which was the 24th, which was in between the scheme being introduced by way of statutory instrument and the Government specifying the banks, was the assets of the banks and liabilities of the banks guaranteed at that stage?</p></speech>

The Act provided that provided that financial support could be provided individually or through a scheme.   The Government opted for a scheme.  That was approved.  And to avail of the scheme you had to become a participating institution.  And to be a participating institution you had to be designated.  So that's when the legal effect of the scheme-----</p></speech>

So just to clarify that now, the ... we understand that the institutions signed the deed of acceptance on the 24th and returned it to the Department as such.  Would that have been when they were legally covered by the guarantee?  I know it took a ... it was backdated but that's the day that they were legally bound.

So what possibly could happen in terms of law if the Minister decided in that four weeks that, "Look, I think this is a bad idea, there may be more loan losses", or whatever, and decided we're not proceeding with that?  Would the banks have a call, given that the Government made a commitment, a political commitment to introduce this?</p></speech>

I suppose what you would have is you'd have people who lent money perhaps making claims against the Government on the basis they did so on foot of representations.  But, more particularly, I think the issue always was what would be the effect on the financial system.  And for a Government to renege on what was clearly a statement intended to quieten the markets would have had very serious consequences and presumably, though it's not a matter for me to say, the very consequences that were sought to be avoided on the night of the guarantee.</p></speech>

How confident are you, given the earlier testimony, that we could have ... the State could have, under law, protected depositors while at the same time burning senior bondholders?</p></speech>

And the reason was that it wasn't a legal issue about burning, because of course they didn't want to burn the senior creditors, they wanted the senior creditors to provide liquidity to the banking system.  So that wasn't an issue at all.</p><p>What was made clear, consistently, is that if you wanted to differentiate between and senior creditors and the depositors, you would have to change the law.  That was not without complication, but I believed it could have been done.  Interestingly, when the Europeans brought in what is now the legal obligation, in the 2004 directive, they don't distinguish between the depositors and senior creditors, as such.  The eligible deposits are protected, but depositors and senior creditors, as such, are not differentiated against, and the critical limitation on burning there was that nobody should be worse off than they would be in a liquidation situation.</p></speech>

Can I ask you, in relation to the night of the guarantee and your attendance at that meeting, you talk about, in your statement, in relation to, on page 8, "There was a basis for the concern that the fact that the six Irish domestic banks were perceived by the market as having a very significant and, in some cases, enormous property exposure and consequently were perceived to carry a very high bad debt risk."

There was, of course, the realisation that if you give a guarantee, you have an exposure.  But the belief was that these banks were solvent.  It was hoped that this would solve the liquidity situation, and it was hoped that there wouldn't be a call on the guarantee.  But, of course, that risk couldn't be excluded.</p></speech>

And, therefore, the focus was very much on ensuring that we got state aid approval, because this was absolutely vital.  But it wasn't a legal issue, as such, that would have arisen if it hadn't been approved, but a very serious policy issue would have arisen at that stage.</p></speech>

And, if the financial system of a developed economy like Ireland, so dependent on financial transactions and investment, collapsed, then you are back to the 1980s.  That was how I understood it, and, I assume everybody else understood it in that way, but I remember it because it was such a bleak and unforgiving picture.</p></speech>

That's what it conveyed to me, and in my mind, whether accurately or not, I had the picture of the 1980s and a different Ireland because, without a financial system ... and also, I think ... I don't think it was explicitly said, but I think everybody had a very serious image in their mind of social cohesion.  If the financial system were to break down, was society going to survive this?  And, I don't think anybody stated that; I don't think it needed to be stated.  You had very experienced people there.  That's, I think, the image that people had.</p></speech>

Otherwise, if any one of those defaulted, the group couldn't let a subsidiary default because that would ultimately ... might well result in a default for the group, but, certainly, would pose an enormous risk for the group.  So, I think that followed.</p></speech>

And, therefore, if they are effectively supporting banks that should have been supported by the State, that is equivalent to monetary financing.  That was a very big issue in relation to Anglo and the whole resolution of the promissory note issue, and the very beneficial deal that was, ultimately, achieved by this Government in relation to the promissory notes and the replacement with the government bonds.  So, legally, he was absolutely correct.</p></speech>

I suppose it's the huge question ... it's a matter for Government, but, I suspect most governments would say, "We don't actually gamble with our country's fortunes", and it would have been an extraordinary step, I would have thought, but that's for others to judge, it's not a legal matter, to say, "We'll call your bluff".  And, the difficulty - and I do mention this ... I mentioned it today - the ECB was concerned, and very understandably and rightly concerned, of the legal constraints.  And, if it took a legal view it couldn't do it, and we see an example in relation to Greece at the moment, whether they could continue ELA no matter what the consequences.  So, I think the Government decided that's a bluff, if it is a bluff, that we won't call.  But, that's what was at stake.</p></speech>

I mean, if ELA was withdrawn, all of the banks were gone so you were back to the same situation.  So it's a very big bet and my experience of dealing with the institutions - and I dealt with them in the Lisbon treaty and the guarantees - they take a very legalistic view and the other countries ... and this is why I said you have countries sympathetic to Ireland saying Ireland is a great country and you've done very well, but every one of them will, ultimately, look after their own interests and they are not people that can be easily beaten down in negotiations.  Every country is looking after its own interest.  There is the Community spirit and the Union spirit and that will be adhered to.  And I think that's all very positive but, at the end of the day, in critical matters, they will look after their own interests and that is certainly the position with the ESB because I had a subsequent involvement for another client in relation to dealing with ECB - and I do not want to say anything for client confidentiality - and my experience of the ECB is they took the legal situation enormously seriously, as they were bound to do, no matter what the consequences.</p></speech>

Why was a different timeframe not put on it?</p></speech>

That was teased out very, very carefully.  There was considerable concern in giving a guarantee for two years and six months was mooted, a year was mooted.  And, as I explain in my statement, a judgment call was made because they were told and the banks were also ... about this said, "We have to reassure the money markets and we're not sure a shorter guarantee will do."  In the event, it transpired, even when the position was known with much better clarity regarding the losses in the banks, this guarantee was, ultimately, extended to December 2013, albeit with a narrower focus with regard to the instruments to be covered.</p></speech>

I'm not sure I would agree with that, Chairman, in the sense that that seems to me ... whenever you stop the guarantee, if you just leave it there, you will have a funding cliff, unless everything has righted itself.  Everything hadn't righted itself but, as of middle of 2009, as you know, legislation was brought in to enable the period to be extended.  As of December 2009, you had the ELG; 2010 they extended the period; 2011; 2013.  So the fact that the funding would stop as of September 2010 was anticipated far in advance and measures were put in place to ensure a continuation of funding.  And, in fact, the CIFS scheme itself, as you heard, was extended I think until December, and the application for that was made in good time, so measures were taken to avoid the funding cliff.</p></speech>

If Anglo was just left to go bust on the night and was kept outside of the guarantee, what would the legal considerations have been?  Would this have been very, very complex, very, very messy or would it have been, "Here's a legislation; let's make it happen"?</p></speech>

And one of the things that was apparent from the information given to the Government by the other banks was the other banks were distinguishing between Anglo and INBS and themselves and understandably so.  But the report that they gave us of the reactions from the money markets was Ireland was untouchable.  And if you have one bank go, given what was known as the overexposure to property, the ready consequence I assume - and others are better positioned to advise on this - was they'd say, "These other banks have huge exposure to property.  There may be distinctions but we're not convinced and the whole lot goes."  And that was the calculation made with regard to Lehman Brothers and it went so badly wrong and I think there was a huge fear that if that gamble is taken, that things would just be out of control.  And those are the judgments that have to be made and were made.</p></speech>

Can I just clarify one thing?  The ... it's often stated that the guarantee was a &euro;440 billion guarantee.  The Nyberg report, on page 77, gives a breakdown of the guarantee.  The guarantee was &euro;375 billion.  Is that your understanding as well?</p></speech>

There was a very careful consideration as to whether that was appropriate.  There would have been a desire not to include it, if that were possible.  And in the end a judgment was made if we omit that, is that going to impair the effectiveness of the guarantee?  There's also, I've seen subsequently but I didn't see it, the e-mail which the committee has seen from Mr. McDonagh, I think on 6 October, explaining why it was important to have that included.  But I don't remember that particular consideration being raised that night.  My recollection is it went more to the effectiveness of the guarantee and people understanding what was included, and also this was a method of providing funding for the banks.  That's my understanding.</p></speech>

The issue of the promissory notes for Anglo Irish Bank.  To what extent was the sovereign fully standing behind those promissory notes?  Would they have had the same legal standing as sovereign bonds, for example?  Can you just give us a legal perspective on the status of those promissory notes?</p></speech>

The State was the obligor under the promissory notes and, therefore, they were the equivalent, in my view, as bonds.  I think the reason why they were chosen was - and I think the committee have heard this - it enabled capital to be put in, on a staged basis, to the banks.  It provided the banks with the necessary injection of capital but the cost would be met on a staged basis and that was what was behind it.</p></speech>

If, on the night of the guarantee, there was knowledge that ... that a bank had essentially failed and the decision was made to just let it go, in the absence of specific legislation, a bank would just then have been liquidated under the Companies Acts in the normal way.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has to be informed in advance of an application.</p></speech>

So just going back to that issue of special resolution legislation and, as you said, there are different types of resolutions and some resolution-type options were available on the night of the guarantee.  But the scenario I want to raise is if ... if a decision had been reached that a bank had essentially failed and instead of having a disorderly wind-up of a bank ... just collapsing the following day, that the decision was to have an orderly wind-down of that bank, what legislation would have been used in that scenario - that if you wanted to, let's say, let Anglo go, but in an orderly way and in a way in which we will seek to separate the depositors from the senior bondholders, to give preference to depositors and bail in other creditors such as senior bondholders?</p></speech>

The law at that stage was they ranked equally but I don't think that was even impinging on people's consideration because the view was taken - and governor Trichet had said "Save the banks" - and the view was taken that any wind-down, orderly or otherwise, would have a contagion effect that might not be capable of being controlled.</p></speech>

But that was never put as a proposal and they were never told that there was a legal impediment to doing so and, as I say, even as of today there are legal issues surrounding that.  I believe, ultimately, those legal issues can be overcome but, in fact, the 2014 directive explicitly refers to the legal issues and refers ... because the charter, the European Charter and the European Convention of Human Rights create similar problems to our Constitution.  So the constitutional issues, if I can put it that way, are recognised at a European level.</p></speech>

And the effect of that, if I can just clarify, because, I think, Mr. Corrigan said correctly that, in fact, most of them were bailed in through liquidity management exercises, but it was the fact that the legislation was there which enabled the State to bail them in, that encouraged them to accept voluntarily, as part of the liquidity management exercise, a very substantial writing down of their entitlements.  There was only one case where the Act had to be used.  That was in the case of AIB.  There was a legal challenge.  That was compromised -I don't want to say the detail of it - but on a very satisfactory basis for the State.  So it was the existence of the powers and the tools that were critical.</p></speech>

And, very finally, you said that the ECB had the power and the right to withdraw ELA support for the Irish banks.  But when you saw the letter of 19 November 2010 to Minister Lenihan, when the ECB linked the continuation of ELA to the introduction of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, financial sector restructuring, did you have any concern that in making that link between ELA and issues that would be perhaps outside the mandate of the ECB, that it had extended its reach too far?</p></speech>

I don't believe so for this reason: as you know, when the ECB subsequently introduced the outright monetary transactions, in ... I think it was 2013, which had a great effect on stabilising the markets, what saved them from legal challenge - and the European Court has pronounced on it recently - is the conditionality that is involved.  So, in other words, the ECB said "We will continue to lend to you but you must put your house in order and you must agree to fiscal conditions to set the legal basis, otherwise it'll be monetary financing".  And that has been the consistent position of the ECB and ... from day 1-----</p></speech>

Good morning still, Mr. Gallagher.  I've a few brief questions.  Most of what I wish to ask has been asked already.  In response to Senator Barrett earlier you said that because Ireland didn't have huge resources, it needed to give a legal guarantee to make it credible.  Do you accept the view that some people would hold that, ultimately, perhaps because of the nature of the guarantee, that the markets passed a judgment on it that it ultimately was incredible?</p></speech>

I think it lost its credibility over a period of time.  I think it did and I think - this has already been identified by other witnesses - as problems emerged in the banks and as it was clear that it was difficult to get to the bottom of what the deficit was ... so while there's uncertainty as to what the deficit is, there is uncertainty in the markets and they became very concerned about the contingent liability of the State on foot of the guarantee.  But the point I wanted to make was, it seems to me ... and, again, it's the financial experts whose views on this matter but if you are Germany, you have enormous resources, you can pout &euro;50 billion into the banks.  And I think it announced - Germany - a &euro;500 billion package for its banks very shortly afterwards.  The UK did the same in terms of its support of its banks and it was in a different position, it was outside the euro.  Ireland wasn't in that position.</p></speech>

I can't ask, perhaps, a leading question ... but ... of the guarantee, that the nature of it was such ... and the failure on the night to have full information as to the possible exposures in most of the institutions, or certainly a couple of them, meant that the liability opened on the sovereign was such that the markets deemed that it was incredible?  Did you ... what I really want to ask is, did you offer, on the night, a view as to an investigation that should be carried out immediately into the exposure that possibly the sovereign was being opened up to by the nature of the terms of the guarantee, as agreed?</p></speech>

So that was well known.  Secondly, the Government was in the position ... it had to make a decision on the basis of the information that was available and the advice was "You can't postpone this decision."  And, as I say, the Taoiseach repeatedly asked "Is it possible to defer this - not to make a decision?", and was told "No."  But it's not just the guarantee.  Anything that I've read subsequently ... and, indeed, the whole structures that have now been introduced for bank resolution are to deal with the fact that even those countries that didn't give a guarantee, because they ultimately had to save their banks and put the money in, the whole banking crisis is regarded as a strain on the sovereign.</p><p>So, even if you haven't given a guarantee, if you have a banking crisis, the markets know you must solve that because I may be wrong in this and the committee will know better but I'm not aware of any country that allowed, in this period, a systemic bank to fail and, therefore, so far as the markets are concerned, you're behind your banks.  If your banks are in trouble - that's what happened in Spain - that impinges on the sovereign and then the cost of borrowing goes up.  So unfortunately, you're presented with a difficulty that the banks are in a mess.  It has to be addressed and ultimately the cost to the sovereign is unavoidable.</p></speech>

They have given ... several members of the NTMA have given evidence to the inquiry that they had serious concerns and wouldn't have gone down the route of the guarantee which was ultimately chosen.  Did you inform the meeting that perhaps that evidence should be directly given rather than through a third party?</p></speech>

Governor Hurley understood it, the Taoiseach was a very experienced Minister, Minister for Finance, he could not but have known it.  I think it was obvious to everybody that that was a risk and I think the judgment was made, whether right or wrong, that this is the best ... I think somebody has said the least worst option.</p></speech>

Briefly, I want to turn to a book that was published by former Green Party Member of the Oireachtas, Dan Boyle, where he issued ... levelled a number of criticisms at ... indirectly, I suppose, and perhaps directly at yourself in your role in the Government which you were Attorney General.  The book was called <i>Without Power or Glory: The Greens in Government (2007-2011)</i>.  One of the quotes I want to put to you-----</p></speech>

Were you aware at the time that you were viewed by a component part of the Government as an obstacle?</p></speech>

When I was alerted by a member of the press that Mr. Boyle was going to say this, I contacted Mr. ... Minister ... Mr. Ryan, as he was then, to say that I was very surprised by that and he assured me it was not so.  In the publication in <i>The Irish Times</i>commenting on the book, it specifically said that senior Green Party sources said this was not the case.  I take the greatest of exception to that, because I prided, above all, my independence.  I had no political connection and have no political connection.  I've never been a member of the party and I didn't know what constituency any member of the Government was from.  So I took the gravest exception and I gave, I believe equally, but I'm happy to be judged by Minister Gormley when he came in, whatever assistance I could to every party to try and assist them with the legal solution to problems that arose.</p></speech>

I won't go any more into that particular publication.  Paragraph 58 was referred to by Deputy Higgins earlier, of your opening statement, where you said that there was no "constitutional impediment to introducing [further] legislative measures to provide for further burden-sharing".  Was your opinion ever sought on the introduction of legislation to impose burden-sharing on senior bondholders and if so, when was it first sought and by whom?</p></speech>

It came to the fore again, as I said, at the time of the bailout and on 29 November 2010 I confirmed in writing it could be done.  It wasn't done in the meantime, I think, because of the NTMA view.  I had meetings with IMF people and I think that I should make clear to the committee my understanding of the IMF, and certainly the people I met, they were very much in favour of it and thought it was appropriate.  That is, the people at the lower lever, there were obviously people, different people, but they were very supportive and took the view Ireland needed to do this because of the debt burden.  I had meetings again in February before I left office and we went through what could be done.  Doing that, of course, is a very specialist exercise and we had our own ideas but we also had the benefit of a specialist lawyer, whose name I cannot remember, that the IMF very helpfully sent over to meet me, who had done a lot of debt restructuring and his services were available to us as to how that might best be done so as to avoid legal challenge.</p></speech>

So the NTMA, certainly, and their reputation is such that they would have had a very great understanding of that.  Whether anybody else had a better understanding, I don't know.  People in Finance who would have been interacting with them and who would have been involved in this would have had a good knowledge, as would of course Governor Hurley, because one of the functions of the ECB was financial stability so they would all have an understanding of these matters.</p></speech>

It wouldn't surprise me and it was a prudent thing.  If an issue arose on which assistance was required that hadn't already been addressed, then they were readily available to Government.  That frequently arises, people are asked to be available so if some unexpected issue arises.  So far as the issue of their opposition to our preference for nationalisation was concerned, and concern about the sovereign rating, that, I believe, was well known and is recorded in the Merrill Lynch report.  So I assume, but this is only an assumption because I didn't know they were out there, that people believed they had the information, understood that, that was clearly inputted into the decision that was made, taken account of, and as I said, had to be balanced and a judgment made.</p></speech>

Thank you.  The markets had come to a position in relation to the liquidity in relation to Irish banks.  The Morgan Kelly theory is that it wasn't anything to do with the US sub-prime, or the freezing of the liquidity markets, that it was a matter that the markets had decided that the exposure to property, in particular commercial real estate, that the Irish balance sheets of financial institutions were compromised.</p></speech>

What is a documented fact in anything that I've read is that the money markets froze after Lehman.  Nobody was prepared to invest.  So you look at Ireland and you say "There is a problem there, they are overexposed to property."  So you're not going to invest anywhere and you're certainly not going to invest in Ireland so I don't think they're incompatible.</p></speech>

The deposit guarantee scheme went from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000, a fivefold increase.  Was there over-exuberance in terms of the attempts to deal with matters?  Very few deposit guarantee schemes were increased by fivefold internationally.  And then, just to follow on from that is, was there an over-exuberance in relation to banking, in relation to guaranteeing everything: bonds, deposits, etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#V02600"><p>Firstly, I don't remember being involved because obviously it was a policy decision in raising the guarantee.  But I do know that one of the concerns following Northern Rock was that the existing scheme went to &euro;20,000 and 90% of your deposit, and I think it may be in some of the documents.  When depositors see that they're going to get 90% not 100%, well somebody says it's rational to queue outside banks.  So you don't want to lose your 10%, so you queue.  So one of the things was the guarantee was increased from 90% to 100% of the limit.  The other view that was taken and in fact, if anything, it seems to me to show foresight, because as of 2009 the EU brought in a directive, and I mentioned this, increasing the cover to &euro;100,000 throughout Europe.  Admittedly, that wasn't to take effect for a while because it's the form of directives that they don't take effect for a while, 2010.  The view was taken that, because there had been some queues outside banks, I think it's been mentioned there was a media issue and queues had been forming and I think there was a real concern.  Even Dr. Somers said the one thing you don't want to see is a queue outside the bank, so you try and stop that.</p><p>I certainly, going on to the night of the guarantee, didn't witness exuberance of any sort over ... or any type whatsoever.  They were people, so far as I could see looking on, that were being faced with a decision that nobody wanted to be there to have to make and the options were explored, very careful consideration was given to those options, and so far as I could see, a judgment was made on what is the least worst option, on the basis of a fear of what might happen the following day.  They may have been right or wrong, but that was what they face.  And, in a sense, we'll never know, because nothing happened the following day, but if the guarantee hadn't been given, who can predict what was said, and what I say in my notice, we were told that New York Stock Exchange was expecting the markets in Dublin wouldn't open.  Now, if there's a run on the shares of the banks, that effects the shareholders, but as soon as anybody sees that run, it's all over the media and nobody is going to do anything other than queue outside a bank and try and pull their money out because if the shares are tanking, then the bank is about to collapse.  So that's what was at issue, but there was certainly no sign of exuberance that I saw; far from it.  I think what was impressive was people remained calm in what was a crisis situation and worked through the options.</p></speech>

I think there were two issues there.  Some people said, "You shouldn't have guaranteed existing indebtedness", and a view can be taken in relation to that, but I'm not sure where that gets you because even if you don't guarantee it, when that indebtedness - and these were all short term, as I understand it, in any event - so if you didn't guarantee the existing indebtedness and next Friday, the debt accrued and became due and had to be paid, well then the bank had to pay it.  And if it didn't, that was the problem.  And can I just say as well, I'm not clear, but I would defer to experts, that any other country had to deal with a challenge to its entire domestic financial system.</p></speech>

A view had to be taken as to whether that level of differentiation was being made by the markets, and, as I say, from what they told us, that wasn't the case.  That's a judgment call.</p></speech>

I would be surprised if the ECB were purporting to advise us on what was or was not constitutional.  It was quite clear to me from any interaction I had with Minister Lenihan that the objection was not a legal objection, that the objection was that they were afraid of the contagion of the markets.

What was the concern?</p></speech>

That was a matter for the politicians as to whether they said they were in negotiations or not.  But I know there was a concern to protect whatever leverage there was.  It was felt that if we said, "We're in negotiations", then you're just there for the taking, you can't negotiate anymore, you've said you're going in and they set the conditions.  And Minister Lenihan told me that there was very considerable pressure for Ireland to forego its tax rate, and the view was taken that, not only was this wrong but the economic revival that the package or the bailout was meant to encourage would itself be undermined, if Ireland had to forego it's autonomy over that.  That was a very real issue, as I understood it.</p></speech>

They couldn't affect it but people saw this as an opportunity, "You want a bailout, you need a bailout, and we're going to impose this as a condition."

I think some of the major countries that have been giving out, if I could say about that, for a long time.  And if you go back to the record, I think quite a number of countries, including, I believe, Germany ... but I don't want to say because I can't remember now which countries, and I don't want to create any storm that anybody had any particular animus.  But, certainly, people that were competing with us saw this as something very important, and as a <i>quid pro quo</i>for giving us the bailout.</p></speech>

My understanding was the view was taken by Minister Lenihan and the Taoiseach that if you say, "Yes, we're now entering negotiations for a bailout.", whatever little leverage - and you've very little leverage in that situation - was gone.

So when it comes to then ... January-February 2011, and the agreement that was already in place for the capital injections in the banks, is it a straightforward thing for the Minister to say, "I'm going to wait until the new Government comes in", or did that have to be renegotiated under the MOU?</p></speech>

You could talk to them and, indeed, changes were subsequently made.  I think the important thing was: you communicated with them, you maintained their trust and support which was vital.  And I distinctly remember Minister Lenihan communicating that to the troika, and he did so on the basis that he felt, democratically, it was appropriate that the new Government would have the opportunity of considering that and addressing that.</p></speech>

One was I was told IMF was insisting on a priority.  I couldn't see that in the IMF rules.  We had a conversation late on that Saturday night, on 20 November, about 2 o'clock, with the chief counsel of the IMF, a Mr. O'Hagan, and he explained it wasn't anywhere explicit but that's how the IMF dealt with the matter.  And the other issue that I did raise was whether there should be included, or whether there would be agreement to include, what's called a "most favoured nation clause" dealing with interest.  Because there was concern the interest rates were high.  A most favoured nation clause would mean that if anybody else got a lower interest rate, because the Portugal bailout was something that night happen, we would automatically benefit from that.  That had been explored, it was refused but I think you've already been told that there was, at least, an expectation that an improvement would be achieved on the interest rates but they were ... wouldn't put that clause in.</p></speech>

And an example of such would be what legal action could the ECB or Commission have taken against Ireland if we had decided to burn bondholders or let a bank like Anglo go bust?</p></speech>

They may have complained under, I think, it's title 8 of the treaty where each member state is obliged to contribute to financial stability, but, ultimately, they couldn't, in my view, have taken legal action.  Certainly it wasn't an issue that was raised for me to advise on, but my best understanding is they couldn't have.</p></speech>

I didn't believe that it, in any way, compromised me and I wouldn't have gone if I did.

The concern of the Government was quite clear to me.  It had nothing to do with protecting the industries.</p><p>The view was taken, whether rightly or wrongly - and it's for others to judge - that this was a very important aspect of Ireland's economic recovery.  That's how it was expressed to me ... that if you do anything to interfere with foreign direct investment, you are postponing the recovery for everybody's benefit.  And that was the only consideration I was aware of and no moral issue arose that I knew.</p></speech>

Do you believe it's a good idea to make monumental decisions in the middle of the night?</p></speech>

The possibility and alternative of not making that decision was explored fully by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and the advice was, it wasn't possible to delay the decision.  I heard what Dr. Somers said in that regard.  I mean, that's correct in so far as it goes.  Nobody does want to make those decisions but there are times - and I've experienced it in other, far less significant situations - where the decision has to be made.  That was the position.</p></speech>

I notice there was a meeting of the ECB the following day, on 1 October - in your statement, page 6 - if &euro;10 billion was being provided by the banks effectively to fund a liquidity position of Anglo, if the decision had been taken to basically cover that liquidity position, and Governor Honohan had brought up the issue in the ECB meeting the following day, was there any legal impediment to the ECB assisting Ireland in a solution to deal with Anglo and the banking crisis?</p></speech>

I think Governor Hurley said that.  But I do want to make things clear: resolution legislation was available.  When you talk about an orderly wind-down, an orderly wind-down involves a liquidation.  It was quite clear to everybody that you couldn't take the risk of winding down a bank in whatever fashion.  That was absolutely clear.  And nobody was prepared to take that risk because of the consequences for other banks.  It was as simple as that.  And all of the banks were regarded as being exposed to property ... you see one bank winding down and the concern was that, within a matter of hours if not days, that would be the position of all of the banks.  And, as I said, the unique position was you had the six domestic banks - our whole domestic financial system - under threat.  That, to my knowledge, was quite unique and certainly that demanded an approach that addressed the threat to the financial system.  And that's the decision that was taken.</p></speech>

I did mention, in an article that I wrote for the book on Minister Lenihan, that, as of 23 December 2010, we went over to the Merrion Hotel, and it is something remarkable ... I was constrained in what I could say in the book because of the obligation of confidentiality, but here was a man under the stress and the clear knowledge of what the future had for him, and there was only one thing that concerned him: and that was making sure that the legislation that was required to meet the bailout obligations was enacted before the Government fell.  And, in a sense, it's relevant to what Deputy Murphy said, there was that conscious ... that was the only thing that was on his mind.  And subsequent to that, I wrote to the Taoiseach and copied it to the Cabinet, and asked that I get every assistance from all of the Departments to prepare for the incoming Government the legislation that was required to make sure that there was no breach of those obligations because of the consequences Deputy Murphy has identified.  And I got full support from the Taoiseach and the Ministers in getting that prepared.  And I think that was something that was very important.</p></speech>

Or maybe timing was an issue, but we were ... that bouncing wouldn't be a fair reflection of what actually happened?</p></speech>

And when we're talking about burning bondholders, it's important to remember that they were talking about burning bondholders in the future and the effect on the cost of borrowing rocketed.  I think that set the seal for the bailout.  I think it was probably then a matter of time.  I think the Government was trying not to be bounced into it by saying, "Yes, we're applying for it" because then, as I said, you're locked in but that was the situation.  But, so far as I could see, that was what was of concern at the time and those are the matters that immediately precipitated ... of course, you can't isolate, Chairman, as the committee will know far better than I do, any one factor.  There was all of these factors coming together.</p></speech>

The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session, and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.</p><p>At this session we will focus again on the legal advice given to the Government during the crisis period.  I would like to welcome two witnesses from Arthur Cox limited firm, Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Mr. Eugene McCague.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is ... was managing partner of Arthur Cox from 2003 to 2011.  He led the Arthur Cox team which advised the Irish Government on the Irish banking crisis.  Eugene McCague is a partner with Arthur Cox since 1988, he served as managing partner from 1999 to 2003, and served as chairman of the board of Arthur Cox from 2006 to 2013.  The witnesses' appearance here today has been facilitated by a decision of the Government to waive legal privilege in respect of their oral evidence to this inquiry, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the financial crisis and the important mandate of this committee to inquire into the financial crisis.  The waiver is limited to advices relating to the bank guarantee provided to the Government during September and October '08.  In addition, the waiver does not extend to discussion of legal advice that could prejudice any litigation pending or anticipated regarding matters the committee may seek to inquire into.</p><p>Before hearing from the witnesses, I wish to advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  And I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning, and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  If I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to both Mr. McCague and Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.</p></speech>

I would like to start by giving an overview of Arthur Cox's role in addressing the issues which arose in the banking sector.<br/><br/>Arthur Cox was engaged by the Department of Finance on the morning of Wednesday, 24 September 2008, to advise in respect of the emerging banking crisis.  Prior to that I had no involvement in the banking crisis and was not aware of its depth.  I understand that the Department contacted me as it was familiar with my role ... with my work, through my role as chairman of the financial legislation advisory forum, which I had undertaken at the Department's request on a <i>pro bono</i>basis from 2007.  I led the Arthur Cox team throughout this period.  Arthur Cox was engaged to act as external corporate legal adviser to the Department and its agencies.  In executing our role we worked closely with the Department, the NTMA, the Office of the Attorney General, as well as other Department advisers, including Merrill Lynch, PwC, and later, Rothschild.<br/><br/>Over the seven years since the onset of the crisis, Arthur Cox's role has included advising on and helping manage legal risks relating to the State following the guarantee, assisting the Department of Finance and its agencies to map out the legal landscape applicable to the banking sector, undertaking legal due diligence exercises in respect of a number of the banks which the State was supporting, identifying legal obstacles and risks, as well as potential solutions to them in policy under development by the Department, contributing to the design of legislation being prepared by the Office of the Attorney General, helping execute policy decisions by legally implementing banking sector transactions and undertaking the High Court applications required to effect Government policy, working with the Department to satisfy the requirements of external agencies such as EC Directorate General for Competition, and finally, defending the State in litigation taken against it arising out of the execution of its policy.  The legal work required to perform this role was uniquely complex and extensive, with each legal action or solution integrally connected with all others over the years of the crisis.  In summary, Arthur Cox's job was to help design the legal architecture required to support policy decisions made by Government, and then help provide the legal engineering required to implement those decisions.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the crisis, in 2008, in common with many European countries, the Irish Government had available to it no specifically designed legal infrastructure or powers currently in law to intervene in, or resolve, banks in financial difficulty.  Indeed, EU-wide legislation dealing with bank recovery and resolution has only been implemented this year, in 2015.  As a consequence, this legal infrastructure had to be built, often under intense time pressure, from the ground up, as the crisis progressed.  This was a very extensive and complicated exercise, combining statutory, contractual and judicial avenues with the major milestones being the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013.<br/><br/>The common threads running through all of the work in the design and implementation of the required legal infrastructure were to enable the Government to take the actions it deemed necessary to ensure financial stability, while observing the legal integrity of the banks and their stakeholders, and ensuring the central objective that there be no default by any of the banks in relation to any of their obligations which could impact the guarantee.  Any default by the banks, even inadvertent, could have triggered cross-defaults on their financial instruments, leading to a failure of a bank and a call on the guarantee.  This risk became most pronounced in the first half of 2011, when the banking sector was substantially reorganised in accordance with the troika programme.  Each action taken by the State, therefore, had to be robustly designed to implement policy measures, legally and effectively, while ensuring banker sector ... banking sector stability.  This was legally challenging in circumstances in which the State was required to intervene strongly to maintain financial stability, even where that required the alteration of other stakeholders' rights.  The legal solutions adopted by the State in response to issues caused by the banking crisis navigated a narrow path demarcated by the Constitution, European law, IFSRA, which was later the Central Bank, and banking regulation generally, ECB requirements, stock exchange rules and the EU Commission's Directorate General for Competition, as well, of course, as the legal rights of depositors, bondholders, shareholders, derivative counterparties, bank boards and employees.  These solutions had to legally optimise the position of the State, comply with the requirements of the troika programme from 2011 onwards and take into account the responses of rating agencies and sovereign bond markets.  Over the period of our engagement, more than 120 Arthur Cox lawyers in total worked for the Department and its agencies on this crisis, with specialist teams required in corporate, litigation, capital markets, finance, financial regulation and insolvency-restructuring.<br/><br/>The direction I've received from the committee directs me to provide evidence on 13 lines of inquiry relating to themes of crisis management system and policy response and regulatory, supervisory and Government.  I look forward to answering your questions on these themes, following Mr. McCague's opening statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman,</p></speech>

Thanks for being here today.  Can I ask, first of all, as former chairman, this is Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, of the legislative advisory forum, can you comment on the extent to which Irish financial regulation policy was geared towards the development of the IFSC and do you believe this in any way compromised the regulation that would otherwise have been put in place in respect of domestic banks?</p></speech>

We didn't really look at that ... in fact, we didn't have any brief to look at the policy or the direction of any of that; it was actually just nearly an administrative exercise to consolidate what was already there so it would be hard for me to comment on the bigger picture in terms of the overall policy and direction.</p></speech>

In terms of the purpose of that, whether that was just directed at IFSC I would say that ... just as an observer. I would say that was an element of the regulatory response at the time but how much it was a core or essential feature of policy as that was communicated to the Central Bank, I don't know, but, certainly, if you look at the contrast between then, which is light touch, and now, which is quite different from that, I think you do see that contrast.</p></speech>

As I think I explained in my written statement, I only arrived to the meeting shortly before the representatives of Bank of Ireland and AIB came into the room.  So I suppose the first people I heard expressing their concerns were those representatives, and it was absolutely evident from them, and you've heard this evidence yourselves, that they were extremely concerned about Anglo and the contagion effect of Anglo.</p></speech>

Sequentially, they were the first people I heard expressing concerns.  They were extremely concerned.  They had ... I recall Mr. Gleeson of AIB making the point that if the share price in Anglo the following day when the markets opened fell anything like it had fallen that day, that there was a serious risk that people would take that as a proxy for deposits and that there would be people queuing outside the Irish banks so they had a very serious concern about that.  They wanted the nationalisation of those two institutions.  I think they used the phrase, "taken out", or some such phrase but it was clear that it was nationalisation they were talking about.  I don't recall them actually using the words,"These institutions are insolvent", but my sense was that that was certainly the view that Mr. Gleeson was putting across in what he had to say and the liquidity issue was speaking for itself. And, indeed, they had their own concerns in relation to their own positions as a result.</p> <p>  When they left the room there was then a further discussion among the Government side, if you like, to call it that.  What was evident to me was that I was coming at the end of a long meeting, near the end of a long meeting, rather than at the beginning of a meeting, because it was quite clear that the Government representatives had been thrashing this out for a number of hours.  I mean, I was told the meeting had been going on for some hours beforehand and, therefore, this was ... the main focus was whether anything new had been learned from Bank of Ireland and AIB and I suppose what those banks had done was reaffirmed a position that was already known that it was a very serious crisis.</p> <p>  And I don't recall ... so the issue then really became do you nationalise Anglo and Irish Nationwide or don't you?  By the time I was there, that had become the crux of the issue.  I don't recall anyone arguing the case that they were insolvent on the night.  I do recall Mr. Cardiff strongly argued the case for nationalisation.  I've read his statement, which you kindly sent me, and I recall that.  I don't know whether he based that on solvency but there was clearly concerns in relation to it.  And I recall that the most significant event of that next session was that the Taoiseach pulled the discussion together and said that he felt a decision needed to be made and he turned to the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Hurley.  In quite a formal fashion, he said, "Governor, as Taoiseach, I am entitled to rely on you for advice.  Is Anglo Irish Bank [I think probably also Nationwide, I remember Anglo] is it a liquidity issue or a solvency issue?" and the Governor was quite unequivocal that it was a liquidity issue.  And to some extent from that point on, the direction which the rest of the evening took, which I'm sure we will get to in due course, took its shape.  So I don't remember anyone making an assertion that either of the banks were insolvent but, certainly, the nationalisation of the argument was implying that to me.</p></speech>

Again yourself, if it's okay, what was the practice of the Department of Finance during September 2008, and subsequently, regarding the seeking of legal advice?  Did they seek legal opinion on all policy opinions being considered or on a specific policy option selected by them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene McCague" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#DD01100"><p>Sorry, I could deal with that for September and if you need, I'm sure P&aacute;draig could deal with it for subsequently.  In relation to September, I suppose the policy issues that were being considered were the ones that Merrill Lynch had laid out and they're in the document you sent.  And of those, we were asked to look at two of them.  We were looking clearly at the option of the legislation for the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  That was what my main, if not sole, focus over those days was, so we were certainly asked what were the legal issues in relation to that one.  And the other one was a lending scheme, an emergency liquidity scheme, a collateralised lending scheme.  It was called a secured lending scheme, I think, in the Merrill Lynch paper.  There were colleagues in Arthur Cox were asked to look at that and what were the legal issues on drafting on that.</p> <p>  In relation to the other issues on the Merrill Lynch paper, if I recall correctly, there was a good bank-bad bank option.  We were never asked to look at that but I think the Merrill Lynch paper itself specifies that that was a second-stage solution, if you like.   And liquidation, we were certainly never asked to look at because it was a second-stage one.  So that leaves the one, the option that was, ultimately, followed, which was the guarantee of the six institutions.  We weren't asked to give any advice on that prior to the decision being taken on the 30th.  I know P&aacute;draig and some of his colleagues did some work in relation to legislation after it.  We weren't asked for advice on that.  I should say that the Bill which we were drafting in relation to nationalisation did have a section in it which was giving the Minister very wide powers ... a wide power to give financial support to a credit institution and financial support included the word "guarantee" but that section would not have been adequate to deal with the type of blanket guarantee that was introduced on 30 September.  I just mention that because I think I saw when I was reading that either Mr. Beausang or Mr. Cardiff or one of those gentlemen had mentioned that there was a section in the legislation.  And there was, but it was dealing with just a broad power for the Minister to give financial support to institutions; it wasn't in relation to the guarantee.  So the short answer to that is we were asked to give advice on nationalisation and on a CLS scheme and we were not asked to give advice on any of the others.</p></speech>

To your knowledge ... well you said it wasn't and you were not asked to consider it, so I will rephrase it:  Would it have been legally possible to let Anglo and INBS fail and create a State bank by nationalising the other four?</p></speech>

I mean, the issue with nationalising institutions which are solvent ... I mean, it happens in countries like Venezuela and various other places but if you are in a constitutional democracy with a written constitution and with property rights and by nationalising, you're taking people's property rights away, you would face extraordinarily significant legal challenges but, in legal principle, you could introduce legislation to nationalise banks.</p></speech>

I think you probably know that.  It was based on the Northern Rock legislation, we were working on it over those days.  It was always said to us, from the first day we arrived, that this was contingency planning.  We were never given a date or we were never said, "This must be done."  It was contingency planning but that was what we were working on.  I don't think the legislation, of itself, to take your point, Senator, would have required a declaration that the bank was insolvent.  I'm merely making the point of the practical challenges of nationalising a solvent institution.</p></speech>

So, on the 24th, when you came in, it was about contingency planing.  I know we spoke briefly there about the night of the guarantee.  But did you have any sense when you were engaged on the 24th that, "Look, things are in a very, very grave situation and we expect to need to do something within a week, two weeks, a month, a year"?</p></speech>

I think that, on the morning, certainly, when we came in, we were asked to come in that morning at relatively short notice and we were briefed at the same time as Merrill Lynch was briefed.  And I have to say that I ... the briefing was quite shocking in relation to the position particularly of Anglo and INBS.  And therefore the potential knock-on impacts on the rest of the system, you know, were clear, but particularly on Anglo and INBS.  But at that stage again, as Eugene said, the timing as to how that would play out all depended on things like liquidity flows and all of that. And obviously the Central Bank would have had all of the information in respect of that and that was being monitored on a daily basis.  So it was very hard, when you saw the initial briefing, to predict exactly where this would go.</p></speech>

The banks, Senator, that we would have traditionally done most of that level were ... so let's call it board-level work, would have been Bank of Ireland.  From time to time, we would have done some work for EBS as well, I think, at the same type of level.  But I'm not that conscious that we had done that much in 2008.  So I think Bank of Ireland really would have been the bank.</p></speech>

How do legal firms, and indeed Arthur Cox, reconcile any potential for conflict of acting for the banks and, say, in the context of what we're talking about here, then also advising the Government on guarantee and other related issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#EE03300"><p>Well, the very first thing that we do is to see whether we're advising on the same issue, because if it's not on the same issue, then the issue doesn't arise so much. And then the priority always, obviously, is to inform both clients.  So, what you would do in those circumstances, you'd go to both clients - so in this case the Government, or the Department of Finance at least, and the Bank of Ireland - and explain to each of them what you're doing, how you're acting in relation to that and what the client actually wants of you.  And then if both clients, in those circumstances, agree that actually each of them is happy with that arrangement and the arrangements that are put in place to, you know, separate teams completely and preserve confidentiality and all those types of things, it's the client's decision then, or the client's choice, to go ahead on that basis.  I think, in the type of crisis that we had, Senator, every firm would have acted ... would have been acting for other banks, it's just the nature of it.  Because it would have been very difficult to provide the type of legal advice and expertise that the Department required if you'd never acted for any banks. So the inevitability would have been that any law firm would have been in a similar position.  Therefore the key is, well, how do you handle that conflict and the very first thing in relation to handling a conflict is, obviously, informing fully your clients and making sure that they're aware and letting them choose.</p></speech>

I think that, in general terms, if we had been advised to ... asked to advise on the guarantee, we certainly would have been qualified to act on the legal aspects of the guarantee.  And, you know, for example in the implementation of the guarantee afterwards, Senator, which happened in the first three weeks of October, where the statutory instrument that was ... that brought the guarantee into law was created, we were very involved in that.  So I think that bears out that, on the legal side, yes.  But I think there's ... and this comes back to a question you asked Eugene earlier as well, I think there's a very important distinction - certainly in terms of our role - between what the policy is, in terms of what you choose to do in terms of supporting the banking sector, and then the legal implementation of that.  And they're actually two fairly distinct points.</p></speech>

So on that week we ... we gave some advices in relation to the legislation itself because that was continually in development.  We did things like prepare step plans, for example, in relation to what ... how do you practically ... what practical steps do you take if you do nationalise?  So what are the things you do on day one?  And that's actually quite an extensive list.  We also did things like helped, you know, draft the explanatory memorandum.  All those types of things and also, as I said, contributed to the Act itself.  On the collateralised lending scheme, we certainly had the expertise and, again, we were advising how that could be constructed to provide liquidity to the banks on a general basis.</p></speech>

Because it was written as "O'Riordan" earlier.

It would have depended a lot, from time to time, on what precisely the work was.  There would have been quite a few partners involved but I don't have the numbers to hand.  It's important ... that 120 were not always ... were not working at one given time or another.  So that was over a period of seven years where we needed specialist teams to do specialist things.  So, for example - very clear example - we'd a ... we had a litigation team that had to do some of the High Court applications in relation to direction orders, those types of things, and then we'd have corporate and capital finance teams dealing with, for example, recapitalisations of the banks or the reconstruction of the banks in 2011.  So the 120 lawyers is over that period of time in total.</p></speech>

I want to reference your opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  Paragraph 13.1 and quote it directly, where you said in the middle of that paragraph that "we had a limited interaction with the IMF in respect of the legal manner in which senior bondholders could participate in burden sharing."  Can you, within the parameters that were operating in here today, outline to the inquiry the nature of that interaction that you had?</p></speech>

But on ... basically, when the IMF came in at the beginning, they very much were focused on burden-sharing with senior bondholders and I think that they saw that - at least the teams that I interacted with - saw that as being an integral part in the overall approach in solving the problem.  So we did have some meetings with the IMF in relation to that and the ... there was an IMF ... a lawyer that the IMF had used previously in relation to exactly this work called Lee Buchheit, from Cleary Gottleib, who was brought in and, actually, he gave advice over a day or two, in respect of, you know, how this had been done elsewhere, for example, in Latin America and various other places.  So, certainly at that stage, it was quite a focus of the IMF.  From my perspective then, that disappeared back into a policy discussion and then it came back from the troika on the basis that there wouldn't be any burden-sharing with the ... with senior bondholders.</p></speech>

But if we're talking really about the liabilities, I suppose, until the decision was taken, the responsibility ... or the potential liability on the State would have arisen potentially in relation to the deposit guarantee scheme, where the increases had gone from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  And so if a bank had defaulted on deposits, to the extent there's intended to be a fund to cover that - I don't know what state the fund was in - but to the extent that that fund wasn't able to meet it, then the State I think would have had to step in.  So, until the final decision was taken, that would have been the extent of the State's liability.  Once the decision on the guarantee was taken, I think it's, again, fairly straightforward which is that for all of the categories of liabilities which are mentioned in the guarantee in relation to the six institutions and for the two-year period of the guarantee, the State was basically saying that they would pay up to creditors to the extent that an individual bank failed to do so.</p></speech>

In reference to a comment that you made in answer to Senator MacSharry earlier, you said that you - and I think I'm quoting you correctly - you don't remember anyone making an assertion that on ... banks were insolvent on the night of the guarantee in the meetings that you attended.  Was there an extensive discussion around the matter of insolvency or the potential for insolvency or that the illiquidity which everybody has acknowledged existed could ultimately lead to insolvency?</p></speech>

I wouldn't say there was an extensive discussion by the time I had arrived but bear in mind that this was getting quite late now - the banks had come in, they'd gone out and so on.  I had the clear sense there had been an extensive discussion and there certainly was, to take your last point, a discussion on the fact that, you know, in some ways, it isn't quite binary liquidity versus solvency.  I know people have set up the debate, if you like, as such.  And, you know, serious illiquidity will ultimately lead to insolvency.  So there was a view that if the liquidity issue wasn't dealt with, then obviously it would lead to insolvency.  But I don't recall anyone calling it directly and saying, "I believe this bank is insolvent as of tonight."</p></speech>

I just want to rewind, there's one point that I forgot to ask Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in earlier.  In relation to the full extent of the seven years that were ... that you're referencing in your opening statement - and you spoke about the 120 lawyers who were employed over that seven-year period, or were working on these matters within the firm - can you inform the inquiry how you were instructed for each of those engagements?  Like was there a tendering process for each of them and which of them there were not ... was there not, potentially, a tendering process?</p></speech>

There was no tendering process at the very beginning because it clearly was an emergency when this happened.  The ... over the period of this time I think we did about 19 different tenders, some ...  many of which we won, some of which we lost.  That would include, for example, tenders in relation to work for NAMA and those types of things as well.  So there was ... there was quite a bit of tendering.</p></speech>

If I can find it myself.  Yes, subsection (e) of your statement, you say that the legal consequences of a failure of a bank could have included the capacity of the ECB to seize the bank's collateral.  Can you, maybe, briefly outline what that would have entailed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#FF03900"><p>Absolutely.  So this is just one of the consequences of a bank becoming insolvent.</p><p>So what would have happened ... and the ECB would have been in no different position, really, from other types of ... well, actually, sorry, it had priority ... would have been in a similar position to other types of derivative counterparties whereby, in order to get liquidity, what the banks would have done is that they would have repoed some of their assets to the ECB.  And what happens in that case is that if there's an insolvency event or a bank becomes illiquid, the ECB or, indeed, other derivative parties, would actually then seize that collateral so that they own it, essentially, as collateral for the lending that they'd given.</p></speech>

And that was one of the issues that the banks faced in relation to liquidity because they couldn't just package loans and give them to the ECB.  So that was the position in respect of that.</p></speech>

The promissory notes, for example, that were held at the Central Bank of Ireland at the time ... the Central Bank would have become the owner of the promissory notes and then they were restructured from there.  So that's probably the primary example.</p></speech>

At paragraph 6.3 of your statement you say "Anglo posed the greatest risk to the guarantee and the stability of the banking sector".  Again, can you maybe elaborate on that particular statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GG00700"><p>Certainly, Deputy.  I think ... and, again, I'd need to be a little bit circumscribed because I'm conscious that there's litigation ongoing in relation to Anglo.  But, essentially, once the State guaranteed each of the banks, then the State was, obviously, vulnerable to any default by any of the banks.  And, therefore, when it came to Anglo, once confidence started to erode in relation to, you know, the manner in which Anglo was being run, that obviously had quite an impact in relation to whether the guarantee could be triggered.  And, you know, a guarantee could be triggered if there was any default in any of the covenants, for example, for ... in any of the financial instruments that the bank held.  So when you guarantee like that, you ultimately are responsible for the bank and that, therefore, once the confidence in a corporate governance began to really erode in terms of Anglo, then that really was a trigger, I think, for the State to say "This is really is our obligation, our liability, ultimately, in terms of the guarantee and, therefore, we need to take more extensive control than we have taken in relation to the other banks."  And then that's when you nationalise.  So you become the owner.  You control the board - at least, you appoint the board.  And, therefore, you regularise the governance of it to a much greater extent.</p></speech>

So that judgment would be made by ... from the financial perspective.  So that would be Department of Finance, I suppose the Central Bank.  My lens in terms of all of this would be much more just the legal perspective.</p></speech>

In evidence to the inquiry, Professor Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank, spoke about the merger of EBS and AIB and the merger of Anglo and INBS and he said it "seemed a largely pointless cosmetic exercise".  That's from page 7 of his statement that he gave to the inquiry.  He also said that the exercise was "pressed on the Irish authorities by the Troika".  You would have been involved, obviously, at the time in advising the Department.  Were you aware of those pressures that Professor Honohan ... external pressures that he alleges to have been coming from outside?</p></speech>

So what happened was when the troika came in, the troika required that the banking sector would be reorganised in a sustainable manner.  And at that stage, INBS, for example, was still out on its own as an entity and it needed to be resolved.  It needed to be put on a footing that actually was sustainable in the longer term.  And the decision was made to roll that into Anglo to form IBRC and that combined essentially perhaps the two most troubled banks.  So the purpose of that at the time, certainly as I understood it and as, I suppose, we executed it or helped execute it, was that the ... that the idea was to reform the Irish banking sector into the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  And then EBS ... then ILP as a third bank, which actually had a potentially sustainable future.  So I have to say that I would see logic in that because clearly something had to be done with INBS and EBS too was a very, very small institution at that stage and clearly also was troubled.</p></speech>

I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but you have a difference of opinion as to what Professor Honohan said?  His quote again was that it "seemed a largely pointless [and] cosmetic exercise".</p></speech>

So he has a lens of the ... you know, financial stability and finance generally in terms of the country's economy.  My view is just I would say that there's a logic in saying that if you have a number of banks that seem unsustainable in the longer period of time, you do need to consolidate them or you need to take them off the pitch in some way.  This was just the way that it was decided to do that.</p></speech>

So why was that that you were brought in at that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GG02700"><p>Well, Senator, it's a very good question.  The reason is this. The Department of Finance ... we advise the Department of Finance.  So if you take the Attorney General's office which did a really great job in respect of the entirety of the crisis, their job is to provide the legislation on the infrastructure.  But in a crisis like this, there's a lot more to be done, essentially.  So, for example, in terms of understanding, you know, banks' capital, their financial instruments, transacting with banks - so a lot of this is contractual as well - there's a lot of other legal work that needs to be done which the Attorney General's office wouldn't generally do.</p> <p>  In terms of our input in terms of the legislation that the Attorney General's office was producing, our job really was to say "Well, how does this work, you know, out in the banking world?"  So, in other words, that we would bring the experience of how this would actually legally impact the banks, how ... you know, how the legislation could be drafted in a way that actually effected in practical ways, in the actual banks themselves and the banking sector, what it was that the policy needed to achieve.</p> <p>  There's also a question of resource.  I mean, for example, you know creating that step plan in the ... and this was only the first week, but creating that step plan for nationalisation, what do you actually do, you know, when the legislation is brought in?  Those types of tasks would not be tasks that the Attorney General's office would, generally speaking, do.</p></speech>

There was absolutely a general urgency that everything needed to get done and the preparation that needed to get done, that it needed to get done as soon as possible so, you know, over those days we all worked as a team, not just our firm but, as a team, worked extremely hard over those days.  We didn't know precisely when, you know, the work that we were doing would be needed, but we knew that there was a decent chance it would be needed imminently.  And obviously the function of the Department of Finance at the time, who we were advising, was to make sure, I suppose, that they had the options in place in terms of any Government decisions that might be made and we were working to that.</p></speech>

So there was ... when we came in there was already a very advanced Bill that had been prepared by the Attorney General's office, which dealt with nationalisation and which also had sections in there enabling the Minister to provide financial assistance to individual banks.  So that was all very much in train.  So the work that we did, essentially, over those couple of days was just to maybe help, you know, perfect that and give our views in relation to it so the Attorney General's office could take that on board.  But that legal infrastructure was already prepared.</p></speech>

There was further discussion on the loan books of the banks, particularly of Anglo.  Following that meeting, we continued to progress the draft Bill. </blockquote> <p>So how did that meeting inform or change the way in which you were working or did it?  What was the purpose of the meeting?</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting, I think, was, in fact I've now learned, although I didn't know earlier, that the purpose of the meeting was a follow-up from a meeting on the Friday, which we hadn't been at.  But it was essentially, as I say, a series ... there had been a series of meetings, of briefings as to how ... what the loan books were like, the first one being on Wednesday, the 24th which was our first day.  It's in the core documents.  It's dated Thursday, 25th but I think our view is, as others have, that it was the 24th.  So the general discussion that day was a further update on what was happening.  Merrill Lynch had produced the paper, the slideshow if you like, on the 26th I think and then they had the narrative paper that morning and I think the ... they didn't go through it in detail but they went through the options, which were the same options that had been discussed before.</p></speech>

Made it worse, made it better, <i>status quo</i>for the actual banks, do you remember?</p></speech>

I don't recall at that meeting, maybe I'm ... not to mix up two stories.  I don't recall at that meeting there being updates on liquidity, I mean, we weren't necessarily being told about liquidity.  But to the extent that there was a theme or a tone around the meeting, it certainly was that things were getting worse and not better.</p></speech>

Did they make that view known to you, not necessarily in the succinct way they've done it here, but in the conversations were they making that clear?  Because obviously you were at a meeting with them, more than one possibly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#HH00900"><p>Will I take that?  Senator, I certainly recall that view.  I don't recall whether that was at that particular meeting because of course there were so many meetings afterwards but certainly I recall that view.  And the view was a very straightforward one and, of course, in hindsight it was absolutely correct, which is that, you know, both INBS and Anglo funded their book with short-term debt to a certain extent and, in fact, to quite a material extent.  And that meant that they were relying on the international capital markets being open to them at any given time.  So, put very simply, they would borrow money for three months and lend it to you for seven years, and therefore they had to keep renewing that money.  Once the international capital markets closed, then obviously they ran out of funding.  And that was why it was quite broken and also, of course, both Anglo and INBS were just pure property lenders, so they were monoline lenders.  So the combination of those two things, I think, is exactly what the NTMA was pointing to and certainly that was a theme from early on but whether it was at that meeting or not, I can't recall.</p></speech>

Did you have to stand back yourselves and go, okay these banks are solvent or they're not solvent, or were you just able to rely on, as it turned out, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator's observation?</p></speech>

Just taking up Senator O'Keeffe's point and it's covered in paragraph 9.8 of Mr. McCague's presentation and it says that "the Taoiseach asked Mr. Hurley on a number of occasions for his advice as to whether, in the Central Bank's view, Anglo was insolvent".  Didn't the Taoiseach ask the wrong person?  That was Mr. Neary's responsibility, he was micro and Mr. Hurley was macro.</p></speech>

But I'm fairly sure that it was Mr. Hurley was asked first.  He asked both of them and they both gave the same answer.</p></speech>

Well, that was because Mr. Neary wasn't there.  My recollection is, and I think actually this is borne out in their own evidence, that Mr. Hurley left at some stage and then Mr. Neary came in at some stage.  I can't remember the exact details.</p></speech>

It was an issue at the time, as to whether that division was ... ever made any sense.  And Senator O'Keeffe has spoken with you about the issue of whether it was liquidity, as Mr. Hurley said, or in fact it was the wrong business model, insolvency, and the NTMA believed that and they were in the building.  And certainly the other ... the major banks believed it and they were in the building so unfortunately, it was ... it may have been a minority view, the one that prevailed, that it was liquidity and not solvency that ... the business model being unsustainable.</p> <p>  In Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's presentation, and I thank him for it also, at 6.1, "the State ... formally accepted responsibility for most of Anglo's liabilities when it issued the guarantee in September 2008".  Didn't the State believe, and everybody believe, that was for &euro;1.5 billion and not a bill for &euro;30 billion?  Could anything have been done to say, we understand, as of now we're accepting &euro;1.5 billion and not any higher number and certainly not &euro;30 billion?</p></speech>

But the point I was making is that actually the State was already on the hook for Anglo, from the time of the guarantee, essentially, so therefore in, in nationalising Anglo, it wasn't taking on any more liability.  But, certainly, I mean, my recollection of the early days was clearly it wasn't known that there was going to be a &euro;30 billion gap.</p></speech>

So, you know, the guarantee and the overall the ... financial sector generally did leave the taxpayer with that bill.  I think too it's very important in that analysis, Senator, to remember that the losses that had occurred in the system, you know, predated the guarantee and were there in any case, so they had to fall at some stage.</p></speech>

That was, ultimately, done by the Central Bank, for example, in its PCAR and it's PLAR exercises, and that is a very, very extensive exercise.  The other thing to remember at the time is that things were moving very quickly, so I suspect, and this is more of a financial question rather than a legal question, but if you had gone into the banks at the time and assessed the assets, you'd have been assessing them against probably the conditions over the previous number of months, as opposed to the conditions that were to come.  So, again it's hard to say, I would say, whether that would have ... even if you had had the months that it would have taken to do that job, whether it could have been benchmarked correctly in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Has that been rectified?</p></speech>

I mean, it's been rectified.  Firstly. we brought in ... well, the country brought in, in 2011, a domestic resolution scheme and the troika had required us to do that.  But more fundamentally, just this year, from 1 January, the European Union has brought in the BRRD, the banking resolution and recovery directive, which actually does that in a comprehensive way.  And it took the European Union, you know, five or six years just to formulate that.  So that is a resolution regime that involves bail-ins, for example, that involves bad banks, that gives all the tools that are required.  In 2008, Senator, across Europe, most countries were actually without banking resolution legislation, and it's important to remember that no retail bank in the eurozone had ever been liquidated, so that's why at the time there wasn't, in any country, for example, in the UK as well, that there wasn't a pre-existing resolution legislation.  But that is there now on the basis primarily of the new directive but also of our domestic legislation.</p></speech>

I think the NTMA were ... provided the room, so to speak.  In fact, I think I read some other witness gave evidence that it was to ... there were too many photographers and various other people gathered around the Department, so the meeting was held in the NTMA, but we were retained by the Department.</p></speech>

There was further discussion on the loan books of the banks, particularly of Anglo.  Following that meeting we continued to progress the draft [nationalisation] Bill. </blockquote> <p>So, at that meeting, what views were given by the National Treasury Management Agency, what views were given by the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance as regards doing legislation around the nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide Building Society?</p></speech>

Was there a discussion around that time ... two aspects: No. 1, around the solvency of the banks, more particularly Anglo, and was the discussion around that ... were you under the impression that it was still policy to look at putting in place legislation to nationalise Anglo?</p></speech>

That was the information that was coming through.  There was some, you know, concern that the advisers hadn't been in place that long.  This was all very, very much-----</p></speech>

But, perhaps, to come back to a point that somebody else asked me that might explain it, even if it had have been declared, let's state, objectively everybody had agreed it was solvent that day, I don't think, logically, they would have stopped the legislation being prepared because, as I think we said earlier, illiquidity can lead to insolvency, so even if their balance sheets were very strong, and even if their assets greatly exceeded their liability, if the liquidity crisis continued and if it wasn't addressed in some way, they could have ended up being insolvent and therefore having to be nationalised.  So I think that probably explains why the work was being continued-----</p></speech>

But in terms of the guarantee, it was still in the mix as one of the Merrill Lynch options, but it wasn't ... in fact, an awful lot of that meeting, Deputy, was really about the loan books and what was going on.

So the question I suppose I want to ask you, is No. 1, you were brought in a week before the guarantee took place, you were brought in the 24 September.  Was there in any way a discussion around putting in place a mechanism to allow an orderly wind-down of an insolvent institution?  Obviously, I'm speaking specifically about Anglo and Irish Nationwide.</p></speech>

No there wasn't, Senator, because the ... I think the ... the policy the entire time was to stand behind the banks and I think that the feeling at the time, and you'll see it actually in the rest of 5.5, if you go through what actually would happened at the time, seeing an insolvency, even for example the &euro;100,000 guarantee scheme, there was two things; firstly those depositors would not have got their money for three months and in addition, there was a question of funding that, that scheme, so the Government would have had to come up with the cash to fund that immediately.  So I think ... and that's only ... and that's the least of the problems.  You then see how that would impact the other banks and depositors in other banks.  It would have complicated the problem very significantly I would have thought.  So as a result that ... that week it was not ... that was not part of the ... of the discussion.</p></speech>

But as I said that was true throughout Europe and also bank resolution regimes are very complex things to put into place and as I said, the European Union took five years to do it, which is just in place now.  So I think two things to be clear; firstly there wasn't ... the resolution mechanism, that wasn't part of the policy and the direction was more a nationalisation and with the supporting liquidity scheme, the CLS scheme that we've been discussing.</p></speech>

Could it have been nationalised in a night?  Would it have been required that, you just ... you would have put the liquidity funding in place to fund Anglo in terms of over the next number of days?  What's the practical procedures in terms of nationalising?</p></speech>

So in terms of ... of nationalising a bank it's very important always to make sure that you retain confidence and certainty in the sector generally speaking.  So you would tend to pass the legislation that was there on the night of the guarantee and was there that week, and ultimately, a version of that was enacted in January 2009.  So essentially what you do is you ... you remove the ... you go in, you take the shares, so the shares transfer from the shareholders to the State.  You then change the board, which means that ... that there's new controls in relation to it and you just take ownership of the bank.</p></speech>

Did you form a view, I suppose on the night of the meeting in question, we've had evidence that the NTMA weren't directly present in the room, as to why they weren't there or did you have a view as to whether they should have been physically in the room giving their opinion or ... rather than having it filtered though a third party?</p></speech>

But in relation to the discussions that took place, were there discussions on restructuring with respect to the sovereign or was it specifically on the issue of the possibility of burden-sharing?  And was he specifically employed by the IMF on the ... on this ... on the Irish matter or was it just that he was on retainer?</p></speech>

I'm not sure in what exact capacity he was there.  He was there as simply somebody who had done this in other countries.  He was there I would say quite briefly in relation to this, so we, we had, we had worked out - and I don't want to get into advices for example here - but certainly in terms of burden-sharing the legal structures would have been available in Ireland to do that.  And then a lot of ... a lot of it was actually about well, how do you deal with the bond markets in respect of this and, you know, those types of issues.  And Mr. Buchheit advised on those but, as I say, over a relatively brief period and that was the period that I mentioned earlier where the IMF were still focusing, at least to my ... in my experience were quite focusing on burden-sharing with senior bondholders.</p></speech>

Chairman, I make this statement on foot of your request to assist you and your colleagues in your deliberations inquiring into the banking crisis.  You requested that I address certain issues from my position as Taoiseach during the 28th, 29th and 30th D&aacute;ileanna.  For my record, my tenure as Taoiseach over the time extended over three Governments: from 16 June 1997 to 6 June 2002; from 6 June 2002 to 14 June 2007; and 14 June 2007 to 7 May 2008.</p><p>You requested I address a number of specific topics in my evidence which are of interest to the inquiry.  The first one is the nature and effectiveness of the operational implementation of macroeconomic and prudential policy.  The available evidence supports a strongly positive conclusion under this heading.  The main economic problems facing Ireland in the mid-90s were high unemployment, net emigration, relatively low incomes and the need for increased productivity.  A decade later these problems were substantially solved.  GDP growth in real terms averaged about 7.25% in the decade or so to 2006, and the corresponding rate of growth in GNP was nearly 6.4%.  Such rates of growth were substantially above those experienced in other EU member states, and indeed throughout the OECD area of the time.  <br/><br/>The 2005 annual report of the National Competitiveness Council reported that Ireland&rsquo;s rate of growth in this period was more than double that of the US and triple the average rate achieved by other eurozone countries.  They also noted that labour productivity had been growing by 5% per annum and that the taxation and regulatory systems had developed to become key competitive strengths of the economy.  Furthermore, with Government investment in infrastructure being significantly higher than in other developed economies and countries, a previously important and long-standing weaknesses was being addressed.  As a result of these developments, employment in Ireland increased from 1.38 million in 1997 to over 2 million by 2006, and the unemployment rate declined from 10.3% to 4.3%.  Net inward migration accelerated from 19,000 per annum in 1997 to 70,000 per annum a decade later.  <br/><br/>A key indicator of the progress that was achieved in this period was that by 2007 the National Competitiveness Council would report that Ireland was ranked fourth in the world in the UN&rsquo;s human development index, based on strong improvements in income per capita, life expectancy and educational levels.  These achievements were made against an international background of a slowdown in growth in Ireland&rsquo;s main export markets from 2001 to 2003, and ongoing fears of a steep decline developing in the United States. <br/><br/>Furthermore, at home the aggregate fiscal position was managed in a highly conservative, prudential way.  Thus, total Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP actually declined from 39.8% in 1997 to 39.2% in 2007.  Government gross current expenditure as a percentage of GNP fell from 36% to under 33%, facilitating expansion in capital spending from 3.6% to 6.3% of GNP in that decade.  The overall Government balance rose to a surplus of over 6% of GNP, from 1.3% a decade earlier in 1997.  And finally, to seal this point in relation to prudential financial management, it should be emphasised that the Exchequer debt/GDP ratio fell from 63.6% in 1997 to 25.1% in 2006.  <br/><br/>Budgetary policy was successful also in addressing social inequality.  For example, in the quarterly economic commentary of December 2004 the ESRI concluded: </p><blockquote>	In terms of income redistribution, Budget 2005 has been strongly progressive in terms of the direction of tax measures, social welfare payments and the absence of indirect tax increases.  As regards the Budget's overall fiscal stance.  The most appropriate indicator of the budgetary position is the general government balance (GGB), which we forecast to move from a surplus of 1.1 per cent of GDP this year to a deficit of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2005.  This expansionary fiscal stance may not be inappropriate given that there are potential downside risks to our forecasts over the next few years. </blockquote><p>A year later, writing in the quarterly economic report of December 2005, in an article entitled Future Irish Growth: Opportunities, Catalysts, Constraints, Professor Frank Barry of UCD concluded as follows, &quot;It is suggested here that if Ireland can continue to attract substantial [foreign direct investment] and the labour pool necessary to man it, further convergence on US income per head &ndash; which remains well above that of the EU 15 &ndash; should be [available].&quot;<br/><br/>Clearly, Chairman, Ireland has been extremely effective in attracting FDI.  At the heart of that success is the operational effectiveness of IDA Ireland, the agency responsible for implementing Government policy in this area.  And, for example, the <i>IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2008 </i>ranks direct investment flows to Ireland at $10.79 billion and 4.22% of GDP as the two most significant improvements in competitiveness of Ireland in that year. <br/><br/>On the second question, Chairman, the appropriateness of expert advice: when it comes to expert advice and high-quality economic analysis, the Government have a wide range of sources available - international organisations - including the European Commission, the IMF, the OECD and financial ratings agencies like Standard and Poor's and Moody&rsquo;s.  Each carry out independent assessments of macroeconomic and prudential conditions in Ireland, and for the most part these are undertaken about annually and usually highlight what, in their view, are the prospects facing the economy, and the policy initiatives that were required to prioritise to optimise economic performance on a sustainable basis.  These organisations have the advantage of having international perspectives, and the insights they provide are especially valuable when considering economic conditions and prospects in a comparative context.  In other words, they enable us to judge performance relative to countries with whom we compete.  This comparative perspective is obviously very useful from the point of view of assessing if Government policy is on the right track.  <br/><br/>At national level there are several organisation, funded or part-funded by the Exchequer, such as the ESRI, NESC, Forf&aacute;s and the Central Bank, which through their regular publications and studies on particular aspects of the economy, provide valuable and continual monitoring of economic performance at macro and sectoral level, and with respect to individual policy initiatives undertaken or proposed by Government.  Increasingly, in recent times, domestic financial and professional services providers have also devoted increased resources to economic analysis, policy evaluation, commentary and economic forecasts.  And while the research of these organisations focus primarily for the benefit of their own clients' bases, it can provide useful insights for policy development and evaluation in public policy terms.<br/><br/>I would like to also mention under this heading - which is in my report, but I won't read it, but it's in the report - the elaborate annual process of soliciting and evaluating pre-budget submissions from interested parties and individuals by the Department of Finance.  This process provides a broad platform from which Government can elicit ideas, potential initiatives and amendments to existing schemes to improve budgetary formation.  In addition, it's always open to Ministers, on the advice of their Departments, to solicit interest from external consultants with respect to particular issues or problems which are foreseen developing.  Furthermore, there is well-developed public tendering processes in place to facilitate the public service in procuring the most appropriate level of expertise at fair value for taxpayers.  <br/><br/>In overall terms, therefore, I hope the committee of inquiry can see from my remarks that aside from economic advice available from the permanent Civil Service, in particular the Department of Finance, there is a very wide range of sources of advice, both from an international and domestic focus, which allows Government to draw a synthesis which one hopes of course is balanced and gives due consideration to the very wide range of views that is inevitably brought forward in such a process.  <br/><br/>Obviously I am not going to present a comprehensive review of the policy decisions that were made in this period, nor the inputs to those decisions.  However, I think it's important that the committee takes due recognition of the information that was available when the decisions were being made to counteract the retrospective narrative that has developed with the benefit of hindsight over the years since the crisis first began to manifest in 2008.  To this end, the table included summarises IMF forecasts and results for real GDP percentage growth in Ireland as published in the World Economic Outlook<i></i>over the period 2004 to 2009.  The WEO is published in spring and autumn and data from successive publications are shown in my statement.  <br/><br/>It can be readily seen, Chairman, that the crash was not foreseen by the IMF, who only realised their outlook when the slowdown was well and truly at hand.  For example, as late as autumn 2007 the IMF was forecasting that the Irish economy would grow at 3% in 2008 after inflation is deducted.  Even when it became clear that there was a severe global downturn, the IMF forecast in late 2008 that there would be no more than a marginal fall of 0.6% in real GDP in Ireland in 2009.  This data indicate the information that was available to decision makers at this time, and the conclusions are clear: even an organisation such as the IMF remained convinced that Ireland&rsquo;s economic expansion was sustainable.  <br/><br/>Inevitably, of course, there were stresses and strains associated with rapid expansion in economic activity.</p><p>The most noted and commented upon at the time was the growing importance of the construction sector in the Irish economy.  At some stage, this growth would inevitably ease.  For example, the ESRI medium-term review of 2003 noted that, and I quote, "At some stage over the coming decade, when the demand for housing has been largely met, it is likely that prices will fall to levels closer to the European Union average, and this will be the signal for a winding down of capacity in the sector ... the inevitable process of adjustment to lower demand [for building and construction output], which is still some way off, will prove painful for the sector".  In other words, market forces, which had driven up prices, had led to increased economic activity.  However, as supply rose, some of the increase in prices and activity would be expected to be reversed and this was expected to occur at some stage during the years 2003 to 2013.  In its subsequent medium-term review in 2005, the ESRI noted that no slowdown was seen and there were ... there was "a growing aura of invincibility about the Irish economy", with consumers showing a "high degree of certainly about the future".  And, while, with the benefit of hindsight, this can be interpreted as unwarranted complacency, the ESRI went on to conclude that the "fundamental factors driving the Irish economy ... remain quite favourable".  A note of caution was sounded but the subsequent analysis, which comprised a high-growth and a low-growth scenario, was based on alternative assumptions regarding the impact on Ireland of what were described as "global economic imbalances" which could lead to the US economy slowing considerably and experience a painful adjustment.  Chairman, to an extent, this is what subsequently transpired.  The forecast based on this scenario was that Irish growth would slow to 3.5% per annum in the years 2005 to 2010 and 3.1% from 2010 to 2015.  Unemployment would rise to about 7% in the early years of the slowdown before falling back to the 2005 level of 4%, while the public finances would remain broadly in balance.  Of course, if the US economy did not suffer this painful adjustment, then Irish growth rates were forecast to be higher.  The implication is that no homegrown crisis was foreseen and even an imported one would have relatively mild effects due to the fundamental sound nature of the Irish economy.</p><p> These examples are provided here, Chairman, simply to illustrate what was available to policy makers and it's not my purpose to critique these organisations.  However, the research and conclusions of these organisations constitutes a major input to policy decisions.  Of course, having this research available does not mean that the most appropriate course for policy was always clear.  Some divergences of opinion are to be expected, indeed, contrasting views and opinions were encountered.  The range of views was always taken into account in reaching policy decisions during my time in office but the synthesis of opinions leading to policy decisions inevitably reflects the conclusions of the vast majority of the research.  I believe that this is the correct basis on which decisions should be made.  In this respect, it must be noted that the overwhelming and virtually ... consensus during this time was that Irish policy was moving the economy in the right direction, that the economy was on a sustainable growth path that could be expected to slow somewhat in response to changes in fundamental drivers, that the main risk would be traced to developments in external economies and that the dangers posed by domestic factors represented challenges to be managed rather than the first indicators of a crisis, as subsequently developed.</p><p> Chairman, I'm ... for time reasons, I'm ... I'm skipping some of the sections.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#TT00300"><p>So, to ... to my section with ... on the statement ... the "Context of Budgetary Policy":  In terms of wider budgetary policy and also, maybe, to give proper context to the issues under discussion, I think it's worthwhile to emphasise that during my period as Taoiseach, Ireland finally caught up with and then surpassed average EU living standards.  It was a sizeable national achievement to raise our living standards from a historically low base of two thirds of the EU average.  The downturn did have a very hard impact on individuals and families, especially those who lost their jobs and, of course, that saddened me and I wish the recession did not happen.  However, it is disingenuous to suggest that all the gains this country made have been wiped away.  Between 1997 and 2008 this country thrived, and, not only did Ireland enjoy record economic growth but living standards were raised across the board and this drove social progress.  This rising tide was essential in lifting hundreds of thousands of our people out of poverty, to reversing forced emigration, to significantly increasing pensions and child benefit, to modernising schools, health facilities, roads and communications infrastructure around our country and creating well-paid jobs for young people at home.  This represented a positive change to the lives of many people and, despite the recession, a lot of this progress is still there, benefiting thousands of our citizens.</p> <p>  I am glad that Government allocated - that I led - huge amounts of money in this period into regenerating traditional areas of poverty, such as Ballymun and Fatima Mansions in inner-city areas, and parts of Limerick, Cork, Waterford and other cities.  I am glad we put money into the islands, improving electricity, sewage and building infrastructure and piers and ... in rural areas.  Throughout the country, people now drive on better and safer roads.  The motorway network that Government supported during my tenure has cut journey times and is a vital economic and social artery of our people.  People also travel on better trains, our school and hospitals have more staff working in better buildings.  All the time as Taoiseach, what I wanted to do, Chairman, was ... with budgets, was to improve the quality of life for ordinary people and to provide services that our country did not have before.  Those who say we squandered the boom forget that in my time as Taoiseach we actually recorded budget surpluses in ten of our 11 budgets.  We balanced sustained increases in spending with the need to reduce our national debt.  As a result, Ireland paid a billion euro less every year in ... in interest payments.</p> <p>  I want to remind members of this committee that when I first came to the House, in '77, and for ... right through the 80s, our national debt was an unsustainable milestone around the neck of taxpayers.  It was a barrier to national progress, as huge sums of revenue had to service interest payments.  In 1997, the year I became Taoiseach, 20% of all taxes raised in the State were used to service the national debt.  In 2007, my last full year as Taoiseach, that figure stood at 4.3%.  During my time as Taoiseach, we continued to pay into the National Pensions Reserve Fund, so that, when the downturn came, we had &euro;20 billion saved which provided some protection when the recession came.</p> <p>  There is zero credibility in suggesting that an open economy like ours could withstand the global recession and the collapse of the global investment banking system.  This was not just an Irish experience, it was a worldwide recession that affected America, Japan, Britain and China, and most of the developed economies in the world.  In 2007 the International Monetary Fund maintained that Ireland's economic growth would be strong over the medium term.  The IMF directors said our economic performance was robust and was supported by sound economic policies.  When I left office a year later, the IMF and other financial organisations, such as the OECD, along with national ones, such as the ESRI, were all predicting growth in the Irish economy in the region of 3% for 2009.  In June 2009, a little more than a year on from my resignation, they were predicting contraction of between 8% and 10%.  That illustrates how unprecedented and unforeseen this global crisis had been and how quickly it took shape.</p> <p>  It is true that we had some warnings about over-reliance on ... on property.  But it is important to be clear about the record.  In October 2004 the IMF alluded to a possible overheating in the housing market, even though, subsequently, they themselves, and other economic commentators, implied there was no bubble.  In the budget two months later, Brian Cowen, the Minister for Finance, announced a review of tax incentive schemes.  In the next budget we announced a termination date for all existing property-related tax incentive schemes, with the exception of private hospitals, registered nursing homes and child care facilities.  Our stamp duty was already the largest transaction tax on property in the European Union and despite a concerted campaign by some to get rid of the tax, or to reduce it substantially, we refused to go down this route and we listened ... we'd ... if we had listened to those calls, this would have added fuel to the housing market and we would have experienced a far greater difficulties than we ultimately experienced.  We were, Chairman, able gradually to remove incentives from the property market but membership of the euro meant that we were unable to raise interest rates.  Accordingly ... according to the IMF report in the summer of 2009, the housing boom was caused mainly by cheap credit due to low interest rates, along with rising incomes and a strong demand for housing.  There is no doubt that this created a structural weakness in the economy and the international downturn ensured this has turned from a soft landing into a very hard one.  I wish this didn't happen and, with hindsight, of course, I would have done things differently.</p> <p>  I did make mistakes, Chairman, I admit that.  But, so does everyone who governs.  I know that during my time as Taoiseach, while I did not get everything right, I can honestly put my hand on my heart and say I did try my best - my very best - to do the right thing by the Irish people.  Of course, I apologise for my mistakes but I am also pleased that I did get a lot of things right.</p><p>The winds of the greatest international recession since 1929 did batter our country after my departure but now, as that storm abates, it will become increasingly clear that a lot of the progress the Irish people made in the first decade of the 21st century, such as modernising infrastructure, investing in our roads, schools and hospitals has not been washed away.  I make these points not to take away from the fact that Government has had to do Trojan work in recent times and that the Irish people have endured many sacrifices in a national battle for economic and social stability.  I want to conclude by saying I respect the work done by my successor, Brian Cowen, and the late Brian Lenihan.  I also admire the efforts of the current Government and I think the Taoiseach, Minister Noonan and Minister Howlin have shown a lot of commitment and courage in tackling the financial crisis.  I think one of the lessons we should all take from the crisis is that, maybe, our politics needs to be less partisan and that, as a small island, we should pull together.  The last few years have been extremely tough on many ordinary families and that breaks my heart, but the work of our democratic political system must prevail and the problems we faced on a massive scale of unemployment, emigration and the banking crisis are on track to being resolved.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, can I just invite you to look at a table that I'm going to bring up?  It comes back to your own testimony with regard to indicators and this shows a huge increase in public service allocations between the years 2000 and 2008, a plus 141% in total expenditure, which was precisely double the growth in GDP over the same period.  So what you see there is under the headings of social welfare, education, health, capital investment, total expenditure and GDP, the measurements are there and the figures are as outlined.  Can I also bring to your attention another graph that will come up, where when you combine it with the statistics on the parallel major growth in construction-related lending, the bottom, kind of, amber-beige line is standard lending or other lending and the blue line is property lending?  And you can see there on the graph it increased quite significantly from, sort of, '01 period peaking into '07-'08 quite significantly.  When you look at these two sets of figures alone, were these not enough to warn the Government that a bubble was being created?</p></speech>

I tended in my political life, as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, to look at GNP more so because of the repatriation of profits but, as you know, in the European Council or in ECOFIN, which I attended for many, many years, it was always GDP.  We always had to make the adjustment but, either way, while our revenues were growing, I was always conscious that we should keep our percentage right and if I recall, even on the highest year 2006 or 2007, I think only Estonia had a lower expenditure than us so ... I'd like to go on with, maybe, what a lot of people have said to this committee and say, "Well, expenditure was out of control", but I have to say, Chairman, at the time, I did not see that view because only Estonia had a higher ... and we were way lower than everywhere else.  Now, on the other chart, it was quite clear, Chairman, that the property markets - I'm sure it will come up after - but it was quite clear that the level of indebtedness and the lending to the property section was growing dangerously.</p></speech>

I've the different view on the level ... in the level of indebtedness, I'd a different view on that.  If you ask me what my view now is, it ... I probably would have battened down the hatches in 1997 and said no to everything, so, therefore, we would have had such a big surplus we would have been like Germany, we would have been able to take the whole hit.  But, I'm afraid, Chairman, I wasn't blessed with that view any time while I was in office.</p></speech>

I don't think I argued for the abolition.  Remember, there were about 24, was it, 24 different taxes.  Some of them were expensive; some of them were not.  Some of them were very beneficial; some of them were dubious whether they were or they weren't.  And the view, when Minister Cowen, and I remember him well, he was very anxious to deal with them.  It had been a departmental view, I think Mr. McNally has informed you of that, and that was the view of the Department.  But I think, as you know, Deputy, from the time a lot of the incentives came in, in the urban renewal in 1986 by the Garret FitzGerald ... the late Garret FitzGerald's Government, they were for ever being extended.</p></speech>

And the economy was still growing at 6% or 7%, so it was not easing up, which is what we wanted to see happen, particularly on the property side, but I was happy on the other side.  There were other sectors of the economy growing very strongly, even to the end, and if you look at 2008, my last period, 28,000 jobs were created.  We lost 20,000 in construction and still, just at the time I was leaving, there was a speech, I think, one of the papers, where I was talking about that, that we were actually managing still to create jobs and managing to see it slow down, the construction, and still manage it, so I still thought we could manage it through.</p></speech>

Deputy, I wanted to see it slow down.  I had broken my back from 1997 to try to get the supply side ... when I came in as Taoiseach, there was, in the Central Bank's terms, a bubble, or at least shortly afterwards.  We had moved from building 20,000 houses in 1990 to 42,000 houses when I came into office.  It was believed at that time by all the experts that we needed to get to 50,000 to take the heat out of the market.  Everything we did, and the Bacon reports and all of the other efforts that were made, were all to try and get supply up and we believed that if we got supply up, we'd get an equilibrium that would balance the situation-----</p></speech>

We know from evidence that house prices and construction started to decline in the first quarter of 2007.  Can I just talk to you about your speech at the opening of the new headquarters of Treasury Holdings on Monday, 10 December 2007?  This was an attendance, just before Christmas, with Johnny Ronan and John and Richard Barrett was there.  You talked about the outlook recognises "the difficulties facing the construction sector in the light of recent and ongoing developments in both ... international and domestic economic environments" and you go on to say, "That is why last week&rsquo;s Budget underscores the Government&rsquo;s determination to deliver ... its housing commitments under Towards 2016".  You go on to talk about how you've increased spending above 16% on the 2007 Estimates for social and affordable housing.  You go on to talk about changes in stamp duty regime that were introduced that would significantly improve ... sorry, "provide a significant stimulus to the market by boosting purchasing power generally".  You go on to say how you ... your Government, from 1 January, is increasing the ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers, for married people and also increasing income tax relief for rent payment by 11% and increasing the threshold for rent-a-room scheme and so on, "and are continuing with the generous tax reliefs for landlords investing in private rented accommodation".  You go on to say, "Taken together, these measures testify to the Government's commitment to the [continuing] development of the sector".  Now, is this not you telling a number of developers and whoever else was there that the Government are intent in trying to reflate a property bubble that had already bust?</p></speech>

What we did in the budget of 2007 for 2008, we made a number of changes to try to help first-time buyers.</p><p>We wanted to keep economic growth going and to keep it strong.  And we wanted to stimulate the economy as much as we could to keep it strong.  I don't think we made too many changes that would have made too much difference to most of the developers.  And, of course, at that stage we did know since August 2007, once the liquidity problems did start in the banks, that life was getting more difficult.  And it did get more difficult but it was based on liquidity.  At no stage in those months up to that budget was anybody saying that the bubble was going to bust.  And in the discussions around the budget of 2007, or the budget of 2008 in November, October-November, nobody was talking about the bubble busting. </p></speech>

You said, "This is why in last week's budget we introduced these measures."  You go on to say, "To provide a significant stimulus to the market [which is the construction market]," and you go on to say that, "These measures taken together testify to the Government's commitment to the continuing development of this sector."  You're after giving evidence saying that you wanted to see a decline in the number of house price ... or houses from 2006 on and you tried to do that.  But you're giving a different speech to Johnny Ronan and a number of others in December 2007, which is saying that your Government are introducing measures to actually boost demand at that time.</p></speech>

I disagree with the first point you made that it was only in 2007 that property started easing.  It was in 2006 and it was generally being talked about since probably the second quarter of 2006 that property was easing up.  But unemployment was building fairly rapidly in the construction industry after the summer of 2007 and into 2008.  And, you know, there were 230,000 people working in the construction industry, and that day, whoever I was talking to - I'm sure it was a well-attended function, like all other functions you'd attend as Taoiseach - it was necessary to try to keep our construction industry as strong as we could.</p></speech>

This is the year 2000.  And further measures were proposed to you personally via an internal memorandum by the assistant principal in the Department of the Taoiseach to counteract this.  One of the recommendations was to impose credit controls on lending.  Can you remember if the proposal to impose credit controls and lending via the Central Bank was further discussed with you, or considered by you?  And can you tell us why it was never introduced?</p></speech>

I've no doubt that those views went into it.  But I did meet the Central Bank Governor on a number of times.  I don't believe I raised it with him.

Mr. Ahern, in your statement, you didn't address the key line, 5D, which you were directed by the inquiry to do.  So can you now describe the main aspects of the relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il and the building and the construction industry, and give your view on the purposes and outcomes of a substantial number of formal and informal meetings with representatives and leading persons of this industry?</p></speech>

But I had a lot of dealings through the social partnership process with all of the main trade union-employer bodies and the CIF were quite a strong lobby as part of that process, as was IBEC and as were the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland, along with all the farming bodies.  So I would have had dealings with them and from time to time, and they were most of my meetings because the CIF group represented, except the House Builders Association, but I don't ... I used to have a lot of dealings with the house builders when as Minister for Finance; I don't think I had too much dealings with them when I was Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Quinn lent you his helicopter to go canvassing in Donegal at one stage and there's many other stories that appear in the media.  And, indeed, actually, one of them if I can refer to, in 2009, as part of the promotion for your autobiography that I've already mentioned, <i>The Irish Times</i>on 28 September 2009 reported on one of these interviews that you did, and it said that Mr. Ahern said:</p> <blockquote> 	...it was untrue that the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway races was full of big developers. The best year for the tent was 2005 and only 19 of the 635 people in it on the main day of the races that year, he asserts, could be classified as developers or big builders. Another 30 could be considered builders &ldquo;and the rest are the fellas you&rsquo;d get in to do a small job on your house&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>So, now we know from the Nyberg report, Mr. Ahern that the aggregate exposure of the top 20 customers as of 31 May, as of the time you left as Taoiseach in 2008, they had 50% of the &euro;41.7 billion loan book.  And we know from Nationwide that they had 51%, 25 of them had 21% and we know that the top 25 borrowers had &euro;25 billion between them borrowed at that time from the banks.  So, when it comes to the property-State-finance nexus in the State, are we dealing with a small number of developers, less than 30 it seems?  But you were quite precise in your interview, about the 19 big developers.  Do you have the names of those 19 big developers that attended on that one day on the Galway tent and do you want to share it with the committee?</p></speech>

So there was always that connection.  Some of them were builders; some of them were tradespeople; some of them were farmers; some of them were other.  But there was no big deal.  There was literally no big deal between the connections in the Fianna F&aacute;il tent and the construction industry.  It was a social occasion and I wish I had been able to influence maybe some of those people but I don't ... I heard your questions previously about this and you seem to have a bit of an obsession with the Fianna F&aacute;il tent, as many people have.  But it wasn't any big deal and there was no big business done.  And I assure you this, Deputy, I assure you this.  And I wish it had been different, that I had known the extent of the exposure from some of those people, and there was some of them, that they had to the banks.  Because in the last seven years, as you'd appreciate, I have had good, sensible conversations with many decent people and they believe that not alone did I know the figures but that I had the files, and that I knew exactly what every developer in this country owed and what exposure with the banks.  But the fact is, as you know, Deputy, I had none of that information because I wasn't entitled to any of that.  That's a matter under AK33, which is totally confidential and only the Central Bank and the regulator had it.</p></speech>

And we also know at the ICTU conference, unfortunately you talked about sitting on the sidelines ... people sitting on the sidelines cribbing and moaning and you unfortunately said, &quot;I don't know how people who engage in that don't commit suicide.&quot;  The reason I raise this, Mr. Ahern, is how do you reconcile that with your witness statement, with the fact that as the crisis was starting to emerge, it appears that you were quite willing to confront rather than engage with alternative views, yet your witness statement talks about listening and responding to proposals and criticisms?</p></speech>

In my entire political life, I think I've ... from the time I was Lord Mayor of this city of Dublin and through being Minister for lots of things, but particularly Labour and Finance, I spent my time giving a positive message about this country.  I travelled on trade missions.  I spoke internationally.  I did thousands of meetings talking up the benefits of our country, giving factual positions but also trying to explain all that we could do, particularly in the years ... in the bad years when ... in the late '80s and in the early ... when I was Minister for Finance when matters were very, very tight.  So I was always giving a positive message, trying to give ... if the Minister ... I used to be chairman of the committee for employment back in the late '80s and early '90s and, as Finance Minister, if I was going out giving a negative message or a downbeat message, then what hope was there for the rest of us?  I would always try to be positive.  I would always try to keep a confident message and talk about the glass being half full.  And, as you know, Deputy, in this country, an awful lot of people, even when the glass is full, want it to be half empty.  So I make no apologies for always trying to be positive and sometimes when it was difficult.  And if you ... you see in the papers that you had sent to me, many of the areas where the Department of Finance were advising their own Minister to keep it positive, because there were domestic issues.</p></speech>

In your last question you ... about can I address ... I had two very good friends who died from suicide in the '90s.  I never should have said that.  And three minutes after I came off the stage, I apologised for that.  That was just a totally wrong thing to say.  But what I was talking about that day was confidence, that yes things were getting more difficult, and was before liquidity.  But I was talking to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Donegal and I was saying "Listen, we have to have confidence, we have to have belief, we have to work together, we have to pull together."  And I'm sure you've seen that speech.  And, unscripted then I, unfortunately, said that and, of course, like lots of things in life, everyone forgets what I said in the rest of that speech.  But I think that speech was a speech of trying to give confidence and stability and I don't think there was anything wrong that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, in 2007 and 2008 there was a number of things happening.  We know from 2007, the Government was investigating possible responses to the emerging credit crisis.  At the same time, both commercial and residential properties had stalled.  In March 2008, INBS was frozen out of the wholesale markets with no access to normal ECB funding.  In March 2008, Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick was lobbying the Governor of the Central Bank for the form of ... some form of bank guarantee.  In April, the Government was working on draft legislation for a systemic guarantee and we know by September what happened.  Now, you were Taoiseach during all of this period.  You've said to the Chairperson you believe, I think, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound when you left.  Given what I'm just after saying, do you still believe that the economy was sound?</p></speech>

Because in all the discussions I had between August 2007 and up until I left, which was after the collapse of the share prices on St. Patrick's Day - St. Patrick's Day massacre as you like to refer to it - it was not ... it was about liquidity.  I got very concerned from August 2007 and I had discussed it with the Central Bank, discussed it with the Department of Finance, discussed it with many, many people outside of it as well, and the issue was about liquidity.  At no time, and I can honestly say this to you, at no time did any of the agencies or any of the officials for that matter, say "Get ready for boom or bust."  That was not what was-----</p></speech>

Anglo, I think, had ... 40% of its loan book was in property in Ireland and 40% of it in property in England and I think we had ... at 60%, we had probably the highest ... I think we had the highest ratio of lending in one sector.  So they were all different points.

And the reason, Deputy ... I could give you many examples.  I've given you a good few.  But if you looked at the growth and stability programme that was just issued at Christmas to the European Union, that Christmas of 2007, from the Department of Finance which, as I said earlier, is ... always takes ... rightly takes a conservative view, that was showing that we were going to grow by 3% to 5%, so it wasn't that I thought ... the IMF, the ESRI were all saying the same - that, yes, there was a problem but not that we were going to see a collapse.  And the figure that we're talking about in that Growth and Stability Pact figure was 50,000 to 60,000 houses and the Department of Finance said well, they thought under 50,000 was more likely.  We were not talking about down to what happened a few months later.</p></speech>

Moving forward then through to before 2007.  In an interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in November 2014, you said:</p> <blockquote> 	...competitiveness had certainly been lost for three or four years by 2007 ... Investment in residential property went to 13pc of our national output in 2006.  That's about double what it should have been.  The share of employment in construction was too high.  But the OECD didn't pick it up at the time, and from reading their reports, which I used to do, I didn't pick it up. </blockquote> <p>The 2003 OECD report said that tax incentives that boost demand in an already overheated residential market should be cut.  The 2006 report stated domestic risks were important too, of which the most prominent was the risk of overshooting housing prices, although a soft landing was considered the most likely scenario, a sharper fall could not be ruled out.

I ... but, you know, Deputy, you've been reading these things massively and I ... I admire you for all you have to do in that, but you ... you can see what they do.  They give the upsides and they give the downsides and they give conclusions, they give some criticism, they give some praise.  But I do accept what I said in that article is true.  Competitiveness, of course, is a loose term that's thrown around.</p><p>But competitiveness, when I was talking in that article and many other times that I have accepted, and this is what I do accept more so than I accept the expenditure argument, I accept that we got the competitiveness issue wrong.  Competitiveness in its broadest sense, it covers a wide range of factors, it includes productivity, quality of output, innovation, sales, marketing expertise, quality of infrastructure, and I suppose, mainly salaries.  That's what competitiveness is, and we did, I think from the period 2000 on ... miss out that we were losing market share and we were losing our competitiveness and, you know, if you were doing things differently, that issue, I would argue some of the other issues, but I think that issue I don't argue about, because I think that broad definition of competitiveness, we were letting, we were switching, we were switching from exports, which in most of my political career in Finance, I was always ... my paranoia was keep exports high, because that gave us more consumption, that gave us domestic demand.  But then we lost on the export and we moved to domestic demand and that was the mistake that we made.</p><p> If you look at what Germany did in the same period, they went the other way, gained 10% competitiveness.

Capital, we were being advised by all the organisations that that was the right thing to do, that we still had infrastructural deficits, so I think on the current side, we should have tightened up, on the capital side, 10% was high, because overall, we were working to a 5% on infrastructure, 5% of GNP.  On the current side, it was time to be getting tighter at that stage.</p></speech>

The amount of taxation that was directly related to the residential ... to property was too high ... too high and, you know, I accept responsibility for that.  I was head of Government ... 24%, almost 25% in the economy, you know ... you know, that was ghastly when you look back at it ... you see it.  On the other side, you look at what the banks did ... you know, the Nyberg report, all that happened on the banking side.  But the bit I'm not too sure of ... the international crisis that came on top of it ... talk about all the cards being played against you in one go, Chairman.  I think sometimes we forget ... internationally ... just the extent of what was happening worldwide in those few months.  Rightly so, we looked at what was happening in Ireland and how it was effecting us and the banks ... and ... but look at what was happening worldwide, the extent of the investment bank system ... the banking system put the world under ... to get that on top of our problems ... I'm not defending our problems.  I've said the two vulnerabilities that were there - one I take for responsibility for, I take no responsibility - none - for what was happening in the Central Bank or in the Financial Regulator because I had no knowledge or control over it, despite what people think and accuse me of.  But the international hit ... the international hit was just massive and I think that ... to, kind of, say that had nothing to do with it does ... I'm not ... if I was here with him, I had have an argument with him but he's not.  But I just think that is too harsh a statement and I would like be able to argue that point with him.</p></speech>

And then, just about mistakes that you think were made by your successors in government in the Department in Finance ... if you thought any mistakes were made?  Because again, from that same interview in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in November 2014, when you were asked about the pressure that Jean-Claude Trichet was putting on Brian Lenihan, you said:</p> <blockquote> 	The reality in life is when you're around a long time, maybe the mistakes you make the first time, when you do them about the sixth time [you don't do it again].  When you're doing it the first time, it's not so easy. But that's what's called, in inverted commas, experience. </blockquote> <p>Did you feel that Brian Lenihan did not have enough experience to be the Minister for Finance and if mistakes were made, what mistakes were they?</p></speech>

I think they did their very best in the circumstances that were there.  But it wasn't easy for them.  You know both ... they ... I remember during the currency crisis the then Governor of the Central Bank saying to me that, "I was unlucky in one way and I was lucky in another", and I asked him what did he mean and it was Maurice Doyle, a very good Governor of the Central Bank.  And he said "You are unlucky to be here when there is a currency crisis to the extent and the level that it is.  But you are lucky to be here to gain the experience in this particular time" and, you know, it was that time that we had the group which afterwards, was like the domestic banking group.  During that whole currency ... the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, Sean Cromien, Michael Somers, who was head of NTMA, Maurice O'Connell who was, who was later Governor of the Central Bank, we met three, four times a week working and getting through that crisis.  So, you do ... you do, I think, Deputy, appreciate ... you gain a lot of experience from that for me to say would it have made any difference.</p></speech>

You must have seen the files."  I know you people here are experts on this issue now.

Mr. Ahern, you were a renowned constituency worker, and you had a huge reputation in that area and as somebody who had a very, very strong relationship with their constituency.  In that regard, I'd imagine that you would have had a very busy advice centre or centres during the course of your term, even as Taoiseach, not ... besides when you were a backbencher.  Did you have people coming into your constituency clinics who were saying that it was getting harder and harder to buy a home, that the affordability of buying a home was becoming beyond their reach?  We have evidence that's been before the inquiry that shows that the average house went, in a ten-year period, up ten times, and that the difficulties of getting a mortgage were going out from 20 years to 35 years, 40 years, which meant that when their child was going to university, which should be at the latter end of a 20-year mortgage, was now half, only midway through a mortgage, and these type of difficulties.  Did your constituents bring these concerns to you?  And, if they did, can you tell us how you reflected that in government then?</p></speech>

That was the reason we spent an enormous amount of time ... maybe we did too good of a job on the supply side, but ... to trying to build up supply.  It was our view, maybe mistaken, but ... that if we got the supply side right that that would solve that problem, and that we would get equilibrium and we would get the prices. to drop down.  But what did we do?  I mean, all the initiatives, the serviced land initiative, all the affordability issues we put ... I personally put a huge amount of time with the members, social partners, and trying to talk to some of the construction sectors about trying to help the affordability issue, giving State land, doing the SZC, the zoning areas in the land, trying to narrow down what were the designated taxes.  I should have said earlier, sorry, I think, when I was answering a question to Deputy Doherty, but we were attempting to narrow down the designation to try and get more affordability into the issue.  I had changed the section 23s.  I saw them one of the days when I was watching the hearing.  Section 23s; I limited that back to designated areas.  Before that a builder could get a section 23 loan anywhere.  We changed that.  I think I changed it back when I was in Finance.  And then we changed it again to bring in the integrated areas, so all the time we were trying to ... and we were trying to help on affordability.</p></speech>

But there were a ... there were a lot of reasons for this, Chairman, that, you know, in '99, if you see the ... where the curve starts going up in 1999, that's the year we made the change as well from gross to net, which meant that a person on the average industrial wage could get up to about &pound;400,000 ... or euro, we were euro then, &euro;400,000 for a mortgage.  So that one decision drove the ability of that gross to net, and the age structure when the building society extending the loans.</p><p>So, we were ... and these weren't issues that I agreed with, but they were putting pressure on us.  And back in 2005, Chairman, when the loan to value went to 100% ... I mean, the loan to value, if I can just say this, Chairman, because I think it's an important point, and I didn't hear it here but may ... I've watched as much as I could, the loan to value, when it went to 100%, the only reason a bank gave a loan to value for 100% is because they wanted the price to go up.  Because, banks don't give money to ... for no profit, and by it's very self, if you give 100% loan, and if it doesn't go up, you're making no profit.  So, by their very practice they were pushing it up.  And yet at time when we were cooling it - and we did say this, and it was said to the banks and it was said by the Department of the Environment - they were pushing this up and then it takes off again.  So there were a number, along with supply and demand, there were a number of policy decisions that were made that drove that and made it more difficult.  And the policy would have only worked if we had have started getting ... decreasing which didn't happen until 2007.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Ahern.  You have apologised for mistakes that you made during your tenure as Taoiseach and so far in your evidence what I have picked up is an acknowledgement of a mistake in terms of public spending, that it was too much, the loss of competitiveness, and I think an acknowledgement of the over-dependence on construction and property.  Are there any other areas where you believe mistakes were made, or do you believe that those are the key ones?  Is that what you're apologising for?</p></speech>

The expenditure late on.  I defended it on the percentage but I think when you go late on, definitely that wasn't a wise issue and it was wrong.  And I suppose as I said I can't ... I can't apologise for issues I hadn't got control over.  But I do apologise to myself that I didn't know about them because at least you might have been able to do something about them and in the Office of the Taoiseach you would have been able to do about that.  I mean I don't think it's good enough for the future that the data that's available to us now, about the size of loans, looking backwards, I don't think that's data that shouldn't be there on a current basis in future, because then you don't have to put names on it, but at least you would have been able to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

Of course, my defence on that, of course it was too high, can't ... can't defend that, but remember, Deputy, where we thought we were going was back to 55,000, 60,000.  And I had regularly looked at what the adjustment would be if you were going from 80, 75, I mean, I think that's in some of the papers that it's 0.5% in the short term, 1% in the longer term.  And that would have pushed up employment, but it seemed to be reasonable that, yes there would have been some unemployment in the construction industry, we wouldn't have had 230,000 people, we wouldn't have had 13.3%, we wouldn't have had investment to 16%, but it did seem sustainable, if we were on 55%, to be able to still have, cyclically, a balanced budget, or near to balance, and still not put up the debt-GDP ratio.</p></speech>

Could the Government have dictated that ... "We want a more intrusive approach"?</p></speech>

And they are allowed - both from a banking stability point of view and from a prudential point of view - to be able to deal with their own affairs exclusively.  And I think that's the situation we have.  And I know from my long experience - maybe it'll change in the future and maybe it should - but if you ask me ... my long experience dealing with governors of central banks, and I've dealt with a lot, you don't ... they will not allow you ... even if you ask a vague question or a broad question, they will not allow you inside their remit.  I'm not saying I ever tried but that is something that is guarded by them and guarded, in particular, in the European Central Bank.  When the European Central Bank were formed, they very early put down their foot and boot that they were independent and that they were going to hold this strong position into the future.  So I don't think that the political system could have done anything about that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, you've acknowledged that the property industry turned, as such, in 2006 and that you were very concerned by August 2007 about the overall economic situation.  Now, as we know, a lot of ... a lot of your time was presumably taken up with the Mahon tribunal.  Between September and December 2007 you made a number of appearances and the issue first broke in September 2006, when <i>The Irish Times</i>published an article that the tribunal was examining some issues relating to your own personal finances.  But, given that you were entering into a crisis period in government, to what extent, if any, did the backdrop of the Mahon tribunal and the amount of time that you must have had to devote to it and the worry it must have presented for you personally ... did that impact in any way on your performance as Taoiseach, on the attention which you were able to give to the issues which were emerging?</p></speech>

I, kind of, ignored the tribunal to my own detriment later because I didn't realise what the game was down there but it did not affect my job as Taoiseach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#GGG01000"><p>But in your statement on 2 April 2008 - you cited it -my reading of it is essentially the main reason why you were resigning:</p> <blockquote> 	It is a matter of real concern to me [you said] that the important work of government and party is now being overshadowed by issues relating to me at the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.<br /><br />The constant barrage of commentary on tribunal-related matters has and I believe will continue to dominate the political agenda at an important point for our country. </blockquote> <p>So it came to that point at the end where you felt you had to go because of the extent to which the Mahon tribunal was dominating political discourse.  But, in the months leading up to that, was it not also a dominant part of your life, that you were having to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

I'll just clarify it.  It didn't affect my job because I didn't give much time to it, to be honest with you, other than maybe Sunday nights or answering the endless letters I used to get from them.</p><p>But it was ... it became a daily issue, not just for me, but for my Cabinet colleagues and it was, you know ... and as I say in that statement, I think you've read a piece, where I say that it is a serious time.  There are serious economic problems and serious economic difficulties and the attention has to be on them, on those issues, not on me.  And it was the case ... I mean, I know it's natural and I don't say this as a criticism because I'll get more criticism if it's meant as that but, like, if I went out to say that there was a severe ... a serious issue on liquidity and that we need to be careful where we're going economically, the first question I was asked was not about the liquidity.  And then it became an issue that every one of my colleagues, if they went out and said it, that was the question, and that was the reason.  I had no intention other than ... those last few months.  I would have stayed on, not like some former leaders, as I said, until they were 80, but I certainly would have stayed on for another 18 months.</p></speech>

We had grown massively.  The effects of the change in the availability of cheap money.  The fact we were growing in employment so fast.  We grew from, I mean, 1.4 million, I think, when I came into office ... like, if you go back when I was chairman of the Cabinet committee 20 years ago, there was 950,000 people working.  In a very fast period, we went from 950,000 to 2.1 million.  We were growing ... in the 20-year period from '87 to 2007, we grew by about 7% a year.  You know, the scale of the budget and the economic catch-up, and then surpassing the catch-up, was just enormous.  So I think the jumps we made, and we made many of them successfully, but when you take the collective magnitude of them, it caught us in the end.  And so many of them came in that 2008 period.  There was no breaks, and that's why I'd a lot of sympathy for my colleagues when I was gone, because never could I see a situation where so many things, where the investment banks of the world, the banks were falling all over the place - big banks, big institutions that were there for generations - and all of that coming against what we had achieved, it was just too big and that's ... so it wasn't any one thing.  It wasn't that there was, you know, there was tax designations and there was tax breaks or that we were just ... you know, we were building too much.  It was ... just wasn't one thing; it was the collective enormity of probably seven or eight of those things coming together and ... as they did, all in 2008.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Ahern.</p><p>Firstly, can I ask you: in the late 1990s capital gains tax and profits from land sales was reduced to 20% to boost supply in the residential rental market.  When it became apparent that land prices had soared due to speculative demand for housing in the years between 2003 and 2008, was there consideration given to increasing capital gains tax?</p></speech>

It was considered at the time that it was a beneficial thing to do because the rules were streamlined as well.  As you know, there was a huge amount of legislation and regulation governing capital gains but from the time it came down until the crisis, I don't think there was consideration given.</p></speech>

And as well, as you know, it was a very cumbersome system, there were all kind of ... it was a great business for accountants at the time, ducking and diving around the legislation and the laws around the capital gains, so Minister McCreevy, who was very familiar with it, thought this was a ... a straightforward way of doing it.  You'd reduce the taxes but also simplify the whole regulation ... regulations around it.  And then, I'm not sure about the ... if capital gains obviously would have brought in more revenue.  To be frank, I think that, I wonder would it have been better for us if, when I amended ... I mean there was a property tax issue there from the '80s and I changed it again in '92-'93, and then it was decided not to pursue it and then we didn't ... when I came in I didn't pursue it either.  I think it would have been better if we had kept a property tax there.  That would have been more effective to be honest with you.</p></speech>

I'd ... I'd have to say my self-proclaimed socialist principles haven't changed either but I think we should have kept a property tax.  It would have ... that from '93 ... because, of course, the Department of Finance idea was to bring it in at a certain rate and then to change it and I did that in '93.  It would have made more sense to keep that there because it would have been a good revenue buffer and it might have simplified things too.</p></speech>

When we were building 88,000 houses in 2008, affordability was a bigger issue.  I think the affordability, it just ... it kept on creeping up.  I mean we had the initiative in the social partnership of 15,000 affordable houses but in the '98 - '99 period, that's when it really crystalised, and the Chairman is correct in this, where you had ... it's always the example when the teacher was marrying the nurse, you know, or maybe the nurse marrying the teacher but - politically correct - but it, it was that they couldn't afford a house, even taking their salaries in.  The response to the lenders that time was to change it from gross to net.  Now that substantially increased the amount of the mortgage that they could get.  I'm not sure that was a good idea, but anyway it, it helped at the time.  And then they increased, immediately afterwards, the 25.  Twenty-25, 20 was the regular at that time, there was very few on 25, they switched that up.  But I think that ... that was the affordability issue, which I distinguish totally from the other issue.</p></speech>

I don't know where it took place, inside or outside of a tent ... but, on 2 August 2000 ... by a Mr. Michael Walsh, who was a senior person in lending, I think, in EBS, in relation to the introduction of the SSIA scheme.  And it was followed up by a detailed letter from the chief executive of EBS at the time, Pat O'Reilly, on 29 August, in which he referenced the meeting that had taken place between Minister McCreevy at the time and Mr. Walsh.  What was your own view with regard to the introduction of the scheme?  Were you involved in its drafting?  And were you aware that, at least from the documents we've seen, the genesis of it seems to have been in race week in Galway in 2000?</p></speech>

One, it would take money out of the system, take heat out of the system, and, you know, disposable incomes were far higher.  And, as well as that, it was a good thing for a new generation of people</p></speech>

Oh, I liked to have savings schemes.  Now, I think Deputy McCreevy said he thought it all up himself, and nobody else thought about it.  Well, you know, maybe so.  I'm not claiming that I thought it up, but there were a lot of people talking about it at the time, so if he wants sole rights of inventing it, I'll give them to him, but I think there were a lot of people talking about a savings scheme, and that this was a way of taking inflationary pressures out.  And I did agree with it.  Okay, you'll say, the only downside, I suppose, which we didn't know at the time, was that the very time when people were maturing their saving and were going out into the system, that, maybe was when you didn't need the heat that was there.  But, you know, I don't think that was seen at the time.</p></speech>

And in the D&aacute;il, more than anything, the issue of affordability was a major issue.  And that group of developers came with a number of ideas about how it could help and they had ideas about getting land or ... you know, in areas in the greater Dublin area where the biggest problem was ... where there were big ... the old corporation schemes, council schemes, where there was land and that if ... a lot of these areas were causing social problems.  That if the land ... if the local authority would give it to the developers, they could build houses which the local authority then could give to people on the local authority list who wanted to buy houses.  So it wasn't a bad idea or if the State would give land where they ... so you'd take ... and part of the reason for that, as you know, Chairman, in the late 90s the cost of land was about 13% of a price of a house and it went up to about close enough to 25% of the price of a house.  So it was a big factor on affordability.  In fact, many of the economists at the time were saying that we should be looking at the land issue as much as any other issue.  But that's what that meeting was about ... it was particularly they advocating that they had a social conscience and they would play ball to try to help to deal with the either social-affordable housing.

Mr. Ahern, you're welcome.  There were two reports, Indecon and Goodbodys, and they outlined the effects and the costs for the State for the property tax incentives in February ... and they were published in February '06.  Indecon reports stated "extremely high-cost and wasteful mechanism to achieve objectives", and recommended an immediate end to tax breaks for student accommodation, multi-storey car parks and hotels.  Can you outline the costs and/or benefits or were there benefits, in relation to these tax incentives prior to the reports?</p></speech>

There was always this issue about ... which I used to argue with Finance about the issue of tax foregone.  The reports show the costs, I think, and you know the tax ... the incentives were around from '86 on.  I mean, the whole concept of that in 1986 was that the ... it was an ... it came from an American scheme, the urban renewal.  It came from American cities where there were ... where they were looking at old docklands and old rundown areas and then it moved to the dockland in England, the Isle of Dogs and all these places.  Now they're very ... very expensive parts of Canary Wharf, isn't it, where the troubles were?  And you know, that ... that's were the designation concept came.  Then it came into us here, too.  It came in too broad and then there was agreement that the section 23 be changed to narrow it down.</p><p>Then it was narrowed down again, only into integrated area plans.  I worry a little bit, if I can say, Chairman, that the idea floats out that designation was given anywhere.  Like it ... in ... it had to be an integrated area plan specified by the local authority to an area where they considered there was extremely high deprivation and were money wouldn't otherwise come.  Like, in the old days, when section 23 was there, you got the same tax benefit if you built in Howth or Foxrock as you did for my constituency.  So nobody built in my constituency.  So when it was narrowed down, that's where the whole thing came from.  And, yes, there was a cost.  Now, Finance used to say - now, Finance do a good job and I was always pro-Finance and I liked Finance when I was there, I'd a great time - but they would say, "That's a tax forgone".  But if somebody has &euro;10 million to invest and they invest it into a deprived area, a development into the designated areas as we did; yes, there was a tax on it but if they put it into some other country ... and remember &euro;10 billion ... &euro;10 billion, which is a big figure even today, was going out of this country per annum into developments in other countries.

In evidence previously, in evidence yesterday, actually, Mr. McCarthy, your Secretary General, said he didn't read the financial stability reports.  In previous evidence, Ministers - your Ministers for Finance, Minister Cowen and McCreevy - both also clearly stated that they didn't have any handle in terms of the commercial real estate sector, in terms of Anglo Irish Bank.  You said previously today that you looked at the deficit and income and expenditure when you were preparing for budgets.

I think I had a reputation, and it's well known within officialdom, if not politically, that I used to read a huge amount of documentation, so I tended to ... I tended to read, because of my Finance days, and I'd been dealing with finance issues from the time I came into government in '87, because I worked with the then Minister for Finance on the social partnership arrangements, so we ...

Dan McLaughlin has said that was the sector that collapsed the banks.  Your Ministers for Finance, both of them, have said they didn't know what was going on in commercial real estate sector or with Anglo.  Your Secretary General said he didn't even read the reports.

Like, I'd have to tell you this, and I don't want not to say it because it wouldn't be honest, like, there were 750 people in the Central Bank, or Central Bank-regulator.  When I was in Departments, staffs were small enough.  Finance was hard-pressed.  I thought there were loads of these people and I thought they had loads of time to be checking this and reading this and reading that.  And then I see that if you take the main five banks they've about 15 or 20 is all that was supervising.  I was horrified when I saw that, horrified.</p></speech>

You said you read the financial stability reports, and you can ... if you can bring them up, the '04, '05, '06 and '07, which was the final report, and I've pursued this line with other witnesses.  In 1997 the level of household indebtedness was 71% of GDP.  In 2007, the final FSR report, the level of indebtedness had gone to 248%, highest in the OECD.  And you said, as you were preparing for budgets, you were there to protect the budget and put in place an expenditure programme but who was supposed to protect the citizens when there was over-borrowing to that degree that we were, that the citizens of this country-----</p></speech>

I think there's sometimes, even now, now, even today there's an over-concentration of what happened - I'm not talking about the committee, I'm just talking about the debate - in the residential side.  I mean, look what happened in the commercial property side.  I mean, there was where the madness really took place, where it zoomed from nearly nothing to extraordinary increases, with no collateral behind the individuals that had it, to the property was all over the world.  It was doled out like confetti or snuff at a wake, right?</p><p>And, that ... I think, that was a bigger issue.  Now, who should have seen it?  Well, the job ... it was the job of the regulator.

The Chairman, earlier, stated that there was a period in '05 ... a lot of witnesses have said there was a period in late '05, early '06, that if steps had been taken, that the downturn here wouldn't have been as severe.  But anything beyond that, it was only a question of how severely the downturn was going to be.

In the early times, that was probably seen as a good thing.  You know the old "neither borrower nor lender be" but that went out the door and really the banks moved to a position where they could get without exchange risks ... I mean in the old days, when I was in Finance, the exchange only went at that stage, so it was a very tight position and it was not just because of borrowing and lending because it was the exchange regulations.</p></speech>

It says, in the article, the then Minister for housing, Noel Ahern, spoke of Irish housing, &quot;banks and financial institutions of 'greed' and 'reckless behaviour' and of 'hyping up' the property market with 100% mortgages and interest [rates]&quot; - I am quoting continually here:</p> <blockquote> 	Despite the record supply of new homes in 2004 and 2005, Ahern said the prices of houses was likely to increase by more than 10% again this year.  &quot;The rampant competition from market share between financial institutions is one of the factors why all predictions for house prices have been wrong.  They are creating a false demand which developers are cashing in on,&quot; the minister said.  [I am just going to finish now in a second.]  The banks hyped it up at a time when everything was going well.  It's all about market share. </blockquote> <p>It goes on, in the same article it happens to say where the regulator, Mr. Liam O'Reilly, chief executive of the Financial Regulator, &quot;had warned that 100% mortgages were niche products that should not be marketed at a mass audience&quot;.  It goes on significantly from that.  You would have been aware, not least of the role of the other Deputy Ahern at the time of his role as Minister for housing, that these were valid concerns and how right he seems to have turned out to be.  What actions would have been taken or what was your view of his views at that time, which, as we have heard from Senator D'Arcy was still at least to some people's minds within a timeframe that action could have been taken to usefully reduce our exposures?</p></speech>

The one that was always alight was the 100% loan-to-value scheme, it wasn't the only one, there were other ones.  He believed strongly - or his Department - that prices were decreasing at that stage and there was stability in the system and at least they were getting to some stability in the system and that this was going to hype it up again.</p><p>And the Minister of housing and his officials felt very strongly about this and they wrote to the regulator and they wrote to the Central Bank, I think, and the Department and they made quite an issue about it over that summer.  And to the best of my recollection, there were a number of meetings held between the Department of housing and the regulator at that stage about those issues.  There were guarantees being given.  I know about ... that the 100% loans weren't that much, though I saw in some of the correspondence I think you sent me that in ... there's one stage it's mentioned that, in 2006 or 2007, there was 100% ... or a third of the loans were given out on the 100%.  So there wasn't much control over that.  But the view was, their view, that it was only to be used in very isolated ways.  But the Minister of housing - it happened to be my brother at that stage - felt very strongly that this was a disaster, that they were hyping it and going against the trend of where we should be.  But he wrote and there were meetings and it was followed through and-----</p></speech>

Would it have made a huge difference?  I think it would have made some difference, I'm not saying it would have ... but it certainly ... the banks were looking for market share and I think I said, in reply to the Chairman earlier on this afternoon, the very fact that they gave 100% loan-to-values, or anything near it, meant that they were speculating against an increase.  Because you don't give 100% with no guarantee because you were going to make no profit for the banks unless you believed that the price was going to go up.  So his point, his central point, and that of his officials - because I know there were a lot of letters and documentation at the time about it - was that this was hyping the price.</p></speech>

I think we were very responsible.  You asked me, in hindsight, if I knew that when there was a hole in the budget would we, as Germany did ... built up a surplus that you would deal with that difficulty.  Of course, in hindsight, you would do that.  But each year I, and Ministers, and I think the country ... economic analysis of Ireland ... remember we were held up as the model worldwide for a long time, that we were doing the right thing.</p></speech>

Did you make any plans to deal with the, "Well, what if some of those do come to pass?"  Or, did you read them and make a decision to keep going?</p></speech>

I was always concerned that, as we chased supply ... and all our efforts were to try to deal and build enough houses to deal with the demand that was there, that was the right thing to be doing ... supply.  When it went over that figure, I was concerned.  Like, when we went to 65,000 - whatever it went, 65,000, 77,000, and 88,000; I think they were the three years - I was very concerned about that because I couldn't understand why the sustainable level that all these reports had been telling me for years would have been between 50,000 and 60,000.  Now, I did discuss that and I remember being told that I didn't factor in the supply side correctly, because between 2004 and 2006 the population went up 300,000.  So if you factored in that, the 55,000 would go up.  And that was a credible enough answer, in fairness.</p></speech>

I think you have these documents, DOF03151.  This was a briefing document ... so I'm assuming that these would have been briefing documents you would have known about.  The Department was saying, &quot;We are now factoring a &euro;2 billion shortfall in taxes but have not publicised this as yet.&quot; [this is May 2008]  &quot;This represents a significant worsening of the position for this year, with serious consequential impacts for next year.&quot;  And then it goes on to say in relation to the banks:</p> <blockquote> 	There's a virtual cessation of normal wholesale lending activity.  There is general negative international sentiment against Ireland.  The concerns that initially led to credit markets seizing up last August are persisting.  Major financial institutions continue to disclose major write-downs. </blockquote> <p>So these were the briefing notes passed between Departments at this point.  What does that tell you about the state of the economy as you closed the door and left?</p></speech>

I think the entire second half, maybe even the three quarters of 2007, houses ... the number of houses, and, thereby, the revenues, were going down.  It was showing that we were going to be stretched in 2008 and all the reports show that.  But equally, as I said earlier on, even in the growth and stability pact of December 2007, the Department of Finance, which would have been going to Brussels in January 2008, the Department of Finance were indicating that we would grow 3% in 2008 and 3% in 2009.</p></speech>

I believed that the place was in good order but that we had problems and the problems were the liquidity.  We had that ... while houses were coming down, that didn't upset me, but we were still going to grow by 3% and 5%, and, as I said before, in 2008, even though we lost 28,000 jobs in construction, which was because of the houses coming down ... sorry, 20,000 jobs ... we were able to take all of those up in financial services.  So we were still managing to deal effectively with what was the turn down in houses.  And that was my view maybe until the summer.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, under the terms of reference of the banking inquiry, one of the issues that has to be looked at is the role of the Oireachtas in the matter of regulatory and supervisory systems and practices.  During your term as Taoiseach, do you believe that Oireachtas committees were structured so as to have sufficient authority to effectively examine financial matters, fiscal matters or regulatory matters?</p></speech>

And, I think, one of the advantages of the committees is that they can call people in and they can discuss it but, as you recall, Deputy, there were very ... there was very little debate on these issues in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#XXX03000"><p>And, Mr. Ahern, issues that witnesses at this inquiry have identified as causing the inflation of a major property bubble - and then which caused a major crash - for example, exponential increase in lending by banks, particularly in property, major speculation and profiteering in building land and rocketing house prices, can you remember being challenged, either by committees of the Oireachtas or even in the Houses of the Oireachtas in a significant way on any or all of these issues that caused you to have serious pause for thought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#XXX03100"><p>No.  No.  On the issue the Chairman raised earlier on about affordability of housing and the inability of the ordinary, you know, Joe and Mary to be able to get their mortgage and to be able to get a house ... on the affordability issue, that was raised, you know, probably every week in questions.</p><p>But on the banking issues or you know the ... the major issues as they turned out to be ... very little, issues about speculation ... land speculation, the land issue.  As you know, I was pressed in the House to go back and look at land prices when it was showing that land prices had moved from 12% of the cost of house to 25%, to go back and look at the housing report names ... the Kenny report of years earlier and I did that.  I spent a considerable amount of time with the then Attorney General looking to see what could we do short of a constitutional referendum on property rights, which we weren't very anxious to get engaged in.  So that issue was raised a lot.</p></speech>

You may remember, in 2004, it was raised in the Oireachtas, where a syndicate of rich people had bought 11 acres of building land in Stillorgan only four years before, had got planning permission and then sold it for a gain of &euro;32 million, and your Government had reduced corporation ... capital gains tax to enrich them further.  Why didn't you take action to stop that type of profiteering and speculation?</p></speech>

I mean, you're correct in was there an anti-speculation tax to stop that?  There wasn't but what we had been endeavouring to do from 1997 on was to try to get more land and to try and streamline the difficulties there were to try and get more land built on, not zoned, because there was more than adequate land zoned.  But it was to try to get into a situation where we would have more building where we could get supply up.  And we were very active in doing that.  But because the prices kept going up ... were developers making more money on that?  Of course, they were.</p></speech>

Establish the relationship and then make the question.</p></speech>

But I don't believe that in trying to build supply and trying to get more houses built ... yes, you could say you're encouraging builders to build more houses because we had to move from a situation where we'd 40,000 houses to 60,000 houses or 55,000 houses.  But it was our position to try and get more and more supply.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern ... two issues in regard to that.  Ms Elaine Byrne in evidence to this inquiry, found that between 1997 and 2007, of the &euro;1.8 million donated to Fianna F&aacute;il, and anything &euro;5,000 or under did not have to be notified, but of what was notified, 35% or &euro;635,970, was from property and construction interests.  Is that not significant?  And, secondly, did tribunals show the corruption of councillors, some from your party, by property and developer interests, who were bribed by these profits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071600002#YYY00800"><p>It did.  And that is a matter of record.  But I don't believe that anything we were trying to do as a Government, other than trying to encourage supply, was wrong.  We had to get to ... house prices, or the demand for houses were going up for many reasons; people had more money, people had jobs, the demographics of the country.  We were ... we'd only 1.1 million houses at one stage, we got it up to 1.9 million houses.  But even at that, <i>pro rata</i>against other countries we hadn't got enough of houses.  So what happened was too much of it came together.  But I don't think we were wrong in the early years, in particular, to try to get up supply.</p></speech>

You don't take responsibility for alleged perhaps ... whatever, in that regards.  But I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that you have to take responsibility for this reason; that you launched the Better Regulation in 2004 and in your foreword it's quite clear that regulation was to be subordinated to allowing the banks to have sharp competition for profits.  And, secondly, can I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that in a speech to the Irish Bankers' Federation in March 2006 and the federation of international bankers, you said the following, "I know that your industry is bottom line driven and I can assure you that the Government is very conscious of its role in assisting you to maintain a healthy bottom line."  So the points that I would ask you to comment is this; that you were a main sponsor of light-touch regulation which allowed them to do what they did and not only that, but this shows that you were encouraging their profiteering.</p></speech>

The document of 2004 was for good regulation, for better regulation, based on the OECD efforts at the time that countries should not be regulating in areas that were not necessary and that for poor regulation which was affecting economic progress and stability of economies.  So there was no ... the principles that were laid out in the better Government regulations or was entirely different.  So I think the purpose that you've put on it is just misleading it, either intentionally or deviously.  What was your second question?</p></speech>

I did ... I ... though, at times, I'd be a bit like yourself.  I think nationalising banks mightn't be a bad idea, but even if you were ... they were nationalised, they'd need to be profitable so I wasn't against the banks making a profit.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, you said in your opening speech page 2:</p> <blockquote> 	The main economic problems facing Ireland in the mid-1990s were high unemployment, net emigration, relatively low incomes and the need for increased productivity.  A decade later these problems were substantially solved. </blockquote> <p>And then you said Mr. Ahern in page 19, reminding younger Members of the Oireachtas, when you came to the House in '77:</p> <blockquote> 	National debt was an unsustainable millstone ... 20 % of all taxes raised in the State were used to service the national debt.  In 2007, my last full year as Taoiseach, that figure stood as low as 4.3%. </blockquote> <p>Can I put it to you, Mr. Ahern, that it would be delusional to think that that, or to allow that, or hope that that would be your legacy, when the gigantic property bubble which happened on your watch, created a situation where a few years later, you had the return of precisely the evils that you described of unemployment, mass emigration and a huge national debt and 20% currently, unfortunately, of taxes going to service that debt?</p></speech>

Unemployment ... but thankfully we didn't go back to where we're going.  We're back at 9% now and in fairness to the current Government, this year's current budget deficit will be down to 2.5%.  It's going to take us a while to get the debt-GDP ratio down.  But, Deputy, I have to say if the corrective action over many, many years was not taken to decrease what was a very, very high debt, we would have been in a really difficult position.  I do accept that some of the very good indicators that I'd worked most of my political life to achieve were badly reversed.  I accept that.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, the programme for Government and social partnerships created a need to finance pre-agreed commitments from available revenues.  Can you discuss the extent to which, in your opinion, such long-term political commitments influenced and constrained the Government's budgetary decisions?</p><p>And I'm referencing, Chairman, page 101 Vol. 3, and also page 81, Vol. 3.  So page 101 initially, which is from the Wright report.  And that's, basically ... Mr. Wright basically says:</p><blockquote>	... the Programme for Government and Social Partnership processes helped overwhelm the budget process.  Instead of providing an appropriate fiscal framework for [privatisation] of competing demands [prioritisation, rather,] ... the Budget essentially paid the bills for these dominant processes.  Relatively clear advice to Cabinet in June on the risk of excessive spending and tax reductions was lost by the time of December Budgets. </blockquote><p>And specifically figure 26, on page 81, encapsulates this and that's really, I suppose, what I want to ask Mr. Ahern about.  Can you explain, first of all, you continually speak about taking responsibilities for the areas that you're responsible for.  Do you take responsibility for the budgets in your time as Taoiseach?</p></speech>

Can you explain why in all the budgets, we'll say, between 1999 and 2008, the amount that gave rise, the actual budget day outcome, the amount that was spent in the budget itself, was significantly more in many years than the actual document, the fiscal framework, that was presented to the Cabinet by the Minister of Finance in June?</p></speech>

Just one matter I just want to deal with in general with regards to Mr. Cowen's testimony and then just an item that comes back to your earlier comment there, Mr. Ahern.  In a statement to the banking inquiry, Brian Cowen discussed the announcement of the restructuring of tax incentives to the end of 2005 stating:</p> <blockquote> 	This decision did not gain favour with many interested parties in the property market.  It also represented a decisive policy shift, because over a long period, successive Governments since 1985 had added more new property incentives rather than engage in wholesale abolition of existing incentives.. </blockquote> <p>Would you interpret this remark as a criticism of your role in Government over the proceeding years?</p></speech>

I think the Minister wanted to bring an end to the incentives.  He was right to bring an end.  As we have said, it went too high.  When it went over 50,000, the number of houses being built too high and anything that created ... that led to that had to be looked at.  And one of the big issues that he believed was the property incentives.</p></speech>

And what you will see there is how cyclical taxes, by the late 1990s, were in around 15% or so, or just maybe a little bit above it.</p><p>And by 2006 had rose to 30%.  They had doubled in that period of time.  So that would be the total tax take of corporation tax, capital gains tax, but in particularly it relates to stamp duties and other cyclical tax measures.  Would you consider that to be a proportionate or disproportionate percentage of the tax take in terms of tax balance? </p></speech>

So even in regards to your earlier comments that there was a banking crisis coming down the tracks, was there not also a fiscal crisis coming down the tracks?  Because these were what might in layperson's terms be called consumption taxes, and as soon as the economy slowed down consumption would stop, and cyclical taxes would stop with it.</p></speech>

Neither did I believe ... I think in 2012 that came down to 11%.  As I said earlier on, the judgment was that we would have to correct somewhere from 55,000 to 88,000 which was the figure that everybody gave.  We couldn't have controlled the situation of bringing it from 88,000 to 8,000 which is what happened, but that was never a consideration because we never believed we'd have to make that correction.  Unfortunately, that correction had to be made ultimately.</p></speech>

So we had that expenditure running ahead of GDP, we had this massive cyclical tax thing, we had a difficulty in the banking section.  But would you have a view that Ireland's crisis was not ultimately a banking crisis in isolation, that there was a cyclical tax crisis that was coming down the tracks, or not?</p></speech>

But the position, Chairman, at the time, and I know your committee knew ... I've heard you several times saying you're anxious to know what the state of mind was at the time, and what the state of mind is now.  But if I could give you at the time: at the time was 30% of unsustainable taxes was too high, but the proportion of what we believed would be sustainable was something building about 30,000 ... 55,000 houses.  And it was ... if you take it that roughly 1% per 10,000 houses, we were talking about an adjustment, on the budgetary side, of 3%, or maybe 3.5%, which we believed was totally sustainable, and that the employment effect would have put up employment up to 7%.  And what I've said in my statement, not to dwell on it, but what the ESRI pointed out, where they saw the vulnerabilities, and they were quite critical, and a very good organisation, and their independence I accept and admire and worked under for many years, but they looked at what the period was by 2005 to 2010, and 2010 to 2015, and they were looking at even a less tough hit.

I suppose the fiscal group is what's now perceived as an independent group to do that.

It's a report by Maynooth; it'll come up on the screen if ... or I think you have the hard copies: "What the data reveal is a pattern of development that ran counter to what one would have expected or hoped for - those local authorities that had the most vacant stock in 2006, subsequently built the most new housing, now have the highest surpluses of stock and have the most land zoned for future use."  So, a gross policy of housing, you know, had all those defects which that report from Maynooth, which is in your volume, show.  Could we have targeted it better?</p></speech>

I mean, I wouldn't sign my name to their ... to the report.  I don't accept that local authorities, just to get levies, property levies, started zoning houses all over the country.  I wouldn't accuse local authorities of doing that, or members of local authorities of doing that.  But, yes, I suppose the end result is that, for the next number of years, we have enough of ... the zoning of the land wasn't the problem, but, even in the height because there ... I think many of the reports had shown that there was sufficient zoned land around.  What there wasn't was sufficient serviced land.  As you recall, Senator, the amount of effort we had to put in in the early years, '97 to 2001, in getting the necessary infrastructure, not just transport infrastructure, but the North Fringe, which was responsible for zoning about 370 hectares of land in north County Dublin just to try to ... and in several other places as well.  and there was a lot of capital expenditure in those years put in to service land that was actually zoned so that housing could be built.

I mean, in the end of the day, a lot of this was about risk and they had to have been taking the banking figures that ... you know, right up until the end, Senator, the banks were, when they were being asked questions by the regulator, and I criticised the regulator earlier on, but when they were asked questions by the regulator, they were standing over their figures.  They were saying, "These are net worth individuals.  These individuals don't have difficulties", and, even when there was collateral changes between one bank and another, the banks were defending that.  All's I can assume is that the auditors must have been accepting that the capital that the banks had said they put aside to cover those loans was adequate.</p><p>As we all know, and you know in this committee better than anybody, they were far from that.</p></speech>

I mean, but to do that, which I think the banks should pay for ... I mean, I think the banks should pay a levy on their profitability for evermore, based on the necessity of the banks being able to employ the experts that they require.  I mean, if you take in these years or in the other years we're talking about, the profitability of the individual banks was massive.  They were considered to be the most profitable banks in the European Union.  And, still, in the regulatory system, which I didn't know - and, okay, people think you should know everything - but that there was only a handful of people regulating them and the auditors didn't have the ... well, then there has to be another system.  There has to be a way where that information is given - either the regulator has far more power and has the power to be able to do it.

Mr. Ahern, between 1998 and 2000, Mr. Peter Bacon recommended in his reports ... Dr. Bacon ... at the end of a certain property-related tax ... sorry, recommended in his reports an end to certain property-related tax incentives.  In December 2001 you and your Finance Minister announced the unwinding of some of the implemented changes.  This related, in particular, to the reduction of stamp duty and tax deductibility of interest for investors.  Mr. Bacon, when he was before this committee, told us that he was not consulted before these measures were taken and maybe you can discuss with us this afternoon why he wasn't consulted and who was consulted with regard to these measures and these decisions being taken.</p></speech>

But it was a decision taken by the Minister for Finance.  I was consulted.  The ... I think Peter Bacon stated at the committee that they were done ... that the changes were done too soon and, you know, I wouldn't argue with him in that.  I accept that.  But the reason, Chairman, was that while the prices stabilised for period, the rent zoomed up.  The rent of apartments and flats went up something like 85% in a relatively short period.  And I recall well, because I live in the city, before the university students came back, there was an outcry by the students union, by the way, as there is now - they've posters up around the city again asking for landlords to give them ... if anyone wants to let their property to get on to them - because the rents were going through the roof.</p><p>And a third ... people tend to think, okay, it was the immigrants, they can pay a bit higher rents because they're working or it was people in jobs, but a third of the people in private accommodation, in landlord accommodation are supplementary welfare cases - they are people on social welfare.  So it wasn't some abstract thing that it didn't ... it didn't matter, it was the ... it was ... the people were suffering most from some of these changes were the poorest people in society.  And I represented a lot of those poor people and I was, you know, very conscious that we were hammering ... because the supplementary welfare officers wouldn't give the increases and Joe Public, who was in rental accommodation, was being screwed.  So ... like, when the model and the theory was ... and I'd a lot of regard for Peter Bacon ... might have said one thing, the effect of it was hammering people who were at the bottom and that's why we changed it. </p></speech>

I think the general figure was there was about &euro;1 billion going into rent supplement at its peak, and one could put forward a proposition that the buy-to-let investor had a very, very preferential mortgage compared to the home buyer because the interest rate rebate that they were getting were better than the home buyer.  So the State, through one measure and another, was assisting the buy-to-let purchaser to purchase the property and was also putting &euro;1 billion in the other side to help the person to actually rent the property.  Would you have any comment on that?</p></speech>

Well, I think you're right, but the wizards in the IMF and the OECD, by the way, say we shouldn't be building any social housing, we should be doing it all through buy-to-let properties and that that's the way we should be dealing with social housing, which I entirely disagree.  But, yes, we were subsidising it and no doubt the taxpayer was subsidising it.</p></speech>

If you look there at quarter ... it's quarter 1, 2001 to quarter 1, 2002.  The ... this is the period in which the Bacon report measures are implemented and we see there was a significant increase in property prices and then it plateaus and even begins to drop somewhat over that annualised period.  Then we see the removal of the measures and we see house prices escalating very, very rapidly right up until 2007, both in the blue line, which is the new house prices, and in the red line, which is in the second house price market ... coming back to our earlier discussion of today with regard to affordability.  Given an examination of that graph, did the removal of those Bacon measures make house prices more unaffordable for people on average incomes?  These are average house prices.</p></speech>

But the reason ... the main reason was the increase in rents.  I mean, that's why it was changed.  I mean, I've seen somewhere that there was lobbies ... and there were lobbies maybe about the stamp duty but the rents astronomically increased in that period.  What we're looking ... I've no problem with the graph and I accept that the graph ... but I'd like to see what the graph showing the rents.</p></speech>

If they're cohabiting there's another income, and that's done over a 20-year period.  But the calculation for rents historically has also been about the ... 12 times the value of the property.  So it would work ... there was a calculation process there, so if the price of a house went up, rent would go up as well as ... because if I was purchasing a house in the morning in the buy-to-let market, as a second-hand house, the valuation of that, usually, would be a multiple of an annual rent by 12.  So if I was paying &euro;10,000 a year in rent, I would multiply that by 12 and the house should be worth about &euro;120,000.  That was the old sort of model as well.</p><p>So on that basis, because house prices were going up, it was inevitable that rent was going to go up because it was actually tied in with price.</p></speech>

It's the period of stabilisation of the price is when the rent zoomed.  So what happened was there was a direct transfer in that period from ... the escalating price of the residential stopped, we had equilibrium for a while, but the rent zoomed and Joe Public who was in a rented accommodation, including a third of them who were on supplementary welfare allowance, were screwed and that's the fact.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the affordability issue, now, as we spoke about earlier and that's affordability of mortgage loans in terms of home buyers as opposed to buy-to-lets.  It seemed that you related this to the ability to get a loan from the bank, as you referred to the discussion, to 100%, loan-to-values, net income calculation and also the extension of the maturities of mortgages and so forth.  Were you at any time ever worried about people being able to get a loan and were you also worried about people actually being able to repay those loans?  Because what we had was people on ... you take the ordinary industrial wage, the multiple of that person buying their home went up to ten times their income, and it was stretched out over a very, very long period.  So was the affordability ever a concern?</p></speech>

But, as I said earlier on, in 1999 when the loan-to-value changed and there were a number of changes ... 100% only came 2005.  But it went to 80%, a far more general 80%, as I think you mentioned, if not today, on another day.  There was also the gross-to-net, which I think is not to the extent focused on as it should be because that made a huge difference in the amount of the mortgage that a person on the average industrial wage and their partner, whoever ... whatever circumstances they were in, were able to borrow.  It gave a huge ... it was something like &euro;140,000 more, which was an enormous amount of money.  Like, if you were looking and, somebody goes into the mortgage person, and they've said, "No, you can't get an increase on your mortgage", and next month you come back and you can get &euro;140,000 more and you're on the same income; that's what happened.  That had a huge impact as well and I think when ... those few things coming together in '99, 2001, is what zoomed that graph up, up substantially.</p></speech>

And, in Cork, at the peak, the affordable housing had gone up to &euro;250,000.  That was subsidised housing through the State.  And mortgage approval had to be granted through three different institutions.  And so somebody who was on a social housing, affordable housing list had to go through this very technical process before they'd even be considered for one of these.  Given that people in that type of circumstance were being facilitated through and affordable home programme that was being run where subsidised housing was costing as much as &euro;250,000 back at that date, was that ever a warning sign that there is something maybe very, very difficultly and fundamentally problematic here that would have to be addressed?</p></speech>

You had to be within a certain income group to qualify for it, if ... a nurse and a guard couldn't get onto the affordable housing scheme because of their incomes.  And we were ... for people on low incomes, the scheme was actually operating on &euro;250,000 a year.  Was that not considered to be ... that there's something wrong here?</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern, you said ... you were critical of the Financial Regulator and you also said that you'd be damned to take responsibility for something that wasn't your responsibility.  And it's been put to you by Deputy Higgins that you sponsored or were aware or promoted light-touch regulation.  Given that statement, how can you wash your hands of, or how can you not take responsibility for the type of regulation that was happening in the Financial Regulator's office?</p></speech>

I don't know where you get the notion that the Better Regulation White Paper, had anything to do with light-touch.  It was not light-touch; it was good regulation.  It was to ... based on an OECD model to improve regulation.  I had done, I think, considerably good work on the statue law revision of the Oireachtas on both legislation pre-1922 and the statutory instruments, where we updated the entire Statute Book and legislative book going way back to ... hundreds of years.  And as part of that initiative, we wanted to get to a situation where the easy option wasn't always taken, that a statutory instrument or regulation would be the first thing that was looked at.  And there were five principles or six principles set out in that White Paper.  But it was not light-touch, it should not have been considered light-touch; it was better regulation.</p></speech>

And at that, you were accompanied by the Financial Regulator, and in your address to them, you say, "International benchmarking studies show that Ireland is very lightly regulated compared to most of our European colleagues."  You were telling the financial services sector in New York to come and invest in Ireland, and as I quote, you were saying that Ireland is "very lightly regulated."</p></speech>

The whole ... I'll tell you, Deputy, I remember as Minister of Finance, when the Bundesbank finance committee came to this country because this country's financial services centre, which was only in its infancy, was being talked down by others, mainly Luxembourg, which ... I don't criticise them for it because they saw this was a new opposition.  And they came here and were amazed to find out that it wasn't a brass plate operation, that we had good regulation, that we were well-regulated.  And one of the reasons that the financial services industry in this country has been a success, that it has billions upon billions under fund management and that has been one of the great success stories of the last quarter of a century in this country is because it's seen internationally as a well-regulated, not light regulated, well-----</p></speech>

So do you accept that you were aware that the Financial Regulator who accompanied you there was pursuing light-touch regulation with the banks?  And if you were aware then how can you say that you'd be damned to take responsibility that wasn't your responsibility?</p></speech>

We're talking about better regulation so that we're seen as a modern country, to be able to manage the funds of something like 100 banks worldwide as we have done successfully here even in the downturn.  Our banks here ... our foreign banks who work in the IFSC, that employ 30,000 or 40,000 people are well regulated and that isn't about light touch, they are well regulated ... and they're seen internationally to do that.  But we had to, Deputy, work hard for a quarter of a century as I did, as the Taoiseach before me did to win that reputation, and as a former Taoiseach, is there in the financial service industry today doing a good job on it.  So I would almost resent, Deputy, if I can say it respectfully to you, the idea that our international financial services industry is considered to be light-touch in the way that you put it.</p></speech>

If I can ask you, we've seen the graphs in terms of the explosion of credit into the market.  And you yourself talked about that the commercial property was where the madness really took place.  Mr. Ahern, your Government introduced the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Act 2007.  It's reported that you were lobbied by the financial institutions, and the Minister for Finance was lobbied by Anglo Irish Bank.  This is all on the public record and it was introduced in 2007.  It was introduced in the statement in the D&aacute;il it says that the banks were relying in the past in relation to deposits which is no longer available.  What this Act did was allow for commercial mortgages to be rolled up into a bond and new funding to be secured on the basis of that to allow these banks to release more credit into the Irish market.  Now this was in March 2007 at the peak, or close to the peak, of credit flow.  Do you take any responsibility for introducing that Act which encouraged more credit into an overheated system at that point in time?</p></speech>

I didn't deal with that legislation.  I heard the Minister answer it and I think the Minister gave the reasons why that was, so I don't want to add anything to what he said.</p></speech>

But I would have been very well on the side of "leave well enough alone", because there was concern in the Central Bank but at the same time, there was an impelling argument because of the difficulties that had come out of the DIRT report that we should make those changes.  There was a compromise, and I accepted the compromise, so ... I don't intend to say that to you it was the cause of the issue.  I don't believe I said that, and if I did say that, that's not correct.</p></speech>

I don't see anything wrong with that.  I know there's been an issue made about this, was that in some way tied his hands.  I don't really see that.  We're a country that hasn't got huge resources in the administrative system for having separate agencies and separate organisations, and if people can double up in their promotion, of it, the Central Bank, working together.  In the early years, all the people that were in the Clearing House Group, the Central Bank was there, the regulator was there, Revenue were there, Government Departments were there, I don't really think that that created any weaknesses in the system.  I know there's been some changes now, and from what I can hear, the changes don't add up to a lot in so far as the system works very much the same.  They have two different groups, one group meets now and then another group meets separately, it, the changes aren't substantive.</p></speech>

My name is Jake Proctor and I studied at Strangford Integrated College in County Down from September 2008 until June 2015.  I am eternally indebted to NICIE and those brave parents, governors and teachers who took a brave stand to create an integrated school on the Ards Peninsula.  Strangford Integrated College has changed my life for the better.  From the outset I felt like I truly belonged there.  There is a real community feel at Strangford and the word "school" is not used.  We use terms like "community" and "family" instead.  It is an inclusive learning environment, like all integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  We need more integrated schools and more places in them so that a greater number of young people can have their lives transformed by integrated education.</p> <p>  One of the key aspects of integrated education that I identify with is that it engages with division and celebrates difference.  Sectarianism is combatted in integrated schools.  For example, I have strong friendships across the divide, friendships I did not have before I joined Strangford and which I would never have had if I had gone to a controlled school.  It is not just a buzzword or tick-box exercise; difference is actually celebrated in integrated schools.  Just last month, I took an assembly at Strangford where I asked the younger students to find a person who was not like them and to find out three things that made that person who he or she was.  I have seen very positive outcomes of this including strengthened friendships and better understanding of the past and of where we are going in future.  Integrated education works as it encourages children to work with people from other communities and backgrounds from an early age.  It has been a pleasure to be part of that.  Educating children together works well to break down myths, stereotypes and perceptions, which is crucial if we are going to have any type of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Better than any of that, integrated education prepares young people for a very diverse life in the 21st century.  It has helped me to prepare for a rapidly changing world and an uncertain future.  I feel ready for third education and to start my degree at Queen's University in September thanks to Strangford College and integrated education.  I do not have to think about mixing with the other as I have done it since I was 11 years of age.  If I had gone to a controlled school, I guarantee that I would not have this luxury or this weight off my shoulders.  I know this because I was the only one from my friendship group from primary school who went to an integrated school.  The other four went to grammar schools in Belfast.  Academically, we have performed equally over the last seven years but as far as making us 21st century citizens is concerned, they all agree that I have the upper hand.  The notion of the other is not in my mindset or vocabulary.  I am a non-believer so people's religion will never be a question I ask.  The notion of the other has proven to be a challenge and an obstacle for the other boys.  They know that when we walk into Queen's in September, we will enter an integrated environment.  Each of us knows what we will face but thanks to integrated education at Strangford College, I am more than equipped with the tools to deal with this.</p> <p>  What do I blame the boys' fear on?  It is a failure of the education system.  The current segregated system of education in Northern Ireland is, as NICIE puts it, a key component of a negative peace.  Is it fit for a society emerging from conflict?  No.  Are integrated kids better prepared for life in the 21st century and the diversity of university and the workplace?  Absolutely.  The last time I researched it, I found that 92% of school kids in Northern Ireland were being educated separately.  Of every 100 young people, 92 are being denied the opportunity to learn together.  In 2010, I made a speech at Stormont through our education committee and told the members that I believed the time was right for a fully integrated system of education.  I still do, but I respect parental choice.  The fact is, however, that parental choice is being denied.  It is void and hollow for many people in Northern Ireland.  Underfunded and oversubscribed integrated schools as well as vast areas across Northern Ireland which have no integrated option is a situation which is, frankly, unacceptable.</p> <p>  I place the blame for this firmly at the feet of those who are failing to implement the Good Friday Agreement and a framework for the peaceful, equal Northern Ireland that 75% of the population pledged to support.  Not all young people are going to be world leaders, doctors or teachers, but we are all going out into a very diverse 21st century.  Integrated education gives us a helping hand.  Mahatma Gandhi said that if we wanted world peace, we should start educating children.  Jake Proctor says, "If we want progress in Northern Ireland, we need to start educating children together".  The assumption is true that children learn better in a place where they are fully accepted.  At age 12, I very much fitted the Protestant working class underachieving schoolboy stereotype.  I had failed my 11 plus and no one had high hopes for me.  Strangford College transformed Jake Proctor.  It accepted me and in the space of five years, I fell in love with school again.  I was in the top 10% in Northern Ireland at key stage 3 level.  I got first place in Northern Ireland in GCSE business studies, and I got three As at AS level, including 100% in two subjects with a similar outcome expected in August.  Working in an open, honest, caring environment has helped me and I feel I have excelled in integrated education.  I have found a new confidence and belief in myself.</p> <p>  I hope a time comes in Northern Ireland when educating children together will be the norm and not the exception.  We all need to work together to achieve this.  We have the framework as integrated schools exist and we have organisations like NICIE and the IEF here for support.  We clearly have the interest as existing integrated schools are oversubscribed while many controlled and maintained primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland are showing interest in joining the integrated movement.  Yes, there are problems and barriers, but let us leap them.  In five years, when I hopefully re-enter education as a history teacher, I will want to work in an integrated school.  I want to send my kids to an integrated school.  For the sake not only of my kids but of all our young people and future generations, let us leap the barriers and solve the problems.  We have ignored article 64 for 17 years.  Let us not leave it any longer.</p></speech>

Before I begin, I once again offer apologies on behalf of Noreen Campbell, who would have loved to be here today.  I am trying to fill her shoes albeit I ask the committee not to go with the mental image that creates.  I will try to summarise the report she has presented.</p> <p>  Our overall concern within NICIE and the IEF is that some of the principles contained within the Good Friday Agreement are not being delivered in keeping with the way the agreement was designed and what was in mind when it was drafted.  That is the overall framework for what I have to say today.  There are missed opportunities and work to be done and we urge the committee to use its influence to try to bring about positive change in terms of that process, notwithstanding that time has passed since 1998.  Our concern is that the education system in Northern Ireland remains one built on the basis of segregation while divisions between different sectors remain as strong as they ever were.  Jake quoted the statistic that 92% of schoolchildren in Northern Ireland continue to be educated within what is essentially a segregated system.  With all the time that has passed and, indeed, the funding that has been poured into various projects since 1998, we should surely have expected to see greater progress.</p> <p>  In her paper, Noreen Campbell quotes Professor Brandon Hamber who talks about the absence of violence without underlying reconciliation and genuine peace-building.  He describes this as a "negative peace".  The absence of violence is not the true peace we seek for Northern Ireland.  If one adds to that the concept Jake has touched on that one of the key drivers to real and sustainable change within Northern Ireland has to be children and the educational system, the deficiencies within the current system suddenly appear stark and urgent.  Ms Campbell quotes in her paper research which shows that sectarian attitudes are formed at a very early age and she quotes Hayes and McAllister who said that individuals who attend integrated schools are significantly more likely to have friends and neighbours from across the divide.  These friendship networks translate into a more optimistic view of future community relations.  Hayes and McAllister conclude, therefore, that an integrated education system is not only a fruitful place to start, but should be a key element within a wider strategy to address community divisions.  I would like to pause over that.  The first time one sees research which concludes that children coming out of integrated schools are more likely to have friendships from across divides, it sounds relatively unsurprising.</p><p>However, if one considers the ripple effect, it becomes very exciting because the children who are learning to grow up without barriers and the baggage of the past and willingly build friendships with children from all parts of the community and across the divides, as used to be the case, are the ones who, like Jake, are growing up to become the future generations.  Whether Jake goes into teaching or becomes a politician - I share the Chairman's feeling that perhaps he should - he is one of the shapers of the future.  If he is coming into adult society without the barriers and divisions of the past and becomes one of the shapers of the future society of Northern Ireland, suddenly we may feel we are in good hands.</p><p> We need an education system that encourages the attitudes Jake is carrying into his university career from September onwards.  The concept of children building firmer friendships within an integrated school is central to a better future for Northern Ireland and is a key way of fulfilling the Good Friday Agreement.  The current position is that the segregated system in Northern Ireland is not sustainable.  It has been made very clear from within the education Department that we cannot afford, even at a financial level, the education system we have in place.  In these times of austerity, we are funding multiple schools, all with their own identity and all within one relatively small town or part of a city, when it could all be much more financially economical.</p><p> The real cost, however, goes way beyond the finance involved.  It is about whether we are genuinely transforming the hearts, minds and values of young people.  There is a raft of shared education projects which have been funded and which continue in Northern Ireland today.  Some of them are very good, while some of them are not, but they all boil down to one single question: what is the genuine impact and quality of what is going on and is it, therefore, money well spent?  We have found during the years and throughout the history of integrated education that by bringing children together under one roof, day in, day out, they sit in class together, play football together at break time and the barriers are dismantled day by day.  They are genuinely coming through an integrated system and leaving to move into the adult world with the barriers removed.  They have a positive outlook.  They think, "I can do this; we can do this."  They move into society ready to play an active role, not only in changing the historical picture of Northern Ireland but, again, as Jake mentioned, in the increasingly diverse and multicultural society Northern Ireland has become, with the rest of Europe and the world.  </p><p> Ms Campbell goes on in her paper to talk about a number of opportunities she believes are open, even now, within the remit of the Good Friday Agreement and to those charged with fulfilling it.  She speaks, first, as I mentioned, about the economy and the fact that we simply cannot continue to maintain this duplicating system.  Second, she talks about the concept of identity and the fact that the idea of identity as it applied 30 years ago in Northern Ireland has changed and that society demands that we keep step with the changes taking place.  We now live in a multicultural society.  There are increasing numbers of younger generation parents and families coming through who are saying they do not want these labels to be applied to them.  Some of them only have recourse to describing themselves as "Other".  Surely it is time we moved forward to a slightly more positive concept.</p><p> Ms Campbell goes on in her paper to talk about the concept of human rights, by which she means the belief of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education that a right to an integrated education is a human rights issue.  It is the right for which the young person has to be prepared in a diverse society and world, wherever they may spend their working careers, and the right of parents to be able to say they want their child to have an integrated education.  The picture today in Northern Ireland is that not all parents have this right either because there is no integrated school within their geographical location or those that are available, including the one of which I am principal, are too small and, therefore, routinely turning children away when they have asked to join to receive an integrated education.</p><p> Ms Campbell goes on to talk about educational administration.  The committee may be aware that recently the structure of the five Education and Library Boards in Northern Ireland was replaced with a single Education Authority.  Therefore, massive change is under way.  What better opportunity is there to take a fresh look at the concept of integrated education and give it more formal backing than when we are designing a new education authority?</p><p> There is also within Northern Ireland the concept of area-based planning.  This, essentially, is where one looks at a single area as, perhaps, the cake with the different slices which are given to different sectors.</p></speech>

She refers in the section to such issues as the economy, the concept of identity and educational administration.  As she notes, the establishment of a new education authority presents opportunities for change.</p> <p>  The report goes on to discuss the process of area-based planning which has been established in Northern Ireland for the past four years, whereby the planning of educational provision within an area is strategically identified and explored.  Unfortunately, under this system, we still have different sectors fighting for their own interests.  The process remains partisan and there is no sense of a genuinely fresh look at educational provision within an area or any consideration of what is in the best interests of that area.  Moreover, it does not take on board in a wholehearted or honest way the concept of integrated education.  As such, it is a deeply flawed system.  We ask the committee to consider challenging the basis on which area-based planning was designed and is being implemented.</p> <p>  Ms Campbell goes on to talk in her report about the fact that the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, of which she is chief executive officer, has designed a new pathway into integrated education - Positive Partnerships for Integration.</p><p>This is a way in which schools that are not currently integrated can express an interest in gradually taking steps towards becoming integrated schools with the support of the Northern Ireland Council.  Ms Campbell states that on a first request for expressions of interest relatively recently, more than 50 schools expressed a interest in exploring this as a way forward.  There are ways of developing the concept of integrated education within Northern Ireland.  She went on to talk about the Stormont House Agreement and the capital funding package of &euro;500 million.  We are not sure where we are with the Stormont House Agreement at the moment, but if it does goes through we would love to think that some of that funding would be diverted specifically into integrated education.  In addition, PEACE IV will come online in September.  The figure of &pound;45 million has been allocated for shared education.  One of our questions is how to ensure that a healthy proportion of that is put towards integrated education.<br/><br/>Ms Noreen Campbell is asking that we explore the possibilities of the PEACE IV funding, specifically addressing integrated education and the possibility of calling for an independent commission to be established to reform the education system in Northern Ireland.Our concern is that, within the current remit of the different political parties and sectors, it is almost a mandate for no change.  Because the existing bodies are being given the task of looking at the system we have, there is very little hope for substantial change, whereas an independent commission could look at it with fresh eyes and say that it proposes a way forward - it would be a different approach entirely, with a fresh look at the whole system.  <br/><br/>Ms Noreen Campbell's final paragraph states:</p><blockquote>The embedding of peace needs constant attention; the dangers of following a path of 'separate but equal' must be challenged.  The endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement by the vast majority of people on this island represented vote for a 'shared future'.  Educating our children together is a critical building block of such a future.</blockquote><p>I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tina Merron" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015071600002#M00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to contribute.  I want to outline briefly why the Integrated Education Fund, IEF, exists, why we no longer want to exist and then I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Paul Caskey, to make a few concluding remarks.  The Integrated Education Fund, which was established in 1992 as an independent charitable trust, seeks to bridge the gap between finance and support that is available from the government and what it takes to set up an integrated school.  Twenty three years later, the IEF still exists with that core aim and we seek to increase the number of places in integrated schools and also to meet demand and advocate for structural reform of our education system, with the objective that the IEF will no longer be needed in the future.  If that financial gap were met, we would no longer need to exist.  We would not need to fund-raise continually for integrated education.</p> <p>  Since the Good Friday Agreement, we have spent more than &pound;20 million in seed funding for integrated schools, and today, despite the Good Friday Agreement, we are still needed.  It is parents who set up integrated schools, not the Department of Education.  We provide support to parents to establish schools.  For example, we funded the school that Mr. Proctor attended, Strangford Integrated College.  We funded it for two years as an independent school; it is established now and it is very much oversubscribed.  </p> <p>  The fund also provides capital support for 13 new integrated playgroup facilities.  The Department, for the first time ever, funded an integrated playgroup this year.  It is big positive achievement for us.  We funded the rest to date and it has all been in terms of capital.</p> <p>  In the last three years we have provided more than &pound;2 million in funding to help existing integrated schools grow.  We know the demand exists and they want to grow.  We provided additional capital funding for additional classrooms, and they then meet the demand and can prove to the Department of Education that the demand exists.  </p> <p>  We also fund and encourage transformation of existing schools that want to become integrated.  To date, 20 controlled schools, which are mainly Protestant schools, have transformed to integrated status.  However, the first Catholic school recently applied to transform and was refused approval from the Department of Education to do so.  The Department provides some financial support but it is not enough to do this work.  It is challenging and it takes time to transform a school</p> <p>  Transformation is cost-effective and sustainable with respect to integration, which can help resolve the over-provision of school places.  It was recently identified in a Northern Ireland Audit Office report that there is over-provision in respect of at least 20% of the places.  Transformation offers a school the opportunity to increase enrolments through working with the entire community, but it needs to be effectively supported.</p> <p>  We have supported the grant-aiding of cross-community education programmes during the past 15 years.  We had a programme called PACT, Promoting A Culture of Trust, and we spent more than &pound;1 million and more than 500 schools were involved during those 15 years.  The programme is a precursor to some of the shared education programmes that are currently being funded.  This work was important for us at the time and it still is important as it demonstrates the appetite for this work, but the time has come for more ambitious programmes with the potential for sustainable structural change.  We have put money into this for 15 years and we could do it for another 15 years, and it is great that children have an opportunity to meet each other, but there is no structural change and it is not sustainable.  Unfortunately, the PEACE IV programme suggests a similar type of funding, this type of shared education approach, and this will continue to dominate both policy and funding, but we would question whether this is another lost opportunity.  Should we not be able to do more?  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Paul Caskey, for some final comments.</p></speech>

One of the observations we can make is that there is tremendous support for educating children together in Northern Ireland across all political perspectives, but what we need now is structural reform and change.  We believe the appetite is there for that.  Much of the cross-community education work that has gone on for many years shows that the appetite is there, but we need more ambitious reform.  We need integrated education to be properly planned.  Seventeen years after the Good Friday Agreement, it should not be beyond us to ask communities and parents what types of school they desire in their area and not just rely on the current existing sectors and institutions to provide that.</p> <p>  We need a vision for the future, which is sadly lacking.  We need a roadmap on how we will get there.  If we could plan for integrated education, we could start to meet that demand.  It is not imposing anything on anybody; rather, it is reflecting what communities want.  PEACE IV could present a big opportunity.  Shared education has been agreed.  There is a good deal of money available.  I know it has not been ratified yet, but it would be pleasing if we could see some element of support for integrated education just as in the Stormont House Agreement.</p> <p>  I have one final request.  I would love if the committee would consider visiting an integrated school in Northern Ireland, perhaps even Mr. Proctor's old school, Strangford Integrated College, which might be amenable to such a visit, as there is nothing like seeing this in action to get a feel for what it is about.</p></speech>

We would be delighted to accept Mr. Paul Caskey's invitation to visit an integrated school.  Our secretariat will work closely with him on that.  We go on many outreach visits to Northern Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, when she was Chairman of this committee, pioneered many of those visits, which were very worthy and interesting, and they have given us an in-depth knowledge of what is happening.  I thank Mr. Caskey for the invitation and we will be delighted to accept it.  We will fit that trip in.</p> <p>  I have one or two questions before I bring in the members of the committee.  Ms Tina Merron said that the first maintained Catholic school recently applied for and was refused approval to transform by the Department of Education.  Why did that happen?  Second, regarding an independent commission to reform the education system in Northern Ireland, could our guests expand on who they consider should be members of such a commission?  Why do they consider it has not been progressed?  Is there any way this joint committee could be of assistance to them?</p></speech>

Clintyclay is a small school that was refused approval to transform by Department of Education based on its size, and it is also in financial deficit.  There was subsequently a judicial review and the decision was quashed.  We are not sure where it sits at the minute.</p></speech>

She has not gone into detail in the report.</p><p>The basic principle behind it is that it needs to be led by someone and composed of a group of people who are prepared to rise above the tribal politics that presides in Northern Ireland.  The power-sharing Executive is, on the one hand, a brilliant step forward from where we were before, but, as we can see even in the current wrangles and difficulties it is facing, it has flaws built into it.  When there are sectors representing their own interests, there is no agreement or synergy.  We are looking for something that is beyond this.  I apologise because I cannot comment further on the proposals for the mechanics of this.</p></speech>

We recognise that how we educate children is a very sensitive issue for many.  We are all very proud in most cases of the education we received across the various sectors.  It is a question of trying to remove education from the difficult, sensitive space and using external, independent expertise to help to examine all of the various issues involved.</p></speech>

It is good to explore what has held back to some degree the development of integrated education.  The delegates have said there is sometimes a halfway house in dealing with issues.

Do the delegates regard the shared education concept proposed and talked about by Minister John O'Dowd as a benefit or an obstacle to integrated education?</p> <p>  With regard to the educational benefits of integrated education by comparison with the community benefits, how do the academic benefits of integrated education compare with those of mainstream education?  How does one judge the after-effects of community involvement in trying to develop a new society in the North?</p></speech>

I will take the very first one, on how we assess demand for integrated education.  In the past parents' groups came to us stating they would like to open an integrated school.  That has now become more difficult with over-provision of places and too many schools.  We would like to see a mechanism whereby the Department could assess parental demand.  We are examining some pilot schemes that would allow us to carry out a community audit in an area and to ask parents and the community what they actually want in their area.  In that way, what is desired by the whole community, rather than just one section thereof, could be identified.  We are piloting a mechanism to assess parental demand.</p></speech>

If it is a controlled school, it is given the option to amalgamate with another controlled school.  If it is a Catholic school, it is given the option to amalgamate with another Catholic school.  The parents are never presented with the option of an integrated school that might be more beneficial for the community.  We would like to see it becoming an option for parents in such circumstances.</p></speech>

Shared education is regarded by many as an alternative to integrated education.  There is a dangerous line of thought suggesting it is easier than integrated education.  Let me unpick that suggestion.  For me, it really boils down to the question of quality, by which I mean the impact on the values of young people.  At its worst, shared education becomes a kind of sticking plaster on a broken leg, whereby schools can tick a box and access funding allowing them to say they are providing shared education.  The real question, however, is whether the delivery of what they are calling shared education is having any meaningful or lasting impact on the young people involved in it.  Second, we must ask whether it is sustainable.  If the pot of funding comes to an end, does everything collapse or is there something being developed that has momentum and can be continued?  Quality, therefore, is about genuine contact between children from different areas of the community or across the divide.  It is a question of what is actually happening to shape them to help them to prepare for a meaningful future and their roles as citizens when they are adults.</p> <p>  Let me give an example of a practice in my school that might perhaps serve as an instance of what I am talking about.  Every year before Ash Wednesday, one of the questions asked is about how the school should approach a practice often regarded as rooted in one part of the community and deliver what is required within an integrated school.  For us, the Ash Wednesday service is a service held for the entire school community, including Protestants, Catholics and others.  Staff, students and even the canteen staff gather together in the hall.  We invite clergy from all sides of the community to help run the service.  I begin the service every year by saying we have come together on the day to explore the ways in which we are living our lives and ask ourselves whether we could be doing so better than we have been.  We then reach a point in the service where both Catholic and Protestant clergy speak to the children.  Without using the terms "Protestant" and "Catholic", we say, "You now have an opportunity to receive the ashes if you wish, and if you would rather not, that is your choice and you may remain in your seat."  We play a PowerPoint presentation and some reflective music while the ashes are being dispensed and we invite those present to think, reflect or pray; it is entirely their choice.  Those who wish to receive the ashes, queue for them in a very dignified manner and those who would rather not receive them remain in their seats.  After this, we close the service.  It is a beautiful, dignified occasion on which students from all parts of the community can see each other in action and deem it to be okay if their friend goes up for ashes if they do not.  I always invite the clergy for a cup of tea afterwards.  Approximately three years ago the Catholic priest said, "My goodness, the presence of the Holy Spirit in your school this afternoon was phenomenal."  I believed that was an interesting reflection.</p> <p>  That is an example of what I am talking about.  I refer to children who are genuinely learning to tolerate and respect one another and the differences in the various communities.  Where else would they receive that experience?  My challenge to those delivering a shared education project is to determine whether the quality of what they are doing will match this and, consequently, whether the funding being poured into their project is worth it.  Putting it bluntly, we offer shared education under one roof from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and beyond every day.  We see the transformation in children's values that we believe should be the aspiration of any shared education project.</p></speech>

People's perception will be based on five GCSEs, with results from A to C in subjects including English and mathematics, and the barometers associated with examination results.  The big divide in Northern Ireland in terms of that crude barometer is between selective and non-selective schools.  Most schools are on a par with one another, be they Catholic non-selective, integrated non-selective or controlled non-selective.  There is a difference of approximately 1% at GCSE level.  Catholic schools are approximately 0.5% ahead, followed by integrated schools, with controlled schools being marginally below that level.  Sometimes it is presented that certain schools in certain sectors are outperforming others because of their ethos, but it is important to note that it is really about selection and non-selection.  There are good, well performing Catholic schools and also poorly performing Catholic schools.  It is no different in the case of integrated schools, controlled schools and grammar schools.  Sometimes it is a very complex area, but these are the facts.  Is that a fair description?</p></speech>

Ultimately, the only way forward is through what is called a value-added system.  We talk a lot at Drumragh about personal best.  We need a system that evaluates.  Children are benchmarked academically when they join the school, which is not difficult, and then one measures the extent to which they are over-performing based on the initial predictions.  A value-added system would determine whether each youngster had performed below, on a par with or above what had been expected initially.</p><p>Out of that, one has a value-added system which asks whether a youngster achieved below par, on a par or above par, with regard to their initial expectations.  If we could design a barometer that picked up on that system rather than asking how the grammar schools did or how the non-selective schools did and all of that, we would have a way of genuinely measuring the quality of each school and its delivery.</p></speech>

Many of the challenges faced in the North are not a million miles away from the challenges we face.  We are looking at the issue of the predominance of faith patronage.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and we have discussed whether there should be an increase in the diversity of patronage or whether to provide one model to cater for all.  It is very welcome that a recent call for expressions of interest received a positive response from more than 50 schools.</p> <p>  Will the delegation clarify whether the integrated schools are state schools under private patronage or a mixture of both?  Do the integrated schools tend to be co-educational?  I am aware that the North also has the phenomenon of single-sex schools but since the 1990s, no new school in the Republic is allowed to be established as a single-sex school.  Any single-sex schools are legacy schools.  What is the position in Northern Ireland?  Are the integrated schools multi-denominational, non-denominational or a mixture of both?  In some cases, schools here that are non-denominational describe themselves as multi-denominational and vice versa, which can cause confusion.</p> <p>  We have published new legislation on a schools admissions policy.  The current legislation has been in place since 1998, under which schools must publish their enrolment policy.  The new legislation, if passed, will put further requirements on schools to be open and transparent in their policy in order to limit, to a certain extent, barriers and discrimination against children.  Is similar legislation planned or in place in the North?</p> <p>  One phenomenon which sometimes occurs here is when parents decide to set up a school with the ideals of Educate Together, for instance.  These schools are often predominately middle class.  However, it is not always the case because Educate Together schools contain a mixture.  Is this an issue in integrated schools?  Is there an equivalent of vocational educational schools in the North?  These schools have a much broader mixed socio-economic background.  Mr. Proctor referred to the pitfalls of parental choice.  This is an issue of concern to me.  Some parents can use choice to the advantage of their children while other parents are not able to do so and their children are disadvantaged as a result.</p></speech>

I was inspired listening to Mr. Proctor.  I am deeply interested in education and I spoke on the subject of junior cycle reform in the Seanad this morning.  Education is for everybody and every career path is equally valid.  That is what we are moving towards here.  There was an elitism in education but now, we value things like self-esteem and a path for life so that a person can start as an apprentice and end up being a doctor in one's subject.  Integrated education is part of this process.  I commend the work of Mr. Frith.  Last year or the year before, we had a community audit in the South in a number of towns.  I was struck by the number of people who wanted to retain the <i>status quo</i>.  I ask the witnesses to comment because it is a big question for me as to why people wanted to retain the <i>status quo</i>in terms of the management and the control of schools.  I am not criticising any of the bodies which manage schools.  However, change is happening in other areas, such as the introduction of marriage equality and many other social changes, but in the area of education, it seems that parents are reluctant to change.</p><p>I was in Derry last summer when people were celebrating the fact that their son or daughter got into the school of choice by means of the 11-plus exam.  They were booking holidays in Tenerife because it was a big celebration for all the family.  I was also struck that one of the schools in Derry had stipulated that as well as academic achievement, a student had to be able to play a musical instrument.  I do not know whether that is right and I suggest to Francie that he should discuss this with his Minister.</p></speech>

I am only sorry I was unavoidably detained and did not hear all the presentations but I enjoyed listening to the members and Mr. Proctor, whom I believe gave a very powerful speech.  He is a credit to integrated education and I wish him great success with his exam results and into the future.</p> <p>  As a former teacher I find this subject fascinating.  I will follow on from Senator D'Arcy's point about why he could not understand why people would have to be able to play a musical instrument.  As a former music teacher, I would strongly advocate that every child in school from four to 18 years of age should play a musical instrument.  For many years I saw students starting school who did not play an instrument and I was particularly delighted when I saw them leaving school, not only playing an instrument but continuing to become musicians and to study for degrees.  Some of them even became lecturers in music at university.  Music is the universal language.  A person with a musical instrument under his or her arm is always welcome in every house in this country.</p> <p>  I am a strong advocate for music.  Until recently, part of the criteria for entrance to primary school training was that one had to play a musical instrument.  This change may have had a knock-on effect when I see students who have had no or very little music in primary school.</p><p>To be able to play an instrument is a great string to one's bow.</p><p> Can the witnesses comment on the criteria for entry?  In the notes it states that, to date, no Catholic school has transformed to become an integrated school.  Can they elaborate on why that is?  I understand one school applied for the process and that it is going through a judicial review.  How can we as a committee help implement the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement?  It is the way forward when one sees the calibre of student it produces and Mr. Proctor is certainly a good role model.</p></speech>

However, I have gone through the documentation.  Shared housing and integrated education are contained in one sentence in the Good Friday Agreement but there has not been progress on shared or mixed housing to the extent we would like either.  In the early 1990s the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which the Chairman was co-chairman with a member of the British House of Commons, visited Lagan College which was one of the first integrated colleges.  A founder member of the Alliance Party was very much to the fore as a champion of integrated education at that time and in 1993 or 1994 a number of us from the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the British House of Commons visited various educational establishments.  We met with unions, management bodies and the governing body of Lagan College, who had a very progressive programme.  I see that Ms Scott-Wills taught there</p></speech>

Is it intended that this initiative move forward incrementally, with shared classes rather than a shared or integrated school?  It seems, unfortunately, to be a slow process.  Is there any willingness on the part of the Department of Education to push the boundaries?  Has any Minister shown any interest in driving it forward?  I am from Cavan-Monaghan and my constituency borders a number of counties north of the Border.  There has been huge concern about smaller schools being closed and a major reduction in funding for education.  Is there any interest, politically or administratively within education, to drive this forward?</p></speech>

The problem is that the Department of Education demands that schools prove there is the demand and one of the few ways it can prove demand is to put up another mobile and encourage other pupils to come in.  If that can be done the Department will subsequently fund it but we have to fund the mobile initially.  In the past couple of years we have funded some 13 additional mobile classrooms for schools to prove demand.</p></speech>

When Lagan College opened in 1981 a lot of schools were single-sex but Lagan wanted to make sure it was mixed at all levels so it became co-educational.  All integrated schools are co-educational.  On the question of multi-denominational status we have a statement of principles, dating from 1991, in which we state we are Christian in nature but we are there for children who come from the faith, from other faiths and from no faith at all.  We cater for them too.  While there is a Christian ethos and the religion taught in schools, because it comes from the Northern Ireland curriculum, is Christian we have always been open in a multi-denominational way.  People would be concerned about this at times and we have had a lot of discussion about what it means.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nigel Frith" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015071600002#P02400"><p>An integrated school follows the same religious education curriculum as any other school in Northern Ireland.  The difference is that, like the history syllabus, it is delivered in an entirely balanced way because the staff are aware that there are Protestant and Catholic children in front of them in the class so there is an imperative to deliver the subject in a completely balanced and harmonious way.  In our RE curriculum we follow a philosophy and ethics route.</p><p>The older the children get, the more we are adopting this route which is fundamentally about not only understanding world faiths and religions but also asking huge questions and, out of that, exploring what one's own values and beliefs are going to be.  It seems to me that that is a healthy outlook for children to take out into the sometimes very confusing world in which we live.</p><p> In terms of the socio-economic make-up of integrated schools, we often find that integrated post-primary schools attract higher numbers of special needs children than any other sector.  In our own school, for example, we have something in the region of 70 children with statements of special need, which is the most acute level of special need there is, and an entitlement therefore to a classroom assistant.  Some 35% of our intake are on the special needs register somewhere with some form of identified special need.  That is significantly above average.</p><p> The difficulty is that because we are competing in a system where the grammar schools are creaming off some of the more academically able children, rightly or wrongly - in my view wrongly.  We are therefore competing to ensure our intake is entirely balanced with all ability levels and all gifts and talents.  For that reason we have introduced a gifted and talented programme whereby staff are tasked with ensuring gifted or talented children in their classes are offered additional challenges.  When a child finishes a piece of work, do not offer them more of the same, but ensure they are given an extension activity which builds on what they have already achieved.  We must ensure we are offering extracurricular activities, which might be a science competition or a maths challenge, that allows them to go beyond what their peers are doing.  We compile a gifted and talented register every autumn where staff identify the gifted and talented children in the school.  As I will explain in a moment, that is also built into our admissions criteria.</p><p> I see integrated schools as a great leveller.  When we have prospective children and parents looking around, I will often ask the child whether he or she thinks this is a grammar school or a high school.  They will screw up their chins and have a little think for a minute.  The answer is, however, that we are both under one roof.  Therefore, not only do we have all faiths and none under one roof, but we also have those who might have gone to a grammar school or a high school.  It is a fully integrated education system whereby every child can then be nurtured, supported and developed according to their personal capacities.</p><p> I think it is immoral to rubber-stamp a child at the age of 11 with the words "pass" or "fail".  The damage some children carry into their adult lives because they were told at the age of 11 that they failed is irreparable.  At the age of 40 or 50, some of them are still carrying the damage to their self-esteem that test at the age of 11 inflicted upon them.  It should never have made it into the 21st century.  It is wrong that we have a system that still does that.</p></speech>

It is a rather crude indicator, but free school meals are one way of measuring.  There are issues about uptake within particular communities.  Some 28% of children who attend integrated schools in Northern Ireland are entitled to a free school meal.  Within selected schools it is about 8%, while the Northern Ireland average is around 25%.  It depends where the school is located.  We have schools in working-class communities and schools that sit on the interface in Belfast and other places.  We also have some schools that sit in very affluent communities.<br/><br/>One of the myths about integrated education is that this must be a middle-class phenomenon.  The truth of the matter is that working-class communities are perhaps more receptive to integrated education than middle-class ones, because middle-class communities do not like to admit there might be an issue around some of the schools in the area.<br/><br/>A point was made about auditing, but we are not afraid of auditing.  That is the one thing that is missing from the area-based planning process.  We want communities to be asked what type of schools they want.  If they want something else, that is fine.  As I said earlier, it is not about imposing this on anyone.  If they opt for the <i>status quo</i>that is fine, but give them a choice and a voice.  Ms Merron spoke about transformation and that allows parents to have a democratic ballot overseen within their school.  That process is delivered in many integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  Faced with that realistic choice, we should not be afraid of auditing.</p></speech>

When one drills down into the reasons, much of the time it is because there is not an integrated choice in their area.  Many would say that if the local school transformed, they would send their child to that school.  There is not that much choice for parents, especially when one moves outside Belfast.  Therefore, while they would want integrated education, the only choice given to them is either a controlled school or a Catholic school, and then they send their child to that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nigel Frith" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015071600002#Q00700"><p>I want to touch briefly on two things.  When I was a child there were a lot of cows in the area where I lived, and one horse.  The horse thought he was a cow.  He had never seen that there was any possibility of anything different from a cow, so he assumed he was one.  The point I take from that is that a vision for change in a place like Northern Ireland has to include a vision of what could be.  On the question why more people are not opting for something different, they have not been given a vision of what could be.  Therefore, the family tradition of opting for the grammar school and that being seen as the pinnacle of achievement persists because it is just that - it is tradition.  There is not a solid vision of what could be.  It is down to organisations like NICIE and the IEF to say that things could be different, but we are not seeing that vision from the political leadership of Northern Ireland.  The political leadership of Northern Ireland continues to deliver the segregated, sometimes tribal, approach that is impeding Northern Ireland's progress.</p> <p>  The second point I want to touch on briefly is the question that was asked about our admissions criteria.  When we are beginning a transfer process, we make it clear that we intend if possible to admit 40% Catholic, 40% Protestant and a maximum of 20% other.  Within each of those groupings we have a series of admissions criteria which we begin with.  First, a child who is coming to us from an integrated primary school has a very easy transfer into a post-primary school because they have begun the integrated journey and it is only right that they can continue it.  Our second one is children of members of staff or governors because there has to be a perk in the system somewhere.</p> <p>  We admit children who are gifted and talented, but not in terms of a transfer test.  It is simply a way of saying that if a child has a gift or talent in two or more subjects, there is an opportunity for them to have some preference.  The point of that is not to recreate a transfer test.  It is this goal of achieving an even ability intake and therefore a way of saying to parents who are thinking of a grammar school that there is an alternative and they could look at the gifted and talented programme operated by Drumragh.  It is not a narrowly academic model and does not recreate the 11-plus.  Children who are sporting, musical, budding engineers or academic all have an equal opportunity to present a case for being gifted and talented.</p> <p>  Our admissions criteria also offer the opportunity for parents to make a special case based on a child's learning difficulties, medical needs or social needs for some reason.  There is an opportunity to say that they are from a mixed marriage and therefore essentially the child is receiving an integrated home environment, and for that reason the parents want the same ethos to be present in their child's education.</p> <p>  Those are the sorts of criteria we have built into the system.  Our regret every year is when we run out of places and then have to say that one child can come in but another cannot.  That seems to us to be entirely wrong.</p></speech>

To pick up on what Mr. Frith said about the 11-plus transfer test and how individuals in their 30s and 40s are still damaged by that, it had really damaged me, and after I got my results I suffered depression for a brief stage.  I spent a long time alone in my bedroom.  I was very upset about that but when I went to Strangford, which was a non-selective school, I got a fresh start academically and socially, and that has helped me achieve academically.  I do not want to repeat what I said at the outset but that is one of the main benefits that has aided my development.</p> <p>  Another benefit would be that we explore culture in classes such as history, religion and citizenship.  We explore culture in physical education, PE, by playing Gaelic football, something I would not have had the opportunity to do in my own community.  In terms of language, we were laughing coming down on the train because I said I was not much of a linguist but I would not have had the opportunity to learn the Irish language if I had attended the local controlled school.  I got that opportunity through integrated education at Strangford.</p> <p>  In terms of friendships, as I said at the outset, I would not have made the friendships I have made across the divide had I gone to the controlled school.  That is another opportunity integrated education has given me.  I could go into more detail but I am aware we do not have much time.  </p> <p>  Those are the four points I wanted to make.  Integrated education has aided my development.  I know it is not easy for the members to grasp that in the brief time available to us but they have to understand that when I came into integrated education, I did not know one Roman Catholic person.  Now, my four best friends are Roman Catholic.  My four best friends went to a maintained primary school.  My friendships now are across the divide and in my mindset, as far as Jake Proctor is concerned, there is no divide.</p></speech>

It was awful stuff.</p> <p>  I spoke about music earlier.  Two of my three children have degrees in music and play with the Cross Border Orchestra, which is an integrated project.  Music breaks down barriers also.  Having an extra criteria to allow a child get into a grammar school through playing a musical instrument favours the middle class because it is middle-class children in primary school who get the extra tuition in music.  That is the point.</p> <p>  In 50 years from now people will say: "Imagine there was a time when one chose one's school on the basis of one's religion."</p></speech>

At worst, it becomes an excuse to avoid the real issues, and that is a huge concern for us looking at the amount of funding being poured into shared education as opposed to integrated education.  If the two concepts could be given even a level playing field in terms of political support and funding, we would be a lot further forward from where we are now, and we could be in danger of putting the Integrated Education Fund, IEF, out of business as it would like to happen.</p></speech>

From my experience in Dungannon, I thought it was another part of the educational programme because it gives young people the opportunity of working with other children who have disabilities.  I was greatly impressed by that when I was a member of the council in Dungannon.  It is something we do not see enough of.  When I was in school I never met someone with a disability whereas in the school in Dungannon, the children were helping a child in a wheelchair and helping another child to get about.  That experience is very useful.</p> <p>  I live close to Moy and Clintyclay, and therefore I am between two situations.  If a school is failing, and particularly a primary school, the danger is that people come up with the idea of creating an integrated school, but there must be more planning involved in that.  In the Moy situation, it was envisaged that this would be the first step.  It could have become integrated in the future.  The intentions of those who were planning it and the ideas behind it were good in terms of how it would develop.  There was too much emphasis on the fact that there would still be two schools on the one campus, but sometimes that can be a good development.  In the Omagh example, the Irish language and the other schools were put on the one campus.  Instead of building new schools, if schools can share the one facility it can lead to an integrated school in the future, which would bring people together who would not normally meet.  Do the representatives agree that can be an advantage in the future?</p></speech>

It was a small rural school and it did not have financial problems, as outlined in the judicial review.  It is a small rural school which could, if it transformed, open its doors to the other community.  It would have been a welcoming presence, and it could have grown.  I would point out that transformation is a process of helping with the oversubscription problem in the area.</p> <p>  In terms of shared education, it is certainly a step in the right direction but there must be something more to it.  It has to progress to the next stage.</p></speech>

The system is so rigid in Northern Ireland that it does not cater for real children.  I can tell the members about Grace, who is in year 9 in our school.  In terms of her mathematical ability, she is at the very top of the scale on the tests we ran with her when she joined the school.  Cognitively, she is extremely high functioning.  She was in the top ten of a competition for writing in <i>The Guardian</i>last year, and yet she has a statement of special educational needs and needs a classroom assistant.  Where else would we find a school that caters for that child's needs?  She spans the divisions that are built inherently into our education system.<br/><br/>A question was asked about the shared education campus.  I refer again to the question of a vision and purpose.  The shared education campus in Omagh will be built on what used to be an army base site.  Obviously, there is some significance to turning an army base into an educational site, which in itself is great.</p><p>Those schools will be built on that campus with their own front doors and fences, with their own badges and forms of governance.  They will be as separate on the site as they are on their existing sites.  Ours is the only post-primary school in Omagh not invited onto the campus.  It comes down to money and the fact that we moved into a new building six years ago.  We have accepted this, although we do not necessarily agree with it.  However, the remaining post-primary schools in Omagh will move onto the campus within the next four or five years.</p><p> Nobody has yet answered the big question: what will happen there?  There will be three shared blocks on the site and a great many separate classrooms behind their own front doors.  The big question which will not be answered for years is whether it will gradually become an integrated campus or remain a set of separate schools built on one piece of land, with the tribal politics continuing.  Nobody has answered that question.  If it does become an integrated site, I will applaud it, but my fear is that that is not part of the vision at present.</p></speech>

I will read an extract from my opening statement in order to keep within the time allocated.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware of the impact that delays in the registration of overseas nurses is having on the recruitment of nursing staff in the health services across all of the sectors.  The extent of the problem is that there are currently 2,016 applications being processed, 70% of which cannot progress due to incomplete documentation having been received by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland from all of the applicants.  All of the applicants who did not send complete documentation have been notified and are notified and updated on a regular basis.  Some 35% or 698 applications have been in the system for more than 12 months.  </p> <p>  Reflecting the lift in the economy, some 974 applications were received between January and June of this year, which compares to 302 applications received in the same period last year.  Notable contributory factors to the delay include staffing levels and funding at NMBI, with revenue being significantly less than expected for 2015, due to a lower than expected annual retention fee for the year.  This funding crisis has created uncertainty and insecurity among staff in the organisation with the subsequent increase in staff turnover for the first half of this year.  Eleven staff have left between January and June 2015.  This has added to the challenges of processing applications.</p> <p>  To get on the NMBI register, which is a legal requirement for anybody wishing to work as a nurse or a midwife in Ireland, the individual must demonstrate that he or she has met and achieved a level of competence in practice, educational preparation and would be prepared to work in accordance with the NMBI code of professional conduct and ethics.  This standard applies to all applicants, regardless of whether they are students graduating from Irish nursing undergraduate programmes or from overseas.  It is in the interest of patient safety that the process of registration must be rigorous and therefore cannot be compromised or undermined in any way.  </p> <p>  There are two major streams to registration.  Irish registration is about first-time registration for nurses and midwives following successful completion of their undergraduate programme and the annual renewal of registration of individual nurses and midwives.  The annual renewal process allows for restoration of nurses and midwives to the register if an individual has been removed for non-payment of fees.  If a nurse or midwife requires verification of their registration for the purposes of working overseas, a certificate of current professional status is issued.  Issuing of these certificates does not mean that the individual has actually gone to work abroad.</p> <p>  Students of nursing and midwifery in Irish universities and institutes of technology on successfully completing their education programme must apply to get on the register by submitting an application for initial registration in the Register of Nurses and Midwives, which is signed by the head of the nursing department in their educational institution and the director of nursing of the partner hospital.  This process takes place throughout September and October each year and the average time from receipt of application to confirmation of registration for students is seven days.  The number of students graduating each year is 1,500 in total.  Of that number, 860 are general nursing students, 290 psychiatric nursing students, 180 intellectually disability students, 100 children's general integrated students and 140 midwives. These are all registered within 15 working days.  There is no delay in this part of the system.</p> <p>  For nurses and midwives who have trained outside of Ireland and wish to practice in Ireland, the registration process is best described in four steps.  The first step involves the completion of a request for application and a payment.  This is followed by the issue of a personalised application pack to the applicant containing a formal application form and a full suite of supporting documentation, setting out all of our requirements together with full instructions.  The third step is the validation and verification of the application.  This stage requires a thorough visual check and validation of all documentation provided by the applicant.  The next step is that the application goes through an educational assessment for recognition of their qualifications and finally the application is assessed for determination of registration.  The decision can be one of three outcomes, namely registration, refusal, or successful completion of a period of adaptation and assessment, during which the individual's competence to practise is assessed.</p> <p>  The period of adaptation and assessment can be undertaken in any health care facility that has been approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, having met the standards for overseas adaptation.  These standards are available on the website.  On successful completion of this adaptation period, the applicant will have his or her registration confirmed by the board and his or her personal identity pin number is issued.  All applications from EU member states are processed within 90 days, as set out in the EU Directive 2005/36/EC, providing all documents are in order.</p> <p>  In regard to the current situation, the number of applications in January to June this year is 974 compared to 302 for the same period last year.  At the same time the budgeted revenue for the organisation was reduced by 33% as a consequence of lower than expected annual retention fee.</p><p>In addition, natural attrition of staff from the organisation was in the region of 23% of the organisation&rsquo;s complement.</p><p> Delays are also being experienced in Irish registration in respect of issuing certificates following restoration to the register for non-payment of fees.  The removal of nurses and midwives from the register for non-payment of fees and subsequent requests to be restored to the register is an annual event.  This year the numbers requesting restoration increased from 159 in 2014 to 1,472, with approximately 300 requesting a waiver of the restoration fee.  This volume of requests, against the backdrop of the resourcing issue outlined above, has given rise to delays in this process, which are currently being addressed.  These delays have not prevented the individuals concerned from practising.  Once an individual can produce evidence to his or her employer of completion of the restoration application and payment of fees, the registration is restored and the individual is able to practise, with the certificate being issued subsequently.  We are introducing an internal mechanism to allow staff to track individual applications online, thus enabling a more efficient response to queries.  Furthermore, the new restructured website will provide some online functionality, including the ability for individuals to track their own applications and payment options for applicants by the end of this year. </p><p> We have engaged in a collaborative process with key stakeholders so that we can further improve the process while maintaining the integrity of registration.  Those involved in the process include representatives from the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland, independent private hospitals, directors of nursing and midwifery, human resources experts, systems analysts and NMBI registration staff.  Moreover, our revised spending plan has been approved by our board, and the Department of Health has recently authorised additional resources to assist us in respect of the overseas registration delay backlog.  To clear the current backlog and ensure sustainability into the future as the demand on our organisation increases, we now require three additional full-time positions and funding for a web-based integrated case management system and register.</p><p> To sum up, while there are indeed delays in the registration of overseas  nurses and midwives, these delays have come about as a result of a combination of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, all of which have been or are in the process of being addressed urgently.  We are making progress, but much remains to be done.  In 2015 to date we have registered 253 nurse applicants from within the EU and 158 from non-EU countries, to a total of 411 nurses.  In 2014 we registered 344 nurses from within the EU and 161 from non-EU countries.  In the past 18 months, therefore, a total of 916 nurses registered with us.  A total of 2,016 applications are currently in the system, of which 818 are from EU member states and 1,198 from non-EU countries.  The number of applications received between January and June this year was 974, compared to 302 during the same period in 2014.  The number of applications in process for more than 12 months is 698, and the number of applicants with incomplete documentation is 1,398.  Of the 473 applicants who have received decisions, 330 were deemed to require adaptation, 43 have had their registrations refused, 55 were deemed to require further information following the initial assessment and 45 were recommended for registration.  Progress is being made but it is not quick enough, and this gives rise to the need for additional resources.  We welcome the support provided by the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in our minds about the importance of the work they do.  We and our loved ones depend on the verification process to validate the capacity, professional training and expertise of nursing staff, who are often the people with whom we have the most significant engagement in our health delivery settings.</p> <p>  The correspondence we received from Dr. Pidgeon in advance of the meeting refers to a decision to fill nine vacancies on an interim basis.  The issues relating to the protracted process and the delays in bringing people through the system have been evident for some time.  In her opening statement, she presented a picture of a less than stable or happy work environment, with an exodus of 11 staff over the period in question.  She also referred to uncertainty and insecurity among staff.  That is unsettling for any organisation.  Why were posts filled only in the relatively recent past and what exactly does "interim basis" mean in real terms?  I would expect the positions to be on a full-time basis.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland appears to be late in responding to an identified need.  While Dr. Pidgeon referred to a lower than expected annual retention fee, this has been a controversial issue in the past year or two.  I ask her to elaborate on the purpose of the annual retention fee and any other funding the board might secure to carry out its work.  If it is not solely dependent on the registration fee, perhaps she could help us to understand exactly where the funding difficulties arise.</p> <p>  There are 62,909 nurses and midwives on the active register.  I expect that some nurses and midwives may for their own reasons maintain registration even though they are not active in the health delivery system.  How does that relate to the numbers directly employed by the HSE or in private settings, including primary care and other practice roles?</p><p>Does Dr. Pidgeon have that information and statistics on the breakdown of nurses in the categories of general, psychiatric, intellectual disability, children and midwives?  If she does not, would it be possible to forward it to us subsequently?  I would welcome that.  </p><p> The number of students graduating each year is 1,500.  I expect that is the number coming through and graduating in this jurisdiction.  Are the numbers coming through at full capacity?  Does Dr. Pidgeon have information on the retention rate within our health system in recent years?   Could she give us a sense of that?  Has the retention percentage improved in recent years, particularly in the recent past with the lifting of the recruitment embargo, compared to previous years?  What has the direct impact of that been?  </p><p> Dr. Pidgeon referred to EU and overseas applicants.  Is it the case that Irish trained nurses are grouped within the EU classification within the NMBI's role and responsibilities?  I note the number of overseas applicants in the first six months has more than trebled compared to the same period in the previous year.  How does that statistic reflect itself in terms of Irish-EU applicants?  That figure does not appear to be given in the presentation but I could be wrong on that. </p></speech>

I am interested in the comparable position between Irish and EU applicants and the number of overseas applicants.</p> <p>  I will close on this point.  I can understand that time is required to properly evaluate and adjudge the bona fides of the suitably trained and qualified applicant getting through.  Is  there a verification process in place for the documentation presented by overseas applicants?  In layperson's terms, is there any fear of somebody presenting fictitious, forged or wrongly acquired documentation, and can we have certainty as to the veracity of the information and documentation being presented in every case?  Is verification by the issuing institution, in whatever setting globally, part of the work of the NMBI?  I thank the witnesses for giving of their time to come here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#F00400"><p>I thank our guests for the presentation and the briefing on this issue, which is one of concern to the committee and it is also a concern, on wider basis, in regard to  the health services.  The presentation appears, to some extent, to paint a picture of difficulties almost amounting to a crisis level within the organisation.  The presentation states, "This has created uncertainty and insecurity amongst staff in the organisation with a subsequent increase in staff turnover for the first half of this year, with 11 staff having left in the first half of 2015".  How many staff does the board have overall and what percentage of the overall staff would the 11 staff who left in the first half of 2015 constitute?  That statement is quite broad and I wonder if there are particular reasons for that turnover of staff.  There is a bigger workload within the organisation as we can note from the figures but it appears the staff numbers have decreased significantly.   What is the background to that?</p> <p>  There is the question of replacing those staff and  the number of applicants is increasing but staff numbers are  declining.  Dr. Pidgeon might elaborate on what she means by interim staff.  Are they temporary, part-time or long-term staff and how are they appointed?  Is there a long recruitment process for these staff or what is the exact position regarding their appointment?  How long are  those appointments for or are they long-term appointments?  </p> <p>  Dr. Pidgeon might elaborate on the financial position and the resources generally.  What are the difficulties?  What factors have brought about a situation where the level of funding is not adequate in terms of the number of applications with which the organisation is dealing?</p> <p>  On the issue of the number of nurses being trained, and this may not be relevant to the issue under discussion, does the NMBI have a role in the training of nurses?  Does it have a role in making recommendations?  In the area of gerontology and dealing with the elderly, it appears we will have a significant deficit in the number of nurses being trained.  I am not sure if that comes within the remit of the NMBI or whether it has any input into that.  Can Dr. Pidgeon see a time when the application and registration process will be manageable again within reasonable timeframes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#F00500"><p>I thank Dr. Pidgeon for her comprehensive presentation.  I wish to raise a few issues.  I fully accept there are 62,000 nurses and midwives on the register and each one of them has to renew their registration every year.</p> <p>  Dr. Pidgeon gave a summary in regard to the people who  are qualifying in Ireland and that they registered within 15 working days.  That system seems to be very well set up.  What is the staffing level dealing with the number of applications from people outside Ireland and from those  who are non-EU citizens?  Is there a gap between the time an application is received and when it is assessed to ascertain if inadequate documentation has been submitted or, on receipt of applications, are they assessed to determine if all the required documentation has been submitted, while not fully examining the application but merely identifying that if eight of nine items of documentation are required, they have been submitted? </p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of adaptation courses.  I understand from Nursing Homes Ireland that more than 330 people have to take adaptation courses.  Is there an adequate number of adaptation courses available and, if not, what mechanism is being put in place to ensure there will be an adequate number of them?  I understand there is a long waiting list for them and that even if it is agreed and approved, people can practice in Ireland who must complete an adaptation course.  What is the process for getting on to an adaptation course and what is the waiting period involved?</p><p>This question of the availability of adaptation courses is an important factor in addressing the broader issue.  My understanding is that the HSE is not providing an adequate number of courses and Nursing Homes Ireland has had to enter into discussions with other organisations about putting courses in place.  That needs to be clarified.  We can complain all we like about delays in registration but if the adaptation courses are not in place, we are not really achieving anything.</p><p> Although it is not a matter for the delegates, I am aware of a case involving a medical doctor who, after graduating in Ireland, went to work in New Zealand.  Within two weeks of applying for registration there, this person was eligible to practise.  By contrast, when the individual returned to Ireland two years later, the registration process was still not completed eight weeks after the person had applied to the Medical Council.  We seem to have a problem in terms of putting in place appropriate mechanisms for processing applications to register as health care professionals in this country.  I fully acknowledge the difficulties that have arisen for the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland as a result of the sudden increase in applications and the staffing issues it has to address.  I am concerned, however, about what is being done in respect of the provision of adaptation courses.  Even if we deal with the first problem, that issue will remain to be resolved.</p></speech>

Essentially, we have a number of full-time staff working on a short-term basis - that is, for a period of six months.  My comments regarding the workplace environment causing some uncertainty and unsettled feelings were in the context of the unexpected shortfall in revenue to the organisation, which meant I was not in a position to guarantee staff on short-term contracts security of tenure.  Naturally, some of those staff left for secure and permanent employment elsewhere.  Having said that, of the 11 staff who left, three were permanent staff who left for promotional grades and opportunities in other organisations.  There was an element of natural attrition, in other words, and my comments about uncertainty and an unsettled feeling related to staff on short-term contracts.</p> <p>  The NMBI is a completely self-funding organisation and relies on members' annual retention fee and other registration fees for its functioning.  We have had no other sources of revenue, except for two years ago when the Department contributed &euro;1.6 million towards the implementation of the new legislation.  We were then in position in which the revenue stream to the organisation was unexpectedly reduced.</p></speech>

Was that a once-off allocation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maura Pidgeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#G00400"><p>No.  The contribution of the HSE towards the careers centre is a long-established provision for the recruitment of students into the university programmes.  It had been significantly higher over the years but was reduced when nursing education went into the universities.  It is specifically targeted at mature applicants.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the increase in the annual retention fee.  Following consultation between the board, the Department of Health and key stakeholders, and in the interests of the continued provision of services through nursing care in the health service, the decision was taken to reset the fee to its original level of &euro;100.  There are ongoing negotiations between those parties on how the board can be funded to meet its obligations under the legislation.</p> <p>  There was a question about the total number of nurses and midwives on the register.  The figure of 62,000 relates to what we call the "live register".  An additional 20,000 nurses, including those who are retired, people working overseas and so on, are listed on the inactive register.  In regard to the breakdown of the employment status of the 62,000 nurses on the "live register", we have been in the process of collecting those data in recent months.  Having more comprehensive figures will help to inform workforce planning for the organisation.</p> <p>  There are 1,500 nursing and midwifery students in training in the Irish education system.  We do not have data on their retention within the workforce.  At the time of completion of their programme, all new graduates apply to come onto the register, but we do not have information on where they go thereafter.</p> <p>  In regard to EU applications, those numbers are over and above the number of home-grown Irish students.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Byrne to deal with the question of the verification of documentation.</p></speech>

Every document that is received from an applicant or on behalf of an applicant is scrutinised with a view to ensuring the information we require is there and that the document does not raise any concerns as to its authenticity.  That verification process involves examining not only the document itself but also the envelope in which it arrived.  In some instances in which we have had concerns regarding the authenticity of documentation, they have arisen on the basis of the envelope in which the papers were submitted.</p> <p>  There are several steps we go through to verify a document, depending on what it is.  For example, we require proof of English language competence for non-EU applicants through the International English Language Testing System, IELTS, test, and that this proof comes from source.  From the introduction of the IELTS mechanism in 2003 until very recently, that was done by way of IELTS posting us the results.  Now, however, we are able to access the results online.</p><p>However, there are 15 different steps in the process of authenticating the document.  If we identify a document about which we have doubts, we write to the applicant and say we have concerns about this document and ask them to provide an explanation or clarification of it.  In a large number of such cases - it is not a huge volume - we never hear from the applicant again.  A note is put on the file that we could not verify the authenticity of documents and the file and application are closed.  The application does not progress.</p></speech>

Then there are a number of supporting documents which must be received directly from source, such as the transcript of their training, a reference from their current or most recent employer and proof of their valid registration in other jurisdictions and their good standing.  As each of these documents come in we notify the applicant that we have received the document and we notify them of what is still outstanding.  They get a letter, but we are now moving towards e-mail communication with applicants as far as possible to speed it up.  We tell them we have received their application and that it appears to be complete or that they have not filled out a certain page or section.  When we receive their verification from other regulatory authorities we acknowledge receipt of it and we identify whether there are problems.  This is the primary area where, with additional resources, we wish to speed up the process of feedback to the applicant.  As Dr. Pidgeon said, we are also developing a facility on our website, which we hope will be live by the end of the year, whereby the applicant will be able to log on using a unique identifier and monitor their application and the receipt of documents.  That will cut down-----</p></speech>

It is simply the sheer volume of applications coming in and the ability to do even the initial identification of a shortage of documents.  This is one of the areas that the working group, which includes our partners and colleagues from the employers and their agents, is drilling into in terms of working together to address this issue.  In addition to targeting the backlog that has built up, another requirement is to work with employers if they wish to identify somebody and help applicants in the application process while they are overseas.  It is complex.  We have provided additional and more simplified information in that respect, but the issue is to work with them in identifying that before the forms even come in.  They are two elements of trying to deal with the backlog over time.</p> <p>  I will respond to Deputy Healy's questions.  To add to my response in respect of the staffing issues, it was 11 staff out of 51 that had left in the first six months of this year.  The process of recruitment is in hand.  There are internal mechanisms because there have been some promotional grades available, an opportunity for staff within the organisation, so it will be dealt with by the end of this month.  We are working closely with the Department of Health and the HSE in respect of utilising the Public Appointments Service as well as HSE deployment in order to select and recruit staff into the organisation.  That is in hand.  Further meetings, even tomorrow, on the logistics of getting additional staff into the organisation are taking place.</p></speech>

It is a self-funding organisation and, given the current circumstances with regard to the annual renewal fee, we are in discussions with the Department of Health about the ongoing funding of the organisation.</p> <p>  With respect to the number of students in training, that is determined at Department or Government policy level.  The number of students is not determined by the regulatory body.  However, the number of students has not decreased for several years and is still at 1,523.</p> <p>  Regarding a solution to the problems, several measures are being taken as we speak to address the criticality of the situation.  One of them is the board's approved spending plan.  The Department of Health has been very supportive with additional staff.  We have also reviewed, and had been reviewing, our internal registration processes in regard to simplifying the process and providing greater clarity of instruction and guidance to applicants.  That was in tandem with the development and restructuring of our website to have greater online capacity.  That will come on stream by the end of the year.  There will be a completely new website.  It is not just about a fancy page.  It is about the restructuring and the development of core applications to enable us to do our business online as a modern organisation.</p> <p>  Most importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we have listened to our colleagues in both the public and private sector in regard to the establishment of this working group.  It has met and the sub-groups are working on two focused areas.  One is to reduce the cycle time for overseas registration and the backlog.  The second relates to the area of adaptation courses and the maximum utilisation of those courses.  In addition, we are, and had been, using a call centre to deal with the volume of calls coming into the organisation and e-mail inquiries relating to registration and restoration.  The Department is supportive of our expanding that facility to address customer need in terms of responding to calls.</p> <p>  On the other areas of work, I believe we will get the situation under manageable control.</p><p>There is an increase in demand.  We are aware of a potential additional 1,500 vacancies to be filled throughout the sectors.  With regard to coming here from overseas, the applicants will advise through the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals.  We are putting systems in place and we have identified an internal manager to support the overseas project so we can clear the backlog and develop a robust and sustainable process to prevent further backlogs of this nature.</p></speech>

Adaptation courses can be provided in any health care facility approved by the board for students.  Facilities must apply for approval and show compliance with the standards we have set.</p></speech>

I was told when visiting nursing homes in Dun Laoghaire that some of them may have to close beds because they do not have nurses.  HIQA instructed one nursing home to stop taking in residents until it is able to fill its nursing vacancies.  I am particularly worried about nursing homes.  I understand that public health is of huge importance.  What is the status of the applicants who have been in the process for longer than 12 months?</p> <p>  I am delighted to hear there will be an online facility.  It is how one applies for many careers.  One must fill in the form on screen to progress.  It is something the witnesses should examine.</p> <p>  A number of care staff working in nursing homes are qualified nurses who do not have registration.  They have been waiting for 12 or 18 months and feel totally frustrated.  They are nurses but they are not recognised here as such.  I have been told they make an application but there is no response until they are told the application is being reviewed six months later.  It is a very untimely process.  I absolutely understand the staffing issues but if we must close down nursing homes and hospitals are backed up with acute beds being kept by patients we have a serious problem.  This is why we want the witnesses to sort it out or tell us how to sort it out.</p></speech>

This is obviously a much more challenging time than in the days when six or seven Irish nursing schools provided all the graduates that were needed.  Circumstances are now very different.</p> <p>  Having had extensive representations made to me by individual nurses and their representatives at the time of the proposed increase in the retention fee, I learned they have a number of concerns that need to be addressed.  There was a sense that increasing the fee by 80% over two fee cycles in two years seemed hard to justify.  The nurses asked repeatedly what extra they were getting for the 80% increase in the retention fee over the cycle.  It is important that the delegates and members know that a consistent refrain I heard from many nurses - I am not saying I agree with their perspective - was that the board appeared to have two functions, the first of which was to take nurses' money and the second of which was to discipline them.  This was certainly a widespread opinion among registrants.</p> <p>  Nurses felt they had suffered disproportionately the effects of personal circumstances cutbacks during the recession.  Like everyone else, they were subject to the universal social charge.  Since they were mostly public servants, they sometimes had very substantial decreases in pay.  Many of them had depended on what had been non-discretionary overtime, which disappeared.  More important, many of them felt they were working much harder.  They were working harder because there were fewer replacement posts being filled and people were being allowed to retire.  The increased attention paid to the capping of staff numbers within publicly funded institutions meant retiring colleagues were not being replaced.  These were all concerns of the nurses.  Many of them asked where the board was when these issues were arising.  They wanted to know what position of public advocacy it was taking.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions.  The board tells us it is understaffed, which I accept.  We are well used to hearing that a body run by the public service is likely to be either understaffed or "malstaffed".  By how many is the board understaffed?  What is the budgetary shortfall required to refill the positions?  I am not trying to be provocative but feel this is an opportunity to bring points to the attention of the board that were brought to my attention.  Nursing members had concerns about how the board's money was spent.  They wanted to learn how much was being spent on public relations, travel and other items.  I am sure all these expenses were legitimate but the nurses questioned whether there were opportunities for cost savings.  At the time, they were wondering whether the cost savings could have been passed on with smaller retention fees.  Could the cost savings be passed on by hiring extra staff to do what is required?</p> <p>  Many Irish graduate nurses train in medical schools with which the board is very familiar.  The board knows all about these schools and the individuals concerned, who have been with the board for many years.  Re-registration of somebody with this background should be very simple by comparison with the registration of somebody who may have come from a medical school on a different continent, bearing in mind the interrogation of credentials.  A foreign nursing school may be a very fine one, but the board may not be familiar with it.  Is there any degree of cross-subsidisation of the current expenses?  Are the relatively simple registration requirements of Irish and EU-trained nurses being used to subsidise the appropriate interrogation of the credentials of nurses coming from schools that are less well known?</p> <p>  I have raised the question of fees on several occasions when it looked like we were facing a shutdown in the health service on this issue.  Many nurses said they would not pay the increased fee.  I am thankful that there was an outbreak of compromise and common sense.  The then Minister gently reproached me and said I misunderstood the function of the board.  I was told there was one function only, namely, to protect the public.  I kind of get that.  There is a need to protect the public but if one is entirely protecting the public, the public should pay for it.  If one is protecting the public and also defending the standards of the profession and individuals in the profession, then it is appropriate that those in the profession should pay some component of the fee.</p> <p>  We have in Ireland a tendency to follow the tombstone principle, which is the principle enunciated in the world of air safety.  Rather than trying to prevent crashes, most of the great air safety organisations wait until a crash has occurred and then investigate what happened.  In air traffic circles, prevention would involve advocacy of telemetry and real-time monitoring of cockpit management, etc.  I get the sense we do in our health service what is being done in the world of air safety.  We have a very unsafe health service.  We have a health service which, in all the critical front-line areas, is grotesquely understaffed.  Staff are overworked and expected to do jobs they are sometimes not trained to do at all.  In these circumstances, there is a higher frequency of adverse outcomes, lawsuits and general quality queries than in other equivalently sophisticated health systems.  I have made the point to HIQA, and now make the point to the board, that it is important that those concerned prospectively rap the knuckles of the people who hire the nurses and make decisions.  It is important that they tell them there are problems they need to fix and that they should not be depending on the board to come in as the police force afterwards to investigate people who, sometimes in difficult circumstances, produce outcomes that are not as good as they should be.</p></speech>

I will have to blame traffic.  However, I read the witnesses' document.  Just to point out, "An Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann" is spelled wrongly at the top, but that is a minor point.</p> <p>  Like Senator Crown, I had serious concerns at the start of the year about the registration retention fee and how that issue was handled.  I have had greater concerns since about the way the organisation is being run.  The statute requires that it be run independently.  At the time when we in the Seanad were raising the issue of the extortionate increase in the fee, the Minister for Health was telling us he had no role whatsoever in it.  However, the witnesses have told the committee that the organisation changed the policy in consultation with the Department of Health.  Under what statutory provision was that done?</p> <p>  I am also interested in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland seems to be a party to it, as nurses have been given the commitment that there will be no increase in fees until 2019.</p></speech>

Was political pressure put on it?  The corollary of my second question is whether the Department is forcing the board down a particular route to reduce its income stream, resulting in it not being able to carry out its functions while being unable to replace that income.  The Department seems to be forcing it on various issues, including that of fees, contrary to its statutory independence and reducing its income without replacing that income.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I will go straight into my few questions.  It was mentioned that the board received &euro;1.6 million to help implement the legislation.  I note that the witnesses stated the legislation also provided for a mandatory competence assurance scheme, which has not been commenced yet.  We are nearly three years on.  Why has it not been commenced and when is it likely to happen?</p> <p>  I noted that, according to the document, it takes approximately one week to register 1,500 new nurses.  It also mentioned a backlog in the re-registration of the approximately 1,400 people who left the list.  Given that 1,500 can be registered from scratch in seven days, surely it should only take a couple of days to re-register the 1,400 and issue their certificates.  I am sure it is only a few clicks of a button, although perhaps not.  Will the witnesses go through this issue?</p> <p>  I do not know whether my next point is relevant to the board, but I will make it anyway.  There are 1,500 graduates, but it sounds as if we need more and that, if we had more, we would not have issues with applications from EU and non-EU countries and the constant problems with paperwork.</p></speech>

Perhaps I will respond first to Senator Crown's questions as we await the return of other members.  I thank the Senator for his questions.  The rationale for the increase in the annual retention fee has been well documented.  The fee was increased in two consecutive years due to the low cost base on which the organisation had been operating for some time.  In 2013, the board proposed to increase the fee to &euro;140 in 2014.  Given the circumstances, however, it decided to leave the fee at &euro;100, with a view to increasing it in 2014 for the 2015 annual retention process.  The reason for the fee increase was simply the cost of implementing in full the new legislation and the subsequent need to modernise the organisation.  This involved the development and replacement of old information and communications technology, not to a highly sophisticated level but to a level that would allow a modern organisation to conduct its business.  The fee was primarily due to the cost of implementing the new legislation, which amounted to more than &euro;8 million in a four-year period.</p><p>The cost as a result of the new legislation was in excess of &euro;8 million over that period of time.  The issue of how the organisation and regulatory body is viewed by those we register is of concern.  We are mindful of it and one of our objectives, as we work our way through the implementation of the new legislation and conduct our business, is to create greater awareness of what it is to be regulated and how regulation can support individual nurses in the advancement of their practice on a daily basis.  </p><p> The sole of objective of the regulatory body is to protect and safeguard the public from people referring to themselves as nurses who may not have met the competencies or who have impaired standards.  We do that through the setting of standards for education, continual professional guidance and the code of professional conduct.  In that respect, the public interest is addressed through the setting of standards for nurses and midwives.  </p><p> In respect of value for money and the costs of running the organisation, the nursing board, under the new legislation, comes under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The board's accounts have been audited by it for 2012 and 2013 and the process has not made any adverse findings to include in the report of the accounts of the public services that were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The accounts for 2014 have recently been completed and no matters of substance emerged during the course of this audit.  </p><p> With respect to the costs of replacing staff who have left the organisation, the overall cost would be in the region of &euro;500,000.  These costs had been budgeted for in the business case for the original fee of &euro;150.  </p><p> With regard to travel, as the Senator would be aware, international work is a routine and normal part of the work of the regulator, in particular regulators of health professionals which is very much a global activity.  The recognition and appreciation of the developments of nursing and midwifery in Ireland is recognised across the world and in order to sustain that development and apply evidence-based practice to our regulation, it is important the board continue that international work.  The international work and participation in international forums and networks is no different to that of my predecessors over the years.  I am contractually obliged to carry out this work.  As I said in regard to auditing, all of the travel costs have been audited and are in compliance with Department policy.</p><p> With respect to the tombstone approach, there are three elements and I appreciate that nurses and midwives do not always see the middle element of regulation.  First is registration and second is maintaining nurses' competence while on the register.  We have continued to do that during the past four years through the launch of a new code of professional conduct and ethical practice.  We recently approved a new scope of professional practice for nurses and midwives which will enable and facilitate greater latitude in the work nurses and midwives can do.  We have revised the practice standards for midwives.  Our revision to the undergraduate standards and requirements for the education of nurses and midwives will go to the board for approval in the autumn.</p><p> We are, in conjunction with the HSE, revising our guidelines for the management of medications.  A multidisciplinary forum is revising the policy and standards on nurse prescribing.  We address the professional development of nurses and midwives.  On registration and renewal, I will defer to Ms Byrne who can provide some of the detail on that and can explain why it is more complex.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ursula Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#Q00200"><p>In terms of the comparison in timelines between Irish trained registrants and those who trained abroad, when Irish trained registrants start their education programme, they go on our candidate register.  We already have them on our database and have assessed their identification document.  Once they complete their programme and are signed off as being suitable to register by the head of the college and the director of nursing in the primary hospital where they had their placements, that process is very quick.  </p> <p>  In terms of individuals who were taken off the register for not paying their fees and their restoration to the register, once we receive their application for restoration forms, which they can download from the website and send to us by email, and we have received payment of the restoration fee their restoration is complete within three working days.  The issuing of a certificate of registration takes a bit longer than it would have done in previous years because of the volume this year, but they are legally entitled to be back in the workplace after three working days because their employer will be able to see on the online register that their registration has been restored.</p> <p>  A number of committee members asked about incomplete documentation.  This does not just involve issues with the application form which the applicant nurse submits to us.  It also involves issues to do with the supporting documentation which they must get from other sources.  Somebody who is Irish trained will find the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is somewhat of a one stop shop in that we provide verification that the person is registered, is in good standing with us and that his or her education programme met certain requirements.  Somebody coming into the country may need to go to three different institutions to get that information and send it into us.  He or she does not get all of the information from one place, depending on what country he or she comes from.  </p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned people who are already working in this country.  Ironically, that may work against them because if they are in their home country and there is a delay in getting documentation from third parties, they can visit the offices of that third party and speed up the process.  There are great difficulties in some countries which are outside of our control, in terms of applicants getting documents.  There are also some countries where the documents come to us in a format that raises persistent queries about the content of the documents.  This is an area where we work with recruiters so that if they are going to a particular country to recruit we can advise them as to the particular issues in that country.  If the documentation is incomplete, we try to speed up the process of informing the applicant of exactly what is missing or needs to be clarified.  </p> <p>  There was a question about what might be the issue after the assessment process.</p><p>This is information that primarily relates to the content of the transcript of training that the person sends in to us.  It is only when that has undergone detailed scrutiny that questions arise, usually in respect of particular countries where there are issues, where it is not possible to make a decision until certain queries have been raised about the content of the person's education programme.</p><p> The other issue raised about education programmes relates particularly to the numbers undertaking their education programmes in Ireland.  The number of places on courses is a matter for the Department of Health.  It would, however, always consult with us on this matter.  Programmes must also meet our requirements and standards so that we can be satisfied that at the end of the programme the student has had the requisite education and clinical experience.  One of the key issues in respect of the number of students on programmes is that there must be sufficient staff in the clinical sites to support the supervised clinical practice and assessment of students.  If in the morning there was to be a vast increase in the number of students, the clinical sites would not be able to support that.  These are the same clinical sites that support overseas applicants undertaking adaptation placements.  It is a question of getting that balance correct.</p></speech>

That is why we have been listening and have engaged in open information sessions and workshops to deal with the timeframes around the cycle and the adaptation programmes.  The restructuring of our website will provide for some online capacity in the initial stages this year.  The procurement of an information management system for registration will allow for infinitely more online capacity and the development of a smoother system for registration of all calibres.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Byrne, we fully endorse his acknowledgement of the work of midwifery.  There has been a huge emphasis on the work of midwives across Ireland, and in May we revised the practice standards for midwives.  The standards for education and training of midwives will soon go before the board.  One of the key elements of the change in the legislation is the acknowledgement of midwifery as a profession independent of nursing.  It is important and appreciated that Senator Byrne appreciates the work of the midwives.</p> <p>  I apologise for not picking up on the typo.</p></speech>

In respect of the Senator&rsquo;s point about the concerns about the running of the organisation, I hope it is clear that the organisation has been going through an enormous period of change and during that period there will be considerable stresses within the organisation at different times.  The exceptional circumstances that the organisation has had to cope with over the past six months have not helped that situation.  Given the circumstances, I have to acknowledge the enormous work and commitment of the staff in the organisation in registering the number of nurses we have now.</p> <p>  As a State agency, we are self-funded.  Independent regulation is a cornerstone of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011, as it is for all the health professions.  Needless to say, within that structure there are reporting and oversight mechanisms in the parent Department, and there would always be consultation and discussion about issues pertaining to the organisation, funding and policy direction.

Under the new legislation, we brought the staff, or some of them, from that organisation into the board.</p> <p>  The mandatory competence assurance scheme is part of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  It has not yet been commenced.  The development work is quite substantial and costly.  We have had to defer a large part of the development.  We can develop the model, but the roll-out and management - the business model - have had to be deferred, given the funding arrangements.</p> <p>  With regard to the question about having more graduates, as I said in response to a previous question, that is a matter for the Department of Health in respect of number of students.</p></speech>

Is the documentation they use in the UK not accepted in Ireland?  Why can they be registered quickly there when it takes so long to do it here?  We have 1,398 people with incomplete documentation.</p></speech>

What was the role of the board in that?  What on earth is role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in that organisation?  Is the board being told not to collect money?  We have been told that under statute it can and must collect money to fund the organisation.  It has, however, been told politically not to do so by the Government, which is not giving any extra funding to make up the difference.  The result is that the witnesses have been dragged in to this committee to hear a load of complaints from all of us about how they are running the organisation.  I am not trying to defend the fee increase, by the way.  Is there political interference going on to suit a Government agenda which is having a negative impact on the organisation?</p></speech>

I am delighted they have come before us to clarify some points.</p> <p>  Going back to the first response Dr. Pidgeon gave on the nine recently recruited staff, she said the contracts were for six months and used the phrase "full-time".  Those are not permanent posts.  There is no security.  One of the issues that contributed to the departure of 11 people over the first six months of the year was insecurity and the general sense of things within the organisation.  Surely the anchorage that is needed is job certainty and security.  Does Dr. Pidgeon hope to be able to make these temporary positions, as they clearly are, into permanent posts?  Is that something she envisages in the short term?  I would be of the view that the numbers currently presenting are likely to maintain themselves for some considerable time.  Surely this is a requirement in order to deal with the work levels that are presenting for the NMBI now and into the future.</p></speech>

The processing can be quite complicated and Ms Byrne is best placed to provide clarity.</p></speech>

However, closing files requires resources and we took a decision to prioritise trying to progress those files that are still active and ongoing, rather than diverting resources to closing others.  When our staffing numbers are back to the required levels, we will review whether those files can be progressed or closed.  It is not in anybody's interests to have applications through the system.</p> <p>  For those who are working as care staff in Ireland and have applied, the fact that they are physically in this country does not change the dynamic of their applications, except that they may find it more difficult to get their supporting documents.  We are trying to increase the level of feedback to applicants on where their applications are in the system and how they are progressing.  We have very long-standing, ongoing communication with our colleagues in the UK.  The UK system, which was recently revamped, is on a par with our own in terms of the documents required and level of complexity of the process.  I would question whether people are able to get registered in the UK within a matter of weeks.  There are no short cuts in the UK and their process is as rigorous as ours.</p></speech>

The staff that we are replacing are temporary staff on a short-term contract for a period of six months.  The reasons for that are, first, that we have to finalise the funding of the organisation - creating permanent positions in the absence of firm funding arrangements into the future would not be very prudent.  The second reason for the short-term contracts is that we wish to address the current crisis in terms of the backlog and fixing and enhancing our processes.  On that basis, we will evaluate the progress being made because with enhanced systems and with more online capacity as we get towards the end of the year, there may not be the need for the same numbers of staff.  It will be evaluated over that period of time.</p></speech>

Our elderly population are a pivotal part of the health system, so it is important to examine the issues involved.  Today's discussion is therefore opportune and welcome.</p><p>Before we begin, I must advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Professor O'Shea to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

The financial, emotional and social costs are high.  Public knowledge is improving but attitudes remain largely negative.  People with dementia and their carers are certainly one of the most vulnerable and invisible in society.</p> <p>  Ireland has an ageing population and therefore the numbers with dementia are likely to grow, particularly among the very old.  The fastest growth area in the population is that aged 80 or older, so we are likely to see an increase in dementia numbers.  There are just under 50,000 people with dementia in the country.  By 2041, that number will have trebled to roughly 140,000 people.  The numbers will increase, so the big challenge is to find ways of addressing some of the needs associated with dementia.  The South Tipperary Dementia Pilot Project is about trying at an early stage to get to the heart of caring for those with dementia in their own homes.</p> <p>  We have done some work on the main costs of dementia nationally and, relative to other diseases, dementia has a huge cost.  Our calculations show that the annual cost of dementia is about &euro;1.9 billion, which is a significant cost relative to treating heart disease or cancer.  The main driver of those costs are family carers who essentially provide most of the care for those with dementia.  Approximately 50% of the costs are associated with family carers when a value is put on their informal care.  This makes it different from other diseases whose treatment is associated with technology.</p> <p>  Residential care costs are also high but, interestingly, primary and community care costs are pretty low.  This is because we have not yet got to the point where we are providing such services.  This is an important point to note in the context of what Dr. Crowe and Ms Leonard will say later.  Dementia is a different type of issue than the normal things we come up against in health where many costs are taken up by high technology and acute care.  This is what makes it different.</p> <p>  The current realities include a lack of focus on preventing dementia, which is not often talked about.  Some dementia issues have a preventative aspect, especially with regard to heart disease and stroke.  We therefore need to concentrate on what we can prevent.  Diagnosis is still largely poor and there is a stigma associated with it.  Many people are unaware of the disease.  The majority of the 48,000 I spoke of earlier would not have a diagnosis, which makes it very different from other illnesses.  If it is unknown, we do not do enough about it.</p> <p>  Community care is largely fragmented and incomplete, although some valuable work is being done.  We need to put the focus firmly on home-based care, supporting families and individualised and personalised care.  Dr. Crowe will say that having that link to the clinical lead and having a focus on individualised and personalised care is a new dimension for caring for people with dementia in this country.</p> <p>  We know the Government's policy and we have just had a national dementia strategy, but the key is how we implement it.  It is good that the strategy is there and the objective is to keep people in their own homes for as long as possible and practicable.  The implementation of that strategy is the key element.  We are hot on the heels of other countries that have national dementia strategies.  The emphasis is on diagnosis, finding pathways to care that support those with dementia, personalised care, and having adequate residential care.</p> <p>  The national dementia strategy must be framed in a philosophy which is about person-centred care and personhood.  It is also about the capabilities, inclusiveness and inclusivity of those with dementia within the system.  The critical element of the implementation strategy is how to get to the person with dementia and their family carer in a way that will enhance the care experience.  Dr. Crowe will speak later on about the South Tipperary Dementia Pilot Project, which is essentially wrapped up in a person-centred, personhood model.</p> <p>  The focus of implementing the national dementia strategy should be on the person with dementia, the family carer, and looking after people in their own homes.  If we manage to do so, it will not only have a health benefit but will also have a potential economic benefit.  If we can keep people out of residential care, it will be a major and valuable addition to resource allocation.  Dr. Crowe will demonstrate that with some figures.</p> <p>  This brings me to what we need to do differently and why the south Tipperary project is so important.  The current policy is encompassed in four or five key words.  This is not only for Ireland but also internationally, where we need to move to a new model.  Currently, we tend to think about dementia as individual, overly biological, and in terms of residential care, risk, deficits and exclusion.  We must transform care from a world where these words - individual, biological, residential, risk, deficits and exclusion - are in common usage.  Can we transform that world into one where we see dementia in some sense of collective, society and home-based care?  Can we move from risk to examining people's capabilities, what they can still do, and how they can still engage in society and the local community?  If we can move towards thinking of older people with dementia as significant assets in local communities and also moving from exclusion to inclusion, that is the real challenge.  That is what is interesting about what Dr. Crowe is going to say - the transformation of a model from exclusion to inclusion.</p></speech>

That is what should be emphasised in a national dementia strategy.  To have that transformation, we need to challenge the following.  We need to think of dealing with dementia as the most important aspect of ageing.  We can talk about financing and communicating, but dealing with dementia is the really significant issue.  We need to mobilise political and intellectual resources to support a liberating national dementia strategy.  We need to make the national dementia strategy real and tangible for people living in their own homes.  We need to create an understanding of dementia in society.   We need to agree key priorities.  For me, the key priority is to support individualised person-centred care for people in their own homes and communities.  We need to support the practice of personhood.  That is the challenge for everyone.  It is not just for the deliverers of care or families but for the political system.  Do we have the vision, courage and capacity to imagine a new paradigm, a new model, for people with dementia and, more importantly, activate the national dementia strategy to support this vision?

I am a consultant in old age psychiatry in south Tipperary and I lead a project called The Five Steps to Living Well with Dementia.  It is a very innovative project and we are delighted to have the opportunity to present it to the committee today.  As Professor O'Shea said, dementia is a huge problem now but it is going to be a much bigger problem when the population with dementia trebles by 2041.  To put this in context, I ask members to step into the shoes of one of our patients.  Perhaps they can imagine being an 80 year old woman looking after an 82 year old husband with dementia.  He has been up all night, trying to get dressed and go home to his own mother, whom he believes is still alive, and when morning comes, both husband and wife are exhausted.  Whom does she turn to or whom can she ring, and, if she rings someone, can they do anything to help?  That person and that scenario are part of our wish to transform things.<br/><br/>As HSE staff, we understand just how difficult the health service can be to navigate, even for those working within the service, so we can imagine how difficult it is for an 80 year old carer to know where to go to find real help - not just a listening ear but someone who can do something to fix the problem.  These are the people who have been at the heart of our project, and it is their experiences we have been trying to change.<br/><br/>We were very lucky in 2012 when we were awarded funding of &euro;700,000 over three years to design new ways of supporting people with dementia.  It was unimaginable for us, as clinicians, to get that funding from Atlantic Philanthropies and the HSE through a charity called Genio.  We had to compete for that funding but we were one of four sites chosen nationally.  We were given that funding to go away and make a difference.  One of the big things they wanted, which really appealed to us, was that people with dementia and their carers would be at the centre of all that planning.  It was a very novel way of doing business.  We were all the table - people with dementia, carers, HSE staff, HSE management and voluntary bodies.  It was a completely new way of doing business, from the bottom up.  It was a matter of looking at what was already there and what was needed.  The aim was to design a better way of doing things, and there was the money to do it.  In our wildest dreams, that would not happen in anyone's career, so it was a huge joy to us all to try to make things better, because anything we could do would be better than the situation at present. <br/><br/>Professor O'Shea talked about the statistics, which are frightening.  We are not doing a great job with the 48,000 people we have at present and we really need to do things very differently in order to make things better.  Over the years, as clinicians, we gave a lot of thought to what might work better and we did a lot of service development.  I set up the old age psychiatry service in south Tipperary, the geriatricians set up geriatric medicine and, jointly, we set up a memory clinic to diagnose dementia, as well as a day care centre for people with dementia.  The more services we set up, however, the more the gaps became apparent, including gaps in information, in support and in respite.  While we could set up the services, where did people go when things went wrong?  That was a big issue that we wanted to fix.<br/><br/>We were very worried about how little support existed at a time of crisis.  It is okay getting regular support, but what if the carer got sick?  If that lady I spoke about broke her leg, where would she go?  We had an example of a woman who was looking after her husband with dementia.  She had to go to hospital with heart failure but took herself home prematurely to mind him because he could not be left on his own.  We have been able to rectify that through the service and the project we put together, and I will tell the committee later how we did that.<br/><br/>We knew the service was fragmented and we wanted to change it in every way.  We were also very mindful of the emerging national dementia strategy and our projects were chosen to provide evidence that would guide the development of that strategy.  In fact, I was asked to be on the working group that developed the strategy and I am now on the monitoring group that is monitoring its implementation.  In every way, the core objectives of the strategy have been absolutely embedded in all our work.  We have not been doing anything that is separate or different.  We were totally prioritising the objectives of the strategy, which are building awareness of dementia and destigmatising it, better diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and better support for people in the community.<br/><br/>The whole consortium of 26 people - those with dementia, carers and all of us - sat down and we asked ourselves what we wanted to do.  We said that we wanted to change the world for people with dementia.  We wanted to transform the life experience of people with dementia and their carers, increase awareness of the illness among the public, dispel the myths, reduce stigma and encourage people to come forward earlier for diagnosis and treatment.  Most of all, we wanted to provide flexible, person-centred care in the home so people could remain living at home for as long as possible.<br/><br/>I want to give a sense of some of our achievements as we are coming to the end of the project.  We have established a single point of contact for dementia.  A person can ring one number in south Tipperary and get a very highly trained clinician - a clinical nurse specialist in dementia - who will answer that call and solve the person's problem.  Therefore, the lady whose husband is up all night will not just get advice; she will get practical care that will resolve the situation for her.  It is transformational.  She does not have to ring 20 people who will tell her to ring somebody else.  We can solve it with an expert.<br/><br/>We ran a huge awareness raising campaign through developing the role of the community connector.  The community connector has worked in health promotion and prevention, as well as in building awareness about dementia through talks in pharmacies, Men's Sheds, resource centres, day-care centres - you name it, she was there.  She has worked with the ICA and Meals on Wheels and run pop-up shops.  She also did a lot of work promoting the prevention message.  The risk factors for heart disease are now the same risk factors as for dementia.  If people manage those risk factors - for example, a bad diet, smoking, obesity and diabetes - they can delay and prevent dementia and even Alzheimer's.  While that is not widely known, it is an important public health message to get out there.  The community connector has been very busy with all of that.<br/><br/>We have run a very effective local media campaign, with monthly interviews on Tipp FM, our local radio station, which are available on our website as podcasts.  Tipp FM is also making a documentary as a legacy to the project.  Our website gets 4,000 hits a month and our Facebook page gets 2,000 to 3,000 hits a week, so there is huge interest.  We were on &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot; and <i>The Irish Times</i>covered a conference in May at which Professor O'Shea spoke.  I was on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning before I came here because RTE picked up on the issue from this committee's press briefing, which is great.  Media awareness has been very important because it is about putting out the word that people can live well with dementia.<br/><br/>One of the biggest things we have done is to develop an innovative service, the dementia support workers service.  The dementia support workers are specially trained and selected people whom we put into people's homes.  For example, we pay their car insurance so they can take people with dementia out of their homes.They are not the home help or the home care attendant, and we do not want to substitute for those services because people need those too.  The idea is that the dementia support workers would re-engage people in the world and get them back doing things they had given up or taking up new interests and activities they had not even considered before.<br/><br/>We know that social stimulation and brain stimulation are as important as diet and exercise in preventing and delaying deterioration in dementia.  For example, we have a man back playing golf again who had given it up.  It is one of our dementia support workers who is taking him out to do that and he is now teaching her how to play.  Other people are going to the gym or swimming, and, for some, it might be a case of just going shopping again.  It is about facilitating them and not letting the disability get in the way, not doing something for them but enabling them to do something for themselves, so they are visible and participating in the world.<br/><br/>We provide routine, short-term care, but the most valuable service these workers provide is crisis care.  If a person is in a crisis situation, he or she rings our specialist clinic, which is a single point of contact, and we can provide care straight away that is responsive, flexible and non-bureaucratic.  There are no forms to fill because we fill in the forms.  It is not like the person makes an application and it goes to a meeting in three weeks' time.  Nobody can wait for that.  If the carer has broken a leg, he or she needs care immediately.  We are able to go out and fix the problem, provide immediate care and help them out until the natural supports take over.  Of course, the natural supports are there in the form of family and friends, who are amazing, but this service has made a huge difference to families who are receiving it in south Tipperary.  If a carer gets sick suddenly, or if a person is coming home from hospital and the carer is not sure whether they can manage if the nights have been disturbed, we can supply the service.  We have had people coming home from nursing homes who use the service.  We are really pleased with it.  The whole project is being evaluated externally by Professor O'Shea and Professor Suzanne Cahill from Trinity College, and in our own evaluations, 97% of people are saying this is keeping their loved one at home.<br/><br/>We have also developed the first memory technology library for dementia in Ireland, located in the grounds of the South Tipperary General Hospital.  It was set up by our occupational therapist and people can come there and view all sorts of telecare and stand-alone products that are helping in managing dementia, such as one-button radios and simple clocks.  That service is open to the whole country.  Everything we are doing is open to anyone who is on our website but the actual service is at the moment just funded for south Tipperary.  We have had many conferences and training days and we have actually changed the mindset of the HSE locally, which means it has really come on board with this and has increased its provision of home help to people with dementia living alone; it is now at a level of up to four times a day in response to our project.  Therefore, the HSE, which co-funds this project and for which we work, is really on board and wants to do things differently.</p><p> The lady who is looking after her husband had heart failure but took herself home from hospital to mind him.  We got a call from the public health nurse and went there immediately.  We put dementia support workers into the house to take care of the husband so the lady could recuperate and get better at her own pace.  He was safe and still at home.  We were able to give that support for a few days until the daughter came home from abroad.  In the pre-project days, she would have had to go back to hospital and he would have to go there too, which he did not need.  This is all in line with the strategy and it is absolutely where we need to go.  It has been hugely successful in south Tipperary.</p><p> We are coming to the end of our funding.  Our project will end on 8 October and our funding runs out on 29 August.  We are involved in very positive discussions with the HSE, locally and nationally.  We have met all the Ministers.  We have met the Ministers of State, Deputies Lynch and Hayes, and the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Our Deputies, Deputies Healy and McGrath, have been very supportive.  There is huge interest in not just sustaining this project but in rolling it out nationally.  We think we have developed this great funding and opportunity, and a solution to supporting people at home which is totally in line with the strategy.</p></speech>

I represent the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  For those who are not sure about what we do, we work across the country, in the heart of local communities, providing dementia-specific services and supports.  In 2014 we provided just over 1 million hours of care to approximately 9,500 people with dementia.  The services we deliver include home care, day care, Alzheimer caf&eacute;s, social clubs, cognitive stimulation therapy, dementia advisors, a helpline, care training and care support groups.  We are also an advocacy organisation and we advocate for the rights and needs of those living with dementia and their carers.  The voice of the person with dementia and that of the carer is at the heart of what we do.</p><p>They are closely involved in our work.<br/><br/>In 2012, only three years ago, the World Health Organization described dementia as one of the most serious social challenges facing the world today.  This is a significant statement and it is against that background that I address the joint committee.  As Professor O'Shea noted, the population is ageing and this will lead to exponential growth in the incidence of dementia in the coming years because age is the key risk factor.  Assuming current trends will continue, the number of people with dementia, which stands at 48,000, will treble within one generation.  We must also remember that 4,000 people under 65 years of age have dementia, and for every person with the condition, three others are significantly affected.  Dementia is, therefore, a major social, health and economic issue.  I am sure everyone present knows someone with the condition, as it extremely rare that a family is untouched by it.  It is useful to provide again, in synopsis, the wider context which Professor O'Shea described.<br/><br/>Professor O'Shea, in outlining the cost of dementia care, pointed out that almost half the cost of care is borne by informal family carers.  The largest share of Government expenditure on dementia care is allocated to long-term residential care, which is provided in the later part of the journey of those with dementia.<br/><br/>Dementia is a progressive illness which may last from two years to 20 years.  An increasing number of people are being diagnosed with the condition in a timely manner and at an earlier stage.  Cognitive ability is greater and different at the start of the journey than it is at its end.  I am generalising in this respect because the journey is different for everyone.  However, with 63% of people with dementia living in the community, the services required range from signposting services, providing links to local health care teams, clubs and caf&eacute;s and other social facilities that allow people to be involved in society and, subsequently, day care and home care.  Only much later and where absolutely necessary is residential care required.  Virtually all Government expenditure on dementia care is focused on the end of the journey and only a tiny fraction of it is allocated to these other services.  We ask the Government to consider how expenditure can be rebalanced to reflect reality.<br/><br/>The reason we all have the same message about community supports for people with dementia is that all of them and their family members express a preference for staying at home and receiving the support they need to do so.  This makes economic sense because it is also the cheaper option.  A recent European study, for example, showed that it was twice as expensive to provide residential care than dementia-specific home care.  This is an important finding.  In addition, there is plenty of expertise available to provide the services required, as Dr. Crowe explained.<br/><br/>The first national dementia strategy was published a little more than six months ago.  While the strategy could be transformative, there are certain limitations to its implementation, not least that only three specific actions have received funding.  We thank Atlantic Philanthropies, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health for providing these funds.  The three areas for which funding has been provided are general practitioner training, general awareness and specific interventions.  Much more needs to be done.  We want to ensure the needs that are not being met in the current system will be met in future.  The current system is characterised by poor rates of diagnosis, low levels of post-diagnostic support, patchy and inequitable provision of care and a society that pushes people with dementia to the margins.  The issue of stigma has been referred to by previous speakers.  There is no pathway of care available for those making the journey I described, which lasts for between two and 20 years.<br/><br/>The two themes addressed in our pre-budget submission are, first, staying at home and, second, promoting independence at home.  With 63% of people with dementia living at home, nursing home care should only be an option when the person needs a high level of care.  People should not enter long-term residential care as a result of poor community-based supports.  With appropriate community supports and interventions, people stay at home for longer, thus delaying the need to fund the costs of nursing home care.  We call for intensive dementia-specific care to be extended beyond the eight pilot sites funded under the national dementia strategy.  Funding of &euro;22.7 million has been provided for intensive home care packages for people with dementia linked to the hospital discharge crisis.  This will positively affect 500 people with dementia living in eight specific geographic areas.  This funding has been provided to enable people in acute hospital settings to return to the community.<br/><br/>We want to promote resilience and independence at home.  With approximately 48,000 people having been diagnosed with dementia, the provision of home care packages for only 500 people is a drop in the ocean.  The individuals in question are a specific cohort of people who clearly have significant needs as they are already in hospital settings.  We call for this pilot project to be extended to all local health regions at an estimated cost of &euro;30.2 million.<br/><br/>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland is a national non-profit, dementia-specific care provider with a presence in every county.  I referred to the different types of services we deliver.  We have experienced a disproportionate decrease in funding from the Health Service Executive in the past seven years.  As a section 39 organisation, part of our funding is provided by the HSE, with the remainder generated through fund-raising efforts.  In 2008, the HSE grant covered the cost of 74.5% of our services.  In 2014, the HSE grant covered only 67% of the cost of our services.  The organisation requires a further &euro;2.1 million each year if it is to return to the 2008 position.  While we have continued to meet the needs of people with dementia, these needs are increasing.  At the same time, our income from the HSE is reducing and we cannot assume that we can make up the difference through fund-raising.  With the general practitioner training and public awareness work that is being financed under the national dementia strategy, more people will present seeking services and support.  There is, therefore, a real picture of need, and funding is required to deliver it.<br/><br/>Staying at home is the first theme of our submission.  The second, promoting independence at home, is strongly related to the first and also falls under the umbrella of community.  It also links in to the contributions of Professor O'Shea and Dr. Crowe.  Post-diagnostic support includes not only traditional methods of care, as these may not be suitable or desired, but additional interventions that help to maintain a person's independence.  Our first recommendation for promoting independence at home is that funding be provided for a national dementia adviser service<b>.  </b>As a result of restructuring in the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, we have been able to fund eight dementia advisers.  These operate as signposters, if one likes, who link in with families to provide information on what services are available.  An evaluation of this type of service in the United Kingdom found that it plays a significant role in enabling people with dementia and carers to re-narrate their lives and find a new life that has meaning, value and purpose.  Our eight dementia advisers deliver a service to almost 2,000 people.  We would like to extend this service to each county and estimate that it would cost &euro;1.56 million to do so.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>Dr. Crowe referred to teams linking up with people with dementia in the community.  In this context, we make a recommendation that centres on case management and collaborative care.  Evidence shows that a case management approach in the community reduces the likelihood of institutionalisation, increases independence and so forth.  One of the priority actions in the national dementia strategy is for a primary care worker to play a key role in co-ordinating the care.  We estimate that providing a case worker in all local health areas would cost slightly less than &euro;2 million.</p><p>To conclude, people with dementia and their families want to stay in the community.  This represents the truth of the situation, yet most of the Government's spend is weighted towards the end stage and long-term residential care.  We need to look at how we are going to address the real needs of people with dementia in the community.  The measures I outlined to the committee would significantly improve the lives of people with dementia and support the implementation of the national dementia strategy.  </p><p> We are asking for political leadership on this issue.  There is a world dementia council as well as G7 leadership and we hope that there will be cross-party political leadership on this issue in Ireland.  </p></speech>

We collectively apologise for all the delays today.  I refer to the quote from the WHO which Ms Leonard cited which describes dementia as one of the most serious challenges facing the world today.  I agree with that opinion and I know only too well the truth of it.  I welcome all the delegates.</p> <p>  I do not have a raft of questions but one of the aspects that struck me with regard to the south Tipperary initiative is its simplicity.  It is not complex and it is very straightforward, which is, perhaps, its strength.  The critical aspect jumps off the paper but it also came across even stronger in the passion of each of the contributions.  I apologise I did not hear all of Professor O'Shea's contribution as there was a vote in the D&aacute;il.  I refer in particular to Dr. Crowe's contribution.  That passion, while it is not written into the text, just jumps out at me.  I refer to such a critical component part in the success of the initiative which is the people; both they and the community have made this difference.  I refer to the five steps of the Living Well programme or the building on those steps.  The five areas are among the achievements of the past three years.  Just two of the five areas, particularly, are directed to the dementia sufferer.  The others are supportive of, or directly geared towards the wider family and then the community in turn, in terms of other supports, technological advances, dealing with the stigma, public knowledge, awareness, acceptance, all of those things.  I ask the delegates to tell us a little bit about the clinical nurse specialist. I ask them to describe the factual position of the clinical nurse specialist - perhaps there are more than one - who is described in the contributions as the single point of contact for people with dementia.</p> <p>  My other question relates to the dementia support worker.  I can readily identify with this role.  I have had a recent experience within my extended family and friends of another case of dementia in the recent past and all that entails.  I see how it can very much limit and arrest another's life because of the support requirements.  I ask for more information about that role.  How many dementia support workers are in the service in south Tipperary?  With regard to the other areas I can readily understand and appreciate and I can apply them without any difficulty in my own community.  I can see how we could all play a part.  The clinical nurse specialist and the dementia support worker are more particular roles.  Is there a training process for dementia support workers?  What degree of preparation is involved?  What is the personal profile of those who are support workers?</p> <p>  I refer to Ms Leonard's contribution and I ask Professor O'Shea to contribute as he thinks appropriate.  I refer to the significant number of people with dementia under the age of 65.  One particular case was represented in the audio-visual room only several months ago.  He was a young man who could only be described as heroic, in my view, as he was looking after his mother who has dementia while still in her 50s.  It can present even earlier than that.  Are particular responses required for the younger age group as against dementia presenting in older life?  Ms Leonard spoke about an estimated number of 4,000 people and that is not an insignificant number of people.  This committee has addressed a raft of different rare diseases over the years that, in some cases, affect fewer than 100 people yet we are pressing, quite correctly, for specific supports and assistance.  However, there is a particular cohort of younger people here and their needs may be slightly different, I would think, than those of the older cohort.</p> <p>  The investment of &euro;30.2 million for dementia specialist intensive home care packages is one of the key component parts of the group's pre-budget submission.  It proposes that this would extend beyond the eight pilot areas and to all local health organisations regionally.  I ask the delegates to identify the eight pilot areas.  I agree that receiving a service should not be dependent on where a person lives.</p> <p>  The people in south Tipperary will not be able to readily identify with what I am now going to say but I live four miles from the Border and I have lived there all my life, born and bred.  Many in my home community, because of the absence of sufficient capacity within support structures and because of where they live, naturally gravitate towards the next little town or community and that might be in Tyrone or Fermanagh - I am thinking specifically of Tyrone and the Clogher valley.  The fair deal support does not allow my neighbours, whose life gravitation has been to Clogher village, access to the use of that nursing home.  There is a deficiency.  We are talking about developing all-island solutions to health challenges and this is a very practical area.  Fair deal should be available on the basis of the need of the individual as against the geographic location, not just of the individual, but of the service.  I ask Ms Leonard to comment from the point of view of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.</p></speech>

This project has done excellent work in south Tipperary and has been hugely successful.  I thank all the delegates for the very thorough, informative and detailed presentations we have heard.  The south Tipperary pilot project has been particularly successful.  It has reached approximately 340 individuals and families who are touched by dementia, which, as all speakers have acknowledged, is hugely challenging now and will be in the future.  The reason the project has been so successful links to what Professor O'Shea said earlier.</p><p>It is certainly well on the way to changing the mindset of society in south Tipperary towards dementia.  In the past, the initial reaction was that a person with dementia needed residential care sooner rather than later, as they were seen to be a risk to themselves or their family members.  That has changed in south Tipperary where people now see services and supports are available which enable a person suffering from dementia to live and be supported in their own homes and their own communities.</p><p> One of the reasons south Tipperary was chosen for the pilot project was because considerable work had already been done there in this field.  The Le Cairde day centre opened in Cashel in 2006 and the Memory Technology Library in Clonmel in 2008.  South Tipperary had form in this area.  The three-year pilot has been particularly successful with single points of contact, the website, the dementia support worker and crisis care system all setting a scene whereby persons affected by dementia and their families see a future at home and in their own community, rather than in long-term residential care.  The focus is to keep people at home living independently for as long as possible.  There was a widespread media campaign undertaken by the pilot project which was supported by the local radio station, Tipp FM.  It is to be congratulated on the success of this pilot project.  This pilot project, with which Dr. Crowe has been involved, should be supported financially, along with the national dementia strategy, and rolled out nationally.  I expect the committee to request this funding from the Minister and the Department and I hope it will do so.</p></speech>

I really liked their empathy towards the patients in question and the language they used.  They spoke about personalised treatment and it being inclusive to the person and their family.  Often when we get these documents, one often just gets budgets and statistics.</p> <p>  The pilot project in Tipperary sounds fantastic.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a strong project, Living Well with Dementia, run by Eilis Hession from the Health Service Executive.  None of us wants to suffer from dementia when we are older.  Tina Leonard said advisers can help slow the onset of dementia.  I did not know diabetic patients are more prone to dementia.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting Tina Leonard as it is important the committee hears from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I know the delegations want a commitment to continue the strategy with a budget behind it.  I will do my best, as will every other member.</p></speech>

Dr. Crowe asked the committee members to put themselves in the shoes of one of her service users.  I have been in those shoes, along with my brothers.  My mam was diagnosed with dementia when she was 89.  It was heart-breaking for the family but devastating for my mam who was very active up to three months before she passed away.  We were really taken by surprise by her condition.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Crowe talk on the radio this morning about not locking people with dementia away but to keep them at home.  My two brothers lived with my mam.  Through their unconditional love and affection, they made her life that little bit easier.  The highlight of her day was going out.  For some strange reason, she became a big fan of McDonald&rsquo;s which she never liked before.  Towards the end of her days, her favourite was chips and tomato sauce.</p> <p>  It is frightening that the figures for people with dementia will double by 2031, with 96,000 people diagnosed with the disease by then.  What is different about this pilot project to what other organisations and many other communities are doing?  Is there any graphic illustrating the national and regional distribution of the number of people with dementia?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is a difficult area and will become an increasing one with our growing aging population.  Up to 990,000 people will be over 65 by 2030 which will mean there will be a growth in the number of people with dementia.</p> <p>  I noticed a significant variation between the number of men and women who have dementia from the 2011 census.  For men, it was 17,391 diagnosed with dementia while for women, it was 30,459.  Why is there such a variation?  Is it because women live longer?  Has any research been done in this area?  Is it an area in which we need to do further research?</p> <p>  An issue raised in the national dementia strategy was that 94% of hospitals have no dementia care pathway in place.</p><p>When reports and strategies are produced, I always worry about the timeframe for implementation of sections of reports and cross checking to see what progress has been made after two, three or five years&rsquo; time.  Do we have enough mechanisms in place to cross check the progress that is made on what is set out in a clear strategy document, which took time to prepare?  Who will audit it?  It is very important.  While it is great to produce reports, the timeframe for implementation of the recommendations is important.  Regarding the finding that 94% of hospitals have no dementia care in place, what progress can be made on it and in what timeframe?</p></speech>

They outlined that in 25 years&rsquo; time, the number of people living with dementia will have tripled.  It makes sense that people should be supported to live at home for as long as possible.  There are waiting lists for the fair deal scheme, and with 20,000 people going over the age of 65 each year for the next number of years, it makes sense for people to be cared for at home.  I was particularly interested in the south Tipperary dementia pilot project, especially in the way the witnesses personalised the stories in the presentation.</p> <p>  The presentation stated that there is a single point of contact in south Tipperary.  I presume each of the eight pilot schemes has this single point of contact.  Do people from outside the Tipperary area make contact?  Have the witnesses considered temporary sheltered accommodation for people who do not have anybody to care for them?  The presentation mentioned that it is possible to delay dementia.  Could the witnesses expand on that?  Ms Leonard mentioned that the project has provided more than 1 million hours of care to approximately 9,500 people suffering from dementia.  Some 50,000 people suffer from dementia.  Are the rest of them living in nursing homes or are many people receiving no service at all?  The eight dementia advisers deliver a service to 1,760 people.  I wonder about all the people who receive no service at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1766" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#EE00300"><p>I apologise that I could not be here earlier.  I read the submissions, which we received in advance of the meeting.  Given that I have a family member who suffers from dementia, I am familiar with it, and it is sad to see the deterioration at an early stage.  They try to get involved in family conversations, and get in and out of it.  In a one-to-one situation they are only able to cope and one sees the difference.  I agree that information is vital.  In one instance, the person strayed and got lost.  A simple thing like putting a mobile telephone in the person's pocket so one can make contact and know where the person is at any time of the day or night can be effective.  It took three years before the family discovered this.</p> <p>  The person in my family began to suffer from dementia in his early 60s and is in his mid-60s now.  It was a very sad time for his family, when they still had much to look forward to.  He is still in his home and is being cared for.  In Adare, where I live, there is an excellent day centre.  It provides an outstanding service and is greatly supported by the wider community outside of those who may be involved with the families with dementia.  I congratulate the witnesses on the work they are doing and wish them well.  I have read their pre-budget submission and, hopefully, we will be able to further influence those who have the authority to make decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#EE00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I am sorry I missed most of the presentation.  I never knew what dementia was until several years ago when my mother went into a nursing home and I realised some of the people there were suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  I did not realise they needed special care and often wondered what we could do to help them.  I always thought dementia was part of the aging process and that the older one became the more likely it was that one would suffer from it.  Only when I examined the statistics and read Ms Leonard's report did I realise that 4,000 people under the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer's disease, which is very alarming.</p> <p>  As a young person, how can one identify dementia?  We all suffer from memory loss at some stage.  Communication, functional abilities and behaviour are also mentioned.  Behaviour is probably the most common way dementia is discovered.  We need much more care, especially in our general hospitals and residential care.  My mother was old and was in a nursing home because she was coming to the end of her life.  I saw people who needed more than somebody putting them in a wheelchair, taking them to a dining room and feeding them and doing the normal things.  Many of them had behaviour problems and it took two or three people to look after them.  I am an advocate of people staying at home.  I often say if anything happened to my wife or me I hope we would look after each other, and I hope my children look after me.  The statistics are shocking.  Some 48,000 people are suffering from dementia and, as the presentation stated, by 2041 the figure may have reached 132,000.</p> <p>  We are very lucky.  I come from Dundalk.  We got a bad beating last week in Thurles.  I am sure Professor O'Shea was there, and he had his own problems.  There is a centre in Dundalk called the Birches.  The amount of work the people there do is second to none, however they find it very difficult to get money to keep them going and they depend on charity.  We will have to push harder on dementia and let people know it can affect young people as well as old people.  The presentation was excellent.  If the committee can help the witnesses in any way, they need only ask.</p></speech>

It is very moving for us that they are so receptive to what we are saying.  Clinical nurse specialist is a recognised grade of nurse already in the health service.  It is a very senior grade and is equivalent to the clinical nurse manager grade CNM2, who would run a ward.  These people are senior and highly qualified, and they work across a range of specialties such as diabetes, respiratory medicine, midwifery and work at a very high level of expertise and autonomy with the clinical team.  We developed our clinical nurse specialist post towards the end of the project when we realised there was a need for a very highly qualified nurse, who is highly expert in dementia in all the possible complications as well as the simple parts, to be in the community, go out and respond to need, do assessments and put in services.  Being the single point of contact is attached to it but is not the clinical nurse specialist's only job.  When a query comes in, it comes to a person who is very expert, highly qualified and can do something for the caller, not just to a secretary who will tell the caller to go to his or her GP.</p><p> The beauty of the pilot was that we could understand that this was the necessary level of expertise.  It is a recognised grade and we have two fantastic people jobsharing the role at the moment.  One is an advanced nurse practitioner in dementia and the other is a clinical nurse specialist in old age psychiatry.  They are the best of the best and we are lucky to have them.  We are going to mainstream this post as the service goes forward.  It is a recognised, senior and expert grade that is useful for families and people with dementia.</p></speech>

It is not that these people were psychiatric patients.  It was that I was the lead.  It was meant to ensure good governance and accountability and to keep it safe.  As we proceed, there will be no need for all of the patients to be under old age psychiatry.  It is making them psychiatric patients unnecessarily.  A part of our sustainability plan is to move them into community care, with the consultants having an overarching involvement and there being more of a memory team running it alongside HSE management.  We are working on the location and setting.  Our sustainability plan is for them not to be in mental health services, as they do not need to be there, and that they would access mental health services from our clinic and mental health specialists when they need it.  Most people do not have psychiatric complications in dementia, but approximately one third of them do.  People will be located in community care with the proper governance and supervisory structure around it.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's second question, which was on dementia support workers, they are an interesting grade.  We have developed it and their role.  It is based on peer support workers.  Members might have heard of them.  They crop up in many settings.  For example, they are being developed in mental health services.  We recruit them from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Carers Association.  We work closely with both groups.  This is a collaborative project.  We have recruited people who are trained to FETAC level 5, which is a nationally recognised qualification.  We reinterviewed them for the project and checked their suitability.  We had a high threshold.  If I was happy to see them in my mother's kitchen, I would have them in the project.  They had to be special, warm and giving.</p> <p>  We have fantastic people.  There are 19 of them.  We give them further training.  We developed a two-day intensive dementia programme.  We also give them monitoring and mentoring.  We are very fussy about the quality of person whom we have.  We brought them all in last week and they told us how much they loved doing this work.  It is new work in Ireland.  It is different than being a home helper.  Some are home helpers and some are doing other jobs.  Ours is a new model that can be expanded everywhere.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's third question was on the population.  In south Tipperary, there are approximately 1,000 people with dementia.  In or around one third of those are in long-term care, leaving 650 or so in the community.  Our budget of &euro;700,000 has allowed us to provide support to approximately 340 of these over three years.  That is the cost of four or five people in long-term care in the same period.  The cost effectiveness is staggering.  I hope that I have answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

There are four Genio projects around Ireland, including one in Kinsale and another in Mayo.  We are all closely linked and collaborative, so we recognise the fantastic work that is being done in Stillorgan-Blackrock.  It is also trying to be mainstreamed.  I did not have time to mention the other pilots today, but I want to acknowledge their fantastic work.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne's comments about her mother were moving.  We recognise that anything we do as professionals is only a drop in the ocean compared with what families do.  What they do - the love and loyalty that they show - humbles us all of the time.  We support them in continuing to do what they want to do.  Irish families and communities are extraordinary.  We see it every day.  It would move one to tears to see what people do for their loved ones, how much they love them and how much they want to look after them.  I wanted to say this publicly.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me what was different about our project.  It is a collaborative project between us and the four voluntary bodies, all of the HSE staff that one might think of, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Carers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the South Tipperary Community and Voluntary Forum, which is an umbrella group of the 70 voluntary bodies in south Tipperary.  At the core of the project are three people with dementia and three carers.  Some of these carers are former carers.  We got a blank page from the HSE and were asked how to do it differently.  The HSE gave us that money.  It was an amazing opportunity to redesign factors.  We looked a great deal to former carers who explained that something or other was not there when they were caring, for example.  It is a different approach, in that it is bottom up rather than top down, and had never been seen before.  This was a major strength.  People with dementia and carers attended everything we did.  They told us what to do next.  In our memory technology library, former and current carers told us what would work, what not to use, etc.  Much of the expert opinion that I give families on what to do next I learned from other carers.  They found that something worked and they passed on the knowledge to someone else.  The collaborative, bottom-up approach, the person with dementia and the family are at the centre of everything, making our project different.</p> <p>  We had freedom with our funding to change the project as we saw fit.  We did not have to get permission to make a clinical nurse specialist post.  If we recognised that it was needed, we did it.  It was free and unrestricted.  That has been a liberating experience.  We have done amazing work with &euro;700,000 and had the freedom to provide support to 340 people, as we did not need to submit business cases, write letters or explain matters.  It is a great model for how the health service could be in many other domains.</p></speech>

That was encouraged.  If something did not work, one could stop and try something else.  That has been positive.  Everyone working in the project has a day job as well.

They have been transformative in the context of individualised, person-centred care.  The new model or, as Deputy Byrne called it, thinking outside the box has been the main lesson.  The national dementia strategy was published last year and is at an early stage.  If we can manage to integrate the ideas, concepts, philosophy and support for home-based care and people with recognising the person with dementia and his or her importance, the national dementia strategy can be equally transformative.  There is a double win here.  Dr. Crowe has emphasised what is good about this work, but the task for the next couple of years will be to support the strategy in being equally liberating.</p></speech>

Men may have more risk factors, but it is women's longevity that has that figure so high.</p> <p>  The implementation element is important.  The strategy's monitoring group will monitor the implementation.  We have a large job to do there.  Professor O'Shea and I are members of the group.  We in Ireland are good at strategising, but we are not always good at implementing.  That is our greatest job.  At least this kind of approach can be implemented and copied everywhere.  We are not precious about it.  We can give everything to everyone.  People have been coming to look at and find out about what we are doing.  We are more than happy to help other groups to set up.  They do not have to do all of the ground work; we have done that and found models that work.</p> <p>  Turning to Deputy McLellan, a single point of contact is important.  As to the eight areas that will get intensive home care packages, those packages are in a novice state.  They are concerned with getting people out of acute hospitals and back home.  We have received funding from Genio for three packages outside of the eight.  They are cumbersome to put in place and there is a great deal of paperwork, but they could be useful in time.  There is no single point of contact yet, but each of the three other Genio projects that Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned has a single point of contact.</p> <p>  We have not set up any sheltered accommodation as part of the project, but there is a small amount of it in south Tipperary and some people with dementia live there as part of our normal practice.  We have not done anything differently in that regard.</p> <p>  Delaying dementia is important.  This is something that we all need to think about.  Four treatments for dementia came out between 1997 and 2002, but there has been no new treatment for it since.  What has come out is evidence to the effect that, if one manages one's vascular risk factors, which we should all manage anyway for healthy hearts and brains, one can delay the onset of dementia.</p><p>That is part of the heart strategy.  It is part of the Healthy Ireland strategy.  We need to emphasise that and let that word go out.  We were always afraid of dementia but at one time TB was not talked about.  People never talked about cancer, HIV and AIDS.  Those are now talked about.  There is no stigma surrounding them.  We need to talk about dementia in the same way as something that one can do something about.  That is not to say that plenty of people who got it went on to live healthy lives.  Therefore, it is not the only risk factor.  If we, as individuals, can do anything, we would be happy to do so, but also acting as part of a wider community can help.</p><p> Deputy Neville spoke of the wandering and the simple contact by telephone, and I appreciate that.  It is often other families who come up with those kind of solutions.  We found that in the project.  We have spaces where families can tell each other and give advice.</p><p> In response to Deputy Fitzpatrick on the question of dementia and Alzheimer's, it is common for people not to understand the difference.  People say to us they do not mind if they have dementia as long as it is not Alzheimer's.  Dementia is the umbrella term and Alzheimer's is the commonest type, but there are approximately 50 different types of dementia.  People use the terms interchangeably and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland does not restrict itself to Alzheimer's but covers every dementia.  The terms are used interchangeably but Alzheimer's is the commonest type of dementia.</p><p> Dementia is different to normal ageing.  People think it is normal ageing and want to say that there is nothing wrong but it is different.  The outcomes for the person are very different.  We all are losing brain cells all the time, probably from our 20s, but that is not dementia.  Dementia is not normal aging.  As anyone who has been involved with it will know, there is a difference qualitatively in terms of the experience.</p><p> In the general hospitals, there are three big Genio projects.  The Genio Trust, the funder of our projects, combines Atlantic Philanthropies and government funding through the HSE.  There are three big Genio projects going on in acute hospitals over three years to improve the dementia care pathway through acute hospitals.  These are in Blanchardstown, St. James's and the Mercy in Cork.  Those are trying to correct the care pathway because general hospitals are terrible places if one has dementia.  Patients get very confused and agitated.  The projects are trying to smooth out and improve such issues as training, understanding and the environment so that the patient has a quicker trajectory and gets out quicker.</p><p> With our project we found it has spilled into the general hospital and one of the general hospital wards has made itself dementia friendly.  Tesco has even set up fund-raising for us using its tokens to make the ward dementia friendly.  It has been done out of donations with no new funding.  The ward has been reoriented, painted in dementia-friendly colours and uses signage and trained the staff.  We found with our project we can get patients out of hospital quicker because we can put in support workers to get them home, and that is a much better outcome.  Those with dementia do badly in acute care.  They have longer lengths of stay suffer higher forms of morbidity and greater mortality and are more likely to end up in long-term care.</p><p> I think I have answered my questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-16a.1781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tina Leonard" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071600002#GG00300"><p>I thank the members for all their questions, and particularly to Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor for ensuring that we are represented here today.  I should have said that earlier.</p> <p>  To come to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question first, he asked about the under 65s of whom there are 4,000 and what different needs they may have.  The obvious ones are that many dementia services in Ireland fall under the older age category.  That is the first point to note.  There may be age discrimination or an age barrier in that regard.  Indeed, the national dementia strategy opens with the assertion that everybody in dementia has to benefit from the strategy but then, as one goes to the detail, many of the elements mentioned within the health services are under the services for older aged persons.  Then one begins to wonder whether there is a barrier in that regard, even within the language used within the strategy.  That is a real consideration.</p> <p>  There are other real considerations.  Those under 65 are at a different place in life.  Some of them are working and we have come across those who felt they had to leave work immediately.  Questions arise, such as can workplaces be supportive of those with dementia and can they change the type of work they are doing.  Such persons with dementia may have dependants and then there are financial issues.  Also, there is an impact on public awareness.  In public awareness work that we have carried out and in talking to those with whom we work who are under 65 and who have dementia, one sometimes finds that the level of understanding or acceptance on the part of the public is less because someone is assuming dementia to be exclusively an older age issue.  We have even come across situations where those in their 50s, for example, almost feel they must justify and prove somehow that they have dementia because others do not believe and are not willing to give help as easily as they would for someone who is much older.  All of those issues must also be addressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the eight pilot sites.  These are ones separate to the four Genio living well projects that we have heard about today.  They are provided under the funding available under the national dementia strategy.  The national dementia strategy has over &euro;27 million to deliver three different actions, one of which relates to the provision of intensive dementia-specific home care for which there is &euro;22.5 million.  In that regard, there will be packages in eight pilot sites, four of which are in Dublin  - in north Dublin, Dublin north city, Dublin south west and Dublin south east - and in Cork city, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  As Dr. Crowe stated, these are linked to patients who are in acute hospital settings to enable them to go back to the community.  No doubt it is needed, but it is a narrow focus that needs to be expanded.  Dementia-specific home packages need to be available for those with dementia across the country, not only if one is in hospital but for those already in the community looking to remain in the community.  That is crucially important.  It is worth noting also that currently HSE tenders are for generic home care packages.  There are not dementia-specific tenders.  We believe dementia-specific home care is very important because those with dementia have different and specific needs.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also mentioned the geographical lottery.  It is worth mentioning post-diagnostic supports there.  For example, one woman with whom we work who has Alzheimer's, Helen, is just over 65, but she was under 65 when she was diagnosed.  She was diagnosed in Galway hospital, and lives in Sligo.  She drove home on her own, was not told where to go or whom to talk to, and then, understandably, went into a darkness and almost did not leave the house for the first ten months staring at the four walls, not knowing where to go and what to do.  That is a real experience of only a few years ago.  Another person with whom we work, S&eacute;amus, who lives in Dublin, is in his 70s.  He also has Alzheimer's.  He was diagnosed in the memory clinic in St. James's.  They put him in touch with the primary care team, which linked in with him, called to him and signposted him to supports, such as our Alzheimer's caf&eacute; and working group and the day-care centre locally.  Immediately, from day one, both he and his family were given all that information.  The committee will see from those two cases the difference in being linked in to information from the start and then, as Dr. Crowe outlined, to have that support and co-ordination of care as time progresses.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Colm Burke, Dr. Crowe spoke about the pathway in hospitals.  It is important to mention that almost one quarter of patients in hospitals have dementia and those pilot sites and the three projects to make those hospitals dementia friendly are crucial.  In particular, I am thinking of one person who went into hospital where there is not dementia-specific care and the decline was immediate and quite severe.  When one is aware that those with dementia can continue to thrive with dementia-appropriate and dementia-specific care, that is so upsetting to see.</p> <p>  I should mention as well that the ASI is represented on the dementia strategy implementation review group.  The implementation review group includes not only all of the experts but a member of our dementia working group - a person with dementia - and a member of our carer's network.  It is crucial that the voice of the carer and the voice of the person with dementia are there.  It is part of our policy and all the work, especially all the public awareness work, we are doing right now that we hear from those who are advocating for themselves.</p> <p>  On prevention, which was raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan, recently we published a paper that we commissioned the Institute for Public Health to write on prevention and dementia.  One will have heard about keeping healthy and heart health.  It is about not smoking, not drinking much, etc.  Keeping the body healthy keeps the brain healthy - low education was a factor there.  When the research was analysed it was discovered that if all the related and interacting modifiable risk factors were reduced by 10%, which is a big ask, taking the 2011 figures for dementia, within one year over 1,000 cases could be avoided or delayed.</p><p>That is a huge number.  We call on the Government to ensure dementia and dementia prevention are included as a public policy message across all health messages.  That is to support what members heard earlier.</p><p> Regarding the delivery of services to the 9,500 people we are reaching, and that is not the total number, 5,000 of those call our helpline.  That is one service we provide.  A different type of service could be a social club, caf&eacute;, day care, home care and so on.  Is it a drop in the ocean?  Yes.  The reason for that is that the 48,000 people we mentioned are prevalence rates.  If we are in the same position as the United Kingdom, then only half of those people are actually diagnosed.  Also, we do not have the money to provide more services than those we already provide.  That links in to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about The Birches, our day centre in Dundalk, and what I said earlier.  Our funding from the Health Service Executive, HSE, has decreased.  We cannot plug that gap with fund-raising because the gap is becoming too wide and the demand for services is growing.  Therefore, what do we do?  That is the stark reality.</p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to the numbers in each county.  Deputy Mitchell has the number for each county.  They are prevalence rates.  With regard to all the numbers we mentioned, it is important to point out that we do not have a register of people with dementia in Ireland.  We do not know the exact number diagnosed and where they are located.  Therefore, we cannot tailor services to reach those people.  That information should be available, which is another question for the future.  I hope I have answered all the questions.</p><p> To conclude, individualised, person-centred care is what we in the Alzheimer Society of Ireland are advocating for and what we are about.  All the evidence shows us that interventions, supports and advice at earlier stages and throughout the journey enable people to live well, which is what they want, and it is also economically beneficial.</p></speech>

However, there are two aspects to be considered, the first of which is the large numbers, including the 50,000 who have been diagnosed and the multiples of that who will be affected in the next few years.  How we deal with that will be a seriously significant issue, not only in terms of the issue of dementia but in the funding of dementia supports.  Equally, when we talk about big numbers, it is easy to forget about the issue of dementia and the person-centred, personalised care that recognises the dignity and humanity of the issue for people and their families.  That will be a key aspect in the coming years.</p> <p>  We are in a position now where we have a strategy.  The key issue is the implementation of that strategy, which must be accelerated.  Having a strategy is one thing, but implementing it is another.  We need to recognise what I just mentioned, namely, the number of people affected and the individualisation associated with the illness.  We have some examples of projects in south Tipperary and other areas where there are huge gains to be made from considering the social aspects of the disease and how communities can be mobilised if there is significant public investment in dementia.  If we could merge the notion of the local with the issue of public support for people with dementia, we would be in a position to say we are addressing a significant issue.  The opportunities are many.</p></speech>

It is a problem, and I am sure it is not unique to north Monaghan.  It probably goes along the Border's length, but I am most familiar with a particular case in regard to two homes in the Clogher Valley.</p></speech>

While we said the Government's focus in terms of spending is on long-term residential care, it is important to say that in an ideal world, there would be more options.  The Deputy mentioned sheltered accommodation.  There are no other options for people who need that level of help now, and that is a problem.  People with dementia trying to access a nursing home under the fair deal scheme may, and do, come up against not only geographical problems but also that some nursing homes will not accept someone with dementia.  For example, a member of a family I know was in a nursing home but the family were asked to take the person out of the nursing home because it could no longer deal with the person whose condition had progressed.  Can one imagine getting a call like that?  Even if someone gets a package under the fair deal scheme, there can be barriers in terms of accessing the care.  Issues arise across the journey.</p></speech>
