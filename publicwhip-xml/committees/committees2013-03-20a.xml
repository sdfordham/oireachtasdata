The main industries identified by the joint sub-committee in this regard are aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries and inshore fisheries, specifically sea angling combined with tourism.  The joint sub-committee had intended to have officials from the three relevant Departments at its meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning.  However, I understand that those who were with us earlier will not be available to attend.  I thank them for agreeing to meet us this afternoon.</p><p>  Before we begin, I am obliged to remind witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this joint sub-committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence with regard to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Dr. Beamish to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

This demand is linked to global population growth.  In 1999 global population levels passed 6 billion for the first time, last year they passed 7 billion and in 2025 they will pass 8 billion.  In conjunction with changes in dietary habits and increased demand from Asia, this has led to a rapid rate of increase in demand for seafood.  It is generally estimated that global capture fisheries have reached the maximum sustainable output of approximately 80 million tonnes per year.  Demand for seafood at a global level will, therefore, increasingly be met through aquaculture production.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that an additional 42 million tonnes of farmed seafood will be required annually by 2030.  Aquaculture is already producing almost 50% of the world's seafood.  In 2010 global aquaculture production reached 60 million tonnes, with an estimated value of was $119 billion.  This was an increase of nearly 8% on the previous year.  Production is estimated to have increased further to 64 million tonnes in 2011.</p><p>  European aquaculture production now stands at approximately 2.5 million tonnes per annum.  This accounts for around 4.2% of world aquaculture production.  Countries within the European Union produce approximately 1.2 million tonnes of aquaculture product.  In the European aquaculture context, salmon has been the main species to be developed.  Demand for salmon has been growing very well.  The current size of the farmed salmon market is approximately 2 million tonnes.  Demand in this regard is still developing.  In Europe, which is considered to be a mature market, demand for salmon has been growing by around 7% per annum for the past ten years.  The Russian market for salmon is growing at 27% per annum.  Close to 60% of world salmon production involves farmed salmon.  Much of this comes from Norway, Chile, the UK and North America.  It is estimated that the Atlantic salmon market will continue to grow by 4% per year in the period 2013 to 2020.</p><p>  Norway is now the world's largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon, generating more than 1.2 million tonnes in 2011.  More than 838,000 tonnes of that, with a value of 29 billion krone, was exported.  Norway has been developing its industry since the early 1970s.  It was targeted as a means of restoring the livelihoods of rural fishing communities whose economies have become depressed on foot of a decline in wild fisheries.  Norway's initial production was less than 500 tonnes.  This was largely generated by small family businesses and sold to local markets.  In recent decades the industry has developed very rapidly and some vary large multinational companies are now operating in it.  Farmed fish has become Norway's fourth largest export commodity after oil, gas and metals.</p><p>  Within the EU, the UK produces farmed Atlantic salmon in significant quantities.  The vast bulk of this is generated in Scotland, which is the largest farmed Atlantic salmon producer in the EU and the third largest globally.  In 2011 Scotland produced 158,000 tonnes of farmed salmon, worth &pound;584 million.  Scotland did not begin farming salmon until the 1970s.  In 1971 it produced 14 tonnes of farmed salmon.  This had increased to 40,000 tonnes by 1991.  By 2001 it had increased again to 138,000 tonnes.  Farmed salmon is now Scotland's largest food export product.</p><p>  To set the context for any discussion we might have on aquaculture, we must compare the situation in Ireland with those which obtain in Norway and Scotland.  Ireland commenced salmon farming in 1974 and in 2012 we produced just 14,500 tonnes of farmed salmon.  The fact that Irish aquaculture production has not grown but has a substantial opportunity for growth was recognised in Food Harvest 2020, which the Government has adopted as its food strategy document.  Food Harvest 2020 identifies ways in which the seafood sector can increase turnover to &euro;1 billion and employment to 14,000 full-time equivalent jobs by 2020.  Food Harvest 2020 also calls on the aquaculture industry to play its part by expanding the volume of its production by 78%.  It seeks that the relevant State agencies, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute, should continue research and development work in the areas of offshore aquaculture and alternative species aquaculture.</p><p>  In the context of the Food Harvest 2020 recommendations, BIM has begun to consider new fish farming production areas in deeper waters.  This is a response to the fact that the Irish aquaculture industry has previously been constrained, in part because more than 80% of its operations are located in inshore areas governed by EU environmental directives, primarily the Natura directives.  The concept is that situating the larger aquaculture operations in deep waters would place them outside Natura areas, thus minimising impacts, simplifying licensing requirements and taking account of the necessary environmental limitations.  This has led to an examination of potential sites by BIM and the Marine Institute and also to a consideration of oceanographic and other data which indicate what sites might be most suitable for allowing Irish aquaculture to expand, given the opportunity.</p><p>  BIM estimates that one deep-sea salmon farm could potentially produce 15,000 tonnes of organic salmon, generate more than &euro;100 million in exports and create 500 direct and indirect jobs.  In view of growing international demand for salmon, it is perceived that there would be significant interest on the part of operators to run such a farm.  In addition, there would be scope for expansion.  I am seeking here to establish an economic context for any discussion we may have in respect of aquaculture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000005#D00200"><p>I thank Dr. Beamish for giving us the background of the socioeconomic situation.  He mentioned Scotland and the Natura sites.  The committee tries to trawl through a lot of information.  Can the three or four areas that we mentioned work in harmony?  A significant number of inshore aquaculture sites are Natura sites and I hope that the new checks and balances will deal with our concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000005#D00300"><p>I thank Dr. Beamish for the information he gave on the aquaculture element that is of concern to the committee.  The report is comprehensive and covers most of the policy aspects.</p><p>  I have a question on appropriate assessments.  Dr. Beamish said that all of the assessments had been completed on the Natura sites.  Is that true?  If so, the conservation objectives will then be laid out in order for applications to be progressed and, from what I heard, that will probably be done this year.  </p><p>  The committee hopes to examine another aspect which arose following the ban on net fishing in area 6A and the impact that has had on small inshore fisherman, particularly in island communities that depend on fishing.  The ban means they must concentrate on crab and lobster fishing only.  Can Mr. Beamish explain what discretion or policy options are open to the Irish Government regarding the six and 12-mile limits that would make allowance for small inshore fishermen and fleets?  They traditionally fished in these waters but the ban will make them part-time fishermen.  Are there policy instruments available to a national Irish Government?  Do the instruments fit in with the Common Fisheries Policy?  Is there scope to develop an alternative policy that would allow traditional fishermen to continue fishing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000005#D00400"><p>I read a newspaper report today which highlighted the fact that planning permission was refused in Nova Scotia because of possible contamination of wild salmon by sea lice.  Does the Department wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000005#D00500"><p>I thank Mr. Beamish for his presentation.  Having examined the Norwegian and Scottish experience, I can see there is great potential to develop an aquaculture industry on the western seaboard of Ireland.  If the licensing framework and appeals regime is robust, independent and seen to be independent then I have no doubt the sector will provide employment over the next decade to 15 years.  It would particularly provide employment in areas that IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland would not go into in a month or in decades.  We must embrace the sector and its potential.  However, we must adopt a sensitive approach.  I welcome the work that has been done on the sensitive SAC and Natura sites.  Many of these sites are contentious and controversy will inevitably follow many of the proposals, whether they are from BIM or private industry.  Much inadequate information and misinformation has been circulated.  There is also a lot of genuine concern about the sites.  For example, there is a concern that traditional jobs and fisheries will be displaced, and we should not ignore such concerns.  When one is balancing books and saying that a provision will create X jobs, one must subtract the jobs that will be displaced, such as those in sea fisheries.  We should avoid that at all costs.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the exercise on the 94 bays and harbours that are Natura sites.  Has that work been completed?  Roaring Water Bay, Dundalk Bay and Castlemaine Bay were mentioned.  Are they the only bays being considered for licensing applications at present?    </p><p>  The committee does not just focus on aquaculture.  We have a concern, which was touched on during our previous meeting, that some rural communities have suffered as a result of consolidation in the sea-fishing industry.  Can we explore the possibility of aquaculture being complementary to sea fishing?  Can we allocate a total allowable catch, TAC, improve licensing or create more favourable policy instruments to support island and remote rural communities that do not have access to fishery harbour centres on the west coast?  Can we explore how such communities can exploit resources on their doorstep to provide jobs, not just in the aquaculture sector but in the small inshore fleet?  I know that much of this subject requires a national discussion and a national policy.  Some of the challenges that lie ahead are the allocation of TAC from one sector to another and the controversies that could follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000005#D00600"><p>I shall first clarify the points made by Deputies Pringle and Harrington.  I sought to convey the position on the Natura sites and perhaps I did not convey it fully.  The process is long and detailed and one can only reach the endpoint if one has built all of the previous steps along the way.  The task was set to gather information on the pelagic environment, living marine organisms, migrating sea mammals and fish species, the tidal environment and migrating birds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000007#FF00200"><p>Mr. Beamish said that in one case there was a 1% difference in the number that returned.  That looks very small.  However, if 5% returned in one case and 6% in the other case - because Mr. Beamish said that 95%, give or take, died at sea - that is a 20% difference in the number that returned, which is huge.  Could Mr. Beamish confirm whether the 1% was on the 95% versus the 94%?  Percentages can be very deceiving.  A 100% increase in nothing is still nothing.  It is similar to cases in which commentators say a team has doubled its lead when it is one point ahead and gets another point.  It is not half as dramatic if one is 15 points ahead and doubles one's lead by another 15 points.</p></speech>

The last thing this debate needs is more energy.  It probably needs calm observation.  I can only read what the report says.  We did not produce the report; we are advised by it.  It was a study of 352,000 migrating salmon over nine years.  I will quote from it.  I do not take a view.  The report concludes:<blockquote><br />The results of a meta-analysis of the combined data suggest that while sea lice-induced mortality on outwardly migrating smolts can be significant, it is a minor and irregular component of marine mortality in the stocks studied and is unlikely to be a significant factor influencing conservation status of salmon stocks.</blockquote></p></speech>

The report states:<blockquote><br />The observed level of marine mortality attributable to sea lice infestation is very small, both in absolute terms (approximately 1%) and as a proportion of the overall marine mortality which in this study had a mean value &amp;gt;90% at all locations.  At these levels, it is unlikely to influence the conservation status of stocks and is not a significant driver of marine mortality.  Recent studies have been carried out in Norway with broadly similar results (Skilbrei &amp;amp; Wennevik 2006).</blockquote>I could go on.  If anybody is looking for the report, it is published in the March 2013 edition of <i>Journal of Fish Diseases</i>.  The reason I quoted that particular study is that it is the latest one and is a particularly large study conducted over a nine-year period.  Whatever decisions are taken on the sea lice issue, it would be in the national interest for everybody to be informed by whatever science is available.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000007#FF00800"><p>We hear of difficulties in the co-existence of agriculture and angling, as well as other activities.  Dr. Beamish said that when the comprehensive studies that are ongoing are completed, the data collected will allow for all sorts of activities.  Would he consider it as part of the planning process for any or all activities that would take place in those designated bays?  Would that include the potential impact of aquaculture on inshore or even freshwater fishing?  Some freshwater anglers will say a salmon farm in the inlet where they fish could be affected as well.  Does it take that into account?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032000007#FF00900"><p>Some of that debate is about sea lice.  The general environmental information on the seabed, living marine organisms, the tidal area and migrating animals and birds is effectively a national asset that is being created to allow informed decision making on anything else that might apply to be developed in a Natura area.  The State will equally have to give informed consent.  It will be another Department or consenting authority, rather than this Department, that will have to give informed consent, in line with the habitats and birds directives, on whatever the application is.  The Department or consenting authority in question will have access to this data and, therefore, should be able to make a quicker informed decision to accept or reject the application in accordance with the Natura directives.  If this data did not exist, any individual promoter of a project would be equally at a loss and under pressure to produce those data to allow an informed decision.  The information might not be easily available to an individual promoter and, therefore, that project might not proceed.  The data collected do not relate only to fisheries and aquaculture but can assist with wider decision-making.</p></speech>

It is important.  I know it is an investment and is tedious and laborious but we should accept that it is very valuable for the State to be in possession of that data.  Does Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v have another point to make?</p></speech>

There are too many things happening in one day, but that is life.  I take it that what we are talking about here is the potential for aquaculture to create jobs in coastal communities.</p></speech>

I am interested in why the Department seems to be going for this huge "big bang" approach under the aegis of BIM, which is obviously subject to ministerial policy direction.</p></speech>

At the outset we set out the global and European context in which aquaculture is developing and try to present where Ireland stands in that global and European market context as regards the apparent potential that seems to exist for aquaculture generally and in Ireland.  It is clear that other countries have seen ways of developing aquaculture while remaining very committed to the marine environment, their commercial fishing industries and their fishermen.  Some countries have developed significant industries and also retained very significant fishing industries.  However, we cannot enter into any discussion or debate on specific applications that are under consideration or indicate any predisposition or otherwise towards any big, small or other applicants of any kind.  So we are somewhat hamstrung in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned specific numbers and clearly it is an area of interest to his constituency.</p></speech>

All the submissions that came out of both the statutory consultation and the public consultation are being examined.  That process will follow the legal prescribed process set out for it.  That process will take into account all matters arising - environmental and otherwise - that have been raised.  However, I do not believe it is possible to go into it in any more detail because one would end up making comments about specific applications.</p></speech>

If this were so lucrative it is curious that the existing farms have not been growing in the past ten years.  There are a number of existing fin fish farms, including one owned by a very large company off Clare Island.  If all this were so lucrative and positive I would have thought that the Clare Island operation would have expanded.  However, I have heard of no expansion in Clare Island.  I have not heard of any major expansion by the operators off the coast of Connemara.  I am not talking about the BIM proposal that is before the Department.  I understand that the BIM policy at a wider level under the direction of the Department is to go for major developments rather than locally-owned and controlled developments.  What is the thinking behind this policy approach?  It has nothing to do with a specific application.  I am critical enough about the tainting of that already.  I believe the Minister is in no position to make a decision on this because fundamentally he is a judge in his own court in that.  While I understand Dr. Beamish's caution here today, unfortunately that one was tainted before it started.</p></speech>

In that context, therefore, the question is whether Ireland wants to take part in aquaculture production opportunities that arise, etc., and how that can or cannot be facilitated.  Part of that facilitation involving examination and ensuring compliance with environmental directives is all of the effort going on regarding Natura sites.  The Natura sites cover the bulk of what are traditional aquaculture sites.  Nobody has made a decision against traditional aquaculture.  Much is going on and I could talk about it.  Indeed there has been substantial restructuring in aquaculture in Connemara on which the Department has been working with the other parties in recent years, which has led to fairly significant change there.</p><p>  We did not talk about shellfish, oyster production, mussels,-----</p></speech>

All of that is equally covered by the context that was established for aquaculture.  There are specific markets and specific site issues affecting each of those types of aquaculture developments.  In many ways aquaculture is only in its infancy.  The committee deals with agriculture, which has been around for 3,000 or 5,000 years.  It has been refined and developed with different species etc.  Aquaculture is essentially a 30 or 40-year old global venture now producing some 60 million tonnes a year.  It is only in its infancy in terms of where it is likely to go in order to meet the food demands.  Debates on aquaculture often become focused on one species or one application.</p></speech>

I live near the Killary, one of the best places for mussels.  Difficulties arose there in connection with licensing but it is totally natural.  One has only to hang a rope out and mussels will grow on it.  I have always believed that we have an obsession with fin fish farming and particularly with salmon which by its nature is an extensively migratory species.  We would be better off concentrating on the things that are natural where we have natural advantages and do not have to put artificial feed into the sea.  Has any examination taken place of producing fin fish on land so that all the stuff at the bottom of the pool can be collected, there is no risk of interfering with anything else and water can be filtered?  Has there been any examination of that because there seems to be much greater acceptance of the concept of on-land fin fish aquaculture?</p></speech>

Almost all of that is produced exclusively from sea-based rearing.  The operators across the industry are private and they choose sea-based production for most of that production.  One would have to study the economics of land-based cages.  I presume private operators are doing that.  If applications come forward for a substantial commercial land-based farm, they will be assessed through the process too.  Operators have to make a decision based on the economics of electricity costs, pumping and the rest of the inputs required.</p></speech>

The Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the overarching policy framework governing fisheries and the wider seafood sector in the European Union.  The policy was first put in place in 1983 after some agreement on principles in the mid-1970s.  Important elements of the reform process, which occurs every ten years, are expected to be concluded during the Irish EU Presidency.</p><p>  The reform on this occasion is different to others in that it is the first one to take place under the provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  In previous reforms, the Commission proposed the reforms, there was consultation and dialogue, the Council considered it and then decided on it.  Under the Lisbon treaty arrangements, the Commission makes its proposal and then both the European Parliament and the Council take positions on it.  When those positions are cleared and settled, the negotiations begin between the Parliament and the Council in the co-decision process to arrive at a new reform.  This is one of the first times the co-decision process has been used on a complex EU policy area, so it is very much uncharted territory.</p><p>  The process was commenced in 2009 by the then European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Joe Borg, when he published a Green Paper on reforms of the policy.  In it he suggested significant changes to the way the policy operated by moving to a system based on fishing effort while changing the current parameters which govern the policy.  In Ireland, the then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Tony Killeen, appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to head the consultation process with the fishing industry and other stakeholders.  They generated a response document to the Green Paper which was published in 2010 and set out Ireland's position on the review.  Many other member states engaged in a similar exercise.</p><p>  Following this consultation exercise, the Commission changed direction and brought forward new proposals which moved away from the proposal to base everything on fishing effort to one now based on transferable fishing concessions or individual transferable quotas and a market-based system which privatised fish quotas.  Since this was announced, it has undergone consideration and substantial change.</p><p>  CFP reform deals with three policy regulations.  First, there is the basic policy regulation which sets out the framework, general principles and structure of the reform.  There is a regulation on the common organisation of the market.  Both these regulations are underpinned by a separate financial instrument, the European maritime and fisheries fund.</p><p>  The main potential benefit of the policy system for Irish fishermen is that it provides a system which aspires to the structured and sustainable management of international fishing activity in each of the key areas of interest to them.  Fishing in Ireland has been an international activity for many years, involving our and many other fleets.  In addition, the CFP provides stable arrangements for access to the large and most valuable seafood market in the world, the EU's.  Exports to this market account for over 80% of Irish seafood products.  Ireland's overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver sustainable fisheries for future generations.</p><p>  The most recent development on CFP reform was at the last fisheries Council meeting in February.  At that meeting, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, as President of the Council, was successful in brokering a political agreement for the introduction of an EU-wide discards ban and reaching a Common Position on the overall structure of the CFP framework regulation.  The outcome was 26 member states voted in favour of the package while one voted against.  All the major fishing nations supported the package.  In the tradition of fisheries negotiations, it finished at 6.30 a.m., so it was consistent in that respect.</p></speech>

It is important we get these regular briefs in respect of what is taking place.  At times it is difficult to decipher exactly what the practical outcome will be for ordinary people who must try to sustain a living from fishing.</p><p>  There should be a ban in Europe on any meeting going beyond 11:30 p.m.  It is totally outrageous.  This has been going on for years and years.  A great gaisce is made about going on until 6:30 a.m.  However, people's livelihoods are depending on decisions made by fatigued negotiators and the process inevitably leads to bad decision making.  It seems that these talks, no matter what way they are organised, have gone on for years with this great macho approach to negotiation.  These are people's lives.  Everyone negotiating should be fully awake and alert when the most crucial decisions are being made.  It is obnoxious that these decisions are made at 6:30 a.m.</p><p>  Let us consider what the delegation has said on the issue of the discards.  It goes without saying that the idea of discarding good fish is obnoxious.  However, the devil is always in the detail and I am interested to hear the views of the fishermen's and fisherwomen's organisations in respect of how discards will work in practice.  We have seen all sorts of regulations coming from the environment agenda to farming which are laudable in themselves but which have had various unintended consequences when they have been applied.  I seek reassurance on the issue of discards, which I support.  No one can argue against it but we need to know the answer in this regard.</p><p>  I am concerned about the European Parliament's input with regard to the maximum sustainable yield.  The European Parliament is controlled and dominated by people who are a long way from the sea and from fishermen.  Few of the people elected to the European Parliament will depend on fishermen as an electorate.  I am concerned at the levels the European Parliament might set on a precautionary basis.</p></speech>

It is evident from the document and the presentation that coastal and fishing communities are poor relations when it comes to negotiations, particularly those in Europe.</p></speech>

I echo the comments of previous speakers on the lack of political will on the part of every Government to deal with the historical wrongs done to Ireland in the context of our fishing rights.  It is interesting that prior to Ireland joining the EEC, the Commission gave itself sole responsibility for the conservation of fish stocks in European waters in the full knowledge that Ireland, England and Denmark were negotiating to join at the time.  The European Economic Community, as it was then known, set out to steal the resources from us and hamstring us in negotiations that would take place after we had joined.  The result has been enshrined in the EU treaties since.  We have always been playing catch-up in trying to undo something that was enshrined in EU law before we joined the European Union.  I realise it is not the responsibility of the officials present.  It is a political role.  Unfortunately, this and previous Governments have not attempted to take this on and try to redress some of the wrongs done.  That has led to the Hague preferences and the fact that we cannot even have them enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy.  We will have to continuously use up political and negotiating capital every year to ensure the Hague preferences are enshrined in negotiations.  That leads to huge difficulties, whereby we cannot concentrate on other issues of importance to coastal and fishing communities.</p><p>  The agreement on discards is welcome.  However, much will depend on the actual technicalities of how the measure will be implemented and what structures will be put in place in order that fishermen will be supported in getting alternative gear that will let juvenile fish go.  However, there might still be a by-catch.  It is vital that fishermen not be penalised if, in implementing the measures introduced under the CFP, they still have a by-catch that will have to be landed.  This should be looked on in a favourable way if somebody is participating and doing his or her best to reduce the number of discards.  That will probably emerge in the detail of how the discard policy will be implemented.</p><p>  One of the issues raised in the conference last week was regionalisation and how regional decision making was envisaged to take place in the future.  In our case, there might be eight or nine countries' fleets operating in our waters and there will be the issue of trying to secure agreement on a regional basis for management structures and so forth and how effectively they will work.</p></speech>

I have an interest in the progress being made with the Common Fisheries Policy.  Regrettably, picking up an analogy used last night in a television current affairs programme, the hairdressing sector in this country probably has more political clout in terms of votes than the fishing sector.  We do not face problems because of a lack of political commitment by the Minister and his officials, we face problems as a result of a general lack of understanding of what is involved nationally.</p><p>  There are twin processes in a European context - the Common Agricultural Policy, being dealt with by the same Minister, and the Common Fisheries Policy.  We would be hard pressed to find any media coverage, support or comment good, bad or indifferent on the Common Fisheries Policy while thousands of people would protest over the CAP.  For some communities on the coast the progress with the Common Fisheries Policy is of greater interest than with the Common Agricultural Policy, important as that is for the State.  It would be ridiculous to add to the confusion by engaging into Don Quixote type battles on a Common Fisheries Policy when trying to sustain an industry that is rightly challenged internationally, with visiting fleets going after fish stocks that in some cases we do not have full scientific information on.  Dr. Beamish and Ms Kelly have outlined some of the key issues in the Common Fisheries Policy.  The ban on discards, maximum sustainable yield proposals, internationally transferable quotas and the Hague preferences are key to the sustainability of the industry.</p><p>  We can debate what happened in 1973 but I could go back to the 1600s, when the Spanish were landing fish in this country.  Many Irish people made great money at the time from imposing tariffs on Spanish fleets so we can talk about the international context going back centuries.  We can talk about how Iceland and the Faroe Isles have handled their mackerel fisheries and say we should do the same but it is more complicated than that.</p><p>  I live in Castletownbere, which is now one of the designated fishery harbour centres.  There was a time, however, when fish were being exported to Billingsgate and we got nothing for it.  The fisherman of the town were treated like dirt.  Billingsgate was the only outlet but thankfully times have moved on.  In some respects the fishing industry has consolidated into a few ports, which is regrettable because some of the traditional ports have lost out.  We tried to address that but we must fight the battle in front of us at present.  It was alluded to by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Deputy Ferris, where the European Parliament and media almost have a consensus view there should be no fishing because we are killing fish and that view is gathering momentum.   There is huge European political pressure to introduce the discard ban.  I agree with the introduction of a discard ban on a phased basis, although I am concerned about how it will work for fishermen on the ground.  I would urge the industry to engage with the Department.  Supports are needed to help the industry with technical measures and to look at proposals the industry would bring forward to reduce the amount of discards.  This is a complex problem. It is not as easy as people think - that we should just avoid catching fish a boat does not have a quota for.  For some mixed fisheries, everything is in one basin and it is not practical to suggest separating haddock from pollock or plaice.  I agree with the approach taken on targeting the pelagic fishery first, which is a cleaner fishery.</p><p>  There will still be difficulties.  We are trying to impose a ban on discards on a pelagic industry while visiting fleets are fishing almost for the entire year and it is not credible they are doing so within their own total allowable catches.  For many of the main pelagic fisheries, there should be a complete suspension of effort for the summer months.  When the Irish fleet is tied up, there is no reason anyone else should be fishing there.  Other fleets do not have astronomical total allowable catches and would be able to catch the permitted amount in the same season as the Irish fleet.  A complete summer time ban should be discussed as part of this.</p><p>  The MSY is a hugely difficult proposal but ultimately it will ensure the growth of some of our more valuable species that lend economic support through onshore processing.  Explaining the concept of maximum sustainable yield is difficult in many of these communities.  There is a huge job of work to be done by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to ensure those on the deck of a vessel understand what this means.  It will require enormous effort but I hope the industry will see the potential benefit of this.  It will be painful but Irish fishermen have taken the lead in the Celtic Sea herring management.  Irish fishermen are willing to make sacrifices when they can see better results that will lead to more sustainable fisheries for them and the generations to come after them.  It is in that context that we can achieve the maximum sustainable yield proposals.</p><p>  I missed the start of presentation so I might have missed proposals on ITQ concessions.  It is disappointing the Hague preferences have not been given permanency.  It is interesting that every year we fight and achieve the Hague preferences and it is right that we must surrender some political capital to achieve that because it is better if we focus on the battles we can win.  I accept this is a challenging time for the Irish fishing industry in the white and pelagic sectors.  The Commission's proposals on discards are universally popular but, equally, they are difficult to enforce.</p><p>  I look forward to ongoing briefings on the CFP and wish the officials well in their work.</p></speech>

If I go beyond that, please pull me back.</p><p>  One of the main issues of concern to the Irish fishing industry is relative stability.  Some of the principles were agreed in the 1970s and the code was rolled out from the early 1980s.  The reforms in 1992 and 2002 both had requests for change to the relative stability provisions.  Neither of them was successful.  In the context of the current reform, it was the subject of a lengthy debate in 2009 and 2010 with those in the fishing industry.  Some in the fishing industry demanded larger shares.  Given the political reality that such demands had not been acceded to in the two previous reforms, greater thought on how to approach that issue in the current reform is needed.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Tony Killeen, published a document which, following discussion on relative stability, had the support of the fishing industry.  It stated: &quot;Ireland believes that Relative Stability and its attendant TACs &amp;amp; Quotas, whilst imperfect, must remain the primary community mechanism to manage fish stocks.&quot;  Ireland firmly believes that, while imperfect, the TAC and quota system must remain the bedrock of access to fishery resources in the Common Fisheries Policy.  It continued: &quot;However, Ireland advocates that adjustments can be made to the present share out (relative stability) of a number of white fish and pelagic stocks so that the future allocation of Community resources is better adjusted to match today's needs and is seen to deliver increased shares of stocks adjacent to shores for coastal Member States through a range of mechanisms including the improved use of swaps.&quot;  It was looking at the use of mechanisms that were within the realm of what was likely to be proposed to try to achieve progress in that area.  In the most recent stock allocation of boarfish a couple of years ago, Ireland achieved two thirds of EU stock.  This is now an important fishery, with 56,000 tons of quota this year.  </p><p>  The Common Fisheries Policy reform is a very large package and legal instrument and not all of it is available for members, as the financial fund that would support the policy is not agreed and the areas in which spending would be prioritised or permitted have not yet been finalised.  Thus, there are parts of the CFP that have not been settled and are not available to members. <br /><i></i>One of the proposals the Minister put into the package in respect of discards was agreed in December during our Presidency.  The terminology that is used for a discard ban in Europe is a landing obligation; in other words, one cannot throw fish away but must land them.  I will quote: &quot;When a landing obligation for a fish stock is being introduced [in other words, when a discard ban for fish stock is being introduced], fishing opportunities [which is code for quotas] shall be set taking account of the change from setting fishing opportunities to reflect landings to setting fishing opportunities to reflect catches on the basis that for first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed.&quot;  The principle was put into the package agreed in February that quotas must be set, once a discard ban is brought into account, taking account of the fact that fish that were previously being discarded will now be landed.  The quota must be adjusted to reflect that.  That could be very significant.  If we look at the levels of discards in Ireland between 2003 and 2009, among our top ten commercial white fish species there was an average catch of 36,600 tons per year, with associated discards of 14,000 tons per year.  That gave an average discard rate of 38%.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the impact of this.  The figures are all set out clearly in the atlas produced by the Marine Institute and BIM for the Department, which is available from the institute or BIM.  We set out the level of discards for each fishery in order to examine the practical implications.</p><p>  With regard to overall discards, the FAO did a global review and found that the north east Atlantic, the area in which Ireland operates, has the highest discard level in the world.  It was estimated at 1.3 million tons, and the majority of discards took place in EU fisheries.</p></speech>

There would be some discards of pelagic fish but there are not strong reasons for large-scale discarding of pelagic fish.  Clearly, if the reform policy could prevent unwanted catches, particularly of juvenile fish, that would contribute significantly to building stock to higher levels and sustaining higher catches.</p><p>  The real debate on relative stability was on the Commission's proposal for the introduction of individual transferable quotas and the privatisation of quotas to individual level, allowing them to be sold, bought up, concentrated and aggregated.  Deputies were concerned about inshore fishermen, fishermen with smaller boats, family-owned trawlers and so on.  That Commission proposal was regarded by the Government as a significant threat to the way in which our fishing industry is organised and a significant threat to the national quotas.  Very strong opposition, with unanimous support from the fishing industry, was exerted in respect of that central aspect of the Commission's proposals for reform.  The fear in the Irish context was that the larger industrial companies that operate fishing fleets in white fish fisheries to the south and pelagic fisheries in the North Sea would effectively buy up Irish quotas.  If that happened, landings to Ireland would diminish significantly, as would the associated employment downstream.  There was an intense debate and Ireland was at the forefront of opposition to this proposal.  That element is not in the Council's agreed position today.  It is there to a small extent in the Parliament's position but it is not in the Council's position.  That was a significant change in what the Commission had proposed in this reform and was the core debate about the code of management.</p><p>  With regard to quotas for inshore fishermen or smaller fishing operations, the principle agreed in the general approach of the Council is that it is for member states to decide how to distribute their quotas.  This morning we had an initial meeting with the fishing industry for about four hours, updating them on the reform process.  We keep close contact with them on what is happening in the reform process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013032000010#L00400"><p>In the first instance, it will have to be done on the basis that stocks must reach maximum sustainable yield.  A proposal will come from the Commission and will be decided on by the Council.  The Common Fisheries Policy text is giving guidance to the Commission on how it makes the proposal.  When we are bringing in the discard ban, we cannot simply propose a quota as if nothing has changed.  The quota must take account of the fact that from 2016 or 2018 - the date that applies to the stock in question - the previous discards of a stock will have to be landed.  In the case of each of these stocks, a higher quota will have to be put in place to reflect the discarding of that stock which will no longer take place.  That is the principle.  The Council cannot determine that in advance - it can simply set out the principle.  The Commission makes the proposal to the Council on the quota.  This is one of the principles that the Commission will have to take into account in proposing a quota.  It will also have to consider where the stock is and the direction in which the stock is going, etc.  This will be taken into account when the discard ban is introduced.  I am referring to the Council's proposal.  The Parliament has not done anything like that.  The Parliament proposal does not reflect the idea that the quota will have to be changed to take account of the fact that the sizeable discards we saw in the past will no longer take place and will have to be landed.  This is another example of something the Council has worked through in greater detail.  It has in place a greater range of flanking measures around the decision to introduce a gradual discard ban.  All of that will have to be worked through during the discussion.</p><p>  I did not come back to the Deputy on the question of regionalisation, which he raised earlier.  Everybody agrees that a "one size fits all" Common Fisheries Policy is not desirable because it would not work from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and the western waters.  It gets complicated after that.  In most of the fisheries around Ireland that matter, at least two or three big member states are fishing alongside the Irish fishing fleet.  It is desirable to be able to make targeted regional decisions on measures to manage stocks in particular sea basins and areas.  The question of how this can be done has been the subject of a fairly detailed debate at Council level over a couple of years.  One of the principles of the debate is that there must be fairness in the decision-making process.  It is easy to envisage how two or three bigger member states might form a gang and do something that a smaller member state might not like and might wish to vote down or overrule.  The fisheries sector is a very competitive environment.</p><p>  There has been a debate on this at Council level.  The outcome, as set out in the text that was agreed in February, is that when unanimous agreement on a set of measures is reached by all the member states involved in the fishery in a particular area, the Commission will fast-track those measures into European law.  That was seen as important by Ireland because if there is to be fairness in the system, all fishermen fishing the same species side-by-side under European flags should be subject to the same EU rules.  The relevant coastal member state - Ireland in the case of Irish waters - should be able to apply those EU laws to all the vessels fishing in its area.  That is the version of regionalisation that the Council has supported.  If unanimous agreement is not reached, the Commission will have to make a proposal in the normal way.  Like any other proposal, it will have to go through the co-decision process.  Unanimity among the member states involved will be required if a proposal is to be fast-tracked.  That is the Council version.</p><p>  The proposal made by the Parliament is different.  Essentially, it has suggested that each member state should make the rules for its own fleet and that an attempt should be made to co-ordinate between the member states.  In the view of the Council and the Irish Government, that is a problematic way of going about shared fisheries.  At a minimum, it would lead to a perception that fishermen under different flags in the same fishery are operating under different rules.  If that happens, very negative things will happen in the fishery and in terms of perceptions.  There is quite a difference between the approaches to regionalisation of the Council and the Parliament.  Member states that tend to speak about the repatriation of powers tend to prefer the Parliament's approach as it would allow them to make the rules under national law.  Almost all of Ireland's fisheries are heavily shared fisheries.  Large fleets from other countries are fishing alongside our own fishermen.  That is why the Irish Government has been supporting the approach that the Council included in the February agreement.  Everybody wants regionalisation, but how will it work in practice?  How can it be fair to the fishermen on the ground?  That is the debate.  If something like the Council version of the text is adopted, significant progress will have been made because it will speed up the process of arriving at more tailored solutions for fisheries in particular areas.</p></speech>

There has been considerable movement on both issues.  We could consider doing a position paper on the issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank Dr. Beamish and Ms Kelly for attending.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Mangan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013032000003#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to address it on the matter of the report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  The colleagues with me today are Dr. John Sweeney and Mr. John Bohan, both members of the advisory group.  Also with me is Ms Teresa Leonard, assistant secretary in the Department of Social Protection, who has responsibility for the administration of the particular payments we are discussing today.</p><p>  I will provide a brief description of the content of the report and we will then be happy to answer any questions.  The report is concerned with a policy area that has been the subject of a number of reports over the years.  Child income support covers the area of child benefit, the major child income support payment, but also the areas of qualified child increases, the payments paid with weekly social welfare payments to various families, and family income support.  Some &euro;2.8 billion will be spent in 2013 on these payments by the Department of Social Protection.  This accounts for approximately 14% of total social welfare expenditure of approximately &euro;20 billion.  Of this almost &euro;3 billion in child income support payments, child benefit accounts for two-thirds of the expenditure and it is paid to 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  It is a universal payment, while the other payments, the qualified child increase and the family income support payment, are related to families' income situation. </p><p>  The advisory group recognises that family income supports have two main objectives.  First, they assist all families with the costs of raising children and second, they play a role in reducing poverty in households with children.  These objectives remain valid and are particularly significant during a time of recession and high unemployment.  However, the effectiveness of these payments in addressing these objectives has been examined in various reports.  The evidence suggests that while we spend significantly higher amounts on cash benefits on families than other OECD countries, other countries get better outcomes.  The reasons for this are complex, but the main reason is that direct income support for children is not the only consideration when child poverty is an issue.  The other major considerations are parental income and the supports available for parents to go out to work and the services available for children.  Nevertheless, direct income support for children is a major factor, but it is not the only factor in addressing child poverty.</p><p>  The advisory group was established as a result of one of the commitments in the programme for Government and was asked to examine a number of specific issues on a cost-reducing or cost neutral basis.  It is important to emphasise this was the case, because if one was to examine child and family income supports without these constraints, one might recommend a different design of income supports.  The group started its work programme by prioritising this area of family and child income supports.  </p><p>  The conclusions reached by the group were as follows.  The primary conclusion reached by the group in its entirety, which is composed of outside experts and representatives of Departments, was that child benefit should remain as a universal benefit.  I am well aware that is not necessarily the view held by all participants in this debate, but the group was very clear it wanted child benefit to remain as a universal payment for all children.  At the same time, we recognised that the system could be changed so as to better target children in low income families.  We looked at a number of options for changes to the child income support system and decided there were two main options.  One was the taxation of child benefit and the other was the two-tier payment, which is the option we recommend.  We recognised there were arguments in favour of taxing child benefit, but the main reason we did not consider this the better option was that it only deals with child benefit and not with the other payments made to children.  Therefore, it would not bring about any significant reform of the child income support system.</p><p>  There are other problems with the taxation of child benefits, not least the question of the legal issues surrounding cohabiting couples and married couples.  I would like to emphasise, however, that it is possible to tax child benefit.  Reports on this issue go back to the 1970s.  In the past, there was emphasis on how difficult it would be to tax child benefit, for technical reasons.  However, it seems to the advisory group from the information made available to it by the Revenue Commissioners that the technical problems of taxing child benefit no longer exist and this is now possible.  The reasons we did not prefer that option were not because it could not be done, but for the other reasons I have outlined.</p><p>  While recognising there is no one perfect solution, the group favoured the two-tier approach.  This means there would be a universal first-tier payment in respect of all children, although at a lower level than that paid currently.  Then there would be a second-tier or supplementary payment which would be paid to low-income families and which would replace the current qualified child increases and family income supplements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013032000004#D00300"><p>I thank the advisory committee members for their work and for the excellent research which will be useful for the group's further work.  I take the point that child income support is not the only determinant of child poverty.  I also take the point that in most other OECD countries a relatively smaller amount of expenditure seems to be yielding better results certainly in respect of child poverty.  This is because a much greater proportion of expenditure on child support is expended on services in those countries as opposed to direct income.</p><p>  The terms of reference of the advisory group are quite narrow.  It has been asked to consider the fixed amount to be spent on child support and to recast it in such a way as to make it more equitable.  I understand the point made by Ms Mangan that just one figure of &euro;63 has been examined and that this is based on the benefit plus the qualified child income support.  That being said, if those figures are applied even with the change in child benefit, the results come out pretty much the same.</p><p>  My party has examined a few models of payment.  In some cases the difficulties - if I can put it like that - to which the report gives rise when using this figure are reduced and in other cases they are exacerbated.  I cannot imagine any government, taking into account the national finances and people's circumstances, would be able to work off a figure which is very different to the figure proposed by the advisory group.  For example, it would be unthinkable for the Government to decide to work off a much lower figure in view of the fact of the large and growing proportion of our people who have very little and consistently less disposable income on which to live.  If the figure is too high it will not be cost-neutral, as is the mandate of the advisory group, with the result that the State might have to spend even more on child income support with very marginal results for our extra expenditure.</p><p>  I refer to the figures used by Ms Mangan and any of the figures my party has used in our study.  These show that it would help people who are solely dependent on social assistance payments, in other words, means-tested social welfare payments.  The problem is that it will hit working people in the lower income bracket as well.  These people might be in receipt of stamp-related social welfare payments and a partner might be working part-time or in low income employment.</p><p>  For example, I refer to page 28 of the report which deals with family income supplement.  This is an income supplement paid to people on very low incomes to encourage them to stay in work rather than depending on social welfare.  These workers will have dependent children and they are at the lowest end of the income bracket.  The report states:<blockquote> More significantly, however, families in receipt of FIS, particularly those consisting of only one child, will experience a reduction in their overall income [these are the lowest income earners in the country]. Analysis carried out by DSP in the case of parents in receipt of FIS shows that over 80% would lose a portion of their income supports as a consequence of introducing a two-tier CIS payment. ... The analysis shows that over two thirds of parents in receipt of FIS would lose between &euro;1 and &euro;100 per week and less than 20% would gain in the region of &euro;1 to &euro;50. Likewise one-parent families in receipt of the OPF and FIS will see their income reduced given that these payments can be paid concurrently.</blockquote></p></speech>

I was almost lost in the tables in the report.  Sometimes when one looks at statistics it is hard to glean exactly what they indicate.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the group considers that the universal child payment should be paid in respect of all children.  That was a good outcome, albeit that the effect of what was being proposed would be a reduced universal child payment, given the advisory group's remit that it had to be cost neutral and cost reducing.  That restriction was difficult for the advisory group given that our population is increasing, more people depend on the family income supplement and more people are qualifying for the qualified child increase.  Taking account of all those factors, it means that whatever the advisory group came up with at the other end would have a negative impact on somebody or other.  I would love to have seen a report that would have allowed the members of the advisory group to use their imagination to formulate a child income support system that recognised the universality of the existing system and to decide how to distribute another pot of gold to tackle child poverty.  Perhaps in time we will get to that.  I welcome the report.   </p><p>  I welcomed the fact that the Minister when answering questions last week recognised the benefits of social transfer, especially in tackling poverty.  I am concerned that if we start to proceed with this intended model, it will have a detrimental effect, especially when we consider the way the second tier is measured and qualified in terms of a means test, whether it is those who already qualify for qualified child allowance or family income supplement, given the changes that have occurred in FIS in particular in recent years in that more people are getting it but qualification for it is more restrictive.</p><p>  Would Ms Mangan have projections for this year, and the next five years, of the number of children who would benefit from child benefit?  I presume Ms Mangan would have some indication of those figures.  If the population rate increases as it is currently, an extra 100,000 or 200,000 children would benefit from child benefit and that would have an effect on the overall budget.  There are figures in the report on the spend, which has reduced for this year and the previous year, but the figures for the number who are benefiting is increasing.  That shows the effects of this measure this year in particular on families, especially those who might not be dependent on social welfare but who are on low and middle incomes.</p><p>  The report was submitted to the Minister last April but we did not have sight of it until February.  Has the Minister been in contact in the meantime regarding the report or did Ms Mangan indicate to the Minister any reason to delay its publication once the advisory group had completed this portion of its work?</p></speech>

I welcome that the advisory group is examining the overall impact of support to children.  The view is that the universal benefit will be retained and I have some questions around that.  Can Ms Mangan give more detail on the reason she believes taxation would hit the lower-income families if child benefit was taxed from the point of view that those who earn the most should pay more?  Why has she come to the clear position that she does not believe that taxation would be a good format to use regarding the income received in families?</p><p>  Ms Mangan spoke about the two-tier system but the beauty of the universal child benefit is that very little work has to go into the administration of it.  It is just paid out to everybody.  If we start changing the system, how much extra work would have to be done to examine the second tier?  What resources would have to go into that?  Would that offset the costs that Ms Mangan said may be saved in some areas?  She might elaborate more on the poverty outcomes under the two-tier payment.</p></speech>

In this report we did not try in any way to suggest this was a perfect solution.  In fact, we clearly state that there is not one perfect solution and we recognised, as Deputy O'Dea quoted from the report, the downsides of the consequences of the two-tier system we are proposing.  However, I would make two comments about that.  First, any change to any system that is proposed within a cost neutral structure inevitably results in losses to some people.</p></speech>

We find it difficult to divert money on behalf of children in low-income households without creating distorting work incentives.  We find that children in low-income households, whose numbers have risen hugely, are being treated inequitably.  The lucky few are in receipt of FIS but there are many who are not.  What we are looking for is a versatile instrument that can solve these aspects of the child income transfer issue.  We fully accept that the services agenda is much more interesting.  What we propose is an instrument that is quite versatile.  There is much reported consensus on keeping child benefit universal.  We did not have to agree on a rate for child benefit.  A universal payment of untaxed child benefit could be paid at the rate of &euro;5 a month and the principle of universality is respected.  The difficulty is in trying to maintain the universality, in particular of an untaxed child benefit, at the rates to which we have grown accustomed.  That is causing huge pressures on the State.</p></speech>

The first thing I should say is that the proposal is implementable.  It will involve some costs to the Department of Social Protection because it will require some further development of IT systems.  Ms Leonard might wish to contribute further on the issue.  However, the Department is happy that it can be done without incurring major costs.  The proposal is that from the point of view of assessing whether people would qualify for the second-tier payment there would be an online application system similar to the ROS system for taxation, which would be self-assessed to a degree, obviously with controls.  It would take approximately 18 months to implement the system if a decision were made to go ahead with it.  Ms Leonard is more of an expert on the matter.</p></speech>

Following the discussions that are taking place on this very good report the Government will make a decision.  In the event that a decision is made, as pointed out by Ms Mangan, it would take the Department a period of time to implement the proposal but we would be able to do so.  A number of issues require to be addressed in order to implement such major change in terms of policy, legislation, technical issues and operational issues.  We already have universal payments partly in place.  Reference was made to the fact that it just happens but it does not just happen; it takes a bit of work to make it happen.  In conjunction with that we would have to do quite a lot of work but it is doable should a decision be made by Government in that regard.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on the model presented as part of the report and the upper income threshold of &euro;25,000.  I accept Ms Mangan has stressed that this is an example not a recommendation.  The figure is low.  I would prefer the income threshold to be set at a higher rate in order to best protect those struggling at this time.  The report appears to be confined to that one example and therefore is the only reference point to which people refer.  It is important even at this stage to add a supplement to the report and to provide another example at a different rate of perhaps &euro;35,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013032000007#G00200"><p>I welcome the delegates.  They had a difficult job, but at last somebody has tackled the issue.  </p><p>  I wish to make some observations.  On the make-up of the advisory group, I note with disappointment that it does not include a representative of the Children's Alliance, Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the National Women's Council of Ireland.  It is mostly made up of departmental officials who, obviously, will try to make savings for the Department.  I am not taking from the work of the group or implying it was not done properly, but such representation would have been welcome in seeking the point of view of the organisations mentioned.</p><p>  Many statistics, facts and figures have been given to us, but I note that child benefit payments benefit 1.16 million children.  If we take account of family income supplement, we are talking about a mere 57,000 children, which amounts to a huge difference.  The family income supplement figures have been stagnant since 2009.  There was a &euro;6 increase in 2010 and the supplement benefits people to the tune of &euro;360.  In addition, self-employed persons are excluded and we all know that the self-employed are suffering, as they have nowhere to turn.  They are even finding it difficult to access social welfare payments when their businesses go belly-up, so to speak.  Those who are struggling have nowhere to turn to for help.  Therefore, the reduction in child benefit will hit the self-employed.</p><p>  While I agree with it being a universal payment, it is very difficult to stand over this when we see the figures bandied about in recent hours for the wages earned by individuals in the banking sector.  If they have children, they, too, qualify for a universal payment, yet this morning I heard a woman say on the Pat Kenny radio show that she had to go to the community welfare officer for money to buy a pair of shoes for her child because she could not afford to buy them.  She said she had sent the child to school in her Wellingtons this morning because she could not buy the child a pair of shoes.  I am sorry, but it claws at my heart to think that is happening in this country.</p><p>  The reduction in child benefit will affect people badly.  In particular, it will affect low to medium income earners who may have an income of, say, &euro;50,000, but what is their disposable income at the end of the month?  Many of the people concerned who are working may have less disposable income than someone on social welfare by the time they pay all of their bills.  We must closely examine the base figure.  I accept it is not the job of the representatives to do this but the Government's.  This entire issue warrants a much deeper discussion, perhaps among the members of this committee without the representatives being present.  Other groups are due to come before the committee to discuss it, but before the Government makes a decision, we need to discuss it in detail.  </p><p>  When we debated this issue in the Seanad at the time of the budget, I recall the Minister for Social Protection saying she would not implement these changes until a proper child care system was in place.  When I refer to "child care", I mean child care services in rural Ireland, as well as in urban Ireland.  I live in rural Ireland and know how difficult it is for someone working to have a child attending a rural school.  If someone is working in a nearby town and he or she has to collect the child to bring him or her to child care, it does not work.  We must examine the model where after-school care is provided in rural schools.  I am aware from speaking to a number of the schools that they are willing to co-operate and put in place child care services for children after school.</p><p>  With Ms Madden, I was not in favour of taxing child benefit because I had worked out the same figures as her for the way people would suffer whether they were taxed at a rate of 20% or 40% and reckoned that low paid workers would be hit extremely hard.  I seek clarification from the Department on how it will administer the payment.  We are all well aware of the delays in administering any means-tested payment and Ms Madden is talking about means testing a large number of families.  She can give it whatever name she wishes, but it is means testing.  If we take farmers as an example, it is proposed to take into account farm holdings worth over &euro;750,000 for third level grant purposes.  Will that happen in the case of child benefit?  What about individuals with second homes?  It is always easy to administer measures for PAYE workers, but we need much more detail on the way this process will be administered.  I accept Ms Mangan has said it can be done, but will she tell us how it can be done and how long it will take to means-test every family in the country?  </p><p>  If time permits, I will contribute again.  I thank Ms Mangan who has many questions to answer, but that is the reason we are here.</p></speech>

We have picked the threshold of &euro;25,000 because that is the risk of poverty limit for a family with two children.

While I cannot give members the precise figure off the top of my head, of that 61% something of the order of 45% already are being means tested and, consequently, the additional means testing is not as great as it sounds.  However, Ms Teresa Leonard knows more about this than do I.</p></speech>

It is up to the Government to decide.  What we have done is preliminary work on the matter, given there are three basic areas that would require exploration when moving in this direction.  One I mentioned earlier pertains to policy issues, which include consideration of means testing and what would be part of a means-tested scheme.  As Ms Mangan pointed out, the parents of approximately 48% of children involved in child benefit are already in receipt of a means-tested payment and this issue would require examination.  I stress the point that this is just an initial view of the issue but I suggest those who may already be in receipt of payment from the Department would automatically have an entitlement to the second tier or within parameters.  Second, as for the other proportion of persons who would have a possible entitlement to the second tier, members should recall that I am talking in a vacuum here.  We would be obliged to put in place a method whereby we could collect data from them to assess their entitlement for the second tier.  In a personal rather than an official comment, I note that one of course would seek to put out information that would identify clearly to people whether they were not in the category.  The Senator herself noted it bothers her when she hears of people with bank sector incomes and so on.  Such people evidently would learn very quickly that they were not in the second tier and, consequently, I would expect not to be getting applications for second-tier payments from that category.  Consequently, by default, the numbers again would start to moderate back to a manageable piece within an income range.  We would be obliged to give consideration to building technologies to allow us to automate, as much as possible, that process.  Again, this is for a future decision and once such a decision was forthcoming, we would work at that particular area.</p><p>  That is roughly how we would do it and how we would manage the doing of it, but in addition there would be a requirement, should a decision be made by the Government, to introduce legislation to support this particular change.  There also would be a requirement on the Department to develop technology to support it because, as was identified earlier, we have had backlogs in particular areas about which we recently have done a lot of work to clear.  However, we do not wish to end up in a position where the introduction of a measure such as this had the consequence of parents suffering a further additional backlog.  Consequently, the Department would be obliged to do a lot of work.  I cannot give the finer details to the Senator because they do not exist at this point.</p></speech>

We are able to state it means another 6% of all families would be included and it would cost &euro;125 million more than our baseline example.  They are all illustrated in table 3 on page 66, which shows there is a large tranche of families who currently are in receipt of means tested social assistance, that is, 37% of all families, who will be untouched by whatever we do to the parameters.  However there is a highly volatile middle group, which can be as small as 13% or as large as an additional 41%, which would receive some element of the second tier.  This is the heart of the versatility of the instrument and where political decisions must be taken.  The model we adopted as baseline adds a further 24% to the original 37% or, in other words, 37% of families already are being means tested for social assistance and because of the normative way the second tier is presented, one automatically would get another 24% of families, bringing us to 61% of all families in the State who would get some degree of the second tier.</p></speech>

As regards the issue that taxation might discriminate against married couples compared to cohabiting couples, is there a view that it might be unconstitutional?  There has been case law to that effect before now concerning taxation decisions.  Did the advisory group consider the costs involved if cohabiting couples were to be taxed the same as married couples?  I tabled a parliamentary question about that recently and the Minister put a figure on it of &euro;1 million for every 1,000 couples if cohabiting couples were to be jointly taxed.  According to the census, however, there are around 168,000 cohabiting couples.  While not all of them would necessarily register as such, it could cost up to &euro;168 million to provide equal tax treatment for married and cohabiting couples.  Did the advisory group consider that matter?  It would be important to take it into account.</p><p>  It seems that it would take some time to put this in place, so am I right in thinking that one could not do it for the budget in October?  What therefore would be the ideal timescale for this matter?  Would it be phased in over a number of years?</p><p>  Dr. Sweeney mentioned the working age payment report, but when is that due?  Would it be better to wait for that report before implementing this one? </p></speech>

I was not asking the witnesses to comment on what the Government does or does not do once it receives a report, other than confirming that there have been discussions since then.  In some ways, the budget changed everything in the report.  One of the promises or suggestions that the Minister made was that changes in child benefit would be ring-fenced to tackle child poverty.  It might have made it a bit more palatable if the money that was saved from child benefit in this year's budget cut had been redirected towards a qualified child allowance or the recognition of children under the family income supplement.  That would be a mechanism without creating a two-tier child income support system.  We already have such a system through child benefit, the qualified child increase and the family income supplement, without creating another payment.  We do not have that luxury.</p><p>  I am not necessarily asking the witnesses to comment because it is up to us to ask the Minister to examine a cost-neutral redistribution.  In that way, part of a payment could be shifted to specifically target child poverty.  The qualified child increase was introduced in the first place to identify those who are totally dependent on social welfare.  The family income supplement identified those who are classified as working poor.  Did the advisory group look at that as a model, rather than creating a two-tier system, to use existing payments while broadening payment levels or thresholds?</p></speech>

He also made the point that when a fixed amount of income is being redistributed, there will be winners and losers.  I can understand that but surely we should be aspiring to an ideal whereby people at the top of the scale - the richer ones - should suffer most, while the poor should gain most.  I know that we cannot achieve perfection but, no matter what example is used, these recommendations fall a long way short of that.  A hell of a lot of poor people will lose quite substantially if those recommendations are implemented.  I do not care which figure is used but we should consider the examples.  A lone parent earning &euro;20,000 per year with one child and the lone parent's allowance will lose.  A married couple earning &euro;30,000 a year will also lose, as will somebody earning &euro;35,000 with one child.  I do not think anybody could describe a person earning &euro;35,000 a year gross, with one child, as being particularly well off.</p><p>  At the other end of the scale, one may take the example of a person earning &euro;60,000 while their partner earns &euro;40,000.  On a total income of &euro;100,000 they will lose &euro;1,140.  Meanwhile, a family with an income of &euro;250,000 will lose &euro;760 which is slightly more than half what the people earning &euro;100,000 will lose.  </p><p>  As regards what people on the family income supplement will lose, it was said that a compensatory factor is that those who do not currently qualify for FIS will gain.  I agree with Senator Moloney who bemoaned the absence of FIS for the self employed.  It is a very good point.  If I am an employee working the requisite number of hours and am in receipt of FIS, I will lose money but it does not make me any happier that somebody else who was not gaining it up to now will do so.  </p><p>  I have two questions for the departmental witnesses.  First, can they provide some other figures or examples and circularise them as quickly as possible?  Second, it was stated that the report will probably have to be implemented over two or three budgets, and I accept that.  However, if it will take so long to be implemented - and if it is the Government's intention to implement it - should they not start in the next budget in October?  Has the Government indicated that it will start to implement this report?  We are now coming towards the end of March and the budget is in October.  Surely the preparatory work would want to start now. </p></speech>

Has the advisory group looked at how the system will operate for separated couples concerning who will receive the child benefit?  If there is shared custody of the children they do not get the one-parent family payments, so will both incomes be taken into account?  Or will it be the income of the person with whom the child is living?  I wonder how that will work.</p><p>  When we suggested a different baseline, the witness immediately came back with a figure of how much it would cost the Department to introduce a higher baseline.  Was the Department dictated to or told to stay within a budget when this report was being prepared, or is it being based on the advisory group's own findings? </p></speech>

The principle is very clear from the tax cases of the 1970s and 1980s.  It is not permissible for the Government to treat married couples less well than it treats unmarried couples.  That is the basic principle from which any consideration of the issue must start.  To put it into ordinary terms, the legal problem with the taxation of child benefit is as follows.  There is no point in trying to tax child benefit if it will not yield some results.  Let us consider the traditional situation, which, I accept, may not apply in all cases, where the father is out working and the mother is minding the children.  The mother is the recipient of the child benefit in all cases.  If she does not have any other source of income, she would not be liable for any tax on the child benefit and so introducing tax would not have any effect.  However, if she is married, her income can be ascribed to her husband and he can pay the tax on it.  If she is not married, that cannot be done.  So there is clearly scope for discriminating between married couples and cohabiting couples.</p><p>  When we are reviewing working age payments we will consider the issue of whether the tax system should be changed to tax cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples are taxed because the unit of assessment for tax purposes is one of the issues we need to review.  I am not familiar with the details of it yet because we have not yet examined it, but I recognise that it would cost some money to treat cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples are treated under the tax system.  I again refer back to the property tax, which will consider the joint income of cohabiting couples from the point of view of deferrals of the tax.  It is very unusual for the tax system to treat cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples, but that is one area in which it does so at present.  That can be reviewed - we have not yet considered it, but we will.</p><p>  I will ask Ms Teresa Leonard to address the issues on timing and phasing because she knows it better.  We have already said it would take about 18 months to implement this system fully.  The report also points out that the advisory group did not envisage all the elements of it would be introduced in one fell swoop.  Interestingly, savings in child benefit were made in the recent budget.  I am slightly hopping between questions here because Senator Moloney asked if we were given a budget within which to work.  The answer is that we were not, but our terms of reference very specifically provided that we would be cost neutral or cost reducing.  The package we analysed in detail is based on an assumption of &euro;200 million of savings.  The reason it is based on that assumption is not that we were told to find &euro;200 million worth of savings, but simply that we were trying to compare the two-tier system with the taxation system.  If everything could be taxed and if the issues over legality, etc., could be addressed, the taxation system would yield approximately &euro;300 million.  We were trying to compare like with like as far as possible.  I have to say we are talking about apples and oranges, but we were trying as far as possible to do that.  The example we have given involves savings of &euro;200 million from the 2012 expenditure rates.  Some of those savings have now been made by the reduction in child benefit in the recent budget.  In some ways, part of this is implemented, but the more difficult part is not implemented.</p><p>  I recognise that I am hopping between questions, but I am trying to keep some sequence in my head.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked whether we felt the savings in the recent budget should have been targeted at QCIs or FIS.  We were very clear that was not a good idea.  The problem with QCIs is not that they are not going to the less well off, which they are, but that they inherently create a disincentive to work.  Increasing QCIs further would further increase the disincentive to work.  As members will be aware from the ESRI studies, the disincentive to work does not arise for single people or possibly even for people with one child.  The disincentive to work in our system arises in the case of families with a number of children.  Transferring any of the child benefit amount into QCIs by definition disimproves the incentive to work and we were very conscious that this should not happen.  That is why we recommended instead of that having a second-tier payment which would not be contingent on receiving a social welfare payment, but would be there for those with low income.</p><p>  Deputy O'Dea suggested that the rich should lose most.  Any reform of child benefit and the associated child income support payments can only take what they are getting so the maximum that can be taken from rich people is the child benefit amount they are getting and we are not in favour of removing the universal element.  As Dr. John Sweeney said earlier, we are not saying what the universal element should be, but we believe there should be some universal element.  The vast majority of children do not live in very rich households.  Some 80% of children live in households earning less than &euro;80,000.  More importantly 20% live in households earning under &euro;20,000.  Most of us who have had children deeply regret that we were not earning as much when we had them as we might have done in later life - that is just a life cycle reality.  The vast majority of children do not live in really rich households.  While of course a few do, the system should not be geared to the relatively few who live in very rich households.  Taxing child benefit would, of course, reduce the income for very rich households.  However, the maximum that can be taken from very rich households is whatever is taken off the basic child benefit because they are not getting the other benefits.</p><p>  On Deputy O'Dea's second question, I would love to do some other examples of processing all this, but I am afraid it is for the Minister and the Department to decide whether resources should be put into this.  It seems clear to me that resources should only be invested in further analysis if the principle is accepted that we move in that direction.  If the principle is accepted, clearly major work needs to be done on the different possible packages and their effects.  Before I ask Ms Leonard to address Deputy Ryan's questions about minimising hassle, etc., I ask Dr. Sweeney to make a few points.</p></speech>

It is a potential silver lining for some of those who might lose out on the amount of their FIS that if they were receiving a second-tier payment instead, there would be much less of a penalty for working extra hours and earning more.</p></speech>

That all boils down to the precise arrangements and whether they are getting lone-parent payments or whether they are living apart.  We would need to settle on many details for that.  I understand the problem the Senator has outlined.  If, for example, a separated couple are still legally married, they come under the married rules for taxes, etc.  Once they become divorced, they are single parents rather than separated parents.</p></speech>

I keep repeating this but the decision is a matter for the Government and there is no decision at this point.  It is a matter for the Government in the context of the debates that will take place on this issue and whether it is to be brought forward in a Government agenda for the next budget.  That is strictly a matter for Government.</p><p>  Deputy O'Dea asked where we see the budget which is only so many months away.  It goes back to a point just made by Ms Mangan about producing further analysis on this.  Given the investment and resource time available to do that, until we get some clarification, one must question where this is going.  Naturally, we have done preliminary work on this and broad outlines of what it would look like as a package should the Government make a decision to put it down.  We have indicated how much time it would take us to do this, to support it and, as Deputy Ryan put it, to put in place a system that would not cause too much difficulties.  We do not want to cause any difficulties for customers so it would have to be a system that is easily operated by our customer base and available to it in a timely manner so we can react quickly to it.</p><p>  With all that in mind, we have not invested in doing in-depth analysis until we get a Government indication or decision that it is going down a particular route.  To be fair, that is not the remit of the Department.  Giving that indication is the remit of Government.</p><p>  Ms Mangan has replied to a question relating to a number of budgets.  The report clearly says that this could be brought in over a number of budgets but, again, it raises the question of how, if one makes savings, one ploughs them back and the method and timing by which one does them.  Ms Mangan answered the question about separated customers.</p></speech>

I would sound a word of caution.  The model we use is the ESRI switch model which is well-established in this area.  The analysis that was done for the group was obviously based on a particular number of budgetary parameters at the time.  They were the pre-budget 2012 parameters.  One would have to update them to compare like with like.  That model changes itself because the ESRI re-bases it when new income data come out.  With that in mind, if the committee wanted us to recalculate the numbers or do a number of different options, we would be happy to do that.</p></speech>

I will begin by explaining what the Centre of Public Scrutiny is before going on to talk about some of the research I have been doing in the past few months on transparency in Britain and particularly England.</p><p>  The Centre for Public Scrutiny is a charity whose principal role is to promote the idea of good governance by considering accountability, transparency and the involvement of the public in decision-making.  Our main focus is on local government and we receive funding from the English Local Government Association to provide support and advice on governance to councils.  We also have a broader role and that is why I have been carrying out research on transparency in the light of recent changes in government policy on transparency and open data, which principally affect England.</p><p>  I will briefly provide a context for the policy environment on the other side of the Irish Sea.  The Freedom of Information Act applying in the UK was passed in 2000 and commenced in 2005.  The Government is considering making changes to that regime.  As part of that process the House of Commons justice committee carried out post-legislative scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year.  Part of my presentation today derives from the evidence I gave that committee.</p><p>  The main areas of change reflect the keenness of our current Government to move to increased openness through the proactive publication of more official data setting freedom of information within a broader regime of openness and government transparency.  Freedom of information is a reactive means of achieving that by providing information to members of the public when they ask for it.  The Government is trying to promote a more proactive approach whereby public institutions publish information as a matter of course.  New technology forms a principal means of making this work.  Open data and transparency do not necessarily lead to accountability.  We carried out research earlier this year to tackle that central issue and principle.</p><p>  I will go through some of the principal findings from that research.  I started by studying the stream of information and how the freedom of information provisions have been embedded in UK law and culture over the past five or ten years, and the wider context of transparency.  The first thing that needs to be done is to establish some aims and objectives for transparency.  Policy-makers often forget this on the assumption that transparency is inherently a good thing.  In light of the need for open-space policy-making more generally, we need to think about why transparency is a good thing in order to be able to judge whether the measures we put in place to promote and develop it are working.</p><p>  The constitution unit, which is part of University College London, took this approach when it carried out a very deep exercise in freedom of information in 2009.  I fed off that to establish some principles on transparency across the board.  I came up with four principal objectives, the first being to mitigate risk by opening up policy making.  The idea is that by opening up the policy-making process the assumptions of decision-makers about the impact and development of policy can be constructively challenged and potential risks can be reflected more accurately, and that by bringing different perspectives into policy-making one makes law and policy more accurately.  The second objective is increasingly important in the English and British contexts - that is, facilitating choice.  Increasingly in the UK we talk about using data to make it easier for the public to exercise choice in public services.  One of the principal areas in which this happening is the National Health Service.  We now have a system whereby when general practitioners refer people for treatment, they can choose the hospitals at which they will be treated.  The use of official information is important in ensuring that those people can exercise choice in an informed way.  The third objective is one of the more traditional reasons for regarding transparency as a good thing - that is, control of expenditure.  The idea is that publishing information adds value by coupling the publication of information with mechanisms for accountability, thereby minimising corruption.  Measuring value may have an impact on decisions.  Publication of financial and expenditure data can be used to establish whether a policy is generally achieving the ends it aims to achieve.  The fourth objective is the most obvious one - that is, promoting democracy through easy access to data and information and encouraging participation.  This is based on the idea that the public has a right to information about services provided on its behalf and about decisions made for it and by its elected representatives.  Those are the four principal objectives.</p><p>  The central point that I want to highlight from the research is the importance of culture, behaviour and values in making transparency work.  Consideration of freedom of information in England focuses mainly on response rates and the amount of time and resources involved in responding to FOI requests, because they are free, as are data protection requests.  There are two separate regimes in the UK, covered by separate Acts - one for official information and one for personal information.  The focus has always been on the process.  Consequently, many have viewed FOI as a compliance issue in respect of timescales, without thinking about why FOI and transparency are important.  I am trying to get to the bottom of the culture of transparency, encouraging the idea that we should be publishing more information because by doing so we achieve some of the objectives that I have set out, making policies and decisions better, and recognising that the publication of official information is not necessarily a one-way street by encouraging the public to respond with its interpretation of that data and additional data of its own, some of which is anecdotal.  By making the information fuller we make it more useful and effective.  People need to recognise the value they can bring to decision-making more generally.  That cultural and attitudinal aspect of transparency is often forgotten.</p><p>   I want to make a couple of points about issues that have come up in England with regard to criticisms of open data and the FOI regime.  The first involves context.  Often there are criticisms of FOI and measures to increase transparency more generally because it is felt that information is released without context and therefore people cannot effectively understand what data means.  In certain circumstances, that is quite correct.</p></speech>

Before inviting members of the committee to put their questions I would like to raise three particular issues.</p><p>  First, the committee is currently developing a proposal in the context of freedom of information which will take into account administrative aspects of the police force.  Has a similar approach been taken in the United Kingdom and how has that worked out?  Second, what would be the impact of further application of the Freedom of Information Act to semi-State companies, in the context in particular of competitor companies which are privately owned being able to acquire data that would be commercially sensitive to a semi-State company?  The third issue was raised by a member of the committee during its earlier discussion, namely, regulatory bodies, in particular airports and energy companies, which have acquired a status that allows them to make decisions that cause serious damage to customers.  It appears these bodies are operating in a secret world and the relevant peer Departments have long since given up trying to control them.  This phenomenon is, according to the member concerned, referred to as regulatory capture.  How do we ensure that regulators are appropriately held to account through the Freedom of Information Act?  Perhaps Mr. Hammond would offer his expertise and opinion on those issues. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Hammond" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013032000005#E00300"><p>On policing, there are 43 police forces in England and Wales, all of which produce crime mapping data which allow people to interrogate information about crimes in their areas, including crime response and clear-up rates.  The issue with this is also one of context.  It is interesting that 18 months ago, when crime mapping were first published in England and Wales, there was an initial flurry of interest in it, in terms of people inquiring about crimes committed in their areas and so on.  However, public interest has dropped off dramatically since then because the information provided gives only a limited picture of services in local areas.  This comes back again to the issue of context and ensuring that the information provided is linked to other data which tell more about issues around crime across the whole public sector landscape, including community safety, crime prevention, probation and the justice system.  That is a complex issue.</p><p>  In terms of wider policing performance, it has been usual for some time for policing performance issues to be discussed in public.  Up to recently, policing in England and Wales was controlled by police authorities, which were bodies on which local authority members sat.  They met in public to examine issues such as police performance and published findings and reports.  They also scrutinised the police service and priorities.  That system has since changed to one of elected police and crime commissioners, the purpose of which is to improve accountability and transparency.  This highlights the issue that many of the transparency and open data issues in policing sit outside of the FOI regime.  I am not aware in detail of the particular ways in which police forces respond to and deal with FOI requests.  While they are subject in general terms to FOI, in many instances freedom of information requests on specific issues are not responded to, including on operational policing in respect of which the release of information would result in individuals being identified, which information is protected by the data protection regime.  FOI requests to the police forces are limited to strategic and tactical information about policing rather than specific or operational issues.</p><p>  On the question of freedom of information and commercial sensitivity-confidentiality, this is a significant issue which has been raised in this country in the past few years as more and more services hitherto delivered by local authorities or other public institutions and have been contracted out to private companies.  The question that arises is whether those firms should be subject to FOI.  The conclusion is that they should not be.  There was a proposal that revisions would be made to the FOI regime to make such organisations subject to FOI in this country.  However, the perception is that the Government is pulling back from this approach.  It tends to be the case that contracts between public bodies and private sector companies include provisions around transparency, openness and accountability.  By definition, and because there is no nationally accepted scheme for doing this, those arrangements end up being quite <i>ad hoc</i>.  This means one must rely on the contract management of those regimes and systems to ensure that information gets out, which sometimes happens and other times does not.  It is a challenge.  The argument being made about commercial confidentiality being an enormous barrier to FOI is not well made.  There are ways and means of preserving commercial confidentiality around procurement and tendering processes, where confidentiality is required.  The issue that arises is separating that from service delivery, where there is no justification for commercial confidentiality other than in very limited circumstances.  There should be an expectation from private sector organisations providing a public service that they should be held to the standards of transparency and accountability demanded of public services which historically would have delivered those services.</p></speech>

Will the witness comment on fees?  Currently, there is no fee attached if people make a request for their own information.  There is a fee for non-personal information, with an additional fee charged by some Government bodies where it is felt there is a substantial cost for providing the information.  That is called a retrieval fee.  Does Mr. Hammond have a comment on those issues or an indication of the level of fees applying for a freedom of information request?</p><p>  Has the use of freedom of information risen or fallen in recent years with more availability of information through modern technology?  Even organisations under the freedom of information umbrella in Ireland have a number of exemptions, and there may be a similar process in Britain.  In various pieces of legislation, certain items are exempt from disclosure even as people assume that everything in a Department is subject to the freedom of information process.  When new bodies or state organisations or boards are formulated in England, do they come under the freedom of information umbrella from their initiation?  The policy in Ireland has been not to burden a new organisation with freedom of information responsibilities and to let them bed in for a year or two before reviewing the position.  That may be a decade later.  Is there a general view on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Hammond" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013032000006#F00300"><p>There has never been a fee regime in Britain for freedom of information requests, and they have been free on demand since the outset, regardless of cost.  The British Government was toying with the idea of introducing fees and the justice committee investigation came out relatively strongly against that as an approach.  As one would expect, many witnesses were against the idea.  Interestingly, there is something of a movement for fees from central Departments and less so from local government, which may be surprising.  There is not a significant impetus for introducing fees, partially because the benefits are marginal.  The argument is that with the amount it costs to establish a system of fees and to collect fees, as the amount charged to individuals is so low, it would not be especially cost-effective to do so.  There may be different evidence in Ireland but as we have never had a fee system here, the basis is mainly on guess work.  That is the assumption being followed anyway.</p><p>  The idea against fees is more philosophical rather than anything else.  The argument is that this data is public and the justification for a fees regime is difficult to support.  Arguably, the fee may be to cut the cost but part of the duty of a public body or organisation should be to respond to requests for information from the public, recognising that the public has a stake in that organisation as citizens.  This is ultimately about the relationship between citizens and states and not having a fees regime in place encourages people to use freedom of information to find out more about services that they may wish to know about and there is no cap arising because only people with significant resources might be prepared to make a freedom of information request.  It could be claimed that such a cap puts power into the hands of people with more economic advantages.</p><p>  There have not been any enormous trends up or down in the use of the freedom of information process.  Use has consistently been relatively high since the freedom of information process began in 2005.  There are still issues with vexatious and persistent requests to some public bodies and there is still the matter of the press using freedom of information for "fishing" exercises.  As there is no charges regime, the press can submit freedom of information requests to every local authority in the country to query an issue, hoping that something newsworthy will come from the information.  That is part of the price to be paid for having a democracy.</p><p>  Volume is significant and some people in Britain have raised concerns about the volume of freedom of information requests.  The way to get around this is to publish more information proactively, and the more this is done in a useful and intelligent way, the less people will automatically need to approach freedom of information as the first means of acquiring information about how a public body operates.  Councils and other institutions public much information about themselves proactively but often it is not very easily understood by people and can be difficult to access.  The ease of access problem is one of the reasons freedom of information is well used, and as we move to a more intelligent approach to open data, I hope people's need to revert to freedom of information requests as a default will reduce.  That may be idealistic.</p><p>  There are two principal forms of exception under the Freedom of Information Act here.  There are absolute exceptions for national security and there are also qualified exceptions.  A public body must carry out a public interest test to establish whether information should be released when it could be covered by a qualified exception.</p></speech>

There was a small number of dissenting voices.  The former Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, the senior pre-eminent civil servant in the country has cast some aspersions on the Freedom of Information Act.  He made the point that I mentioned earlier about the chilling effects and the problems he thought it could have.  Again, one could be charitable about that and say that looking at a government from the inside, as he does, he will see the shortcomings that perhaps freedom of information has in terms of speed in decision making and the fact that it can throw spanners in the works.  Equally, one can could say that could be an example of somebody who is not signed up generally to the principles of transparency and does not really understand what transparency as a broader concept can bring to decision making, but instead looks at FOI purely as a procedural issue whereby people are sending in requests, those requests must be processed and it is additional work.  It is FOI sitting in a separate box which will stop what one must do.  One is not using the benefit and the lessons one learns through that process to influence one's wider work.  One is treating it as an essentially transactional exercise.</p></speech>

What the witness said about Tony Blair inclines me to say that we should adopt the UK model lock, stock and barrel.  Mr. Hammond is very much in favour of freedom of information, more transparency and more accountability and he says the model in the UK is generally quite good.  Will he indicate a few areas where he believes it could be improved even further?  Mr. Hammond appeared to hint in that direction.  He said a key aspect was not just being reactive or having a system that is reactive but having one that is proactive, which is about getting good information published and getting it out to the public in an accessible and understandable form for ordinary people.  I agree with that.  However, Mr. Hammond also spoke about opening up the decision making process.  I thoroughly agree with him.  Part of the reason people are often so alienated from state administration is that they feel decisions were made before they had a chance to scrutinise them or to be consulted on them.  Will Mr. Hammond speak about how that works and how opening up the consultation process is or is not working in the UK, where it might be improved and what we could learn from his experience and views on that?</p><p>  I also have a question on the issue of commercial sensitivity.  Mr. Hammond dismissed the concerns in that area.  In Ireland, I believe there is a widespread concern about the difficulty in getting information from semi-State bodies, State agencies and State boards and in cases where services are contracted out.  Mr. Hammond appeared to think that was not a big issue.  It is certainly a big concern for us.  It is not just State agencies.  We also had a discussion here about bodies that receive substantial money from the Exchequer, such as not-for-profit organisations or banks that are private entities but which have received huge amounts of money from the taxpayer, and whether freedom of information should extend to them and having transparency and accountability in that regard.</p><p>  There is also the asylum, immigration and deportation process.  We have received testimony from asylum seekers and organisations representing refugees that there is a veil of secrecy around this area, it is very difficult to get information and that we must be specific in opening up this area.  Will Mr. Hammond comment on that?</p><p>  Finally, there is the issue of fees.  Mr. Hammond said that the vexatious complaints, the costs and so forth have been raised in the UK.  This has certainly been raised over here.  Will he give us a little more information on why this should not be an obstacle to extending freedom of information as far as possible?  Even though vexatious requests are obviously a phenomenon, it is not such a burden that it makes public administration unworkable.  Is that what I should take from what Mr. Hammond said?</p></speech>

On the question of improvements, one matter that is often raised is the fact that the Act requires public bodies to produce what is called a publication scheme setting out what documents and other items they publish as a matter of course.  I do not think the publication scheme has worked as anticipated.  Organisations do not regularly update their publication schemes in some instances.  I suspect that many have not updated them since 2005.</p></speech>

I found the latter part of Mr. Hammond's contribution very interesting.  Representatives of the National Union of Journalists appeared before the committee earlier to discuss this module and had their own observations to make.  It would be very much associated with a campaign to loosen up, or broaden, aspects of the Freedom of Information Act.  One of the proposals at which we looked was the concept of a register user fee, in order that one could have accredited or non-accredited or associated or non-associated journalists who might be freelancers able to operate under one umbrella to engage with the freedom of information service.</p><p>  To return to Mr. Hammond's biscuit comment, it must be acknowledged that, at times, the media engage with the Freedom of Information Act for commercial purposes.  It is not always about extrapolating information and asking questions about how many biscuits have been bought in the borough of Manchester or Liverpool.  It might make an interesting headline on the front page of a newspaper tomorrow morning, but is it really serving the public interest and should local authorities charge for finding the information?</p></speech>

These are privately owned companies that compete with one another.  That is not to say we should not open up more information but is there any acknowledgement of the commercial aspect of the Freedom of Information Act and how the media engages with it?  There is a paradox that if information was more open, the sorts of exclusives newspapers got through FOI requests, or the silly season stuff that comes out in the middle of July when there is nothing else to write about, would not be covered.</p><p>  What ethics apply to freedom of information?  Is there any code of conduct?  The phone hacking scandal in Britain has been in the news, where the media themselves were withholding information that the public had problems accessing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Hammond" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013032000009#JJ00400"><p>I completely accept the press will want to get hold of information for its own needs.  The print media want to sell newspapers.  There is an issue of journalists going on wide-ranging fishing exercises, although in my opinion it is over-played.  It is difficult to see how to police a dual track regime because if we say a journalist should adopt a different process from a private individual, the obvious way around that is to make the FOI request as a private individual.  The practical circumstances would make that practically unworkable.</p><p>  Some have suggested press organisations pay a levy on the assumption they will make freedom of information requests but I do not see how that can be practically operated and how it would be possible to classify where an organisation should have to pay money for information and where it should not.  One of the benefits of the British regime is the simplicity and because there are no charges, those tricky hard cases do not need to be decided because the system is blind to whomever is making the request.  That is a fundamental principle of the Freedom of Information Act.  It is irrelevant and it is frowned upon to ask why a person might want information.  The fact the information is requested is the only thing that is relevant.  Requestor blindness is one of the fundamental aspects of the British Act and that is jealously guarded.  The ICO has produced some robust guidance on this.</p><p>  It comes back to the philosophical issue I talked about earlier.  These are public data that have been created and developed on behalf of the public using public money and therefore it should be produced in the public domain as far as possible.  It is going to produce difficulties, and be arguably more expensive, for some public institutions to publish information on request in this way than would be the case if they did not do it.  If it ultimately helped to make decision making more effective, however, and if it is coupled with effective accountability mechanisms, that is the critical factor.  If it helps to open up participation in decision making and to achieve the objectives I set out at the beginning, it is worth it.  It is about recognising the externalities and not looking at FOI requests as being a cost in a box somewhere.  We must say that as public bodies, we are paying a cost to manage FOI requests but we get a benefit in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in being open and allowing people to work with us and co-produce public decisions and policy.  By doing that, the decisions are more effective and offer more value for money.</p><p>  It is a <i>quid pro quo</i> and the press are an integral part of that challenge.  Some of the material they produce will be daft and borderline vexatious but much of their work is about genuine robust public challenge.  By trying to mitigate the more frivolous stuff, there might be a risk of missing some of the more serious material.  On balance, it is not worth the effort to develop a complicated regime to separate things out; that is the conclusion some of the British advocates have arrived at.  I cannot speak for the ICO or other experts but I think that broadly accords with their views.</p></speech>

Britain has substantial experience of this area spanning more than 38 years.  Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction, particularly in assisting the rehabilitation process for people who have been convicted, served sentences and paid their debt to society.  In Britain, the period considered spent was 30 months at one stage and that has been increased to 48 months, which provides more scope.</p><p>  I wish to read into the record the relevant sections of a case study by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  It is the case study of an individual called Liam.  He received a six-year sentence with the final two years suspended.  He completed his leaving certificate in prison along with various other courses and upon release he successfully completed the Trinity Access programme and a degree in social science in NUI Maynooth, following which he did a postgraduate diploma in adult and community education.  He is now qualified to teach various courses, as recognised by the Teaching Council.  That is just one example of an individual who would be ruled out under what is proposed in the legislation, as would many more like him.  Those are people who have genuinely rehabilitated themselves and are success stories, but they will be excluded under what is proposed in the legislation. </p><p>  I note also that the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which we would all respect as an advocate for change and with which the committee has worked on our penal reform recommendations, which will be launched soon, recommends that we consider a period of 48 months in this respect.  That is the context for my amendment.  I trust the Minister of State will consider accepting it.</p></speech>

We have been informed on it by some of the deliberations and commentary of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  We did not go quite as far as proposing a period of 48 months.  We propose to substitute the period of 12 months with two years to allow for greater flexibility.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn alluded to a case study.  As I said on Second Stage, the general thrust of the legislation is very much welcomed.  I attended Limerick Institute of Technology recently and heard from a number of students who are finding it difficult to get placements by virtue of the fact that they have previous minor convictions on their record.  Obtaining Garda clearance and all that goes with it is proving to be an obstacle to them.  The period of 12 months is a little restrictive.  If the Minister of State is minded to extend the period to two years that would be great, or if he wants to go along with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's proposal to extend the period to 48 months, I would withdraw my amendment on that basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013032000002#A01100"><p>I thank the Deputies for their support for the Bill.  There is a cross-party perspective regarding the Bill and that is welcome.  We have given the amendments proposed by both Deputies a good deal of consideration.  As the members will be aware, the law in England and Wales has been amended recently to provided that sentences up to four years are covered by their Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.  Some say that this should be the benchmark by which we should devise our own scheme.  The Deputies have settled on a period of two years and four years, respectively.  It is worth saying that the English and Welsh legislation, which does not apply in Northern Ireland, is now probably the most liberal in the common law world.  Meanwhile what we are proposing, when compared with Australia and New Zealand, is at the more liberal end of the spectrum.  In most Australian states only prison sentences of six months or less are covered while in New Zealand no one who is sentenced to imprisonment can benefit from their corresponding legislation.  In Northern Ireland where sentences of up to 30 months are covered, the rehabilitation period for a six months sentence is seven years from the end of the sentence, as against four years from the date of conviction provided under the Bill.</p><p>  It is worth recalling also that the genesis of this legislation was the highly regarded Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions, which we all have seen.  That report recommended only sentences of six months or less should be covered.  </p><p>  In preparing the legislation the Government decided to go the extra mile and cover sentences of up to 12 months.  In that respect, the Government is going further.  The 12 month cut-off covers more than 85% of all custodial sentences handed down by the courts in Ireland.  By any yardstick, a regime that allows a proportion of custodial sentences to become spent, as in this case, is generous.  The 12-month cut-off aligns the regime with the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court where summary offences are prosecuted.  </p><p>  There will always be opinions on the cut-off point, whether it be 12 months, 24 months or 48 months.  From a Government perspective, we are definitely going to stick with a 12-month cut-off.  Having spoken to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and discussed the matter at length, we will revisit this in the coming years and see how it is working.  After a number of years we may return to it having regard to some of the suggestions that have been made, but we have to start off somewhere.  Given the fact that the cut-off point we propose covers the percentage of convictions that I mentioned, a 12-month cut-off point is appropriate at this time. </p></speech>

I gave a particular case study of a person who has made a huge effort in education over a sustained period and has not only repaid his debt to society but has actively sought to do more than that.  We have to strike that balance.</p><p>  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the case of Cox <i>v.</i> Ireland which went to the Supreme Court.  The court ruled that section 34 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, which applied to public servants, was too broad and discriminated against those affected.  In this legislation the Minister of State and the Department of Justice and Equality should be mindful that wherever they set the level, it must be balanced with the right of the citizen who has rehabilitated himself or herself in a demonstrable way to have a chance to return and actively participate.  This concerns the whole area of employment rights - that the person's rights to work, to a pension and in other issues are not affected.  I accept the Minister of State has made clear he will not go beyond 12 months but I appeal to him to engage with the Minister after today's meeting to see if he is entirely satisfied that what he suggests is in compliance with Article 40.3 of the Constitution, namely, the right to work or earn a livelihood.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may be aware that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has raised this issue.  The Bill states that the case of a person with more than two convictions will not be considered. The Minister of State will know that in some cases a number of convictions are lumped together and considered as one.  We hope to have this section deleted, thereby addressing the issue.  The Minister of State must accept there are exceptional circumstances where a person has three or four convictions that were put together or intended to be considered at a future date.  However, even if the person in question has served his or her debt to society, the Bill makes no allowance for that.  I ask the Minister of State to agree to the deletion of the section.  He may prefer to consider the issue on Report Stage.  Where a number of convictions take place on a single ruling of a court, and in cases where the person concerned has served his or her time, we ask that in those exceptional circumstances allowance be given.</p></speech>

We all know of such stories.  It is clear this is not a charter for criminality and a line must be drawn somewhere.  The line drawn is as per the two-conviction limit and is based on the premise that people deserve a second or third chance.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, introduced an amendment in the Seanad that will allow a person with a number of convictions to have them all deemed spent, provided they relate to two incidents.  The people we are trying to assist are genuine, something I believe all of us in this room accept, and are not career criminals.  Few people would suggest that the scheme should be opened further and I do not believe anybody present is suggesting that.  The people spoken about during the debates on this Bill are decent people who have made one or two mistakes, probably in their youth.  They want to move on and have no intention of coming to the attention of the authorities again.</p><p>  The Deputy's amendment would provide no deterrence to criminality but instead would hold out the prospect that no matter how often a person offends, a day will come in the future when his or her convictions will be spent.  I do not believe this is in the interests of either the offender or of society.  We want people to stop committing crime; we do not want people re-offending.  In so far as this Bill can assist in discouraging recidivism, the limit on the number of convictions that can become spent has a positive contribution to make to the rehabilitation and re-integration of qualifying persons.</p><p>  I suggest that the Deputy revisits his proposal.  The entire Bill shows how we can deal with this situation, collectively and politically.  </p></speech>

I will give the Minister a case study from the IPRT on this.  Conor is now in his late 40s.  When he was 18 years of age he was before the courts for failure to stop at the scene of a traffic accident, dangerous driving and no insurance.  He was disqualified from driving for three months and had his licence endorsed.  As he received three convictions on three different charges at the one sitting, he will be ruled out of having his convictions considered spent under the Bill.  In Britain, the system there has 38 years of experience of dealing with spent convictions and it has no such limit.  Will the Minister reconsider this?</p></speech>

It also gives people a second chance.  We all know of cases whereby people have done foolish and silly things when they were young.  Within certain conditions, this will give them a clean slate and allow them to operate like everyone else.  There are certain provisions which exempt such cases but they are in place for good reason.  By and large, we know the overall thrust of the legislation is a good idea and acknowledges a human dimension.</p></speech>

Unless states have reciprocal arrangements for the recognition of spent convictions, they do not recognise each other's.  This is for the good reason that penal systems vary greatly across the world.  What may merit a lenient sentence in one country may merit a harsh one in another and vice versa.  The legislation defines &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; in section 1 as the conviction by a court of a person.  &ldquo;Court&rdquo; is defined as any court in this State.  This clearly locates the regime provided for by the Bill in this State.  For this reason, the Government cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill already contains several safeguards regarding requests for information.  In the first instance under section 5, a person cannot be required to disclose a spent conviction or the circumstances ancillary thereto.  Section 5(2) states when a person is asked about a previous conviction, he or she may regard it as not applying to a spent conviction.  If a person were asked if they had any spent conviction, they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and be protected under this Bill.</p><p>  Under section 11, where a person seeks his or her criminal record, possibly at the request of an employer, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to provide the record in two parts, namely, one with the spent convictions and the other with non-spent convictions, if any.  Where a person only has spent convictions, he or she can provide the requester with the clean record.  In these circumstances, the Government will not accept this amendment.</p><p>  While I accept one cannot legislate to prevent people from asking questions, the Bill does provide criteria to protect people as to how they answer questions regarding spent convictions.</p></speech>

What the amendments are trying to achieve is self-evident.  We believe the periods of rehabilitation for more minor offences should be reduced, as set down in the two amendments.</p></speech>

This is a matter of judgment, similar to many other parts of the Bill, and it may need to be reviewed in years to come.  At this point we will not be accepting the amendment.  The two-year minimum rehabilitation period that applies in the Bill should be seen in the context of the Law Reform Commission proposal that the minimum should be five years and of the period in the Bill as originally published, which was a three-year minimum.  The Minister substantially changed the rehabilitation period when the Bill was in the Seanad and he is satisfied that the regime works as a whole.  Accordingly, the Government is not in a position to accept the amendments.  However, I put it to the Deputy that this is something that may need to be looked at again in some years' time, possibly following further work carried out on analysing the results with regard to how this is used and, further, following progress made by the Department of Justice and Equality in working with other jurisdictions on correlating spent convictions.</p></speech>

It is important to bear in mind that a good deal of this comes down to judgment.  We will have to review this in the future based on the empirical data that will arise a as result of the analysis carried out over several years.  We will learn from that.  There is political coming together on the issue and it is the common-sense thing to do.  From the Government point of view, now that this has finally been done, there is likely to be a willingness to take that approach.</p></speech>

As I have said before, because social media is changing the way in which many of our citizens interact with one another, we thought it was important that the committee should become aware of the various facets of this topic, particularly in light of the disquiet that has been expressed in some quarters about the lack of curbs on the irresponsible use of these channels.  As members are probably aware, the committee has already heard the views of the Office for Internet Safety and Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and has held meetings attended by representatives of the social media networks Facebook and Twitter.  We have also met the National Anti-Bullying Coalition and will hear from Digital Rights Ireland later this morning.  In addition, we are taking submissions in writing via social media channels from interested groups and individuals.  At the end of that process we propose to prepare a report and make recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Sue Duke, head of public policy, and Ms Sabine Frank, media literacy policy counsel, from Google.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submission or opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Duke to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Sabine Frank from our Berlin office, who is our expert on digital literacy.  We have divided our presentation into three main parts, the first being the benefits of the Internet and social media platforms.  I will then give a brief overview of what YouTube is doing to ensure people stay safe and secure online and I will offer a couple of thoughts on where we think we can all work together in this area.</p><p>  Before I begin, I will give the committee a quick introduction to Google Ireland.  Google celebrates ten years in Ireland this year.  During the course of that time we have grown from five Googlers in 2003 to more than 2,500 Googlers today.  Our recent investment of almost &euro;300 million in our headquarter buildings just down the road in Barrow Street as well as our new data centre in west Dublin has consolidated our long-term commitment to Ireland and will be the basis for future growth and expansion.  Much of the work we do from Dublin focuses on helping companies, big and small, to get the most out of the new business models and new opportunities presented by the Internet.  I will detail precisely what those new values are.</p><p>  In the past decade the innovations brought about by the Internet have revolutionised communications and the spread of information across the globe.  The Internet has been a phenomenal force for good, promoting culture, boosting economic growth and advancing free expression.  Social media platforms such as YouTube have been at the heart of the Internet's success in generating economic value, creating employment and fostering innovation and creativity.  </p><p>  What is YouTube?  For those who are not familiar with it, YouTube is our user-generated video-sharing platform, around which users debate, form communities, interact with and inspire one another.  YouTube began in our founder Chad Hurley's garage in California in 2005, when he posted the very first video of his friends at the zoo.  The following year, Google acquired YouTube, and since then the platform has enjoyed enormous success, becoming the world's biggest video-sharing platform today.  The slide on the screen will give the committee a quick snapshot of the story of YouTube and some sense of the scale of content we are dealing with.  Seventy-two hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and there are 4 billion views on YouTube every day.  In 2011, we had more than a trillion views on the platform, which equates to about 140 views for every person on the planet.  YouTube has enabled creativity and collaboration on an unprecedented scale, allowing the young, the young at heart and the old to engage with communities both locally and globally, to express themselves and to get involved in society.  For example, on YouTube today one can submit an idea for a science experiment to Stephen Hawking.  One can launch one's music career, as Justin Bieber did, or start a business from one's bedroom.  Cork man Jason Sullivan began uploading cartoons last year to YouTube and after phenomenal success on the platform, Sminky Animation, as shown on the screen, has gone on to sign a contract with United Agents in London.   The Khan Academy, with which many members may be familiar, has pulled together more than 3,000 educational videos on YouTube, with students around the world viewing up to 200,000 videos every day on topics ranging from calculus to arithmetic and from prehistoric Africa to the Second World War.  During the past weekend, members may have seen how RTE used the platform to promote Ireland at home and abroad.  It live-streamed two main events: the full St. Patrick's Day parade, and, as part of The Gathering, a one-hour music stream from &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, which showcased a host of Irish talent from Christy Moore to the Frames to the Script.</p><p>  As with any means of communication, there can be challenges.  I am aware that the committee has discussed at recent hearings how social media platforms reflect older and larger societal problems with regard to how we treat one another.  In order to address these societal problems we believe we need societal solutions, but we also believe that technology and technology companies have a role to play in ensuring they keep their users safe online.  </p><p>  I turn now to how YouTube is playing its part.  There are three pillars to our approach to user safety at YouTube and, more generally, at Google - education, empowerment and protection.  At YouTube we are deeply committed to educating young people about how to use the Internet safely and responsibly and to raising awareness about digital citizenship and digital literacy.  I shall take members through a couple of the campaigns that are particularly relevant to the committee's current work.  The first is the digital citizenship curriculum.  We launched an online curriculum for YouTube last year aimed at supporting teachers of second-level students by providing online teaching plans and lesson plans.  The curriculum educates students on YouTube's policies, how to keep themselves safe online and how to report abusive content, in order that they can develop a holistic understanding of how to be a responsible digital citizen.  The curriculum was first tested in the Ursuline convent in Waterford, where our local YouTube team walked through the lesson plans with four transition year students and their teachers and used their feedback to improve and adapt the programme.  Since then the digital citizenship curriculum has been launched globally.  </p><p>  The second project, It Gets Better, was created to show young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teenagers how successful, fulfilled and happy their lives will be if they can get through their difficult teenage years and to show them they are not alone during those years.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great work the company is doing and wish it well in its future endeavours.  It is interesting to see the figures which show how the company has taken off globally in the past ten years and its interaction with the ordinary citizen.  The committee is trying to ascertain the legal issues around cyber bullying and posting defamatory material on YouTube and other social media.  Ms Duke has outlined the company's policy on flagging and how it deals internally with something dangerous, misleading or malicious on the site.  What resources does it put into this work?  It must be an enormous job to police the site, judging by the volume of traffic on it.</p><p>  The Internet is a bread and butter matter for kids growing up today.  What data does the company have on the issue of suicide?  People are interacting at very vulnerable times in their lives.  Has YouTube dedicated any resources to dealing with this issue?  Can Ms Duke safely say the company has intervened when people have posted such material or was it too late?  That kind of information is hugely important.  We would all love to think that from playschool on society is pleasant and that no one makes malicious comments, as everybody wants to live in Utopia.</p><p>  The question of whether there is a gap or otherwise in the legislation in Ireland or internationally is constantly raised.  The Minister outlined it in the opening paragraphs of his contribution before we started these hearings.  Many believe that when they are damaged by malicious comment on the Internet, whether on YouTube or any other platform, they have no recourse to the law.  What recourse is available if somebody from outside the State posts something defamatory about an individual that is without foundation and damaging?  Is there inter-jurisdictional legislation in place?  What law or recourse is available to that person?  There is a great deal of evidence, anecdotal and factual, that what is happening on the Internet is causing huge damage to a certain percentage of people.  We do not have to go outside the Republic to see the numbers who have been damaged.  If that reflects the percentage worldwide, a very high percentage of people are affected.  Many access this very successful technology, from which the general populace derives great good.  Is it necessary for the United Nations or other international bodies to take this crime as seriously as they do any other?</p><p>  Ms Duke has shown us how much the technology has developed in the past ten years, with 4 billion people using it, and for how many hours each person uses it.  What do we need to do?  We want to present a report to the Government and others on what we believe is the way forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sue Duke" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032000005#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  To answer the question about the resources we have invested in this area, a high volume of content is being uploaded all the time.  We have developed a flagging system precisely to allow us to handle the content.  Once a report is received, it is sent to a YouTube policy enforcement team.  We have multiple teams working around the clock, around the globe, covering all geographical regions and time zones, to make sure that once content is flagged, it is examined and if it violates our rules, it is taken down very quickly.</p><p>  It is not true to say the Internet is an unregulated Wild West space.  What is a crime offline is a crime online and legislation dealing with offline crimes applies equally to online crimes.  There are regulations and directives that apply to online transactions and behaviour and, in addition, there are self-regulatory models that companies have come up with at a global level to enforce rules on the Internet.  Many companies have a community policing system similar to the one we have developed.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that they take abuse and inappropriate behaviour online seriously, which is welcome.  Will they outline where and how Google and YouTube generate revenue?  The more postings, downloads, views and activity on the site, the greater the revenue.  The Korean video of "Gangnam Style" generated 1 billion views, which is extraordinary.  How does this activity generate revenue for the company and those who upload content?</p><p>  Suicide was a secondary option in the drop-down menu shown in the presentation.  Is there any consideration given by Google to making it a primary option in the drop-down menu?  It is becoming a huge issue and this measure may prove helpful.</p><p>  From what our guests have said, users have protection.  They can choose to vary their privacy settings, but subjects of content do not seem to have the same protection.  One of my concerns is how the subject, rather than the user, of content might encounter difficulties.  This applies not only to the content but also to comments made afterwards.  Last night I looked at a music video on YouTube.  It was of a folk singer from this country who had passed away.  The subject was in a minority group, but it did not take me long to find a comment that any Member would be lambasted for making.  It is still online and it is an incitement issue.  It may never have been flagged to YouTube.  I understand how the rules work with community policing, but it could happen anywhere.  If it was flagged by a subject, does YouTube or Google have tracing capabilities?  Where content is flagged and being dealt with by someone, is there a timeline, record or log of how the company deals with the report?</p><p>  Does Google or YouTube work with the office for Internet safety in the Department of Justice and Equality?  There are cases in which users violate the rules which are quite strong.  I am pleased that the rules are so effective.  When users violate them, there are sanctions and they can be suspended.  What happens when users violate the law?  Does Google or YouTube contact law enforcement agencies directly or leave it to those who have been injured to do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sue Duke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032000006#F00300"><p>On the first point, the YouTube revenue model focuses on advertising and forming partnerships.  When the Deputy was on YouTube last night, he probably noticed that we formed partnerships with channels, merchants and individuals.  Under the advertising model, we share revenue with our partners.</p><p>  The second question was related to foregrounding the suicide and self-injury category.  We recently added this category because the feedback from users was that, where they saw a threat of suicide or self-harm, it would be useful to have a specific box to tick to highlight the issue to YouTube.  That is why it is place and we use the same dynamic to consider whether it should be a stand-alone category.  If users say it should not be categorised under the heading of abusive and harmful content and should be a stand-alone category, that is something we will examine.</p><p>  The third question concerned videos.  If there is a video on which someone is being treated wrongly or abusively, there is the option to flag the content.  The second option involves using our privacy complaints process.  As a user, if someone appears on a video but does not want to be included in it and the video identifies him or her by showing his or her face or revealing a name or personal details, there is a very straightforward form in our help centre which requires the URL of the video, to know who the person is and how he or she has been identified.  As long as the video is not in the public interest and where there is no issue of consent, we remove it.  I did not include the issue in my presentation, but I am happy to send the details to the committee.</p><p>  The other issue was related to criminal investigations.  It is an extension of my previous comments.  We have included the details of the privacy complaints process because the video may not break any rule while still violating someone's right to privacy.  In that case, we remove it.  If someone's right to privacy is infringed, we respond.  Likewise, one has normal legal recourse offline to report a crime committed against a person or where rights are being infringed.  Where there is due legal process, we co-operate with law enforcement agencies in investigating the crime and, potentially, assisting in prosecuting.</p></speech>

We make sure we have people dedicated to reviewing complaints in order that content is taken down as quickly as possible.</p><p>  With regard to how people are identified on the platform, we have two options.  One can use one's real name or a pseudonym.  Some people want to use their real name because they are retailers and want to build an awareness of their product and interact directly with people, while others use pseudonyms because they feel more comfortable expressing themselves using a pseudonym.  I am aware this issue has been discussed at recent hearings, but this has been a huge help in allowing people to express themselves freely.  The Minister, for example, mentioned the Arab spring, which has given a huge fillip to freedom of expression around the world.</p></speech>

I have not participated in the virtual world as frequently as younger generations and, in some ways, politicians are playing catch-up.  Perhaps other politicians are more adept than I am.  Are the complaints YouTube receives in other jurisdictions similar to those it receives in Ireland or do they differ, particularly on the cyber bullying issue?</p></speech>

When we developed our guidelines, we took experts on global legal frameworks and safety etc., into the room.  We worked long and hard on developing them and thought a lot about them because of the issues raised by the committee.  We consider bullying to be about somebody who is persistently or gravely being attacked or harassed by somebody else.  That is common to all cultures.  All parents and teachers know when somebody is being bullied or attacked in that way and want to stop it.  The committee should rest assured that this is something we experience around the globe.  It is an issue to be addressed around the globe and a value common to all cultures.</p></speech>

We have dedicated persons who speak almost all languages.  This reflects the fact that in videos we have different languages and need to understand what people are saying.  We also need to take the context into account because context is key if we are to police videos against our community guidelines.  The committee should rest assured that we make sure we have all the knowledge we need to do this work in a proper and meaningful way.</p><p>  We put a lot of emphasis on education because we believe mobbing and bullying are phenomena in the offline world just as they are in the online world.  It is important that we educate teachers and equip parents and students in their early years with the proper tools.  We are all educated to read books critically and carefully and understand the context in books, but we are not well equipped to do the same in the online world.  This is where we can see we have a role we can play and co-operate and have many partnerships with experts in this area.  My colleague mentioned peer-to-peer projects.  We have similar projects in different countries and would love to explore with the committee whether we could so something similar in Ireland.  Our experience is that teenagers take it much more seriously if people of the same age educate them and it is much easier for them to turn to them if they have a question or problem.  It is also about having a level of trust.  They trust their own peer group more than older people.  That is why we have invested in many partnerships moving in this direction.</p><p>  Parents obviously have an important role to play and should equip their children with all the tools they need.  We have dedicated special resources on our platforms directed at parents to give them a better understanding.  They outline the background to cyber bullying, to whom parents can turn, what they can do and how to spot the first signs and reactions if their children are being bullied.</p></speech>

They might not be on top of all the technology and changes to it but they know how to raise their kids.  Accordingly, online education is no different from offline education.  This is where we have to empower them.</p><p>  European studies show parents are aware of their role in this regard but we need to help them, as the Chairman said, to better play this role.  Parents have a key role next to teachers and companies such as YouTube in this regard.  We all have to take our share.  That is why YouTube has dedicated resources to educate parents.  In Germany, schools hold parent events after school hours at which parents are helped to better understand the online world.  We would be happy to assist the committee on this.</p></speech>

The example of the US President, Mr. Obama, dealing with bullying and LGBT groups shows how YouTube and the Internet can be used positively.  With regard to the flagging system YouTube has for inappropriate material, in some ways it only happens after the event.  There was a case in Dublin recently of a young man dodging a taxi fare after a night out which was videoed and, subsequently, put up on YouTube.  It went viral but another young man was identified wrongly as the man in the video and he had to go to court to try to have it taken down.  Is there someone in real time monitoring what is going up on YouTube?</p><p>  I accept that freedom of expression includes the right to remain anonymous.  However, if someone uses anonymity as a disguise to put up offensive material or attack someone personally on YouTube, is it possible for the victims to trace the source of the video?</p></speech>

As a teacher before I came into the D&aacute;il, I believe YouTube is a strong power for good and a great teaching aid.  It was used by me and my peers to enhance our teaching practices.  For example, when teaching the safe cross code to six year olds, it is easier to get a YouTube interactive video with the song up on the whiteboard rather than having to sing it out one's self.  However, most schools, particularly primary schools, have robust Internet policies and block access to YouTube to prevent children from seeing unsuitable material.  Has YouTube ever considered, with the Department of Education and Skills, a separate platform for YouTube's education videos?  It could be rolled out across the European Union.</p><p>  In my constituency a fortnight ago, the principal of a post-primary school took a robust and concerted approach to dealing with an issue on a different social media platform which has since become a high-profile incident covered in national media outlets.  When YouTube receives a complaint from a person about a video uploaded on its platform, how long does it take to remove it?  The last thing anyone wants is for people to have to go to the courts to have a clip taken down.  Usually, the person's identity becomes known through court proceedings and more people will look at the upload.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  Let us consider the scale of the content.  There are approximately 72 hours worth posted every minute.  The committee can imagine the difficulty that poses in terms of having someone examining the content going up given that every minute there are 72 hours going up.</p><p>  What YouTube is, why it works, why it is so successful and why people go back to it is because it allows them to take a video and upload and share it instantly.  That is an integral and central part of the platform.  That is why people love it and why we had 1 trillion views in 2011.  It is important to maintain the integrity of the platform for the vast majority of users who use it for good.</p><p>  It is not a question of either pre-screening the content or doing nothing.  I have already referred today to several systems we have in place to ensure that when content is uploaded and if it breaks the rules, then it is flagged and we get to that content quickly.  If it breaks the rules we take it down very quickly.  We are constantly improving those systems and examining them to see where we can make improvements.  For example, recently we introduced the deputise programme where we have trusted flaggers in organisations.  These are people that we know who have a history of flagging content that was abusive and that broke the rules.  Such people have logged complaints with us and it turns out that they were legitimate complaints.  Now, we look at the flags these people log quickly because we know that they are a reliable source.  Other organisations have done likewise.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to apps for education.  We have a Google apps for education programme.  I do not know much about it to be honest but I know it does something similar to what the Deputy suggested, namely, it is a bespoke system with content only for educational purposes and which is suitable for students.  Similarly, there is a safety mode on YouTube.  This means a parent can set YouTube to safety mode and this means mature content that does not break the rules but which is not necessarily appropriate for a child will be hidden.  This tool is available to parents and I would be happy to send on some more information especially on the apps for education and what is involved in that suite of products.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the deputise project.  We specifically partner organisations which have history in certain subjects.  In Germany, we partner with an organisation which strongly fights against racism and Nazi content.  It is very knowledgeable about this area and it is a great partner for us to work on, specifically flagging such content.  These are the types of partners we are looking for and we would be happy to engage with more local partners.  If the committee could point us to any well-known NGOs here it would be of great help for us as well.</p><p>  Senator Brennan commented on where bullying starts and what we can do about it.  I fully agree that bullying is an online phenomenon as well as an offline one.  In most cases it actually starts offline.  We know from statistics that in most online cases which we know of, the origin is from an offline encounter.  Many of these children know each other from schools and it simply extends to the online world.  We need to fight the idea of not being trustworthy and respectful to others.  I cannot really judge whether the information should go across school systems.  That is more a decision the committee and others must make.  However, it is important for schools to work precisely with students on reputational issues.  Perhaps the Chairman will allow me to give another example.  We have developed a campaign called 361 Degree Tolerance.  It is a YouTube channel we have created with several partners in Germany.  We asked students and schools to give us video material and to set out how they define reputation and how to fight anti-respectful behaviour.  This is the third time we have done the exercise and on the first two occasions we received 700 videos from youngsters between 13 and 25 years.  This is a great way for them to engage and show us how they see respectful behaviour.  We know that if people take action they are more likely to flag content if they see someone being bullied online.  This is where we must get to.  People must take action not only if they or their families are attacked but if they see people being attacked in the offline and online worlds.  This is where we want to help.</p></speech>

J. McIntyre and Mr. Fergal Crehan from Digital Rights Ireland.

Digital Rights Ireland was set up in 2005.  We had a concern that while traditional civil liberties were well represented offline by the likes of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, new issues were arising online that needed an additional input that perhaps did not come from more traditional groups.  We have since joined similar groups across Europe in the European digital rights initiative and instituted a constitutional challenge against a European law that we believe violates privacy.  This challenge will shortly be given a hearing before the European Court of Justice.  We have also engaged with people, including a number of those present, on issues such as online privacy, Internet filtering and blocking.</p><p>  I am associate dean at the school of law in UCD, where I specialise in information technology law issues.  I am also a practising solicitor, working both for social media websites and users who believe their rights have been violated.  My colleague, Mr. Fergal Crehan, is a practising barrister.  He has advised Digital Rights Ireland from the outset, including in our constitutional challenge which is before the European Court of Justice.  He is also a specialist in this area.</p><p>  As committee members are aware, abuse of the online medium is very far from being a new phenomenon.  On the slide before us we have the first report I was able to find of a criminal conviction for this type of behaviour.  It dates back to 1999, when a man was jailed under the old criminal libel legislation for spreading false allegations of sexual abuse against a teacher.  That example illustrates that this is very far from being a new issue and that it is one very much regulated by existing laws.  Going back to 1999, we see that where the will and the resources are available to allow enforcement, we can achieve results using existing laws.</p><p>  I have listed on the slide I am displaying a number of the laws that can be used.  I had to hold myself back so as to cram them into one slide as I could have filled two or three listing relevant legislation, but I did not want to bore members.  I would like to make some particular points about certain aspects of the legislation, some of which have been mentioned in previous hearings.  Deputy Dessie Ellis mentioned earlier the phenomenon in his constituency of threats being made via YouTube.  It is not always realised that there is an existing offence which applies.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act provides in section 5 for a distinct offence of making threats to kill or cause serious harm.  Therefore, this constitutes a crime which can be prosecuted under existing laws.</p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington asked earlier about the rights of the subjects of YouTube videos.  Again, these rights are already amply protected by Irish data protection law.  There are general rights in section 2 of the Data Protection Acts to ensure one's information is fairly obtained and processed.  There is also a specific right in section 6A of the Data Protection Acts which provides people with the ability to object to the processing of his or her personal data that will cause him or her distress.  Perhaps there is not adequate awareness of these rights and we need more education of users about their rights and more resources to enforce these rights.</p><p>  That leads us to the point made by Deputy Ann Phelan who mentioned the jurisdictional issue and the possibility of cross-border enforcement.  One of the benefits of data protection law is that it is largely harmonised across Europe.  Therefore, we already have instances to which we can refer if material is hosted in the United Kingdom, Germany or France, etc.</p></speech>

In 2005, the Irish music industry brought an action against people it accused of uploading music.  It obtained the IP addresses of those individuals.  It then had to link those IP addresses to particular names and addresses.  It decided to get a Norwich Pharmacal order, which is named after an English case from the 1970s.  It went to the High Court and got an order from Mr. Justice Peter Kelly requiring the ISP - Eircom, in this case - to disclose the identities of the individuals in question.  This approach has been used quite commonly since then.  I recently counted the number of applications for Norwich Pharmacal orders that have been made in Ireland in recent years.  We know of six or seven such applications that have been made in the last three years.  The number is probably much greater because not all of them necessarily appear in the media.  The jurisdiction of such orders is well established.</p></speech>

One of the problems with Irish law is that we have an access to justice issue that is not unique to this area.  A billionaire will find it much easier to assert his rights than an average citizen.  Unfortunately, we are not an outlier in this regard.  As a lawyer, I do not want to stand here and say lawyers are too expensive, but perhaps that can be said of the courts system generally.  Collectively, those of us who offer the technical expertise needed to enforce one's rights are too expensive.</p><p>  I am concerned that if we make changes to existing laws, we might undermine some of the rights that currently exist.  An example of this relates to anonymity.  It has been suggested at this committee that a greater degree of identification can be provided for by requiring real-name registration of users, etc.  I am sure the members of the committee will be familiar with two great Irish writers who chose to write anonymously for various reasons: Jonathan Swift and Myles na gCopaleen, aka Flann O'Brien, aka Brian O'Nolan and many other names.  Just as people find it important to protect their identities online, Brian O'Nolan wrote anonymously because of his position as a civil servant.  Some media columns are written anonymously by politicians so that they have the freedom to speak with a certain candour they might not otherwise be able to show.  I am thinking particularly of the Drapier column in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p><p>  Similarly, Barnardos recommends that children should be able to speak freely about issues such as parental break-up via chat lines, forums or blogs.  It strongly recommends that children who use the Internet to talk through their issues and engage with others about the challenges they face should never use their real names or reveal their identities online in case this might be used to persecute them in future.  There has to be a concern that if we begin to restrict privacy online, it may have unintended consequences for vulnerable groups such as victims of domestic abuse.  The Women's Aid website talks about the risks to women whose abusers discover what they do online.  Such abusers often use their online identities to track women, or use the fact that women might be seeking help online to prevent them from leaving abusive relationships.  Privacy is important for such women.</p><p>  This issue also arises in a slightly more unexpected context.  In 2006, Ryanair brought an action against the Ryanair European Pilots' Association website to seek to identify particular pilots who were posting anonymously to complain about their working conditions, terms of employment, etc.  Ryanair essentially claimed to be protecting the safety of its workplace, but the High Court rejected its application.  Mr. Justice T. C. Smyth took the view that, rather than engaging in a bona fide application, Ryanair had engaged in a &quot;feigned exercise&quot; designed to divide the loyalty of members of the IALPA union.  He said it formed part of a &quot;war of attrition&quot; on Ryanair captains, aimed at dissuading them from exercising their rights through legal battle.  There is a concern that if the captains in that case had been identified, they would have been unable to gather together collectively to exercise their right to form a union, engage in union activity and possibly take industrial action.</p><p>  The final example I would like to give relates to whistleblowers.  The committee will be familiar with the case of Mr. Noel Wardick, a senior member of staff at the Irish Red Cross who expressed concerns about the governance of that organisation in an anonymous blog.  He was eventually identified after an application was made seeking his identity from Blogger, which is a blogging platform operated by Google.  He identified himself and, as a result, was dismissed from his position at the Irish Red Cross.  I understand he testified before the Oireachtas on a number of occasions to elaborate on his governance concerns.  We are concerned that restrictions which make it easier to identify people will tend to deter potential whistleblowers from coming forward.</p><p>  A related point arises when we think about how existing telecommunications law might be applied to the Internet.  It has been mentioned at previous hearings that the sending of abusive messages is an offence under section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951.  If we expand that offence further, there is a real risk that it might have unintended effects on what can be said online.  With the permission of the Chair, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Crehan, to address that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Crehan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032000011#L00600"><p>Section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 does not date back to 1951.  It is a much more recent creation.  The original Act was most recently amended in 2007.  Section 13, as most recently amended, deals with messages sent by telephone, including text messages, that are &quot;grossly offensive ... indecent, obscene or menacing&quot;.  It also deals with messages persistently sent &quot;for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, or needless anxiety to another person&quot;.  This applies to persistent nuisance telephone calls.  It also applies to messages &quot;that the sender knows to be false&quot; and to prank calls.  If one examines the Oireachtas record from the time this most recent amendment was made, one will find that the purpose of this section is to deal with telephone messages which are person-to-person communications.  Any harassment that happens via person-to-person communication is by its nature far more intimate than something one might stumble across on the Internet following a Google search.  There was a very good reason Internet communications were not included in that section.</p><p>  It has been suggested that the section is ripe to be expanded away from person-to-person telecommunications and into Internet communications in general.  We have concerns about that.  Our first concern is that the concept of intimacy of harassment would be lost.  We would be dealing with something that is spoken to the world at large but to nobody in particular.  Deputy O'Donovan made a telling point last week when he said it would be a case of moving the focus from talking to a person to talking about a person.  Harassment can take place when a person is spoken to aggressively.  Freedom of expression issues come into play, however, when it comes to talking about a person.  One of the problems we see with expanding this offence is that it would potentially criminalise every web page, every online newspaper story and every RTE broadcast placed on <i>rte.ie</i> that is intended to cause annoyance.  It is in the nature of certain kinds of political art or political speech-making that annoyance or provocation is intended.  That would be criminalised immediately.  Such a measure would create a very subjective crime.  We would have to decide what is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing.  If one examines a forum such as <i>politics.ie</i>, in which partisan politics are involved, one finds that tempers frequently run high, especially coming up to elections.  One man's vigorous debate is another man's offensive, grossly offensive or indecent message.</p></speech>

Their presentation was excellent and has certainly gone into many of the issues we have been exploring and that we have put to the various service providers over the past couple of weeks.  With regard to the point about comments made on Hill 16 or terraces during a football match, when it is said, it is finished.  However, when it goes up on the Internet, it stays there.  That is where some of the issues arise.</p><p>  The witnesses quoted some of the judgments going back to 2005 where it was possible to trace IP addresses.  The technology exists for false or malicious information to be put up on the Internet.  It has been available for ten or 15 years and is not a new phenomenon, and while some have claimed it is not possible to get that far in investigations, that is fictitious, for want of a better word.</p><p>  With regard to the cases, including legal cases, the witnesses have put before us, there is very little knowledge out there among those who are using the Internet.  In the past couple of weeks, we have tried to explore this and address the legislative gap with every group that comes before us.  There seems to be a whole raft of legislation governing this area.  As a committee, we want to highlight this and make people aware of the evidence of today's witnesses, given the detail they have put before us.  It is fantastic to see all of the judgments and the quotations they have provided.  We need to highlight this in any way, shape or form we can.  Again, it was an excellent presentation.</p><p>  The witnesses spoke about perhaps changing the legislation in an already overburdened system.  If there were one or two issues on which they were handed a blank page and asked to highlight issues with regard to ensuring those who use the Internet are protected fully, what would they be?</p></speech>

He asked what would be one or two points where we could foresee change.  First, the problem is largely not one of existing laws but one of access to those laws and access to justice.  It is important that people have mechanisms available to them which do not require them to spend several thousand euro on a trip to the High Court for, for example, a Norwich Pharmacal order.  One of the best ways in which people can exercise their right is through the Data Protection Commissioner's office which, as we have seen, is rather underfunded.</p><p>  Second, with regard to the Garda computer crime investigation unit, investigations in this area are necessarily very often cross-border and necessarily very often technically intensive.  For example, they can require looking at the contents of laptops and technical evidence.  A problem in this regard is that, in many cases, these are not very complex matters that should be handled out of Harcourt Street and, for the most part, should be handled at the local Garda station level.  However, it is the need for specialist expertise that imposes a bottleneck.  If we were to see greater funding for the computer crime investigation unit, we would help to address that particular bottleneck.</p></speech>

What blockages exist in terms of them seeking redress?</p></speech>

If something amounts to a criminal offence, it is already the case that the computer crime investigation unit could make use of that process to get information from, for example, Google in Mountain View, California.  The mechanisms are already in place.</p><p>  One problem is that Ireland has yet to ratify the convention on cybercrime.  We entered into this convention and agreed to it in 2001.  We intended to implement it and ratify it by 2003 and we are still waiting.</p> <p>One of the advantages of doing that is that it would help provide for dedicated points of contact between national police forces.  </p></speech>

I agree with everything it said about access to the courts.  I said here last week that it is the preserve of the rich - end of story.  I know people will say that legal fees have come down but in the real world with which most of us deal, for civil matters, the courts system is the preserve of the rich.  If one has to ask the price, one cannot afford to go up to the four goldmines.  Anybody who thinks they can go up there about any matter we discussed in the past fortnight would need a serious amount of cash.  For the ordinary punter on the receiving end of some of the stuff we are discussing, access to the courts system to vindicate one's name and have it restored is simply not available.</p><p>  I agree with the delegation in respect of the protection of identity.  I note the examples it gave in respect of Drapier and Jonathan Swift.  If Drapier said something defamatory about a Member of the Oireachtas, one could take a case against <i>The Irish Times</i> or whichever newspaper published it.  The issue is where freedom of speech ends and defamation begins and how one sets margins.  In one very high-profile case, an anonymous tweet, in some people's minds, changed the outcome of an election.  I am firmly of the opinion, although I know some people would not agree with me, that this tweet did change the outcome of a very significant election.  Where does anonymity fit in there?  If Mary from Dunloe sends a politically motivated text or tweet to a programme and does untold damage as a result of a baseless allegation being read out on a national or local broadcaster, how does one marry freedom of speech with the untold damage it does to someone's reputation because somebody then says &quot;ah sure, there is no smoke without fire&quot;?</p><p>  I was interested in what the delegation said about the convention on cybercrime.  What are the reasons for the delay in ratifying it given that it has been knocking around since 2003?  Let us take the example of the owner of a national newspaper which publishes a story given to it by Mary, Jack, Billy, Tom and Joe on which background checks have not been done and to which everybody has added their 10% VAT so that by the time the story comes to the newspaper, it is totally different.  The newspaper goes to court and a judgement is handed down.  Based on the delegation's experiences, have any social media outlets or discussion forums been challenged in the courts recently regarding what they permit to be hosted?  A newspaper or news outlet that knowingly publishes or allows a newscaster to announce something without checking it to see if there is any element of truth in it has a vicarious liability straightaway and will take a hit on it and end up paying the piper.  Have any of these so-called forums been subjected to the same treatment?</p></speech>

Not only is that the case, they are constantly under threat of and very often subjected to legal action.  The moderators of<i> boards.ie </i>recently posted a picture of a whiteboard on which they had written &quot;It is now five hours since we have received a threat of High Court action.&quot;  It is the experience of forums such as<i> boards.ie</i>, <i>politics.ie</i> and others that threats are made on a regular basis.  One can see from High Court records that cases are filed against Irish social networking sites on a regular basis.</p></speech>

The number of cases that have gone to judgment is very limited.  The one Irish written judgment on the point is a case called Mulvany <i>v.</i> Betfair which involved allegations against Betfair regarding comments a user made in their chat forum.  The Betfair case illustrates the answer to Deputy O'Donovan's second question which concerned the liability in these situations.  The liability in these situations is governed by the e-commerce directive which provides for so-called hosting liability.  If a social networking site hosts comments a user makes, it is not liable for the comments until it has been notified of them and given an opportunity to take them down.  If a network is notified that these comments are defamatory, in breach of the criminal law or in contempt of court and fails to take them down at that point, it faces liability.  That aims to strike a balance between avoiding the need to, for example, pre-moderate the many hours of content uploaded to YouTube every second and allowing an individual whose rights have been infringed to seek redress.</p></speech>

One enjoys a presumptive right to anonymity.  It is a right that can be taken away from one by the High Court in a civil action if a good case is shown against one - not just an allegation but a reasonably substantive case.  It is a right that can be lost in the context of criminal proceedings where the garda&iacute; have reasonable suspicion to investigate a possible crime.</p></speech>

I know it says that traditional rights must be protected online as well offline.  Are there any laws that are missing with regard to this?

If someone is using a computer of smartphone, are there any powers to seize those devices if they are identified?

Does the delegation believe this is acceptable?  Does it think people should be able to monitor phone calls in a similar way?  I was going to talk about Twitter because some stations have a slight delay so they can monitor messages before they broadcast them.  Is that the normal process?  Does the delegation have an opinion as to whether they should appear straightaway without being interfered with?  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner seems to be underfunded.  We need more monitoring.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of legislation in place, but enforcement seems to be lacking.  The volume of traffic on these social networks is so huge that the mind boggles in terms of how one might even begin to trawl through all of the relevant material.  It is always possible to deal with serious crime because the relevant laws are in place and the Garda will become involved because of the nature of such crimes.  The most difficult crime to deal with is low-level, nuisance-type crime which is not serious enough to pursue, but it causes people the greatest level of discomfort.  If a serious crime is committed, the perpetrator will more than likely end up in prison.  There is a great deal of low-level, nuisance-type activity on social networks which no one is really too bothered about pursuing because doing so would take up too much time, funding, etc.  In addition, no one wants to clog up the courts with cases relating to the matters to which I refer.  However, the type of activity to which I refer is very abusive in nature and involves bullying.  In order to plug the gap between serious and nuisance-type crimes, would our guests be of the view that it might be useful to establish a body similar to the Press Council which could deal with social media?  People could bring their cases before such a body in order to have them examined without being obliged to initiate defamation proceedings, etc., in the courts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-20a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032000014#O00300"><p>The first matter on which we should focus is that one of the reasons these hearings are taking place is to deal with cyber bullying and the dangerous effects of online abuse or bullying on those who are most vulnerable.  The first presentation we received was from the Minister who mentioned that there might be a gap in the legislation in this regard.  In that context, Mr. Crehan referred to the relevant section of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1953.  In view of everything we have heard since these hearings began, I have come to the view that there is not a significant gap in the legislation.  Almost everyone who made a presentation indicated that what was illegal offline was similarly illegal online.  The difficulty lies in getting to a position where one can deal with this.  Each of the platforms and companies which made presentations has different ways of operating and reporting.  Some allow users to remain anonymous, while others such as Facebook demand that they identify themselves before being able to use their sites.</p><p>  There has been a great deal of discussion about defamation and illegal use online.  Quite often, those who are the subject of online abuse are well able to defend themselves.  I refer to politicians, business people, journalists and others who are in the public eye and would often be online.  These individuals are well educated, have access to the courts and know how to proceed in matters of this nature.  The difficulty which arises concerns those who suffer abuse and do not have the resources to go to the High Court.  In many cases, they would not even know how to report online abuse.  Mr. McIntyre has suggested increased funding be provided for the Data Protection Commissioner.  In the light of the fact that Google, Facebook and other companies have their European headquarters in this country, that is an absolute must.  The economic benefits which these companies bring to the country are vastly superior to the costs we might potentially incur in seeking to establish a balance in this area.</p><p>  Would there be any merit in creating some type of platform or method of connection, by means of a group or association, in order to assist teenagers who are vulnerable and might become so distressed by what they read online that they might do something similar to that which others have done?  We are all aware of the recent cases in this regard.  The committee received a presentation from the office for Internet safety, an organisation of which nobody seems to have heard and which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am very disappointed that the office in question has not played a greater role in the area under discussion.  However, I am not sure it is designed to deal with it.  In addition, I do not know of any other body which might be in a position to deal with it.  Would our guests support the establishment of an entity to deal with the low-level problems to which I refer in order that we might protect the most vulnerable?  Having listened to all of the debates in which we have engaged, it is the most vulnerable who will continue to be caught out.</p></speech>

One of the approaches which might be taken as a model is that taken in the United Kingdom in which there is a Safer Internet Centre.  This centre is really just an informational resource, but it provides people with a one-stop-shop where they can indicate they have been abused or bullied online.  It then provides them with guidance on how they can access the remedies that might be available.  It might, for example, show them how to use a blocking function or the reporting function on systems such as Facebook.  If the office for Internet safety is to develop a role, I would like it to move towards emulating that model.</p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington's point overlapped somewhat with that made by Deputy Ann Phelan on this being rather low-level crime.  That is an important point in the sense that we are possibly misleading ourselves by focusing on criminal prosecutions and the role of international borders.  What is often involved is localised bullying and there is not necessarily an international dimension.  In fact, there is not necessarily even a criminal dimension because many of the cases about which we are talking involve children.  It is very unlikely, as a matter of practicality, that juveniles will ever be prosecuted, even for criminal offences they may commit in this context.  Those of us who are parents would not want children to obtain criminal records for ill-judged tweets they might have issued one night.  We might be better served by focusing more on concrete examples of abuse rather than on some of the hypothetical issues which do not necessarily arise.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan also inquired whether there was a case to be made for the establishment of a body similar to the Press Council to monitor social media.  We already have such a thing in the individual complaint resolution systems set up within the likes of Facebook, <i>boards.ie</i>, YouTube and so on.  All of these entities operate their own complaint resolution services.  I can see merit in having a one-stop-shop, but if one were established, it would threaten the diversity that is extremely important.  Ultimately, we are discussing online communities which operate to different standards.  Some of these communities are very family-friendly in nature and enforce certain standards in respect of identity.  I refer, for example, to Facebook.  Others such as Twitter are much more open and freewheeling and allow users to remain anonymous.  There are still others which are much more vitriolic and I daresay <i>politics.ie</i> falls into that category.  We do not want a one-size-fits-all solution which would, in effect, try to impose a single set of standards on all of these disparate organisations.</p></speech>

We need to ask whether some of these problems can be fixed by legislation and whether there is a lack of legislation to deal with bullying.  In a classic case of bullying, a child is beaten up and his lunch money is stolen.  In the adult world we call that a mugging and people are sent to jail for committing this offence.  We have to ask ourselves if that is how we want to deal with bullying.  Are there legal remedies to bullying, or is it something that has to be dealt with on a much lower, more educational level?  I would say that it is.  I agree that laws to deal with bullying exist, but it may not necessarily be a good idea to involve the law.  Some kind of educational programme is necessary.  There are television advertisements about drink awareness, food safety and various other public health issues.  I argue that this is a public health issue in that, when children go to school, they learn to read and write but they also learn how to play with other children, how to get on with people their own age or different ages, and how to respect people who are different from them.  That is what they learn in the playground, outside of the classroom.  Increasingly, children and adults live their lives online.  This may provide education not only from the point of view of general socialising and learning to play with one's peers but also from a civic point of view.  If we are to have some kind of civic education where debate and public debate is polite and reasonable, then this may be something to be considered at an educational level.  </p><p>  Deputies O'Donovan and Ellis asked about tweets and text messages sent to radio programmes.  They referred to the famous occasion of the presidential debate.  In my experience, radio station presenters have a computer in front of them and they read whatever they think is interesting as a contribution to the programme.  The presenter is acting in a journalistic role.  There is no filtering except that the broadcaster chooses what he or she decides is a funny tweet or an interesting text, which is then read out.  In the event that something defamatory is read out, it will be that journalist's and that radio station's necks on the line.  It may not be financially worth their while to go after the person who sent the tweet or the text.  However, they are free to do so and they can join the person as parties to the dispute.  There is no question of filtering.  Broadcasters decide what they want to read out, in the same way as newspapers.  Deputy O'Donovan said that stories often snowball with quotes from various parties.  Everyone has their ten percent added.  The journalist and the editor must decide whether their sources are credible or otherwise.  If a source is only a tweet, then it may not be a good idea to go to print.</p></speech>

To be fair, a journalist will not print in a newspaper, "Anne from Kilkenny says...".  Neither will a journalist identify a source by a nickname.  Not only in the instance of the presidential election but also in other cases, politically motivated texts are sent with the intention of doing damage and are read out.  The press office or the individual concerned who has been defamed or had damage done to him or her rings the radio station but to no avail.  It is almost like emptying a bag of feathers in a field and then trying to collect them.  It is impossible.</p></speech>

A news bulletin or a newspaper article will never quote as a source, "Noel from Beara".  If Noel from Beara is Noel Harrington, that is the way it will be quoted.  It will not be simply Noel from Beara, when there happen to be 40 men called Noel in Beara and it is impossible to identify which one is which.</p></speech>

The media are already subject to obligations, be it to the Press Council in the case of newspapers or to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the case of the broadcast media.  Deputy O'Donovan's example is striking because it illustrates that abuses will occasionally arise even in a heavily regulated environment.  That is not necessarily an argument for extending regulation to a different context, particularly because the editorial involvement and endorsement are very different in each case.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to <i>The Irish Times</i>, a newspaper that stands over what it publishes.  Its brand stands for a certain level of integrity and truthfulness in the content of the articles it prints.  It is not open to <i>The Irish Times</i> to say that it is not willing to stand over what John Waters said today.  It would be very misleading to extend that analogy to the Internet, where we do not expect Twitter or Facebook or YouTube to stand over everything their users say.  The idea that we should take a principle that has developed in the context of media that select whose words they will print, the editorial line they will take and so on, and then apply that to providers that really are just conduits for the opinions of other people-----</p></speech>

My point is that the information is being relayed onwards through another medium, almost always by means of the broadcast medium of television or radio.  I accept that a person may tweet whatever he or she wishes.  However, that information is being relayed through a broadcast medium even though it would never be allowed in the print medium, for the reason that it cannot be substantiated.  No self-respecting journalist in a print outlet will do that.  Why is it acceptable in a broadcast outlet?</p></speech>

More generally, if a broadcaster lends its endorsement and lends its credibility to a particular tweet, that is a much more serious matter.  As an individual I am entitled to discount what I read from some random tweeter, whereas I will give it more credibility if it comes from RTE.  In that case, we have to think about looking more towards RTE than towards Twitter.</p></speech>

There is that remedy.  I refer to the point raised by the Deputy about access to justice and the cost of same.  If a broadcaster reads out a text or a tweet on air, those words are now the broadcaster's own and it will be liable for them.</p></speech>

Therefore, all of its staff are responsible whether that is the man or woman in front of the camera or somebody backstage who decides what appears and what does not appear.

Our report will contain a lot of useful information.  We have heard many viewpoints from interested parties so the report will benefit anybody that uses it.
