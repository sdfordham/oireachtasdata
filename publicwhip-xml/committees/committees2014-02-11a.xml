I welcome from the Society of Irish Foresters, Mr. Pacelli Breathnach, president, and Dr. Gerhardt Gallagher and Mr. Joe O'Carroll, members.  I thank them for coming before the committee to discuss their concerns regarding the Forestry Bill.</p><p>  Some of the witnesses have been before the committee previously but I remind the witnesses regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  I invite Mr. Breathnach to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pacelli Breathnach" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021100003#E00600"><p>The Society of Irish Foresters would like to thank the members for their invitation to make a submission on the Forestry Bill 2013 and for meeting with us today.</p><p>  By way of background, the Society of Irish Foresters was founded in 1942 to advance and spread the knowledge of forestry in all its aspects.  The society represents the interests of more than 700 members, predominantly professional foresters but including, through its associate and student membership, a wide cross-section of people involved in or with an interest in the forest and timber industry.  Members of the society work across all areas of the forest industry &ndash; State sector, semi-State sector, private forestry companies, forestry consultants, forestry contracting, nurseries, the timber processing sector and investment companies.</p><p>  The Society of Irish Foresters places great emphasis on promoting professional standards in forestry among its members and the regulation of the forestry profession.  To this end, members of the Society of Irish Foresters are bound by its code of ethics and professional conduct.  The society also influences forestry education in Ireland with a view to maintaining the highest professional standards.  A system of continuous professional development is maintained for its professional members.</p><p>  The society was very pleased with the response of the committee to its submission on Coillte's harvesting rights.</p><p>  The Forestry Bill should support the implementation of the strategic actions arising from the Irish forest policy review process, which is currently at draft phase for public consultation.  In that context, the Bill may be somewhat premature as it is unknown what changes, if any, will be made to the draft.  Nevertheless, one has to assume that an expansion of the forest resource area will continue.</p><p>  The society notes a number of omissions from the Bill which it believes should be included, the first of which is research.  One should assume that good forestry practice and the protection of the environment is grounded on contemporary research in forestry and related matters.  Furthermore, the industry is facing challenges such as diseases like chalara and phytophthora, impact from climate change, etc.</p> <p>This is a notable omission from section 5 of the Bill.  Our written submission includes wording for sections 5 and 28 and we urge the committee to include our research in the relevant sections.  The society has published a position paper on research, a copy of which we will provide for the committee.</p><p> The Bill does not appear to refer to any power of the Minister to propose or review policies.  This should be included in Part 2, section 5, which sets out the general functions of the Minister.  The Bill should also require the Minister to prepare and publish annual reports on the Department&rsquo;s activities.  Our written submission sets out some of the areas an annual report should cover such as data on afforestation and other schemes, supports to the industry and progress on meeting the strategic objective of reaching a critical mass of sustainable timber supply.</p><p> The 1996 strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector envisioned that 17% of the land area would be afforested by 2030.  However, between 1996 and 2012, only 53% of the planting target had been achieved, with a cumulative shortfall of 143,952 ha.  The draft review states the afforestation target will be 10,000 ha per annum up to 2015 and 15,000 ha per annum thereafter up to 2046 when the level of forest cover would be 18%.  This is 16 years later than planned in 1996.  Given the failure to achieve planting targets up to the present, the society recommends that the Bill state: "The Minister shall set and review annual planting targets until such time as the critical mass of sustainable roundwood timber supply is achieved".  This could be included in section 5.  To achieve the new planting targets, it is essential that barriers to afforestation be removed.  The Bill should be an enabler to achieving the planting targets.  However, it is the view of the society that key elements of it are, in fact, inhibitors to the achievement of the planting targets.  Confidence is a key element in encouraging people to make a long-term investment in planting.</p><p> Full details have been set out in our written submission on the following points which I will summarise.  The proposed powers of the Minister to revoke or amend licences or approvals as proposed under section 7 and to reject, revoke or add conditions to management plans at any time will become a major inhibitor.  Essentially, this hands over decision making on property to the Minister without taking into account the management objectives of the owner.  An investment could be rendered useless or severely restricted without compensation.  The proposal for fees appears to run contrary to the explanatory memorandum's claim that the Bill will not result in significant cost to the Exchequer or business.  Potential forest owners fear that fees will only move in one direction - upwards.</p><p> The society recommends linking management plans with felling licences.  A management plan for a forest is best practice and the society would support the production of such plans.  Given the very low area average in the private sector, a minimum size requirement or a simplified plan should apply.  The key is that forest management plans would be prepared.  The management plans should also be prepared to meet the objectives and principles of sustainable forest management.  The acceptance of a management plan should trigger a felling licence for the duration of the crop up to clear felling.  Notification of the commencement of operations to the Minister should be sufficient to allow him to exercise his regulatory function.  A separate felling licence should be required for clear felling.  This would greatly reduce the administrative burden on the Minister.  The power of the Minister to register a burden of a licence or replanting order on a property&rsquo;s folio and later to remove such a burden when he is satisfied that the conditions of the order or licence have been met is excessive, potentially expensive and unnecessary.  Conveyancing solicitors should pick up on these obligations during their normal work.</p><p> While the society has an open mind on the replanting requirement and would be wary of proposals that would result in deforestation, the power of the Minister to specify in detail the replanting requirements is, in its own right, excessive, as it does not take account of the owners' objectives and will increase the administrative burden.  The Minister may wish to retain an input in some particularly sensitive areas.  If so, this exceptional circumstance should be reflected in the Bill and follow consultation with the forest owner.  </p><p> Several of the timescales set out in the Bill are unrealistic.  For example, it may not be possible to supply the information sought in section 13 within 28 days.  A period of 12 weeks would be more realistic.  In the Bill deadlines apply to industry players only and none applies to the Minister.  Timeframes should also be set for the Minister in the performance of his duties and, in default, compensation or other remedies should be stated because a failure to act promptly may cause a loss to the forest owner.</p><p> Section 32 has the potential to cause further uncertainty.  This relates to the setting aside of the Statute of Limitations and allowing proceedings for recovery to be instituted within 20 years.  Work can be done in good faith; similarly, grant claims, approvals after inspections and payments can made in good faith.  However, up to 20 years later proceedings can be instituted to recoup the money paid because, for example, of some update in technology.  Work completed to the required standard and measurements consistent with the available technology should be signed off on as meeting the standard without a further claw-back in the event that there is technological improvements.</p><p> The Bill gives authorised officers inordinate powers of entry to land and premises, other than a dwelling house.  The approach is what one would expect in a criminal investigation.  The overall approach to penalties is quite draconian, with class A penalties throughout.  </p><p> The society welcomes the appointment of committees.  Members have been pleased to have worked on various committees during the years and given service from a sense of commitment rather than remuneration.  However, the society is dismayed by the tone of section 9 on the prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  </p><p> There are a number of other topics which are outside the scope of the Bill but which are no less important and might be considered in this context.  On land availability and land use policy, numerous constraints are placed on the expansion of the forest estate because of the classification of and competing demands on land against the background of a scarce and finite resource.  Food Harvest 2020 may put further pressure on land that might otherwise be used for forestry, together with alternative schemes such as the REPS.  Income from forestry was previously tax exempt.  However, the change to the tax laws whereby forest income is taxed as income in the year in which it is realised without any reference to the growing period required to produce that income has potential to derail the planting programme.  Confidence in the sector is also impacted on by changes in grant and premium rates.  Given the long-term nature of forestry, confidence in the long-term commitment of funding is equally important.</p></speech>

When I have received all of the submissions, I will examine them and consider amendments they may suggest.  Some of the amendments will be contradictory and I will have to decide which ones are worth pursuing, either to extract information from the Minister or because I believe the Bill should be changed.</p><p>  Mr. Breathnach made a number of interesting suggestions.  In regard to the policy review and annual report, it appears that the Minister does not need further powers to propose or review policies because the core function of a Minister is to set out policies.  We will be told that the suggested amendment is superfluous to the Bill.  Every Department is obliged to prepare annual reports and strategy statements.  Mr. Breathnach's suggestion that they do not provide sufficient detail may be valid.</p><p>  I will have to think long and hard about the proposal on planting targets.  This is legislation, as opposed to a plan.  If legislation is to be tight enough to be enforceable, it could also be so tight that it creates legislative difficulties.</p> <p>My belief is that taking Coillte Teoranta out of new planting in the past ten years was the biggest cause of the reduction in planting.  It had all of the capability to do this job efficiently and effectively.  It had a large forest holding, the know-how and the financial ability to do the job.  It takes a long-term investment.  There has been ideological opposition to the State investing in anything in the past ten or 15 years.  If that had existed in previous generations, many of our very good semi-State companies and State companies would not have existed. </p><p> We all agree about the amendment of the plans.  I will follow up on that point.  The witnesses are correct about fees, which only ever go up.  The other point made is that there is no significant cost to the Exchequer.  One must always watch the small print in respect of Government documentation.  Charging fees to cover the cost means there is an appropriation-in-aid in the Department fund and one does not need to get the money from the Exchequer.  It did not refer to there not being a significant cost but that there was not a significant cost to the Exchequer.  There is a subtle difference between the two.  I expect that is where fees come in.  We will watch this.</p><p> We have gone mad with plans.  Plans are getting more and more detailed.  They are filling up rooms and we are knocking down trees to beat the band to print out all the plans.  I often wonder whether anyone reads plans.  People prepare a plan because the law says there must be a plan.  There must be a pro forma plan and the details and facts but the writer and the person for whom the plan is intended pay no heed to it in the reality of business.  How much money, time and effort has been wasted in this?  I see this in respect of REPS.  Everything has just become paper, paper, paper.</p><p> In the Department, we used to spend hours, days and months on the strategic statement of the Department.  I asked officials in the Department how many kept the strategic statement of the Department on their desks as an everyday tool or used it to answer awkward questions about what the Department does.  Other than that, some 95% of those in the Department never referred to it again.  It was handy for answering questions but they did not use it for day-to-day management.  If we used the time spent writing the document managing the Department in a proactive fashion, perhaps we would have been better off.  I am not against planning but I am against <i>pro forma</i>planning.  Much of it is done to satisfy a legal requirement, not because the planner believed this information was needed for a strategic plan.  Many plans have more detail than commercial planners would include.  I would be interested to hear the view of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, as someone who is involved in a significant commercial operation.</p><p> I agree with the point about the registration of a burden on the folio.  Replanting is a big issue and needs input.</p><p> I like what the witnesses said about timescales.  The public are often tied to timescales.  Appealing a decision of the Department of Social Protection must be done within 28 days and something else takes 14 days.  However, there is no timescale coming back except in planning.  Where there is an eight week limit to provide an answer, it works very well and effectively.  I am not giving hostages to fortune by saying that if there are timeframes in one direction, I will demand they apply in the opposite direction.  Otherwise, there will be no timeframes.</p><p> We have already met the Department in respect of the Statute of Limitations.  This is a valuable point.  I have come across situations where genuine cases have been passed by the Department and eight years later they say that they measured incorrectly and come back looking for the money.  No banks will bank if they think that this could happen.  It is an important point.  Unless there was a purposeful effort to defraud, there should be no retrospective claim.  If the Department passes the application for a grant, it should have checked it.  Maps may be wrong.  Ecological areas can be re-examined in the case of people who acted in good faith and it totally undermines bank confidence in the business.  I note what was said about enforcement.</p><p> Regarding land availability, I had a connection many years ago with the timber industry.  The area I live in is hugely dependent on the timber industry for employment.  However, there is a competing use of land issue and much marginal land is ruled out because it is ecologically important.  We are moving into better and better land, which gives much better yield when planted.  There is competition with agriculture.  I have a huge interest in the timber industry and the timber mill in Corr Na M&oacute;na needs 350,000 tonnes of timber a year.  The big five timber mills have been extraordinarily resilient in bad times.  Having said that, the dilemma is that every hectare in timber is a hectare out of agriculture.  The Chairman has been particularly exercised about the land use issue and he is dead right.  We have a big job to do on land use to decide on the competing interests for Ireland.  They are not making land any more and, over the past month, much of what we had has become aquaculture rather than agriculture territory.  The issue needs the examination proposed by the Chairman.</p><p> The witnesses' theme is valid, namely, that anything that creates uncertainty, such as retrospection in penalties or changes in grants, undermines confidence and we cannot expect people to plan, particularly if they are borrowing money, if there are too many uncertainties or variables in the equation.  People will not be prepared to fund it.  We must examine this point in the context of the wider debate on forestry if not in respect of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021100005#G00200"><p>I thank Mr. Breathnach for his presentation.  We have had a number of presentations about the Bill.  Along with my team, I will study all of them and examine the proposed legislation.  Where we believe we can improve it, we will table amendments.  The witnesses' points are of help in formulating how to address this.  The witnesses suggest providing that the Minister shall set and review annual planting targets until such time as the critical mass of sustainable  roundwood timber supply is achieved.  I fully agree with the point.  We must have targets and they must be in a legislative framework so that people comply with them.  The Minister should review them so that they are met.  The other aspect concerns the management plans for felling licences.  The witnesses make the point that a management plan is best practice and the society supports the production of such plans.  There is merit in what the witnesses say and I look at it positively.</p><p>  The witnesses and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to deadlines of 28 days in a 12 week period.  That should be applicable from the Minister's side as well as from the side of the person involved in forestry.</p> <p>I assume that the changes in the grant and premium payments have been brought to the attention of every Deputy.  It undermines confidence in the sector.  People need certainty, part of which is ensuring an income. </p><p> I concur with the enforcement side of it.  In the past the enforcement was like a criminal investigation, as the witness said.  That is the wrong way to go about it.  Inspections are necessary but they should be done in consultation with the forestry owner.  Being heavy handed sends the wrong message.  I will take all the witnesses&rsquo; suggestions on board, along with other suggestions and ideas put forward in earlier presentations, and bring them to the team that works with me to see what amendments we need to table.  We need to get this right.  I thank the society for its presentation.  We will give it our full attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021100006#H00200"><p>I know very little about this area, apart from the knowledge I have gained through being on this committee for the past couple of years.  It was envisaged that this Bill would make things easier for people who are in, or want to go into, this business.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right to say that I have a business but I fail to see what role legislation plays in telling me that I must have a type of management plan to run my business.  We all know that one either fails to plan or plans to fail.</p><p>  According to the explanatory memorandum the Bill tries to reduce the walls of bureaucracy and red tape so that people can run the business.  What is the witnesses&rsquo; view of that point and where would they like to see it go?</p><p>  What is happening to the climate?  Forestry is a vital piece of the carbon jigsaw and we have not reached our targets.  We were supposed to plant 15,000 trees but have planted only 7,000.  One Deputy mentioned aqua-land as opposed to agri-land.  My father&rsquo;s place, which is on the side of the River Suir, is half forestry, half farm and is spectacularly badly flooded, to the point that one wonders whether the trees will survive but they survive beautifully.  Maybe this could provide an answer for land now affected by flooding for the first time.  This will be part of our business in the future.</p><p>  Are we competitive with Food Harvest 2020?  The forestry sector has its own targets.  Does it make better business sense for a farmer to move into beef and away from forestry?  Is that a quicker buck?  Is the Minister off balance?  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.</p></speech>

What consultation has the Society of Irish Foresters had on the Bill with any of the stakeholders or the Minister?  Are we in Cloud Cuckoo Land when we talk about increasing planting by 18%?  Does that conflict with Food Harvest 2020 under which there are plans to increase milk, beef and tillage production?  How will we be able to increase planting when land availability becomes a problem?  It will become more and more scarce because dairy or tillage will be seen to be more fashionable than forestry.  How can farmers be encouraged to make their land available for forestry as opposed to tillage or other enterprise?</p></speech>

Do they envisage that this will necessitate an additional later Bill or does this Bill go further than initially intended, without going all the way because it cannot do so?  It was intended to streamline the felling and application process and has become more comprehensive.  That is my impression.  When the forestry policy review process is over and policy flows from it, more legislation may be necessary to reflect and implement that.  What is the witnesses&rsquo; opinion?</p></speech>

I am not sure how I and my colleagues will divide up all the questions.</p><p>  I understand that there was consultation on the Bill maybe six or seven years ago.  The society has not been involved since then.  When the Bill was published we wrote to the Minister and we met the Department officials last October or November.  That was the start of our input into it.  Until then we had had no input for six or seven years. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gerhardt Gallagher" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021100006#H00600"><p>Some of the thinking on the Bill goes back to that time.  Much has changed since then.  The Bill is restrictive rather than enabling.  It is full of rules, regulations and strictures whereas the Minister should give a broad enabling brief.  That is why we suggested as part of his policy that he should be able to review and comment on policy.  He will need help to make the policy.  It should be there in the Bill rather than arise out of a strategic study taking place separate from the Bill.  Is the Minister&rsquo;s name on the strategic study?  It seems unclear.</p> <p> With regard to a brief on targets and achieving same, obviously one would not expect figures to be put into the Bill but the Minister should have some input.  We have not had a report that specifically deals with forestry because since the 1990s the issue has been part of the wider departmental report.  Up to the point that Coillte was established the forestry service used to produce a detailed annual report on the forestry situation at the end of each year.  For example, it stated how much was planted, how much was felled and issues like that plus what was happening on the disease front.  Now it seems to be a bit anomalous to depend on organisations such as my society, which reproduces planting figures and so on for its members, the wider public and associations such as Irish Timber Growers Association which reproduces the planting figures in its yearbook yet there is no publication containing the figures collated by the forest service.  </p><p> I shall make a point about land use because it is crucial to the legislation.  Land use has not been mentioned in the legislation but the Minister did state something about land targets.  Again, we see some of that coming out of the strategic review and it has presented figures that look very difficult to achieve under present circumstances.  If there is a doubt about the annual planting figures proposed in the review then there is a doubt about the continuing production of forests.  Studies have been conducted which show that the availability of timber depends on it being produced in a forest.  Of course there is a delay factor of between 20 to 40 years.  Therefore, the increased planting that took place in the 1990s will produce volumes of timber.  However, there is a danger posed by the collapse in the forests and thereafter so suddenly one is left with a big collapse in the supply of timber which will have an effect further down the industry chain. </p><p> Recently I was involved in the preparation of a report on the availability of land and how real is the pool of land available for forestry.  It is much more restrictive than had been thought previously for two reasons.  There is a huge amount of competing interests for land.  Of course there will be competing interests for the better land.  Certain assumptions had been made on the availability, for example, of wet grasslands.  It was assumed that a very significant supply of wet grasslands would remain.  On examination of the figures one discovered that there are severe restrictions on such lands in terms of what is happening in agriculture at present.  For much of the land that we speculated would come into production there will be severe agricultural competition for same.  Plus there are restrictions on the marginal land that can support forestry.  However, there is a very slow process of approval for farmers to plant marginal land which often brings in an element of better land.  That is another threat to the land supply and ultimately the timber supply.  There has been no reference to the Minister having targets or reviewing targets in the Bill and to me that seems to be quite an omission.  </p><p> I wish to make another point regarding my past career and the research issues.  I happened to be driving along one day when I heard that quangos were going out of fashion.  The first quango to be eliminated was COFORD which I think was the first quango.  It struck me as being the one quango that was doing something for the country yet it was the first one to go.  COFORD still exists as a subsection of the Department but its independence for instigating, funding and supervising research is gone.  I believe that we need research more than ever.  Two diseases, chalara and phytophthora, pose a great threat and could seriously damage standing forests.  International trade takes place so we do not know what else will happen.  Therefore, the first part of the Bill needs a specific reference that the Minister can undertake, or authorise to be undertaken, research into forests and forest products.  Years ago what was known as the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards undertook forest products research which made a very valuable contribution but that research has disappeared over the years.  Research has been mentioned once under the part devoted to the statutory instruments.  However, it is not mentioned in the primary or first parts of the Bill but that is where it should be mentioned.  If it were then it would allow the Minister to set up something in his own right.  Teagasc exists for the agricultural sector and has a great deal of freedom to undertake and supervise research.  My society feels that forestry research should be granted the same importance as Teagasc as it is a very large sector of the industry.  I could go on about the matter.</p><p> Climate is part of the land supply business because the more land one devotes to forestry the more carbon can be sequestered.  Grass calculations reflect carbon emissions and have an inverse effect because the more clear felling and less planting takes place the more carbon emissions will increase.  I shall leave my comments at that and thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is impossible to answer his question until we see what comes out of the strategic review.  However, I shall make a broad statement.  It has been some time since we had a Forestry Bill. The legislation has been eight years in the making and it is six years since consultation.  Therefore, my personal view is that there is no massive urgency on pushing the Bill through until we have seen the strategic review which is more imminent.  Once we see it, and gain a better understanding of the vision for the industry going forward, we can then work on a Bill that will give enabling powers to the Minister to exercise and achieve that vision.</p><p>  The single biggest issue and challenge facing the forestry industry at present is mobilising the private forest industry.  The State and private growers have invested billions of euro into creating a forest resource.  A lot of it is now mature but it is very slow to reach market.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned ECC in Corr na M&oacute;na and the other sawmills that are always crying out for additional volume.  My own business, Imperative Energy, develops bioenergy facilities around the country and constantly faces difficulties in getting sufficient volume to support its development needs.  </p><p>  The potential for job creation and creating economic activity in the private forest industry must be built on to the mobilisation of the private forestry asset.  That is why we need a strategic vision for the industry and a supportive Bill that will help grease the tracks to get that material to market and then economic and social benefits can flow from such an initiative.  The Bill contains very little to grease the tracks and is more about imposing barriers and constraints on the industry.  </p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the management plan.  Again, the wording of the Bill very much suggests that everything will be written, that the Minister will write seeking a management plan and the forest owners will be obliged to submit a management plan.</p> <p>We are in the digital age and have a very modern forest industry.  It is nonsense in this day and age for anybody to put pen to paper, as Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  What we need is access to inventory information.  Timber is not like an annual crop and we need to know what is growing.  Most people who grow wheat do not really know what is there until it is harvested.  The position in the case of forestry is slightly different in that we always need to know what is growing.  All forest owners need to capture this data and they should be made available centrally to enable us to look at the sustainable harvest across the industry.  We have no problem with information being made available, but it should all be in a digital format and inventory data.  There is no need for verbiage.  We have a number of small Irish companies, Tree Metrics being one, a former winner of an innovation award from the Society of Irish Foresters.  They are shaking up the global forest industry in terms of forest measurement, stand optimisation and resource management.  It is that type of technology we should be using in the forestry industry, but none of that modernisation is envisaged in the Bill, as drafted.</p><p> The other development in the forest industry not envisaged or facilitated in the Bill concerns the diverse ownership structure.  There is a separation of ownership of land from ownership of the growing stock.  The chances are that the growing stock will be owned by funds, or it could even be managed by Coillte or other entities, separate from the person who owns the land and the folio.  None of these developments is envisaged in the Bill and they need to be taken into consideration.  In summary, we are putting the cart before the horse.  We need to know what the vision is and need a Bill that will enable us to achieve that vision.</p></speech>

The issues raised by all of the delegates have a common thread running through them, with slightly different perspectives, particularly on the management plan which should include the felling licence.  Others have stated there should also be an indication of replanting intentions before the clear felling licence is granted.  From the point of view of efficiencies within the process, apart from the timelines involved, if the objectives are achieved, whereby there are extra forest plantations, the current administrative structure is already under pressure.  On limiting it to five year licences and making all of the other demands on the system, the only aspect in respect of which there is a deadline concerns the supply of information within 28 days.  Some of us met the officials and suggested a period of 90 days; the delegates have suggested 12 weeks, which is more or less the same.  There are many common threads running through the submissions of the various interest groups in the sector which I hope have been fed to the departmental officials and the Minister.  We have found the officials receptive to the submissions made so far.  The Minister is due to appear before the committee on 25 February to take Committee Stage and the points made have been well noted.  One of the fundamental issues in the forest industry is that one cannot grow trees without foresters.  For that reason, we were keen to have the Society of Irish Foresters which represents qualified foresters to appear before the committee to get its perspective on the issues involved.  </p><p>  This has been a useful meeting.  As this is a public meeting the issues discussed will feed into the debate.  As this is the last submission to be made at this stage, we will ask the departmental officials to read the transcripts of all the submissions and presentations made to the committee and take on board the concerns expressed.  They centre on the issues of replanting and management plans and are not at odds.  Only rarely have the submissions made been at great odds with each other.  Much commonsense has been demonstrated by many delegates and I expect much of what has been said to be taken on board.  That is my request to the officials.</p><p>  I thank the delegates for their attendance and making their presentation to the committee.  This marks the conclusion of our hearings on the Forestry Bill 2013.  We will probably discuss our own position in advance of Committee Stage on 25 February.</p></speech>

I propose to deal with Schedule B items first.  The proposals listed under Schedule B are as follows: COM (2013) 688, COM (2013) 689, COM (2013) 718, COM (2013) 746, COM (2013) 802, COM (2013) 835, COM (2013) 926 and COM (2014) 3.  We also have three early warning notices, as follows: EWN (2013) L 316-8; EWN (2013) C 371-19; and EWN (2013) C372-21.  It is proposed that the proposals and notices listed in Schedule B do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Under Schedule A we have one proposal, COM (2013) 813 (final), a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information - trade secrets - against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure.  This proposal seeks to protect business know-how and commercially sensitive and valuable information or trade secrets against theft, misuse or disclosure.  It will introduce consistent rules across the Internal Market.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation welcomes it and negotiations on the specific provisions of legislation will be informed by a public consultation by the Department, currently under way.  We will be able to raise this with the Minister at the next meeting before the meeting of the EU Council of Ministers.</p></speech>

If it means at some point transposing a directive we should be as well informed as possible.  If the Minister is to come before a Council meeting it provides us with an opportunity to put questions that those sectors will put to us.  It would be useful for us to do that.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. O'Mahony and Mr. Marc Rafferty of LinkedFinance to discuss crowdfunding.  I also welcome three business borrowers who have used LinkedFinance: Mr. Maurice McMonagle, HSD Healthcare, Dublin; Ms Lisa Redden and Mr. Olivier Vander Elst of Greenaer.  Before we begin the presentations, in accordance with procedure I am required to read out the following note on privilege.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I hope that has not scared Mr. O'Mahony off.  We are delighted to have him in today.  Some of the members have had the chance to meet him over the last couple of months.  This committee decided to spend some time examining access to finance for SMEs and exploring alternative sources.  LinkedFinance is a very good example of an alternative source, as opposed to the mainstream banks.  It is very worthwhile having this conversation and I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  This committee plans to spend the next five or six weeks on this issue and to compile a report for the various Ministers flagging the areas we want changed and where we need to see more resources put in.  Even the Department of Finance is discussing many alternative sources of finance that are needed apart from the main banks.  It is worthwhile having this discussion and hopefully we will be able to link back with the witnesses throughout the report stages if we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Mahony" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100003#C00600"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I will give some background on why and how we established LinkedFinance.  I originally came up with the idea when Martin McAleese ran Your Country, Your Call in 2010.  I could see at the time that small businesses were struggling to access finance.  I had run a printing business in the past and it is notoriously difficult to raise finance to run such businesses.  When I did some research I saw that the SME loan book in Ireland was approximately &euro;46 billion while household deposits were nearly &euro;90 billion, even though the country was having a very hard time.  Therefore household deposits were double the requirement for SME lending.  I thought if one could release some of those funds or make it attractive for members of the public to lend to business it might be a good idea.</p><p>  When I did some research I found that crowdfunding had been invented in Ireland in 1720 by Jonathan Swift.  He had a very simple idea.  He ran the Irish loan fund and put &euro;500 of his own money in.  At the time a peasant farmer could not borrow money in Ireland.  The idea was that he would lend money from this fund to a peasant farmer as long as two of his neighbours were prepared to stand behind him as guarantors on the loan.  The idea was that if the borrower defaulted or ran away to Australia, these two neighbours would step up and take up the loan on behalf of the borrower.  We did a little research and there had been no defaults because the most shameful thing one could do back then was to disgrace oneself and bring one's neighbours in on it.</p><p>  A modern-day equivalent is a company called Zopa.com.  Established in 2005 it has loaned &euro;400 million so far.</p> <p>Zopa stands for &quot;zone of possible agreement&quot;, and is the zone between the rate a saver can get for putting his money on deposit and the rate at which a business can borrow money from the bank. Somewhere in the middle is the zone or the rate at which both parties are prepared to lend and borrow.  At present a saver in Ireland would get a return of 1% interest.  In Ireland the rate of interest on an unsecured business loan could be up to 12%.<br />LinkedFinance.com started in March last and has secured a &euro;1.8 million bid on our market, with which we have lent money to 63 different businesses.  The zone of possible agreement in Ireland is between 8% and 9%.  The rate of interest on our average loan is 8.9%, which is one third cheaper than the bank rate.  The lender is probably receiving eight or nine times the rate of interest that he or she would have earned from holding the money in a deposit account.  We are involved in peer-to-peer lending.<br />The company that started Zopa has lent approximately &euro;400 million.  A company called Lending Club, which is a major player in this market in America, has lent $3.3 billion since 2007 and is currently lending at a rate of $300 million a month.  It is very big business in America.  The equivalent of our company in the United Kingdom is Funding Circle, which has been in operation since 2010 and has lent &pound;200 million.  This time last year the British Government started lending through the Funding Circle platform because Dr. Vince Cable, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, considered it the most efficient and effective way to lend money to small businesses quickly.  The British Government has lent &pound;20 million to date through fundingcircle.com and I understand there are plans to lend more.<br />There are a number of crowdfunding platforms of which people might be aware, which serve different segments of the market.  Zopa and Lending Club provide consumer loans, while Funding Circle and LinkedFinance do business loans.  An American company, Kiva, accepts donations and typically lends money to Third World countries.  Reward crowdfunding is similar to Kickstarter.com in America, which has lent $800 million dollars to starter projects and arts projects.  In Ireland the website <i>fundit.ie</i>does exactly the same.  Equity crowdfunding caters for companies, particularly start-up companies, which sell a small percentage of their businesses to a big group of people.  The major player in the market is the UK company Crowdcube.<br />We at LinkedFinance lend to the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker.  The butcher and baker were very quick to come to the site, and we then looked for a candlestick maker to complete the nursery rhyme.  We lend to a range of companies, including medical device companies and two electric bike companies.  We have been successful in lending to businesses on the high street and to the food and agricultural sector, which is a major player in Ireland.  Recent studies reckon this worldwide business will be worth about $15 billion in 2013.  We believe that crowdfunding, which does not have a home, may present Ireland with a great opportunity to capture 10% to 20% of the expected 45,000 jobs in crowdfunding by 2015.  We have already been approached by some people from the IFSC to see if crowdfunding would be the type of business that could move into the financial services sector.<br />When we surveyed the 63 companies that we have lent to, we found that the companies that received these loans have managed to create more than 180 jobs already and, equally importantly, have sustained about 1,000 jobs.  We hope to grant more than 200 loans in the next 12 months and, based on the figures we have, we expect this to deliver more than 600 jobs in that time.<br />I would be delighted to respond to questions from members.</p></speech>

Although Mr. O'Mahony mentioned start-up businesses, LinkedFinance does not cater for start-up business but for those who have been in business for two years.  Will Mr. O'Mahony comment on that?</p><p>  He also referred to the British system, which seems to be very successful.  Am I correct in stating that Great Britain has a different tax arrangement from Ireland's?  Will he describe the tax changes he would like to see?</p><p>  Ireland has become the hub for a number of different industries, one of which is the aviation industry.  Is there a possibility that Ireland could become the centre for crowdfunding, if not in the world, certainly in Europe?  What would the State have to do to achieve that?</p><p>  Mr. O'Mahony referred to the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker.  If a lender invests in a company, he or she feels a loyalty to the business.  An example I was thinking of is a butcher shop that seeks a loan of &euro;20,000 to install a new cold room and extend its business.  I imagine that everybody who lends the money and gets a return from it feels a loyalty to the butcher.  Has Mr. O'Mahony evidence of that?  The individual does not own the business, but he or she has lent money to it.</p></speech>

Our typical business would be a business that has been trading for at least two years.  The main reason for this strategy is that we have a duty of care to our lenders.  Our lenders are members of the public and we have nearly 5,000 registered lenders.  We carry out the credit and identity checks that one would expect a bank to do on a bank loan, and it is very difficult to do that in a start-up situation.  Our plan for the future is that we would get involved in lending to start-up businesses.  Ideally, it would be on a co-funded basis, such as funding those in receipt of grants under the Leader programme, from Enterprise Ireland or from the local enterprise boards.  We do not have the personnel in place to provide that all-important mentorship for start-up businesses.  It is on our roadmap but, as Senator Quinn said, we do not lend to start-up businesses at present.  We also feel there is quite a lot of money in Ireland for start-up businesses, particularly for technology start ups, with the support of Enterprise Ireland, and even regular businesses receive support from Microfinance Ireland.  Our belief is that businesses that have been in operation for 18 months to three years are only getting started but need extra capital to move to the next level.</p><p>  The British tax system is more flexible with regard to using pension funds or ISAs to invest in crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending.  That does not exist in Ireland.  Se&aacute;n O'Sullivan from "Dragons' Den" suggested as part of the recent report from the Irish Entrepreneurship Forum that the Government should put an initiative in place to support crowdfunding by allowing people to earn up to &euro;10,000 in interest every year without having to pay tax.  That would be a fantastic kick-start for businesses.  Apparently the reaction from Government was positive and this is an idea that might be implemented.  </p><p>  Senator Quinn asked about the possibility of Ireland's becoming a hub for crowdfunding.  As I said, it really does not have a home anywhere.  There are two major companies based in San Francisco.  I have met people from both of them and they are considering coming to Europe.  The remaining companies are scattered over the world.</p> <p>There are two other players in the donation space - Indiegogo and Kickstarter - which are looking at setting up in Europe in the coming months.  There is a great opportunity for the Government to show that it is friendly and receptive to the companies, because Ireland is a perfect place for them.  They are technology companies and can see that our having Google, Twitter and Facebook here makes it a very receptive market.  The Government could stand up and show that it wants to embrace this marketplace.  </p><p> The UK Government is one step ahead of us because it started lending cleverly through the platforms there.  Basically, it took up 20% of any loan that was on the Funding Circle's marketplace.  The UK Government did not want to exert undue influence on the market.  If a loan was &euro;10,000 then Funding Circle would put an &euro;8,000 loan on the market and the policy was to let the market run and let everybody bidding on the market set the price of the loan.  Let us say the interest rate was 8.2%; the UK Government would take the remaining 20%, the last &euro;2,000, at a rate of 8.2%.  Therefore, it got a fair market return on its investment, but &euro;2,000 was not large enough to change or influence the market, which is a good way to operate.  We are networked with all of the platforms around the world and everybody thought the initiative was the most positive way for a government or municipal authority of some sort to get involved.  In addition to the UK Government, there were councils.  For example, Camden Council, Leicestershire County Council and Nottingham City Council have started to participate.  That means that if one sets up a business in Camden, in north London, its council will lend through the platform and give a low-interest loan.</p><p> I shall turn to the final area mentioned by the Senator, which is loyalty.</p></speech>

The reason we called our organisation LinkedFinance was that we wanted the borrower to link with the customers.  Our average borrower at the moment has 186 lenders.  For a &euro;30,000 loan, the average person bids &euro;150 to lend to that business and, on average,  between 180 and 200 people will be involved in each loan.  As the Senator mentioned, it is a great opportunity for people to start being loyal and provide support to a business.  Let us say a loan goes live today; the first repayment will be due in a month's time.  We have lent to a couple of butchers, and one of these, who had a loan that went live last July, very cleverly said "Thank you for supporting me on the loan.  The first repayment will go through tomorrow and, by the way, if you want to pop in to pick up any meat for your barbecue this weekend, there is a 20% discount for every lender who has lent to me."  That butcher had a great take-up on his offer.  Such lending creates a bond.  It is important that the lender likes the borrower, but it is also important that the borrower likes the lender.  Let us say that butcher was going through a tough time and the time for his monthly payment is fast approaching; he will decide not to bounce a cheque because the lenders are also customers, and the last thing that butcher wants is dissatisfied customers.  We feel that the link between the lender and the borrowers is key.</p><p>  With regard to the business going forward, members of the public lend through the platform and by creating a link we feel that we are driving defaults virtually down to zero.  In our industry the number of defaults is typically very low.  For example, Zopa has lent nearly &euro;200 million in the past three years and its default rate is 0.3% on all of the loans.  That is down to the community effect, whereby borrowers suddenly feel very responsible in terms of repaying the money.</p></speech>

It is good because it democratises the ability for people to loan money.  Also, shocking though it is, there are people who are investing in property again in order to provide for their future.  Crowdfunding offers a mechanism for investing in a productive element of the market.</p><p>  I have a few questions.  What is the typical length of loans?  Is there an average duration for a loan, in the witnesses' experience?  With regard to accessibility for SMEs, is the knowledge level on the sector high among SMEs or businesses?  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned a lot of figures.  Does he have comparative figures on the volume of such loans in, for example, the United States?  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned the level of default.  How has the amount of default grown?  Is it a level growth?  Is it a continuous growth?  Have there been peaks over the past number of years?</p><p>  Interest rates provide equilibrium in terms of demand versus supply.  Is there enough supply, in his experience?  What is his view on the regulation of the sector?  What are the barriers to growth, in his experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Mahony" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100005#E00800"><p>The Deputy's first question was on the terms of loans.  All of our loans are three years in duration and are fully amortised, which means 36 equal repayments with every repayment having interest and capital added.  The difference between our loan and that of a bank is that there are absolutely no penalties for early settlement.  Therefore, if a business decides that it does not need a loan any more because there is a cheaper alternative, or for whatever reason, all it must do is pay back the outstanding capital.  There are no penalties for settling early.  That is important in order to give a business a bit of flexibility.</p><p>  The Deputy's second question was whether SMEs know about the service.  When we launched last March, if we were in a room that contained 100 people we would have felt that fewer than ten of those people would have heard of crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending.  The situation is different now.  Last week we made a presentation to the Tralee Chamber of Commerce with 150 people present, and I feel that more than 50% of those present would have heard of crowdfunding, participated in some type of crowdfunding, watched something about it on television or seen it in the press.  Crowdfunding is becoming more known in the sector.  We spend a lot of time trying to inform people and we meet representatives of chambers of commerce, SMEs, ISME, the Small Firms Association and their memberships.  I have planned the business since 2010 and everybody I met on the run-up to its launch said I would find it very hard to get people to lend through the site because nobody trusts the systems any more, but that there would be a very lengthy queue of borrowers down the road vying to borrow.  Sadly, we do not have a huge queue of borrowers, because most SMEs have got used to surviving without capital, which is not a good thing.  Instead, they are using  personal resources such as credit cards, extending their credit terms with suppliers and that type of thing.  That is what is being used for cashflow.  The biggest message that is difficult to get out is that an organisation will not have to wait eight or 11 weeks for a decision; we will make a decision in two or three working days.  That is the biggest barrier we have come across in the marketplace - that businesses have become resigned to the fact that capital is not available.</p><p>  With regard to the volume of loans, when we first started in March we provided one loan every two weeks of about &euro;30,000 or thereabouts.  Last week we did three loans and we hope to do four loans this week, which means we are very close to providing a loan a day.  As a business model, a loan a day can very easily become two or five loans a day.  We are very happy that we are on target for where we wanted to be.</p> <p> On the lenders side, everybody told us it would be difficult to get lenders' money.  Since day one we have had a huge surplus of lenders' funds.  We have no issue with being able to fund businesses.  Today and every day we have hundreds of thousands of euro in excess funds available and ready to lend but we have strict criteria for people to come on the platform.  However, we are not getting enough borrowers through the system at the moment.</p><p> On the demand and supply side, we would have seen this as a business with two sides in that we needed to attract lenders and borrowers.  We had in mind that our marketing budget would be divided down the middle; 50% for each.  We have spent hardly any money on acquiring lenders.  All our efforts and focus has been on the borrower side, which most people would find surprising.</p><p> On the regulation aspect, we have been working with the Peer2Peer Finance Association in the United Kingdom and we were involved in drawing up the White Paper it has in place.  Regulation will come into play from 1 April this year in the United Kingdom in a soft and light way, so to speak, with a view that a year later it will have settled down and all the criteria will be in place.  We believe regulation is a good idea because it would give our lenders and our borrowers a little more comfort but we would be concerned that if the regulation was too tough, it might slow down the progress of businesses such as ours being able to get out to the market and bring many borrowers on board.</p><p>  Regarding our observation in the market, since we have launched everybody, without question, is very positive about this as a business model, how it can work and all the transparency.  Anyone who has ever been on our site can see everything about every bid, every loan, and the interest rates people are getting.  It is important that there is some control in the business.  We would want to make sure that a rogue trader did not come on the market in the future and unsettle it because once that element of trust disappears, it would become a very hard business for everybody.</p><p> Regulation will be important and it is the reason the platforms in the UK have pushed for it.  Somebody described the model that would probably work best as being similar to the airline type model where the sites were bonded, which meant each site had to put &euro;100,000 or &euro;50,000 as a bond to show they were of good character and also to protect lenders on the other side, but that is not what is happening in the UK.  It is that the UK Government will regulate them as if they were payment platforms rather than financial institutions.</p></speech>

What happened with funding, certainly in the UK, was the ideal way for the Government to support the sector.  In terms of what happened, this time last year Funding Circle was lending at a rate of ST&pound;1 million per week. Five weeks after the Government started participating and lending through the site, that had increased to ST&pound;5 million per week; there was a five-fold increase.  It was like getting a stamp of approval from the Government but in the biggest way possible, which was that the Government had sufficient confidence in the system to be lending public money.</p></speech>

Along with many other people I had first heard of LinkedFinance from the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which described a company not too far from Leinster House, and the idea sounded fantastic.  I have met with the witnesses previously and I would be a big supporter of what they are trying to do in Ireland.  There appears to be consensus already in the committee that it is an innovative and positive way to do business.<br />I will make two points.  Obviously, this is part of a bigger roadmap in terms of how this cross-party group can try to direct policy at Government level regarding access to finance.  The United Kingdom Government has taken the step and joined in with Funding Circle.  We are not at that stage.  I will put a question now to which I know the answer but I want it to be on the record to ensure it forms part of a report.  Apart from the regulation side, if the Government were to approve this model, what steps would it need to take to ensure we can be informed on how to recommend this to Government?<br />I am very conscious that there are three business owners here today who have benefited from this.  I would like to hear some of their experiences in that regard.</p></speech>

In terms of what Government could do, we have some great agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia, that could engage more with the sector.  Bord Bia would be a great example because food and food retail businesses would be very popular on our site.  I suppose it is because the 200 lenders, as Senator Quinn said, can get behind those brands and support them.  If someone is looking at Killowen Yogurt, which borrows through our site, they can actually see it on the shelves of Tesco, Marks and Spencer or Superquinn.  They are really buying into the brand.  In my case, I had never tried Killowen Yogurt before it borrowed on the site but it is the only yogurt we have in the house now.  There are many Government agencies we could work with and help some of these companies because lending &euro;100 to a yogurt company makes one an ambassador for life.  My children now know the brands that borrow through LinkedFinance because their products are now in our shopping trolley.  That falls across people who lend on the site but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it is great that we have two companies who borrowed on the site.</p></speech>

Our business is supplying medical technology to veterinary surgeons for equine and small animal use.  We take a great deal of human surgical technology and move it across to the animal side.  It is a type of technical sell.  It is a business to business type operation.</p><p>  I believe we were the third loan with LinkedFinance.  I met Mr. Conor McAleese, who is not with us today, at an enterprise show in the RDS.  As it happened, we had known each other many years previously but we got chatting.  At the time we were in the process of developing our facility in Sandyford and ploughing money back into the business.  In the best traditions of enthusiastic entrepreneurs we had done all the work.  We decided that as we had put all our work and capital into this investment we had better put a few bob back into liquidity.  We borrowed the money.  We had talked to our own bank, which shall remain nameless, about it.  We had a good deal of love-bombing, so to speak, but no results.  We put in an application.  It was sent back to these anonymous underwriters, the people who live in the IFSC who do not have names or faces in the way bank personnel used to have names and faces.  In the meantime, I met Mr. McAleese.  We were vetted as thoroughly as the bank vetted us but it was within a number of days.  The loan went up on the site and within two weeks we had the &euro;18,000 we required at a rate better than the bank would have given us.  I did not have to give my first-born son as security although the way he is behaving at the moment, perhaps I should have.  We got the money within a couple of days.  We continued on with our business.</p><p>  One of the critical aspects, and I come from a corporate background originally so I am used to being the guy who has all the resources around me, of setting up one's own small business is that it makes one realise there is the corporate world and there is a small and medium enterprise, SME, world.  We are an SME dealing with an SME.  One can get the people on the phone when one wants to talk to them.  If one has a problem, they will talk one through it.  It is not a question of going through layers of people who have jobs for the sake of jobs.  They are dealing with people who are as enthusiastic about their business succeeding as one is about one's own business.</p> <p>As it happens, we have just finalised our second loan on the site - I think ours is the second or third business to arrange a second loan - to develop the business.  We could have obtained the money from the banks, but why would we pay the banks interest when we can pay it to our friends and family who loaned to the business and give something back to the community and the people who visit vets and buy my equipment?  Call me a socialist, but this is keeping money in the economy.  SMEs keep and spend their profits in the economy and this is what will drag the economy out of the mess it is in.  As far as I am concerned, all the Googles in the world will not do this, even if saying this is popular or not.  That is our experience.</p></speech>

We had also approached the bank, with which we had a good relationship until then.  The key benefits of using LinkedFinance as opposed to the bank were that we were able to secure a better interest rate than we could have had with the bank.  The platform also gave us the opportunity to expose the business  This was a real benefit and it did it very well.  As the Senator pointed out, the loyalty comes back to the business and many of those who lent to us have become customers of Greenaer which has been positive for us.  The exposure has also led to the creation of two new jobs in the company.  It has been a good experience and is one we would repeat.</p></speech>

We were attracted to LinkedFinance because of its progressive element with which we could identify.  The whole process of going to the bank is not pleasant but in going through LinkedFinance the process moves faster and the bidding is quite exciting.  It suddenly becomes a story to tell, that one managed to get a loan at an interesting rate.  We obtained our loan at a very good rate which much more competitive than the rate on a loan from the bank would have been.  Afterwards, many people came forward to us at trade shows and elsewhere to tell us they were among our lenders.  Automatically, one is bound to give them a discount.  These loans create a bond that one would not have with a bank and we will probably be interested in a second round loan at another stage.</p><p>  The experience has been all positive.  As Mr. McMonagle said, dealing with LinkedFinance is like us talking to a company that understands where we are and which is as excited by its development growth, as we are about ours.  We are bound together on the same journey.  We have been spreading the word and it is quite surprising that it is not used more.  The problem is in finding the right borrowers.  Perhaps the help LinkedFinance needs is in getting the message across, without having to spend significant marketing money on it.  Getting borrowers should be an easy problem to solve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100007#G00900"><p>I welcome Mr. O'Mahony and the group represented today.  This proposal is interesting and innovative.  Mr. McMonagle mentioned that when he was awaiting a response from the banks, he decided to approach LinkedFinance.  Are LinkedFinance customers a mix of those who are frustrated with the banks and people who make a conscious decision to use LinkedFinance?  Are people moving more towards making a conscious decision to go with LinkedFinance rather than the banks?  Is the business developing through word of mouth?</p><p>  Mr. McMonagle spoke about being vetted by the banks and customers of LinkedFinance being vetted just as they would be with the banks.  However, is LinkedFinance lending to people who have been refused loans by the banks?  Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about new start-ups.  Part of the problem about which we hear so often is that new start-ups find it impossible to get finance.  LinkedFinance is not focused on new start-ups, but does it have plans to deal with them in the future?  What type of people are the lenders?  Are they business people or retired?  What is their background?  Are there limits to the overall level of funding or the number of customers being accepted for business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Mahony" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100007#G01000"><p>I think the polite term for the type of people we attract who may have been with the banks is that they are people who have been "disenfranchised" by the banks.  We have a borrower who has a retail outlet on Liffey Street.  He opened in 2010, when the snows came, and for two weeks did not have one customer through the door.  He went to the bank and said he needed to pay wages on a Friday and asked to borrow &euro;1,500 to pay his staff.  Eleven weeks later, he was refused a loan.  He made the decision there and then that he would never use mainstream banking again.  He would save money before buying anything and handed back his credit card machine.  All he uses his bank account for is to pay suppliers who insist on being paid by transfer or cheque.  Before we met this man, he had been saving up &euro;5,000 over six months and then buying a new fridge and then saving for another six months and buying a new counter.  When he met us, that allowed him to borrow &euro;30,000 in one go to open a second retail outlet and employ 11 people.  He did not have to save for six or nine months.  Not everybody is like him, but we have other borrowers who have borrowed &euro;25,000 from us.  They were told by the banks that they would be given &euro;25,000 for their business and that the banks wanted to support them, but they needed to put &euro;25,000 in a deposit account as security against the loan.  Obviously, if the business person had the &euro;25,000 in the first place, he or she would not have needed to borrow.</p><p>  We are not the lender of last resort, nor are we just meeting people who have been turned down.  We are meeting people who want to get things done quickly.  They might have a van that is in trouble and needs to be replaced and they cannot wait eight weeks or survive without making deliveries for that length of time.  They want to move quickly.  It is a kind of social business.  Mr. Vander Elst's and Ms Redden's business is in the green energy area - electric bikes.  The people who lent to them would love that business because it is a socially conscious business that is better for the environment and so on.</p><p>  A question was asked about who was lending or the type of people who were lending.  We have no millionaires.  The average loan bid is &euro;146, a tiny payment.  They are people like the rest of us, ordinary guys on the street.  If we profile the average person lending on the site, it is a man between 40 and 55 years of age.  The average person has deposited just under &euro;2,000 for lending - small money.  Everything we do on the site is about diversifying the risk.  If somebody puts &euro;1,000 on the website, everything on it would tell him to put &euro;50, the minimum bid, into 20 businesses, rather than put &euro;500 into two.  Some of our businesses will fail, without question.  We guarantee that will happen.  What we do not want is for somebody to put half of his or her funds into one business.  Ideally, he should put &euro;50 into 20 businesses and if one of the businesses fails, he or she will still have 19 performing loans.  </p><p>  The profile of the people lending on the site has not changed since day one.  It is a great mix of people, which is what we want.  Therefore, we have a business like Greenaer which deals with what consumers want, with customers who can make offers on its bikes or see a trade exhibition and so on.  Businesses like Mr. McMonagle's are similar.  He is supplying vets up and down the country.  One of his lenders might have a sister or a brother-in-law who is a vet and this might open a door for him.  There are always such opportunities, which is why we called it LinkedFinance to try to link borrowers and lenders.</p><p>  With regard to start-ups, it is not until we become more established that we can deal with them because it is very hard for us to make an informed decision on whether a start-up business will succeed.</p> <p>The only way we will do it in the future, probably, is by matching funding or co-funding with people who can put a bit more time and effort into mentoring or helping the business get started.</p><p> Deputy Kyne's fifth question was on the limits.  There is no limit to how much somebody can lend through the site.  We restrict it so that people can only bid up to a maximum of &euro;2,000 on any project.  That is for two reasons: first, we do not want someone to make a mistake and put their whole fund into one particular loan; and second, we do not want somebody to control a loan.  For example, with Greenaer, the electrical bike company, we would not want a competitor in Cork totally funding the loan and maybe putting a bit of pressure on the owner to buy his bikes, only supply his saddles or whatever.  Therefore, &euro;2,000 is the maximum and, ideally, from the business's point of view, we would like 100 or 200 lenders to participate in each loan.</p></speech>

I assume it is common that they would have a number of loans.  Obviously, they would be vetted and Mr. O'Mahony feels confident about it.</p></speech>

It is important for us to be able to look into their past and see that they have had loans previously.  It is the easiest way for us to see that they have been responsible with finance previously.  That is the most important thing that we are looking for.</p><p>  Virtually every business that we look at had a hiccup between 2008 and 2011, because every business did.  Times were hard and they may have had a bad debt, a customer who disappeared and did not pay them, or something like that.  We are prepared to look at that and understand what that was, and if they recovered from it or got back on track, and now they are pushing forward again, we will lend.  A blot on the copybook or a bad mark in the past does not mean that we cannot lend to a company.  Ideally, we look for people who may have had multiple loans and we can see how well their repayment schedules have worked.  Deputy Kyne asked whether the businesses have existing loans.  We have people who have a bank loan, an overdraft and a lease on a car and we are coming in as another form of finance for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice McMonagle" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100008#H00400"><p>I will address that question as well.  In the early days we made the mistake, or otherwise, of not having an overdraft from our bank.  We operated on a prudent basis and grew the business probably more slowly than we could have if we had had an overdraft.  The irony of it was that when the business started to grow and we needed to get an overdraft, the bank would not give it to us, and there was plenty of cashflow.  All it would say was that it wanted us to take a term loan and turn that into an overdraft.  That did not really suit our business.  It seems the banks have a pot of money to give in overdrafts and, because they do not know how much any of their candidates will draw down at any one time, they are reluctant to earmark money that may or may not be drawn down at any particular time.  They like to have the certainty of a loan.  That did not really suit us in the sense that we did not want to take out a long-term facility.</p><p>  We have an existing loan for a car for a sales representative, which is through Skoda Finance, where we sourced the car, but we had trouble convincing the bank that we were worthy of an overdraft because we had not had one previously.  That, to say the least, was fairly annoying because it is a profitable business and we had been with that bank for ten years.  The bank also has my wife's business, our mortgage and our personal accounts.  They know everything about us, which, in retrospect, is probably not good.  With LinkedFinance, we went, we made the case and the job was done.  I am still waiting to hear from a bank about the loan.  I do not have time for that; business moves too quickly.  One cannot be sitting around waiting for answers.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome those who have received funds who are taking time out from their businesses to be with us today and share their stories.</p><p>  I have a few questions for Mr. O'Mahony.  I met him previously and I am familiar with LinkedFinance.  He stated it is difficult to get people to borrow money.  Is there a particular issue with borrowing as a loan or borrowing as equity?  How does LinkedFinance manage the equity, if it is putting in an equity stake?  How does all of that work?  Is there a considerable amount of administration involved?  How does it operate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Mahony" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100008#H00600"><p>On the reluctance to borrow, Deputy Collins referred to Mr. McMonagle and Mr. Vander Elst taking a couple of hours out of their day.  It is difficult for an entrepreneur to do that.  All business people in Ireland have got used to the fact that if you want to apply for a loan, you have to fill out an eight-page form.  If you are working hard and doing a full 12-hour day, you are coming home in the evening to face this form that is just an unending list of questions for you to fill out.</p><p>  We are different.  The quickest our loan application form has ever been filled out is 37 seconds, and we have a timer on the website.  What we are trying to do there is get rid of all the friction in signing up.  However, it is hard, until we are fully established, for businesses to realise that there will not be an eight-page form to fill out.  A business owner may send the form to the bank, fold his or her arms and think the job is done, but the bank will come back to him or her two weeks later looking for supplementary information, and then it will change the rules on what it was looking for in the first place and how the business owner will guarantee the loan.  We have tried to make the application as simple as possible.  On day one, our application form was four pages long.  We found that 60% to 70% of the applicants were skipping out of the website or leaving our website on page 2.  Therefore, we sat down and had the brainwave of making it a two-page application form.  But then, of course, everyone left on page 1.  What we did thereafter was to have a single-page application form, and one can go through all the fields in less than a minute.  That gets one onto the system and allows one to understand what we will be looking for as supplementary information, and we give the full list.  We never ask for anything in excess of what we have listed as the documents we will require to put the loan together.  It is a learning curve.  For me, as an entrepreneur over the years, filling out those long forms was just an absolute headache.</p><p>  Regardless of crowd-funding, it would be helpful if the pillar banks standardised their forms so that when I apply for a loan, I could fill out one form, photocopy it, drop it in to the four or five different banks and get them competing against each other for my business.  At present, all the formats are different and the information required is in a different layout.  It would be simple to do.  I accept it would be a big printing job, but it would be simple to standardise the application form for a loan.</p></speech>

There is a standardised form.</p><p>  My question was, how does Mr. O'Mahony manage the equity?  If I decide to invest in a company that LinkedFinance has introduced me to and I am an equity holder, is my relationship directly with the company?  Who manages the equity?</p></speech>

We are probably best described as a dating agency.  We are between the lenders and the borrowers.  As a lender, you are lending money.  You are not buying equity in the business.  It is a business loan that you are giving.  Once you decide to lend &euro;100 to Greenaer, the bicycle company, you deposit the money with LinkedFinance, you make your bid, and if it is accepted and Greenaer decides to go ahead, we will transfer your &euro;100 into Mr. Vander Elst's account.  Then Mr. Vander Elst has a commitment to pay you back 36 repayments, including the principal and interest.  That will come back in to LinkedFinance and is credited to your account.  We do all the transactions and all the payments, backwards and forwards.</p></speech>

We would look closely at the last six months' bank statements for activity.  That would show us gearing.  It would show whether they are operating within their means and it would show any payments that are bouncing or coming backwards and forwards.  That is important.  We also look for tax compliance because the last thing we want to do is lend somebody &euro;20,000 just to pay a tax bill.  It will not push the business forward or help it grow.</p><p>  The other matter we look at is the funding that they have had in the past to see have they been responsible.  If, for example, they had a three-year loan, did they make all 36 repayments and were they a good person to lend to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Eoghan Murphy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100008#H01500"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to attend today.  I am not a member of this committee but I wanted to come in because I am familiar with both LinkedFinance and Greenaer.</p> <p>I wish to declare an interest in that I am a lender, or have tried to be a lender, on the site.  I opened an account about eight months ago after one of my meetings with Mr. O'Mahony, to try to see how the website worked.  I put &euro;100 into the account and have tried to lend it on a number of occasions in &euro;50 parcels but no one is taking my money.  I might be looking for too high rate, I am not sure.  It is 50%.  A little bit too greedy perhaps.  It surprised me, however, because Mr. O'Mahony talked earlier about the potential for growth.  He knows how many lenders there are vis-&agrave;-vis borrowers.  As I see it, every loan coming through my account is over-subscribed, which is fascinating.  I would have thought, as Mr. O'Mahony pointed out, that it might be the other way around.</p><p> I want to ask about protection.  If a loan is trading for a week and the average rate is about 8.3%, what stops a couple of people coming in at the last moment offering 7% and thus having the bulk of the money?  Is the &euro;2,000 limit the only thing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Mahony" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021100009#J00200"><p>The &euro;2,000 limit is per bid.  In a lot of cases, as was mentioned earlier, people who are lending are friends and family.  We obviously do not want to place any restriction on that.  I mentioned a butcher earlier to whom we lent.  He did his barbecues during the summer.  He had a fantastic butchery business and his father always wanted to support him in the business but the son was too proud and would not take cash from him.  This was a perfect vehicle for him, so in the last hours of the auction be bid &euro;6,000 in three lots of &euro;2,000 to support his son in the business.  We do not restrict from that point of view because as Deputy Murphy described, he is looking at an auction which is 100% funded.  So if somebody was looking for &euro;20,000 and it is 100% funded, every new bid that comes in the market is going to bump out an expensive interest rate.  The top rate of interest at that time might be 12%.  If one wants to come into the loan now, one must bid at least 11.9% and move that bidder out.  On a &euro;20,000 loan, we find that &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 might be bid in the last hour or half an hour, as people try to become part of it and bump other people in the market out of it.  In the butcher's case, his father was doing that for the last couple of hours of the auction.  He was picking an interest rate and putting &euro;2,000 in.  He wanted to lend &euro;6,000 and only ended up lending &euro;3,500 because he got bumped out just before the thing ended.  We would actively encourage it.  Once a loan is 100%, every new bid will make the loan cheaper, on average, for the borrower.</p></speech>

Nobody controls it.  LinkedFinance does not control it and neither does the borrower.  The lenders coming on the market make their own decision.  The minimum requirement is to bid &euro;50.  Therefore, anybody can bid &euro;50 at any interest rate between 5% and 15% to one decimal point - that is, 9.1% or 10.2%.  That is the important thing about the fairness of the site.  By doing it that way, nobody is unduly influencing the market.</p></speech>

When we raised this in the D&aacute;il before, the line that came back from the Government was that generally speaking it is waiting to see peer to peer financing or crowdfunding being established in other markets before we would do it here.  Is it Mr. O'Mahony's view that it is established now?  He cited figures from the UK along with some of the research points.  If it is established in other jurisdictions and there is a reason to move here, what is the wish list?  Looking at the kind of market this it is trying to fill, is it to move away from bank and big corporate funding while not being wholly dependent on government funding either?</p></speech>

At the moment, if I want to lend &euro;100 through the site, in theory, I will have to have earned &euro;200 from my wage packet.  I pay 50% and that &euro;100 goes into the site.  Then if I get 10% interest, that will be taxed as if it is income again, which is very unfair.  Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Sullivan from "Dragons' Den" proposed the idea that a lender should be able to earn &euro;10,000 in interest per year before paying tax at the marginal rate.  That would be really helpful because it would then be as fair as some of the other things out there for people to put their money into.</p><p>  The other area concerns the Funding Circle in the UK.  From our point of view, and that of everybody connected with the peer to peer and crowdfunding business, that is considered to be the perfect way to lend, namely for a government to give a stamp of approval to the sector but at the same time get a decent and honest return on taxpayers' money.  It is not a donation or philanthropic money going into the site that they will never see back.  The whole idea is for a government to give a stamp of approval, while also making members of the public realise that it is a safe and trustworthy way of lending to small businesses.</p></speech>

The Funding Circle is an interesting example and a good way of how a government can help.  It is not interfering with the market rate at all.  The market rate gets set by private lenders.  When it comes in, it makes the return they make as well.  So it is investing with the expectation of making a return.  The only potential risk would be to look at the default rate, which I think Mr. O'Mahony said was only 1%.  In effect, it is without any real risk at all.</p></speech>

So the 80% bid would go through and the 20% requirement would be drawn down at that stage.  It is was fully within the government's control throughout the whole process.  I believe the average return they got on that &pound;20 million was in the low 8% range.  I think they got about 8.2% as a return on the money.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that this time last year, Funding Circle, which was two years old at that stage, was lending &pound;1 million per week.  That changed five weeks later to &pound;5 million, once the government got involved.  It was a five-fold increase therefore.</p><p>  If the Government was prepared to get involved now, that is the type of growth we would see as well. </p></speech>

Since day one, we have had a big surplus of lenders' funds.  Because we are not like a bank, we do not need capital.  The money is coming from our lenders.  Where it came in Funding Circle's case, at the time we had 5,000 registered users.  At the time they got the government money, they had 30,000 - six times more - but they doubled in the next three or four months.  It was not just the government - it also made the public aware that this was a bona fide way of lending to small businesses.</p></speech>

Certainly the committee would be interested in developing the model further with the witnesses.  During our discussions in the next month or two, which will end with a report to various Ministers, we might link back to them.  Today's meeting was very useful to kick-start the process.  Certainly we will do all we can to flag it.  In our report we will address the concerns raised by the witnesses and what they need.  As I understand it, they have engaged in the Action Plan for Jobs and I hope that works for them.  We will certainly add our own reports and link back to the witnesses.</p><p>  On behalf of members of the committee I thank the witnesses and appreciate their coming in and taking the time to speak to us.

From Uisce &Eacute;ireann I welcome Mr. John Tierney, managing director; Mr. John Barry, programme director; Mr. John Dempsey, head of finance, and Mr. Jerry Grant.  From the Commission for Energy Regulation I welcome Mr. Paul McGowan, commissioner; Mr. Garrett Blaney, commissioner; and Ms Cathy Manning, director.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any document provided for the committee may be published on its website once the meeting has concluded.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  In compliance with the decision of the committee and the agreement of the Minister, Uisce &Eacute;ireann is the newest Irish utility and its establishment and ongoing progress are watched by the public at large, not least by elected representatives.  It is a major undertaking and a very good one.  Many of us have been concerned and curious about issues in rolling out the metering project, the decision-making process around it and the efforts to set up this utility.  There were serious concerns expressed earlier about outside expertise and I thank the delegates for their appearance at the meeting held in January.  By and large, there was a good flow of information - no pun intended - between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the committee.  In many ways, it satisfied much of the curiosity.  The hallmark of this project is transparency and we are anxious to do everything we can to advance that concept.</p><p>  A number of issues will be raised in respect of the establishment of the utility.  There is a certain level of curiosity and people tend to presume when there is no information available.  In so far as it can be established, we will deal with issues concerning pricing.  We are aware that households are cash-strapped and anxious to establish that the commission and the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann are mindful of this in setting prices.  </p><p>  With regard to local authority staff now working with Uisce &Eacute;ireann, I understand completely the service level agreements between trade unions and organisations.  Some people do not understand this and do not want to.  However, as a committee, we must be satisfied that people with the appropriate skills set from local authorities are doing exactly what it says on the tin.  Irish Water is not in the public sector in the conventional sense, as it is a semi-State commercial company.  There will always be issues relating to people working in the public sphere who then transfer to another area.  In an era when employment is scarce, any variance in a switch in remuneration is like a red rag to a bull.  It will be beneficial to the committee and the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann to establish this.  </p><p>  We will engage in a robust question and answer session after the opening statements and I believe all members will offer to speak.  I now invite Mr. Tierney to speak to the committee.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. John Barry, Mr. John Dempsey and Mr. Jerry Grant.  </p><p>  Water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure, more than any other type of infrastructure, determines the health of communities, protects the integrity of the environment and unlocks our potential to achieve economic prosperity.  The purpose of Irish Water is to safeguard water as a precious natural resource and deliver water services in a way that meets the needs of all citizens now and into the future.  In doing this, it will deliver a standardised asset management approach across 34 local authorities, drive efficiencies, improve customer service, ramp up the delivery of capital projects and raise international capital to help to deliver much needed investment in the sector.</p><p>  I want to refer to our seven key messages before synopsising what is included in the paper.  Ireland&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure does not meet the needs of a modern economy and there are significant quality, environmental and service challenges.  Irish Water has been established to put the structure and systems in place to address this challenge.  In 2009 the water services investment programme would have cost &euro;6 billion to implement.  The overall requirement to upgrade services has been estimated at &euro;10 billion.  Since 2009 we have invested &euro;1.5 billion in water services infrastructure.</p></speech>

There are serious health, environmental and economic risks inherent in this model.  The establishment of Irish Water as a national utility will secure improved water services by bringing a systematic approach to how we operate and manage services, centralising and standardising procurement and other activities to deliver major cost savings, adopting best project management practices to reduce the capital needed for projects, while accelerating their delivery within budget, delivering the largest metering programme for a water utility, and implementing a system of charging and collecting revenues from over 1.8 million customers.  There are no quick fixes; it is going to take time, substantial investment and a long-term systematic and strategic approach.  That is the only viable way to solve this problem for the country.  </p><p>  Local authority staff are critical to delivering services.</p> <p>Continuity of supply to customers cannot be put at risk as we make the necessary changes.  The Irish Water programme, as we debated the last day, has defined and built the processes, IT systems and capabilities to set it up as a modern utility.  The delivery of the project is to best utility standards and the investment has delivered an asset that will serve the needs of the country into the future and will stand up to scrutiny in any objective international benchmarking process.  We have tried to do three things, namely, to set out how Irish Water will tackle the problems in water services and what difference this will make to people; to set out the major plans in which Irish Water will be engaged during 2014 in order that the committee can understand what to expect from us; and to provide clarity on a few key issues which have arisen in recent weeks.  However, it is important to remind ourselves of Government decisions taken on water sector reform, namely, to establish a new public water utility building on the proven capability of BGE; to establish independent economic regulation of the water sector, set tariffs and protect customers' interests by ensuring efficient delivery of services by the new utility; and to create a sustainable funding model to facilitate much needed investment in water services.  </p><p> In 2014 we find ourselves with an abundant natural water resource but through under-investment and other factors, we have faced and are facing huge challenges in delivering water services.  I point to a particular case.  The European Commission has launched a pilot infringement case in regard to a number of plants.  The potential cost of fines would be additional to the cost of the infrastructure required to address non-compliance.  It is fair to say people involved in the service have been seriously concerned about the levels of investment.  If this was allowed to continue, it would store up even greater problems for the future that would manifest across the country.  Irish Water will take on this challenge by planning and investing wisely in improved national water infrastructure to meet present and future needs; implementing systems and processes that best manage this national water services infrastructure; and reducing costs by improving operational performance to the best levels of other utilities.  We have set out the benefits of national utility managed water services.  </p><p> I mention our approach to asset management.  I will not go through all of it, but it is the area in which the committee will see a radical change in strategy and approach in asset management and capital delivery.  Critical to this is central strategic planning, based on accurate asset performance data and full control of all investment decisions, both capital and operational.  International benchmarks suggest efficiencies of up to 40% are achievable in capital investment alone from a combination of adopting the right choices and delivering them efficiently.  The short to medium-term challenge will be to drive much higher levels of service from the existing asset base, but even with these higher levels of capital investment, a transformation of assets is a long-term project.  </p><p> I have set out the priorities and related issues for Irish Water in taking over water and wastewater services.  Drinking water quality is the first priority to protect consumers in terms of health risks, seeking to eliminate boil water notices and alleviating the problems of up to 50,000 people in areas where there are water restrictions.  Immediately on becoming the responsible authority on 1 January Irish Water put in place a special team to assess the issues involved and progress the solutions.  We point to the particular problems encountered in County Roscommon.  We are trying to build on the work done there to date and bring forward the work as quickly as possible.</p><p> Drinking water capacity is the second priority.  There is a series of measures in progress to ensure we stay ahead of demand.  I mention the greater Dublin area where there are particular problems.</p><p> The third priority is wastewater treatment plants and compliance.  Wastewater treatment plants servicing the majority of the population are currently non-compliant with the water framework directive.  That is a significant challenge which will take a number of years to resolve.  Irish Water's focus is on targeting those plants that will give the greatest environmental benefit in protecting waters as part of a credible plan that will allow us to meet EU requirements.  We need a new focus on how to upgrade existing plants, wherever possible.  </p><p> Our fourth priority is wastewater capacity.  There is little point in addressing the problems with water supply in places such as the greater Dublin area if one does not address the issue of wastewater treatment capacity also.  Our fifth priority is planned asset improvement schemes and development capacity schemes, as required.</p><p> I refer to major plans and developments.  In the coming months one will see Irish Water undertaking a range of actions, about which we hope to keep the committee informed.  In terms of capital investment, at this stage the projected capital funding available is &euro;930 million for the three years 2014 to 2016.  That figure needs to grow to an annual figure of &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million to meet urgent needs.  Given all of the competing priorities, it is necessary to consider how to maximise output in the short-term, given the need to tackle water quality, water conservation and urgent pollution issues.  Based on the asset management approach where we focus on obtaining the maximum benefit from existing assets and taking a critical look at the cost benefit balance on every scheme, we are confident that we will deliver efficiencies of at least 30% on the capital spend.  An example is the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant where an alternative approach may be possible.  On water conservation, Irish Water is targeting a capital spending figure of almost &euro;200 million over three years as part of the capital investment plan.  </p><p> We have to commence work on the Irish Water strategic plan for the 25 years to 2040.  We will shortly open a broad public and stakeholder engagement on the high level objectives looking forward to 2040.</p><p> On interim price control from 2014 to 2016, in a few weeks Irish Water will make a submission on interim price control to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  During the year we will start work on the first full regulatory cycle which runs from 2016 to 2021.</p><p> Irish Water formally took responsibility for water services six weeks ago.  Our goal is to be a professional organisation which is responsible, expert, efficient and operated with integrity and the best interests of the customer at its core.  To achieve this, we need to do a number of things.  In response to the significant demand for information on Irish Water, we are committed to productively publishing on our website all relevant information on water services in Ireland.  We will develop an integrated communications plan to inform and involve all citizens in understanding water services and engaging on managing water demand.  Following on from today's briefing, we will be inviting all Members of the Oireachtas to meet management team members of Irish Water to be briefed in more detail on the points we have raised.  We will put in place an information service for Oireachtas Members and council members to ensure their information requests are responded to in a timely manner.  We will supply details of this service to all Oireachtas Members this week.  </p><p> I refer to some of the items involved in regard to Irish Water and the local government partnership.  We are transforming the water services sector, building from the current model and not replacing or duplicating it.  Continuity of water services is the absolute priority.  The optimum number of staff required to deliver services, after a managed transformation, will be determined by business needs, including, most importantly, public health, under the scrutiny of the regulator who will take full account of comparators with other similar utilities.  There will be no allowance for surplus staff.</p><p> I mention some of the Irish Water programme in terms of the delivery of customer benefits and the high performance utility model and the system and structures put in place to drive high performance to ensure that over time we will have the organisation required to drive efficiencies and so on.</p><p> The Chairman has mentioned the metering programme which is a very ambitious one.  More than 115,000 meters are in the ground and we are meeting the 27,000 meters per month installation target, which is an enormous achievement.  </p><p> Reference was made recently to leaks.  The metering project is uncovering leaks and provides the opportunity to deal with them in partnership with the local authorities.</p><p> Investment in water services infrastructure is a catalyst for achieving prosperity, health and sustainability.  Every generation has tried to play its part within the resources available at the time and every subsequent generation has benefited from the efforts made.</p> <p>Our water services are in need of serious transformation.  We must learn from the delivery of services in the past century.  We must finds new ways of managing the assets, delivering, developing and paying for our water services.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann has been given this task and will work with the local authorities and the people.  We will do our utmost to meet the challenges.  Through incremental progress in the next 15 years, we will deliver on our vision of building a high-quality water service.  High-quality water will protect the health of our communities and the integrity of our environment and will be a driver of economic development.  We want to ensure that people have a clean, safe and affordable water system.</p></speech>

CER's role covers the networks, wholesale markets and retail markets.  We were appointed on 7 February 2013 as economic regulator for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and CER covers water and waste water services.  Our role in broad terms is to protect the interests of consumers and this sets the framework for all our other activities.  We will regulate the network costs of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and ensure they are efficient.  Networks are a natural monopoly.  There is a standard model for networks in energy and water.  We will set the costs through price controls, and we will use standard international processes for establishing the price controls.</p><p>  Price controls ensure that standards are imposed on the functions, and also that sufficient capital is achieved at the lowest cost from the consumer point of view.  Water and energy services are very capital-intensive industries and controlling capital costs is as important for water services as it is for energy services.  It is important that capital is sourced at a low cost.  Price controls provide a stable environment and that environment ensures we can build in targets and efficiencies to improve delivery for consumers.  We have introduced seven price controls in the energy sector in the past 14 years in both the electricity and gas services.  As a result, operating costs have decreased and performance has improved.  We have set targets which have been achieved and exceeded.  This has allowed us to get efficient capital from capital markets, which is an important factor in capital-intensive industries.</p><p>  My colleague Mr. Paul McGowan will focus on the CER's role in the provision of water services.</p></speech>

The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, will regulate Uisce &Eacute;ireann so that customers are provided with a high-quality service via codes of practice and Uisce &Eacute;ireann provides water services in an economical, viable and efficient manner.  The legislation also places other duties on CER, and these are listed in the documentation.  It should also be noted that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has the power to issue directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation under this legislation.</p><p>  The codes of practice will be one of the key instruments that CER will use to regulate the interface between the consumer and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will submit codes of practice on customer-service-related issues to CER for approval.  These codes of practice will make provision for issues such as standards for Uisce &Eacute;ireann in performing its functions.  Standards will be set for communication and service to customers as well as water quality.  The codes of practice will also cover the billing of customers for water services and how that should be done, the methods of payment available to its customers, information to be provided to customers in communications from Uisce &Eacute;ireann, how customers should go about making complaints, and any other matter the CER considers necessary to protect the interests of Uisce &Eacute;ireann customers.  It is expected and will be a requirement that the codes of practice are freely available online and accessible to customers and that the CER can issue a direction to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to comply with those codes.</p><p>  The CER will consult upon the codes of practice and other issues during 2014 and has set out timeframes for this.  We will issue the following public consultations.  In April we will set out our views on options for the structuring of water charges and customer protection issues and invite the public to engage in the process of consultation.  In June we will issue a consultation that will set out proposed water charge levels based on submissions from Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  In July 2014, we will issue a decision on the codes of practice and other customer protection matters and in August we will issue a decision on the structure of water charges and the water charge levels.</p><p>  Our broad remit is to protect the interests of water customers.  The CER will aim for a high-quality and efficient public water system.  Our focus is to ensure that only efficient operating and capital costs will be passed through to customers.  We will achieve this by using benchmarking with best international practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100005#G00500"><p>The key issue is how much people will pay for water services.  That relates to both Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the CER.  There is a cost in keeping costs down and in upgrading the distribution and quality of water services.</p><p>  As I understand it, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will send a proposal to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This is very different from the way Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the ESB engaged with the CER, because these were pre-existing services.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann is constructing a network to take over a service that was delivered by individual local authorities.  How will the CER be able to satisfy itself on the costs that Uisce &Eacute;ireann incurs, such as the cost of capital?  We know, for example, that all customers will be given a free allowance, so how will charging be structured?  Who will determine what is sufficient capital for Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  Some parts of the country have higher population density and have more developed water and wastewater infrastructure, so the existing water services are not developed equally across the country and can be worlds apart.  In the case of the ESB, the service in the west is the same as it is in the east.  Will the witnesses address the issues arising from the unequal water services throughout the country?</p> <p> I want to go back to the question of Irish Water's transition office, an issue which was not really touched on in the opening statement.  It seems from replies to parliamentary questions that the number of people working in that office is quite small.  More than &euro;5.7 million - a total of &euro;7.3 million - has been allocated for the office and I would like to be satisfied in that regard.  Perhaps Mr. Tierney might come back to us on that point.  I do not understand where the money is being spent and how the costs are being kept down.</p><p> Will Irish Water make a proposal to the Commission for Energy Regulation on the extent of the free allowances, or will this be done exclusively at Government level?  There are issues in respect of income also.  Local authorities have collected a sizeable amount of money in development contributions - I think the figure is close to &euro;1 billion - but they are not permitted to spend it.  Some of this fund relates to water and wastewater, some to roads and some to other services.  Where is the fund counted?  Will all of the moneys that have been designated for water and wastewater services be transferred to Irish Water, or will some continue to be controlled by local authorities?</p><p> There are other issues in relation to who is going to be included.  This applies to both groups.  A sizeable number of housing estates have not been taken in charge.  The responsibility of Irish Water extends to estates that have been taken in charge.  Other estates will continue to be controlled by developers.  How will this work where a developer is not in place?  Some people are complaining about being asked to pay property taxes and water charges, even though they are receiving a substandard service by virtue of being in limbo.  The officials might address this issue.  I am not sure how the system will operate.</p><p> Electricity and gas are provided as a door-to-door service, whereas water is provided up to the public footpath.  The householder is responsible for maintaining the service beyond the footpath, even to the point of having to dig up his or her garden.  I have come across several people who were told there were major leaks in their gardens and had to go digging.  Is the first fix policy proposed sufficient from the point of view of the Commission for Energy Regulation?  Is it likely that people living in areas with older pipes will have constant problems with leaks?  There is often an older population who might not be able to deal with these problems in such areas.  There could be a significant problem in this regard as complaints are made.  How would these complaints be dealt with?  Will there be an appeals mechanism for those who fall into this category?</p><p> I would like to return to a point made the last day about the cost of the infrastructure being developed.  Has all of the &euro;44 million being spent on information technology systems been spent at this stage?  Will the delegates describe on what exactly it is being spent?  Is it being spent on hardware, software or licences?  I am still trying to get my head around how such an amount of money could be spent in such a short period.</p></speech>

We have experience in the regulation of existing utilities such as Bord G&aacute;is Networks and ESB Networks.  We have gone through the process of price control and cost review on numerous occasions.  The additional complexity in this regard arises from the fact that this is a new utility.  We are going about this by looking at international experience.  In the first instance, it involves benchmarking, or looking at what happened when new utilities were established in other jurisdictions.  We examine how much that cost and determine whether the costs being incurred here are reasonable in that context.  In addition, we are in the process of establishing a network of fellow water regulators around Europe that have gone through similar experiences.  We are keen to have dialogue with other regulators to learn from their experiences and share our own.  There is additional complexity, but I am satisfied that it is not insurmountable.  We will be able to come up with a view on which costs are being efficiently incurred and, therefore, capable of being passed on in charges.  </p><p>  I hope that addresses the Deputy's questions about the establishment of the new association and how we satisfy ourselves with regard to costs.  Perhaps my colleague, Ms Mannion, might handle the Deputy's question about who determines whether the level of capital is sufficient.  I think it relates to the plan submitted.</p></speech>

I have asked who determines whether the level of capital is sufficient.  There is a great deal of money to be spent on an annual basis.  Is the decision on what level of capital is sufficient made by Irish Water or the Commission for Energy Regulation?  Is the ability of the end user to supply that capital, if it is to be derived from consumers, factored in?</p></speech>

Irish Water provides the Commission for Energy Regulation with an investment plan.  We examine the costs set out in that plan to see what is reasonable and what is not.  We are developing a memorandum of understanding on how best to work with the Environmental Protection Agency which is responsible for the quality of water.  This one of the areas we need to work our way through.  The agency will state what projects it thinks should be built, just as we will.  It is a question of finding a balance.  A separate discussion is taking place about the level of Government subvention.  In the interim period, investment in water infrastructure will be funded partly from the Government's subvention and partly from tariffs imposed on domestic and non-domestic consumers.  We will sit down with the Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and Irish Water to see what we can do during the interim period - the next two years - with the money available.  I am quite sure we will take account of the level of subvention that is realistically available and the ability of customers to pay their bills.  We will all have to work together to see how best the constrained level of funds available can be used.</p></speech>

Is it possible that people with very deficient systems will be charged the same amount of money as those with better systems?  How will that issue be dealt with?</p></speech>

I am giving some initial thoughts.  As I said, we will work with the Environmental Protection Agency to rank the most important things that need to be done to build the quality of the service.  We will work our way down the list.  During the consultation process we will look at the question of whether a customer in an area where a water notice has been issued and the water is not drinkable should have to pay the full cost of water supplied.</p> <p>We cannot presume that is what the outcome of consultation will be, but, realistically, I expect them to pay somewhat less because the quality is not the same as elsewhere.  We have to work closely with the EPA to determine the aspects of quality for which a customer should pay less.</p></speech>

It is an arrangement between local government and the Department directly, as opposed to something that is governed by Irish Water.  From our perspective, it was beneficial from the point of view of initial co-ordination, fact-facting and streamlinging the flow of information, but the breakdown of the figure would have to come from either the water services transition office or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The free allowance is a matter of Government policy.  I invite Mr. Dempsey to respond on the issue of levies.</p></speech>

Local authorities have levied development charges for water service provision.  To the extent that development charges have been collected by the local authorities they would be recorded in their accounts.  At the point of asset transfer to Irish Water on 1 January, these charges moved to Irish Water and will have to be spent on water service provision in the local authority area in which they are collected.  It will be around the middle of the year before we know the exact quantum because, first, the local authorities will have to finalise their year-end accounts to the end of 2013.  We will then have to get into an agreed process between us to clarify and confirm the numbers.  Essentially, that is what is happening on development charges.  They have been levied for water service provision and will be spent on water service provision in the area in which they are levied.</p></speech>

Will that continue to be an issue in respect of Irish Water or will it have control over these funds?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100007#J00900"><p>I appreciate that &euro;44 million is quite a sum.  For that spend, in terms of IBM, we are getting a customer care and billing system that will have to have the capacity to deliver several million bills, a work and asset management system which, when we start to record data on the network, will be data hungry.  By that I mean that when we start to make investment decisions, based on information coming back into our work and asset management system, it is vital that the system have the capacity to record that data and that we extract them to make sensible investment decisions.  The system will handle an enormous amount of data on an annual basis.  The third area is back office systems, audit financial systems.  Obviously, we have to carry out procurement exercises and pay our suppliers.  That is the third part of the plank.</p><p>  We have delivered probably eight major stems in the past 12 months.  If one compares what we have received for the &euro;44 million with has happened in other jurisdictions where companies such as Thames Water invested &pound;100 million in an asset management system alone, the relevancy of the cost involved comes into perspective.  What do we get for the money?  When companies such as IBM come, we sit down and define with them the business requirements and write business processes around these requirements.  To date, we have probably written about 1,300 or 1,400 business processes.  They then configure the systems which come out of the box, so to speak, and are standard, but we can fit them to suit our particular business requirements.  We test them and, obviously, before we go live, they have to be working end to end.  An enormous amount of work goes into this task.  When we go live, there is an element of post-live support.  We are in that mode with a large portion of our system which went live on 1 January.  In setting up this utility we cannot achieve what we want to achieve without the systems being in place, including systems to manage information and the data flowing around them.  For what we are getting, the &euro;44 million compares well with what has been spent in other jurisdictions.  We now have systems and processes in place that will enable it to be a high-performing utility into the future.</p></speech>

In terms of customer billing, work and asset management and all of the financial issues involved - the systems with which we are familiar - we have a key requirement and a programme such as this should define the scope very clearly and distinctly.  One of the major drivers of cost overruns is scope creep.  We would have started out to find exactly what we wanted, based on our experience and the PID document which was given to the bidders.  It gave a very clear indication of scope to each of the bidders.  When we engaged in these contracts, they would have been clearly aware of what we required and the timeline as to when we expected them to deliver.</p></speech>

We brought a lot of valuable information, but we also brought the policies and procedures embedded in the Bord G&aacute;is organisation and transferred them to Irish Water.</p></speech>

There are a few issues from our previous deliberations that we might address.  In the first instance, on page 20 of the documentation, Mr. Tierney says he put in place an information service for Oireachtas Members and council members to ensure their information requests are responded to in a timely matter and that he will be supplying details of this service to Oireachtas Members this week.  Will this include details of the &euro;185 million in set-up costs and the &euro;500 million for water meters raised as a commercial loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  There is a contradictory statement emanating from members of the Government on what information can flow in this regard.  Why can we not be told today what we will be told later this week?  What is the reason for the delay?  What is the arrangement that will be in place?  Does Mr. Tierney wish to respond now?</p></speech>

Just as we did on the last occasion, we will try to give the maximum amount of information on the establishment of Irish Water as the business and metering.  During the week we are going to circulate details of the email address to be used in order that we can respond to queries and, if necessary, replace the parliamentary question procedure by giving Members the information directly without having to go through the Department.</p></speech>

There was an establishment cost of &euro;10 million, which we were promised by the Department and there was &euro;185 million that was drawn down from the National Pensions Reserve Fund that was used by Irish Water and approved by the Cabinet sub-committee.</p></speech>

Some &euro;3.5 million was paid to them, which would average &euro;41,000 per person.  Mr. Tierney can tell me if I am on the right track when I put this question to him, but can either he and Irish Water or the Department establish what specific work, over and above the work they did on a daily basis within the local authorities, was carried out by these people in order to amass that funding?  If Mr. Tierney tells me it is the duty of the Department to answer that question and to provide the details I seek, that is fair enough.</p></speech>

Point four states the establishment of Irish Water as a national utility will secure and improve water services by bringing a systematic approach to the service and so forth.  Specifically, Irish Water suggests that 34 local authorities managing &euro;11 billion worth of assets does not deliver the required economies of scale at present.  The lack of standardisation in how plants are operated and services delivered leads to a variable quality and added costs.  Irish Water goes on to say that it will identify priority areas nationally that require focus and investment to solve problems.  Does Mr. Tierney accept this is very similar to the sort of comment made in the establishment of the HSE?  If so, is it not strange that in the coming weeks we will see the disbandment of the HSE, due to the fact it is not achieving the sort of savings it envisaged it would?  Does Mr. Tierney wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

Mr. Tierney can note that one.  On staffing levels, as Mr. Tierney knows, Irish Water has entered into a 12-year service level agreement with 34 local authorities and the staff of local authorities conducting work under these arrangements will remain local authority members.  The head count for 2014 for service level agreements is 4,320, but will Irish Water also employ an additional 520 staff?  Irish Water and others have continued to state that they will achieve &euro;2 billion in cost efficiencies by 2021.  The ESRI report by Dr. FitzGerald estimated excessive staffing costs if staffing levels went beyond 1,700.  However, I am not sure that 1,700 figure was crystallised.  Dr. FitzGerald referred to Scotland and I understand the water authority in Scotland has 4,000 staff, not 1,700.  What is Irish Water's position on these figures?  Does he think a staff of 1,700 is sufficient or does he think we require 4,000 or 4,800 or for how long should this be the case?  Has Irish Water carried out any assessment of natural wastage or the loss of staff over time and what the position will be by 2021?  Is it correct that Irish Water staff will benefit from a bonus system similar to that in the parent body, Bord G&aacute;is, and will be eligible for payments up to &euro;7,000?  Will bonus payment criteria and numbers be made available publicly over time?</p><p>  My main query relates to the &euro;2 billion efficiencies that Irish Water, the Taoiseach and the Minister have said will be achieved by 2021.  What percentage of that &euro;2 billion is made up of water charges?  What will the savings be if staffing levels remain in place?  In other words, the &euro;2 billion savings has two elements, water charges and savings relating to staff.  Has Irish Water calculated these or can it give us an estimation or indication of these savings?</p><p>  I guess the issue of water pricing relates to the regulator.  Unfortunately, I must refer to the set up cost of &euro;185 million and the &euro;82 million within that for consultancy costs.  The Department says it dealt directly with Irish Water in regard to the submission it made to establish and agree those costs before making them available to Bord G&aacute;is when it went about the process of setting up Irish Water.  The Minister has explained that he would not have had access to the minute detail of those figures, although he said he passed them on to the regulator.  Correct me if I am wrong, but is Mr. McGowan quoted directly in saying that on his initial review of the establishment costs last year, he was not aware of the amount involved in consultancy costs?</p></speech>

The submission we received showed us the costs at the various line item levels, such as customer billing, customer service, but was not split down into the level the Deputy describes.  We carried out a high level initial review at that level of detail.</p></speech>

In April, we will publish our proposals &ndash; they will simply be proposals - around the structure of water charges, without identifying what the level might be.  These relate to how an assessed charge might be structured, perhaps depending on different factors such as house type or occupancy levels.  All of these things remain to be worked out.  Where a meter is already installed we will determine how the water charge might be structured in that scenario.  They are the options.  Then, in June we will have costs based on the submission that we will have analysed from Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Then both of those come together in August for a final decision on the structure and level of charges.</p></speech>

In fact, the establishment of Irish Water is more analogous to what happened in the gas industry.  During the early 1980s Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann brought together a collection of gas companies to form a high-performing utility model.  Thirty years later we probably have the safest gas infrastructure in Europe and a model that delivers efficiencies year-on-year in the gas industry.  That is why I believe the expertise of Bord G&aacute;is has been so vital to the successful establishment of Irish Water.</p><p>  Reference was made to efficiencies in respect of staffing levels.  The direct capital and operational efficiencies that we referred to were &euro;1.1 billion, but added to potential from income would have created savings to the Exchequer of &euro;2 billion and we were clear about that-----</p></speech>

The assumption, as I read it, was that 20% could be taken out of costs over five years.  If we apply that <i>pro rata</i> in respect of staffing, it does not bring us to a figure of 1,700 because it depends on which way we devise the model.  If the model is being devised as I believe Professor FitzGerald set out, on the basis of 1,700 staff in the local authorities with another quantum of staff in an outsourced model, then one would have to take the total head count involved in delivering the same services as today.  That would be a figure far greater than 1,700.  We should bear in mind that there would still be 2,600 other staff left in the local authorities without the job they have today in water services.  Therefore, technically, we would have much greater overall cost to the economy by dealing with simply one part of the equation in that fashion.</p><p>  We produced figures around the initial experience in Britain which, over ten years, saw reductions of staffing in the order of 21.5%.  We have referred to Scotland previously.  What we should remember about Scotland is that the set-up there does not include the billing aspect within its staffing numbers.  Scotland did not get the levels down as far as 1,700 directly in any such length of time.</p><p>  I suppose the position is that many things will have an impact on staff numbers over time.  The committee members will be well aware and would agree that the local government sector, probably more than any other sector within the public sector, has contributed to the reductions in respect of staffing and costs.  I cannot remember the figure exactly but I gather that the sector accounted for 12% of the staff but almost 25% of the reductions.  It is nothing new for local government to be dealing with these issues.  If we are to analyse the service in terms of what is ultimately needed, let us remember that we are coming from a reduced number already as of 1 January 2014.  We have 2,000 plants throughout the country.  It will take analysis and investment but there will be situations whereby, as the committee has rightly pointed out, we will have natural attrition through retirements and so on.</p> <p>There could well be situations where voluntary redundancy schemes will be introduced to manage how the situation will be dealt with in the future.  It is not a question that in modelling any scenarios it is assumed there will be the very same number in 2021 or 2025 when the SLA 12-year period comes to an end.</p><p> On the question about the at-risk part of performance payment for the staff in Irish Water, we gave a very detailed response in answer to a parliamentary question.  The Deputy asked what will be declared at the end of any particular year.  We will publish both the total amount paid out under that heading plus the average payment.</p><p> On the question about the percentage made up by water charges, we will be making a submission based on expenditure and allowed revenue.  I think I described to the Deputy previously that unlike, for instance, the gas industry where it is simply based upon the charge, we have a hybrid situation with subvention and charges.  Therefore, the determinants are twofold and one has to know both in order to make up the total.  I am not into the world of guessing.</p></speech>

Irish Water will have roughly &euro;200 million from non-domestic customers which is less than 60% of the overall and &euro;490 million subvention from the Exchequer - I just want to clarify this - which came through from the local property tax and &euro;240 million for capital works provided for in the budget.  It will have roughly &euro;125 million from water charges - if everyone pays - for quarter year because the billing will be for October to December.  That comes to &euro;1.055 billion.  Does Mr. Tierney agree with those figures? A subvention of &euro;490 million from the Exchequer; &euro;240 million from the Exchequer for capital works; approximately &euro;200 million from commercial water rates; &euro;125 million from domestic water charges which will be collected in January 2015.

We are concerned because we were told that these would be fitted professionally and there would be no leaks, that there would be minimum disturbance and problems.  Meters are being fitted to stop leaks and to reduce the amount of water being used.</p> <p>We now discover that there are hundreds of leaks and that someone must foot the bill in that regard.

As the Deputy is aware, meters are being fitted to existing service pipes, some of which are in poor condition and many are quite old.  When the contractors dig down into the ground, they often find that the connections to the main are corroded and already leaking.  These leaks are reported to the local authorities which fix them.  During 2013 the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provided funds for local authorities to cover the cost of this.  In 2014 Irish Water will cover these costs.</p></speech>

Mr. Grant who is a former county manager will know what I am getting at in this instance.  An issues arises in this regard in that the foul and storm sewers in many towns and cities are mixed.  A problem which immediately arises in the context of works relates to circumstances where foul sewers run into storm sewers.  Where a storm sewer runs into a foul sewer, a different problem arises.  Has this matter been teased out with the local authorities?  I do not know in how many towns problems such as those to which I refer would not arise.  Many foul and storm sewers are combined, even in estates built less than 20 years ago.  They remain combined, even under main streets that were redeveloped, and foul material from hotels and public houses continues to run into the storm drain system.  Is Irish Water putting in place measures that will lead to the two systems being separated?</p></speech>

Up to the 1970s, pretty much all sewers were combined.  Any sewer that contains foul sewage will become our responsibility.  Separate storm sewers will remain the responsibility of local authorities.  There are many difficulties associated with combined sewers, both in the context of the load on treatment plants and pumping stations and in respect of the overflow to rivers and streams during periods of rainfall.  These are creating compliance difficulties for us with the EPA.  Part of our responsibility will be to consider how we can control this and, where possible, separate storm water.  We will do this in conjunction with local authorities.  As part of our capital investment programme, we will be seeking to fund the separation of storm water from place to place.  Local authority staff deal with both storm sewers and combined sewers.  We are covering the cost in the case of combined sewers.</p></speech>

This, in turn, will have to be translated into codes of practice by Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  They will clearly set out the process the company would go through in a situation where somebody had difficulty in paying his or her bill.  The position on non-payment would be very much the same as that which applies in the case of gas and electricity, namely, disconnection for non-domestic customers and restricted flow for domestic customers.  This would be viewed very much as a last resort.  We would be looking at a staged process designed to try to ensure the customer would be put in a certain position.  In the case of gas and electricity, we have payment plans and so forth which can be put in place.  Disconnection of electricity and gas is the equivalent of restricted flow in the case of water and we very much view both as a last resort.  The details in this regard have yet to be set out, but they will be published for consultation as part of the overall consultation process on customer protection and the structure of water charges.  We do not envisage at this point that there would be penalties for non-payment.  Ms Mannion will answer the Deputy's question on that matter.</p></speech>

I cannot argue with that, and it probably has happened, but I know what has happened at the other end.  I am using less energy in my home than I used 40 years ago but I am paying multiples of what I paid for it at that time, as is everybody in this room and outside this building.  Is it the case that the regulator does not have the power to intervene in this respect?  What type of restrictions apply to the regulator?  I am puzzled about this.  How does the regulator explain the huge gap that has opened up between the operational costs - I do not doubt, as was said, the impact if they have been reduced in real terms - and increased efficiencies there and, on the other hand, the massive increase in costs across the energy sector?  Our energy bills have skyrocketed in the past 14 years.  What has the regulator done to regulate that sector and rein in those costs? Has it not had the power to do that, or what is the position?  I am concerned that, with regard to water charges, we would start off with an amount for the charge and within a few years the charge could be multiples of that amount.</p></speech>

In regard to gas and electricity, it is probably worth noting that when we started regulating both of those industries, particularly electricity, they had suffered from decades of under-investment.  During the past decade or more there was massive investment in the electricity infrastructure in order to bring it up to the standard that is required in a modern economy.  That has been a driver for cost increases, undoubtedly, in the energy area.  The second point is that, unlike water, the price of energy is very much driven by the price of fuel, predominantly gas, in international markets.  That is completely outside the control of the State or the regulator.  We are price takers.  We have to accept the international wholesale price for gas, for example, which in the case of Ireland is pretty much set in Great Britain at what is called the national balancing point, which is their wholesale market.  Those costs have been rising over the years.  We have investigated and looked at the costs of delivering both the capital investment and operating expenditure of Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB and the backdrop to that has been rising fuel prices and a massive investment programme in order to bring both electricity and gas networks up to international standards and, for example, to ensure that the amount of minutes lost by customers who are attached to the electricity network has decreased since we took over as regulator.  That probably reflects the level of investment that was necessary to improve the overall system.</p></speech>

To follow on from the regulator's point, water services in Ireland have suffered from decades of under-investment.   The statistics are frightening.  A total of 40% of all treated water is being lost through leaks.  Another statistic that is even more worrying is that 25% of water treatment plants have failed to meet international standards.  We have an enormous responsibility to make sure that everything is transparent and crystal clear in how we do this and in the steps being taken by this committee, Irish Water and the regulator.  To be clear on the timeline involved, the first factor is a price control submission, and this is a question for Irish Water.  That cannot be made to the regulator until the Cabinet makes a decision on the free water allowance and the subvention.  Is there any other controlling factor that may delay the price control submission to the regulator?  I will await a response to that question and then ask my next question rather than get a block response to all my questions.</p></speech>

We will outline our strategy, which is based on the utility model, and we will go into quite a bit of detail on the individual elements of the utility model.  In the regard, if we consider other economies that have gone down this road, there is probably a well established model there.  The regulator mentioned its interaction with other regulators and we would be familiar with that model.  We would give the detail that the regulator will need to form an opinion on our costs and it will be based on expenditure, so we will submit our operating expenditure and our capital expenditure proposals.</p></speech>

What we expect is submissions on what the tariff structure would be both for a metered supply and an unmetered supply and both for domestic customers and non-domestic customers.  There may be more detail on domestic customers because there is a lot more work we need to do on non-domestic customers, so we might do more work on that next year.  It has nothing to do with the price level.  As Mr. Paul McGowan said, we will issue a consultation paper on the tariff structures in April.</p></speech>

A large number of customers would be connected to the mains water supply but would not have an outfall to a treatment plant; they would have a septic tank or whatever.  Would the regulator expect there to be a difference in the charging level because the costing there would be double?  Would there be two costings within that?</p></speech>

In terms of what happens across the Irish Sea, targets are set.  Will Irish Water set targets for leakage, for example?  We are doing a combined drain, and therefore targets are set for sewer flooding.  In the wastewater treatment plants targets are set for capacity and odour abatement.  What other targets and monitoring elements will Irish Water be involved in with regard to regulating Irish Water?</p></speech>

In regard to quality, for example, we would be in discussion with bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to determine the key issues and therefore the key improvements that need to be made on a national basis to meet the requirements of, say, the European directives on wastewater treatment and so forth.  Typically, on any price control, in addition to determining the overall costs we would ask what that is delivering and what are the targets that have to be achieved in terms of quality, output etc.  That is typical of the process we would go through.  It is probably worth bearing in mind that we are doing an interim control for a period of two years before we then step into a full five-year control period.  Those two years will allow us gather even more information to ensure that full five-year control is fully defined and detailed in terms of the targets we set for Irish Water.  Separate to that, we may also consider the standards we expect it to achieve in terms of customer service, complaint handling etc.  All of that is typical of what the regulator will consider.  Once we have set those, we then enter into what we call a monitoring phase, which is reviewing through performance reporting or whatever in terms of what is being achieved on a month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter or annual basis, depending on what is the appropriate reporting cycle.</p></speech>

I have asked parliamentary questions previously to seek some clarity on the bonus structure.

What is the structure of the bonus repayment?  Do the different percentages kick in according to the different salaries?  Would someone on &euro;20,000 be on the lower 3% bonus and somebody on &euro;100,000 be on 14%?  What are the structures for the bonuses?</p></speech>

The example given to me was that the job was advertised at approximately &euro;50,000.  A Bord G&aacute;is staff member applied for that job and transferred into it at a salary of approximately &euro;70,000.  Irish Water might have had many more applications for that position if it had been advertised at &euro;70,000 rather than &euro;50,000.  I ask the regulator to examine that closely because I would not like to see a cost transfer from Bord G&aacute;is to Irish Water, which the customer eventually will have to pick up.  If the job is advertised at a salary of &euro;50,000 and somebody applies for it and gets it, the job should be filled at that salary rather than what may have happened in the example I have given.  However, I will await the further clarification on it but I ask the regulator to examine that closely.</p></speech>

Another point is that in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, in particular, apartment dwellers are used to paying their utility bills individually.  However, my understanding is that the proposal from Irish Water is to have a single levy and that it will not be possible to meter apartments.  Can this issue be dealt with and, if so, can a timeframe be given for how this might happen?</p></speech>

These services very often have lead pipes that often are in poor condition.  A fair amount of work has been done in starting to remedy such services.  It is complicated and expensive work because one must put a pipe in the front and mould services to the back of the houses.  Certainly over a relatively short time - it probably will take ten years - we hope to eliminate all such common services through a programme of work.  As I stated, this will take out the issues of lead and leakages and is improving the service and in so doing makes such properties available for metering purposes.  Clearly, they are not amenable to metering at present.</p><p>  In respect of apartments and other multi-use properties, Irish Water has carried out some pilot work on the potential for the metering of apartments.  It is a highly complicated task because buildings of different type and from different ages have all kinds of plumbing systems.  For example, some apartment buildings have approximately three separate feeds to different parts of the system in individual apartments.  A percentage of multi-occupation buildings have individual stop cocks at the front and can be metered.  For the balance of such properties and beyond phase 1 of the metering process, we are looking at the options.  It will be a matter of being able to fund and deliver the programme over time.  Certainly, however, it is beyond the scope of phase 1.</p></speech>

It is important, from a public information perspective, that this be made clear and communicated.  Consequently, I welcome it.  Ultimately, this is about the customer and providing a quality and efficient service.  That is what Irish Water is being established to do and it is clear from Mr. Tierney's opening statement that were Irish Water not established and were the planned level of investment not to be made, we would be in a far worse position, with the assets degrading further and further leakages.  I understand more than &euro;1.2 billion per annum is being spent, of which 40% is going into the ground, which is completely unsustainable.  Members are aware that this is the standard of network with which Irish Water must deal.  Will Mr. Tierney indicate what is the standard of records or the actual asset data Irish Water has inherited from the local authorities?  Essentially, is Irish Water starting from a zero point to establish a new asset management system?  As Mr. Tierney has noted, the underground pipe network extends to more than 50,000 km and there are 10,000 overground facilities, of which 2,000 are treatment systems.  It will be a huge challenge to establish a starting point and then understand maintenance, replacement plans and so on.  Is this an entirely new body of work that Irish Water has been obliged to undertake?</p></speech>

The value of that system is that it brings us from a position where there was very little visibility of asset records and performance to one where across the 50,000 km of pipes, the 10,000 above-ground assets and, in particular, the more than 2,000 treatment plants we will have both data on what they are, their size and capacities and their condition.  Over a couple of years, as we roll out workflow management, we will be able to attribute the operational expenditure, maintenance activity and repair activity to these specific assets.  The starting point is that there is a reasonably good, although somewhat out-of-date, geographic information system, GIS, for water mains which was developed mostly in the past 12 or 15 years.  It is not too bad in terms of where the pipes are and the basic information available on materials.  It is not particularly good, however, on things like burst history, condition and fragility of the pipe.  It certainly does not pinpoint leakages.  </p><p>  In terms of sewers, we are not in such a good place.  There is a certain amount of information available on the GIS and mapping which we have started to pull together.  By the end of 2014, we expect to have all existing data on the layout and whatever information is available on all underground assets.  However, there will be big gaps, particularly on the sewerage side.  </p><p>  In terms of treatment plants, there is a lot of publicly available information that we have collected which arises from the Environmental Protection Agency's reporting on drinking water quality and which references all plants, as well as schemes and water quality information.  Moreover, wastewater plants have been the subject of licence applications which provide a lot of detail on the plants and in general on where they are short in being able to meet either capacity or compliance standards.</p><p>  Consequently, with a little maturity and additional surveys and work, we will end up with a national database of all the assets.  We will have standard policies and specifications and standards for all equipment across these assets.  We will have the capacity and the customer service that we can deliver throughout the system.  From all of this, we will be able to calculate the risk of not being able to comply with service needs.  Fundamentally, that is what will drive investment.  It will be tailored at a target risk of compliance or service provision that should be consistent across all customers.  Consequently, it should not matter whether one lives in a city or a rural area.  If the system is working well and one is investing properly and targeting capital maintenance, in particular, one will have an equivalent result and over time bring that standard up to where it needs to be.  </p><p>  Perhaps one of the biggest gaps in the water services area has been the lack of planned proactive investment in maintenance.  This is part of the reason we end up with assets in some places that are not fit for purpose.  Essentially - this is particularly true of the high growth period from approximately 1990 - all investment had to be in two areas.  The first was chasing capacity because we needed additional capacity, while the second was dealing with compliance with European standards.  As a result, almost nothing went back into the older assets which were deteriorating behind our backs.</p><p>  This is the basic model against which one plans the work one seeks to do.  One can then introduce measures such as spending to save, for example.  There is considerable potential for us to reduce operating costs by putting in new equipment to reduce energy costs, chemical usage or sludge production, as well as repairs.  One key outcome in any 12 month period should be considering where one is spending one's money on repair and maintenance work and ascertaining where one could replace a particular part of the asset base.  Even in respect of leakages, for example, a joined-up approach that involved more intensive find and fix measures in respect of items such as pressure management to reduce stress on the system would indicate to us - we will be mapping all of this activity - where we needed to go to replace pipes that would produce the biggest yield in reducing water losses.  This has allowed me to explain how the investment Mr. Barry described effectively will underpin the entire approach to operation and, in particular, maintenance of the asset base across the sector.</p></speech>

The agency took a lot of flak for the establishment of something that is critical to the infrastructure.  How much was spent on establishing that asset management system?</p></speech>

At the time, we took the view it was an initial budget but it is still proving to be a valid budget.  We provided for a contingency of 20% within the budget.  With the involvement of Bord G&aacute;is, the risks and the timeframe in which we were set to do it, we reckoned 20% was sensible.</p><p>  When we looked at it again, we decided that as it was coming up from a greenfield site, one should add at a minimum 15% to that.  That equates to approximately &euro;29 million of the &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million.  The other lump of money comes from savings we got on software licences.  By using our existing systems, we were able to get good value for money in negotiating software licences with the various players in the market.</p><p>  The sum of &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million alone is completely understating it.  As I mentioned earlier, without Bord G&aacute;is's involvement, I would argue that this project would have cost tens, if not hundreds, of millions more had it not been because of the control and project management we brought to what is a unique achievement.  To the best of my knowledge, what has happened here on two fronts in the past 12 or 18 months has never been done anywhere previously.  First, we are delivering 27,000 metres a month, which has never been done anywhere in the world.  At the committee in the past month, we confirmed we had consulted Scottish Water and Thames Water.  When we said to those bodies that our target was 27,000 metres a month, they said we could not do it.  However, we are doing it.  Second, from a standing start with a letter from Government asking us to do it in 18 months, we have created a national utility with systems, processes and staff.  I would argue that has never been achieved anywhere.  The utility is now up and running.  We have met all the milestones that have been set for us.  We are on time and on budget.</p></speech>

Other Deputies mentioned unusual situations, such as the networks at the back of houses.  There is quite a lot of that.  I come from Waterford where huge sections of the city have a lead network at the back of houses.  There are numerous estates that have private water supplies but use the public sewers.  Will all that be part of the consultation or how will Irish Water capture those unusual situations, be fair to those customers and keep the service going?</p></speech>

We will be looking at charging in two distinct areas: the provision of water and the provision of wastewater services.  We have identified there are customers who take both services or one or other of them.  We will be devising a charging system which will deal with those four or five different scenarios.</p></speech>

Like other utilities that operate customer charters dealing with standards of supply, in the case of water, one is looking at water quality - there was mention of the Environmental Protection Agency - and water pressure.  Will the CER require Irish Water to have a customer charter to reassure customers that it must maintain an acceptable standard of service, and if that service cannot be achieved, will a penalty of some sort apply as is the case in other utilities?  If the pressure or quality is not adequate, surely the customer should have recompense to a charter of some sort.</p></speech>

In addition, as with energy, there will be certain payments to consumers for non-performance.  On the measures against which we will decide whether to pay consumers, we will have to consult and have further discussions with the EPA.  Deputy Coffey mentioned water pressure.  I do not know whether water pressure is one of those issues.  That will all come out in our consultation in the coming months.  I am not saying it will not be.  I am only saying I am not sure either way at this point.</p></speech>

My last question is also to the CER.  When one compares other utilities, Ireland is regional by nature.  There would be concerns that in future, investment plans Irish Water would cherry-pick the urban areas.  Customers and water users will all pay no matter where they live.  My concern is that while there are probably well-deserved priorities for larger urban areas, rural or regional areas might not receive the investment they require due to their more sparse populations.  How can Irish Water reassure customers in the regions that they will receive the service and investment they require, similar to the larger urban areas?</p></speech>

First, we put in place the resources to deal with new connections generally.  There is a team in place which is picking up on all planning referrals since 1 January in order that we are aware of planning pressures and planning applications as they arise, particularly any of those that are significant in terms of water-using activity.  Through that team, we will be referred to by local authorities in terms of local development plans, regional plans, etc.  When we come to make our own plans, we will take account of both regional plans and local development plans in terms of the expectation for development.  In relation to the public water supply systems, our hope is to be able to keep a basic headroom in place in order that we can meet development on an ongoing basis, based on understanding capacity, availability and headroom.</p><p>  The difficulties arise in smaller rural settlements which are not connected to the public system.  In that context, it can be costly.  Clearly, it could be beyond the scope of the public water customer to pay for the capital investment in those situations.  That has been dealt with, as Deputy Coffey will be aware, through the rural water programme.  The rural water programme continues to be important in terms of providing local water supplies which are beyond the scope, at least in the medium term, of the public water system.</p></speech>

Irish Water inherited the assets and liabilities of local authorities, including water and sewerage infrastructure, on 1 January.  With regard to projects under the current water services investment programmes approved by local authorities and the Department, in respect of which the Department has committed to making progress and to making funding available, can Mr. Tierney confirm they will be completed and continue to be prioritised as they were prioritised by the Department?  How do they feature in Irish Water's capital development programme, the two year programme that the agency is undertaking?  How will new projects be selected?  To what extent do local authority members set the priorities?</p></speech>

These are all to continue.  We are in the business of processing through to contract a significant number of projects to which the Minister committed funding and in respect of which contracts were signed or letters of intent to award contracts were issued prior to the end of the year.  This is to allow them to proceed.  We are not second-guessing them; they are all proceeding.  This means a very significant amount of the funding available to us for the next two years, in particular, is committed to those projects.</p><p>  The rest of the water services programme represents approximately &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion in potential projects, some of which were in the early stages of planning and others of which were at later stages.  We are reviewing all those against the criteria we have set out for the evaluation of projects.  We are determining whether it is possible to bring forward lower cost schemes in the shorter term that might allow us to defer certain projects.  Quite clearly, we will not be in a position to fund work worth &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion in the immediate future.  However, we must make a big impact on the non-compliance issues associated with drinking water and wastewater.  To do so, we must come forward with asset improvement schemes that result in the greatest benefit for the money available.</p><p>  Projects with contractual commitments are going ahead.  Those without contractual commitments are under review by us.  We take submissions, particularly from the capital offices of local authorities, which are working with us and feeding in their assessments of what is needed in their areas.  We cannot afford everything and, therefore, we must make choices on priorities and use minor capital improvements in substitution for big projects where it will buy us some time and deliver a service in the short term.</p></speech>

Therefore, the priorities could be turned on their head.  Irish Water is going to take a different approach.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely correct that we must determine where the greatest risks and pressures lie.  Drinking water quality is our top priority.  Drinking water capacity comes next, as does wastewater compliance.  We would like to be able to spend money on energy reduction and capital maintenance that will keep existing assets working better.  We desperately need to spend money on automation and control in order that we can get better performance from existing assets.  We have a range of priorities in which we want to invest.  The key criterion concerns what will deliver the greatest impact in the short term.</p></speech>

We will receive a submission that will include details on the levels of capital and operating expenditure.  Ultimately, we must decide whether to approve it.  There will be some projects in regard to which we will not get into detail.  With major items of capital expenditure, we will carry out detailed analyses.  There will be items of small capital expenditure that will not be analysed individually by the CER.  This is typical of how we regulate the gas and electricity networks.</p></speech>

The local authorities would have planned to have design capacity for a period of 15 to 20 years.  I understand from my local authority in Mayo that the delegates are considering a period of five to six years.  Is this the case throughout the country or does it pertain more to rural areas where there is an effort to gauge population growth?  If capacity is reached after five or six years, in respect of wastewater treatment or otherwise, there will be a need to plan again and reconsider whether to increase capacity.  More projects will be entering the system again if the approach is uniform throughout the country.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There may be slight differences with the water industry.  We take a very long-term view.  When we are examining capital costs, we look ahead only five years, but this is part of a much longer planning process.  With regard to network development, while Bord G&aacute;is and ESB Networks give us a five year view, they constantly update it to account for the next five years.  There is not a series of disjointed five year plans but a continuous plan.  The companies are always re-evaluating their plans and they come back to us with the next five year sections of the overall plans.</p></speech>

My local authority has been informed that provision is being made by Irish Water for upgrades in five to six years.  If the plant reaches capacity at that point, there will be a need for another phase of planning to expand the system.  That is different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100016#S01200"><p>We are happy to deal with that.  The practice associated with the current model has been traditional, probably because capital became available relatively regularly to design schemes covering a very long period.  It was difficult to get hold of it.  A 20 year design&ndash;build&ndash;operate model is being used because the general practice was to design a plant that would operate for a long period on the basis that one might not get a chance to invest again.  That does not necessarily result in the best value for money, nor does it necessarily result in the lowest operating costs in the system.  As has been explained by the CER, we have a long-term view that maps out a growth and developmental scenario.  Thus, we have plans in place.  We are continuing with our long-term planning so we will be aware of how we will meet demand in five, ten or 15 years.  We are ensuring we are investing across the board in those plants and assets in which it is necessary to invest to secure customer service over the next five or six years.  That model does not require one to plan now for 20 years' time because one knows one can return to the matter again in the event that demand will necessitate it in five, six or seven years.  Obviously, all these projects are subject to a statutory process and planning, but the important point is to get the best result for the customer at the lowest price.  The objective is to do so consistently across the customer base rather than one having to depend on one's being lucky enough to be in an area with a large scheme that might have been put into effect in the past three years.</p></speech>

We want to ensure the company has looked at all of the options, particularly conservation measures - even if it has deferred all or some of these capital investments - and that there is a significant benefit from a consumer point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100017#T00200"><p>My colleague mentioned it, but I also want to refer to the concern about the delivery of water services infrastructure in rural areas.  As there are fewer houses and businesses, it will cost more per unit to deliver a sewage treatment plant in a village.  During the years many smaller towns and villages failed to come up with their polluter pays contribution because the local authority did not have the money when that system was introduced.  They are undeveloped, so to speak; therefore, it makes the case for doing something about the current position.  In my area there are 30 applications to the EPA for discharge licences, but only 15 have been issued.  The other 15 have been pending for quite some time because works are required.  That gives weight to the idea that we need an organisation such as Uisce &Eacute;ireann to fix things.  However, I am unclear on at what point it will state a sewage treatment plant in a certain area is not commercially viable, will not provide a return on investment and that it is over to the Department.  I understand group water schemes come under the heading of rural water, but where will Uisce &Eacute;ireann draw the line in the case of villages?</p><p>  I am familiar with some areas which need upgraded wastewater treatment plants but which are in SACs or NHAs.  Will these areas be given equal priority?  Parts of rural Ireland are heavily designated environmentally.  Shellfish are designated off some coastlines where the local authority is responsible for water quality.  If there is any diminution in that regard, they will be prosecuted.  Will this matter be given priority?  I am not just talking about drinking water.  </p><p>  I also have some questions on pricing.</p></speech>

Scotland has been mentioned, but it has approximately 254 wastewater schemes, while we have well over 1,000.  On the water supply side of things, the position is similar.  Part of the cost challenge is the fact that we have such a dispersed population and so many smaller schemes.  The objective of Irish Water is to apply, as near as we can, consistency of approach and standards for customers, as well as targeting investment on the basis of need to meet service standards.  Many of the smaller schemes would benefit from an approach Irish Water favours, to have frameworks of contractors that can deliver standard unit solutions for small communities, in respect of which there is good potential.  One could deliver ten, 15 or 20 similar typical plants across communities of an appropriate size, while getting good value for money and achieving savings.  We have considerable ideas in that regard.  Equally, we must examine sustainable solutions concerning reed-bed technology.  We need to consider low operating costs and low energy solutions in rural areas for wastewater systems.</p></speech>

Commercial premises are charged for water.  Will it be something similar in the future or will that model change?  Will it be uniform across businesses and households?  It is proposed that households will have a free allocation of water after which they will start to pay.</p><p>  Could existing wastewater treatment plants, not at capacity, benefit from extensions being built?  I am thinking of the number of septic tanks on the outskirts of towns where the only sensible option is to link them with a mains treatment system.  Could a scheme be established across the board to include such households?  People are anxious to do something about their septic tanks.  I can see the benefit in having of such a scheme.  </p><p>  How will Uisce &Eacute;ireann's operations affect public private partnership, design-build-operate or DBO schemes?  How will the current arrangements be affected?  I presume they will not be affected owing to contractual arrangements, but how does Uisce &Eacute;ireann plan to enter into public private partnerships in the future?  As many such contracts operate on a 15 to 20 year basis, will Uisce &Eacute;ireann consider shorter term contracts?  What are the company's plans in that regard?</p></speech>

It had considerable merit in combining the design and technology being offered, with the responsibility to operate it.  Our view is that a 20 year period is probably too long.  We would like to see break clauses more frequently because there are issues of flexibility and being able to deal with change during that 20 year period.  Twenty years is a long time to plan for and build into a contract arrangement.  However, the contracts have worked quite well.</p><p>  We have no particular responsibility for septic tanks and sludge.  It may be that we can provide a service to deal with the treatment of septic sludge transported to some of our sites where we have the capacity to deal with.  That is a service we could probably offer.</p></speech>

We have the delegates in front of us.  I will not be long.  I will ask all of my questions together because they are short.  </p><p>  Reed-bed technology is on the agenda, with conservation and recycling.  Does Mr. Grant make policy to introduce reed-bed technology for water treatment plants, or does it have to come from on high?</p> <p>The paper made a comparison in the delivery of upgrading costs between Thames Water and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Thames Water spent &euro;150,000 on the one system while Uisce &Eacute;ireann did eight systems for the same amount.  I would like this information in written form because it is valuable.  If Uisce &Eacute;ireann can do something for one eighth of what it costs Thames Water, it should be getting a clap on the back rather than a kick in the backside.</p><p> The submission states that Bord G&aacute;is Energy capabilities and systems saved &euro;87 million to date on this project.  Will the delegation give me a detailed written explanation of where that &euro;87 million was saved?</p><p> The water framework directive stipulates that the user pays for the cost of water provision, an onus often directed at the Government.  In Ireland, we essentially do not have a choice about water charges, as a member state must abide by EU directives.  If it did not, it would be fined.  If this happened, would it be Uisce &Eacute;ireann or the Government that paid these fines?</p><p> Commercial water charges vary drastically across the 34 local authorities, from &euro;175 in Kildare to &euro;375 in Wicklow, the dearest.  Will these charges be streamlined by Irish Water?  Will they be averaged?  A domestic allowance of 225 m<sup>3</sup>is available where the water supply is used jointly for domestic and commercial use, but local authorities interpret it differently.  I presume this will be streamlined too.</p><p> If a boil-water notice is in place, will the users affected not be charged?  Will that be the policy, or is it yet to be decided?  When smart meters come on stream, will the ones put in place now be able to communicate with them and not have to be replaced?  I could not find any information on the qualifications required for meter installers and site supervisors.  Are there any recommended training courses for builders who may be interested in such a job and want to improve their skills?</p><p> When does the company expect the codes of practice to be available?  The submission stated that 80% to 85% of costs incurred to date are reasonable.  The delegation stated that the cost-benefit exercise would be completed at a later date.  When will it be completed?  Will the company be able to give the committee details of the exercise to confirm they were reasonable costs?</p><p> Has Bord G&aacute;is Energy calculated what it has saved by having the staff transferred to Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  It is agreed that the Irish name of the company, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, will be used rather than the English form, Irish Water.  However, I note that in the company&rsquo;s submission today the English form is used throughout, when even the Commission for Energy Regulation used the correct form.  As well as that, I note the e-mail address we received from the company secretary of Irish Water, Liam O'Riordan, uses the <i>bge.ie</i>domain.  Why is Uisce &Eacute;ireann not used?  It may not seem important as people do not drink water in Irish or English.  However, the Irish form is used in the legislation and it is important for the Irish language too.</p></speech>

While it would not make sense to change the <i>water.ie</i> domain, all of our stationery and e-mail uses Uisce &Eacute;ireann first.  The reason the <i>bge.ie</i> e-mail was used in correspondence from Liam O&rsquo;Riordan is that we avail of the company&rsquo;s secretariat to share costs.</p><p>  The paper makes it clear how smart meters can be adapted to new technology.</p></speech>

Part of that is the consideration of sustainable solutions within the whole climate change area.  Irish Water/Uisce &Eacute;ireann is one of the highest energy users in the State sector, at between &euro;70 million and &euro;80 million a year alone, which excludes the design, build and operate, DBO, contracts.</p> <p>We would have to play our part in reducing our carbon footprint and bringing down our energy costs.  To do that, we need to look at research and technology opportunities in respect of the basic technologies and how efficiently they work but also, as the Senator says, introducing wetland and breed bed-type technologies.  These have already been very successfully used in some parts of the country.  They are somewhat dependent on the availability of relatively low-cost land and perhaps marginal land but where that is available, they are very good solutions because from our perspective, they reduce operating costs in the long term and are very good from an environmental perspective.  Technology generally, research and in particular looking at energy conservation and management are very important parts of what we want to do.</p></speech>

The question of how charging might pan out if a boil notice is in place has yet to be decided.  We indicated that there would be an issue.  It would seem sensible that where quality is not within reasonable bounds as determined by the EPA, we investigate what rebate, if any, applies.  That has yet to be decided but we will be consulting on that.</p><p>  We will consult on codes of practice and the general structure and format around those in April and a final decision on that is due in June or July.  I can confirm that date for the Senator.  That is the approximate timetable during which we will deal with that.  </p><p>  We said that based on the high-level analysis we carried regarding Uisce &Eacute;ireann's establishment costs, we thought that 80% to 85% of these costs appeared reasonable and could represent value to the Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  We said that this did not mean that the other 15% to 20% of costs are unreasonable but just that it would take further analysis to determine whether or not they were reasonable and that detailed analysis will essentially commence once we receive the detailed submission from Uisce &Eacute;ireann at the end of February.  We then analyse those costs and, ultimately, we will put out a consultation paper that will include our analysis and whether we think all of those costs are reasonable.  That will occur in June.</p></speech>

I am sure the Senator is aware that there are more than 600 different charging arrangements for business so we will be looking at this carefully and will take more time to look at the detail of it.  We want to make sure that we are well aware that when we are making any tariff proposals for non-domestic use, we know the price customers are paying and what price they may be paying under any proposal we may have for changing them to a different tariff regime.  We did this in the past with gas tariffs.  We took a good number of years to sort out what tariffs should be in place so we will take the same approach with water.  We will carry out a lot of analysis and find out what the impact on these consumers would be.  To the extent that there are a large number of charging arrangements for combined domestic and commercial use, we will take a similarly slow and cautious approach to find out the impact of any changes in tariffs.</p><p>  The final question concerned smart meters.  We look after smart meters for gas and electricity.  We are evaluating whether or not to rule them out and the numbers are stacking up.  A number of years ago, we looked at whether water could be included in that process.  We found out at that time that technology was not there to allow that to happen so we are keeping that constantly under review.  As the Senator says, it would be very useful and efficient if at some point in the future, we could combine these programmes.  We will keep our eye on that and see what happens.  </p></speech>

We have certainly learned a lot this afternoon as there has been much clarification.  My first question is to the delegation from the CER.  A number of speakers have spoken about quality of water and how one will charge for that.  In the last round of questions, Senator Keane again asked the question and the response as I understood it was in the context of a rebate in areas with poor water quality.  I know the CER has made no decisions and I am prefacing everything I say on that basis.  The delegation from the CER said earlier that the CER would be liaising with the EPA on this matter.  There has been a boil notice on a continuous basis in Roscommon.  Does the delegation not accept that it would be very difficult to start people off on a metering system where they are told they will get a rebate rather than a reduction or no charge?  I think it would be no charge.  Could the delegation address that issue because it is very significant?  I picked out Roscommon but it affects other parts of the country.</p><p>  The CER presentation referred to benchmarking best international practice.  Benchmarking is based on looking at what is happening in other places and making a decision.  Can the delegation give us some idea of what it is going to start off with?  Deputy Humphreys referred to Scotland and there are other examples of how charging is arrived at in other countries.  Could the delegation tell us what the CER's starting point in this is so we have some idea of where it is coming from?  Does the CER envisage a suite of charges?  The issue was outlined by Deputy Coffey.  What happens in my area where one has water in but no water out or where one has no water in but water out?  Will there be different levels or categories or charges?  I will continue with questions if the Chairman likes.</p></speech>

Has there been any clarification since the last time we were here?</p><p>  A question was asked about whether the water part of development levies collected at local authority level would be spent at local authority level.  The hard reality is that no local authority except perhaps Dublin collected any amount of money in 2013 that would carry out any infrastructural improvement works.  The money is just not there.  In reality, where will that money go?  </p><p>  In respect of the detailed explanation given by Mr. Barry about the charges by IBM, the actual consultancy costs were part of much of the questioning on the last occasion.  We were told we would get a scoping document which set out the breakdown of the charges.  When we were told that, I expected that we have it the next day.  I raised the fact that we still had not received it in the Seanad a couple of days later.  </p> <p>We were supposed to receive a breakdown of the costs for each consultant.  I have not received that information; nor has Deputy Cowen, as the spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is important that we receive a copy of the document for the purpose of clarity and transparency.</p><p> When I asked about the supply of water to Dublin at our last meeting, Mr. Barry pointed out that &euro;67 million had been set aside for the matter.  Has the money been spent and what is being done with it?  I understand that Bord na M&oacute;na has completed much of the preparatory work on the Garryhinch project but the dots have not yet been joined with Dublin City Council, which had assigned 12 staff to work on the project, and Irish Water.  Based on the answers I received at our last meeting I thought we would get specific information on this project, given that the biggest problem Irish Water faces is the lack of capacity in Dublin.  However, the 26-page document we received today did not provide the requested information.  Can the witnesses clarify whether Irish Water is intent on proceeding with the Garryhinch projects?  What are the specific timelines for completing the work outstanding in advance of seeking planning permission?  I understand Bord na M&oacute;na has carried out an environmental impact assessment and is waiting for the Dublin end of the work to be completed.  At a cost of approximately &euro;500 million, this will be the biggest single project for which Irish Water is responsible.</p><p> I am mystified as to the amount of capital investment that is available.  It is either &euro;930 million or &euro;310 million per year.  As Deputy Stanley already went through the figures, I presume the figure is &euro;310 million per year for the next three years.  The documents indicates that between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million will be needed every year to build or repair infrastructure.  If the Garryhinch project will cost &euro;500 million, where does that leave the remainder of the projects?  What is our capacity to attract international investment and how are we setting about to attract it?  The money is clearly not there but the problems in Dublin and the Leinster region will not go away.  How are we going to address that issue?</p><p> In regard to projects like the Fethard-Burncourt scheme in County Tipperary, which has gone to tender, and the Seven Villages scheme in County Waterford, in respect of which a letter of intent has been issued, I have been told by my local authority that it is a matter for Irish Water to complete them.  Mr. Tierney noted that a new point of contact had been established for public representatives.  Will we get the level of information we require from this point of contact, and where are local representatives to find information on schemes and repairs?  Irish Water's website appears to be a work in progress because it is limited in the amount of detailed information provided.  I ask Mr. Tierney to confirm that the website is still a work in progress.</p></speech>

In terms of taking over services, it has been a relatively short period since 1 January but I have given a commitment that we will populate it with as much information as possible.  We will endeavour to provide the level of information required through the point of contact for public representatives, including the up-to-date position in regard to decisions on projects.  We will also be gradually taking over complaints from 1 April and members will be advised about the takeover point.</p><p>  The capital investment plan sets out the figures we project will available to us.  If more money becomes available, whether by subvention or otherwise, we will gratefully take it to invest in additional improvements and works in the system.  We are trying to build up to a level so that we will have the money required when it comes time for the heavy expenditure on schemes such as the Shannon to Dublin project.</p></speech>

Over the coming five or six years we will have to meet ongoing needs for water in Dublin.  We are aware of how tight capacity is at present and we are seeking to maximise the output of the Liffey plants at Leixlip and Ballymore Eustace.  This means finishing out our current investment in Leixlip and making further investments in Ballymore Eustace and in pipelines to transport the water to where we need it.  That will generate additional water, which will help us.  It is even more critical that we get to grips with leakage to a greater degree.  This will require a regional approach to develop leakage management capacity, leakage zone priorities, intensive find-and-fix repairs, automation of pressure management and replacement of mains.  Based on information gathered through the metering project, we hope to target customer-side losses.  The evidence of metering thus far indicates that 5% to 6% of households use considerably more water than normal usage patterns would suggest.  All of these measures will help us to stay ahead of demand and we have a fair idea of the demand load we will be facing over the next five or six years.</p><p>  During that period we will be working on the major source of water for Dublin.  This involves a statutory process which is currently ongoing.  We have a team working on the process.  It involves an environmental impact assessment stage which must evaluate all options objectively on the basis of environmental, technical and economic criteria.  The final outcome of that assessment will be delivered later this year as a preferred scheme, which will be developed further with a view to going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the end of 2015.  We have assumed that the oral hearings and decision making with An Bord Plean&aacute;la will last through 2016 and, assuming we can anticipate a successful outcome, we will be in the design and procurement phase in 2017 and early 2018, with a view to delivering water to Dublin towards the end of 2020.</p></speech>

First, on quality, the point I made earlier was it would seem sensible that if customers are not receiving a complete service they would not then be expected to pay the complete charge.  However, we have yet to consult on the details of how that actually will pan out in reality.  Consequently, I am unable to give the Senator a clear yes-or-no statement <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> charges.  I can state that we will consult on what are the acceptable limits with regard to quality, as it applies to the water that is delivered and the wastewater service that is achieved.  We also will consult on what will be the ramifications for water charges once such limits are not met.  All of this has yet to be decided and we will engage in consultations on it.</p><p>  On what best international practice actually means, it is a fairly complex area but ultimately, costs vary significantly from country to country depending on various issues such as demographics and population densities and so on.  For example, across Europe right now, a typical customer in Denmark spends &euro;670 per year on water charges, whereas in Scotland the equivalent figure is approximately &euro;390 per year.  However, these amounts hide the consumption level per customer, what level of investment has been carried out or whether there has been any catch-up in the various countries concerned.  Consequently, many factors must be taken into consideration, and so we look for the nearest comparators we can find.  We will consider countries such as Scotland as well as possibly considering regional water authorities in England and Wales that may have a similar distribution of population density and demographics.  Ultimately, however, there will not be an exact match and, as a result, we will take the best available information we have on both the establishment of utilities and their operation.  We will take and use that information to assess whether we think the costs Uisce &Eacute;ireann has incurred are reasonable, whether they benchmark well or whether they are excessive.  It is only after having carried out such analysis that we can then form a judgment and therefore decide whether to allow that cost, or what level of cost should be allowed.</p><p>  As for the suite of charges, I again must preface this by stating that no decisions have been made and all of this will be subject to consultation.  To revert to a previous question from a member on the water-in water-out principle, it probably is worth noting that we know from other countries that the amount of water that actually is consumed for drinking purposes is low; I believe it is between 5% and 10%.  Generally speaking, there is a high correlation between the amount of water that enters a property and the amount that leaves through wastewater.  However, that is one of the factors we would take into account.  As a minimum, we will have at least two charges.  One will be a meter charge and one will be an assessed, non-metered charge.  However, in our consultations, we will set out whether there are various options for metered charges, such as a fixed charge element and a variable charge element.  On the assessed charge, we may consider different factors that might be taken into account before one's charge is determined, such as occupancy levels, house size or whatever.  However, we have yet to determine that, and it all will be subject to public consultation.</p></speech>

Mr. McGowan mentioned earlier that the Minister could issue instructions to the CER in respect of Irish Water.  Would that be usual in terms of ministerial responsibilities?  My second question pertains to the European Union's Water Framework Directive and Ireland's responsibilities regarding the quality of its water and its effluent management.  What is the current position in respect of Ireland's water standards?  Could Ireland potentially be subjected to European Union fines and, if so, how much might we be fined if we do not get our act together?</p><p>  I have a further question on the procurement rules for those who tender for contracts to do some work for Irish Water, such as the water maintenance and support work that would have been carried out on behalf of the local authorities in the past.  Media reports in my constituency have stated that a company that was supplying this type of work to Offaly County Council did not obtain a contract.  What is the position with regard to procurement?  Clearly, one does not seek job losses as a result of changes that are being made.</p><p>  On personal water consumption and people's individual responsibilities to reduce the amount of water they are using, I note that Ireland's consumption rate, at 150 litres per day, is among the highest, if not the highest, in Europe.  While metering obviously will make a difference in this regard, what are Irish Water's plans regarding public information, working with schools and so on?  Are any such activities in train?  This will be of great importance in the future.</p><p>  I will not raise the Garryhinch project as Senator Landy has covered it fairly comprehensively, but I was curious as to whether Irish Water foresees a future for itself in the field of rainwater harvesting.  Given all this rain falling out of the heavens, there is potential for Ireland as a nation to use it and to give it to other countries that might need it.  Could such activities potentially come within the remit of Irish Water in the future?</p></speech>

We carried out a number of competitions to put people onto different framework contracts, such as the one mentioned by the Deputy, as well as others pertaining to chemicals, repair and maintenance and CCTV and sewer jetting.  People submitted their applications to go on those frameworks and if one takes the totality of those companies which were invited and the numbers of tenders received, we had a success rate of approximately 80%.  However, on the point mentioned by the Deputy, we received communications back from the existing supply base to the effect that they could not get on or whatever.  We found in the first instance that it was very difficult to contact some of the suppliers and, second, when we put them through the assessment they were failing on some health and safety regulations.  Bearing that in mind, we put in place a particular health and safety specialist to assist them with their documentation to get them onto the frameworks.  Thereafter, we wrote to the local authorities stating that if an entity had a contract with the local authority, either formal or informal, we would honour that contract if we could see the paperwork or if we received verbal notification from the local authority that it existed.  We stated that as long as a supplier passed the minimum health and safety requirements, we were happy to allow that supplier to continue to do business with the local authority, which could then draw down that service as required.  This has proved to be quite successful, but ultimately we seek to reach a point at which we have a competitive supply base with frameworks in place from which Irish Water and the local authorities can draw down for the services they require.</p> <p>For example, we have 6,000 or 7,000 suppliers.  Recently we wrote to 3,000 of them asking them if they wanted to get on the supply base or the framework and we received a response from 10% of them.  They are either not interested or they are not contactable.  I assure the Deputy that we have made every effort.   In some cases we have gone back to people three or four times to see if they want to be included in the supply base bearing in mind that we were conscious that we wanted continuity in the supply base, which is equally important for continuity of service.</p></speech>

However, it has brought out a blueprint for implementation precisely because many countries, like Ireland, are struggling to achieve compliance.  In 2009, we adopted a river basin management plan for the period to 2009-2015 to be followed by other plans.  Within the plan, we had considerable ambitions around water quality achievement and much of that has not happened because of the lack of funding and the fact that we have not been able to keep up with the programme.  We are in some difficulty and a letter of formal notice issued to Ireland, which will result in fines without any action from our side.  However, the Department has responded to Brussels and we have worked with the Department to put together a response to that along the lines of setting out a commitment we will make in terms of what is achievable and reasonable.  This means making choices around schemes and discharges that will deliver the maximum benefit to the environment in the short term within what we can afford.  Clearly, there will be an element of toing and froing on this but, hopefully, we will arrive at a position, although I cannot predict this, where we will have an agreed plan, which Europe can live with and accept and which will represent our best endeavour to meet compliance.  It is certainly a significant risk for the country at the moment and the key to it will be that we set out a plan that we intend to deliver and then deliver it and live up to it.</p><p>  There is a second piece to that around how we engage in the drawing up of future river basin management plans because there is a new plan to be developed up to 2021.   It is important that we have all the objective information on catchment water quality to put the right measures into that plan rather than setting standards that are unnecessarily high.  Clearly, we have the objective of good water quality but it has to be conditioned on what is proportionate, what is the cost of compliance with a particular standard and what standard will be required to meet the objective.  Irish Water can bring a lot more information, evidence and technical engagement with the EPA to that discussion and that will be valuable in saving costs that would not deliver the benefit.</p><p>  There is a good deal of discussion around rainwater harvesting and clearly it has some potential and it can be incentivised both by grants and the opportunity to reduce costs for water.  The difficulty is that it is probably only practical on the basis of incorporation into new builds because it would cost a lot to retrofit such a system in existing housing stock and, therefore, the take-up of rainwater harvesting is likely to be relatively slow and likely to make a relatively small impact.  However, I would like to confirm that we have engaged with schools and are getting involved in a schools information programme, which is important.  We will also have a great deal of other information coming through in terms of water conservation in the home, tips on best practice and so on.  The Deputy is correct that in the context of bringing in charges, we hope to get a dividend of at least a 10% reduction in household water usage and that will make an important contribution to meeting requirements and will allow us to defer investment we would otherwise require in the coming five of six years.</p></speech>

For example, the water legislation includes provision for a ministerial direction as does our energy legislation.  It is probably fair to say what we are facing in water is not the usual situation.  We have a new utility start-up and State subvention and it may well be that the likelihood of ministerial direction is higher in regard to water but this is certainly not an uncommon feature of the legislative landscape.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100022#Y00500"><p>It was stated that the goal is that Irish Water want clean, quality affordable water and I agree with the officials on that but at the moment there is not clean or quality water where I come from and once the company starts charging people, we will not have affordable water either.  I am, therefore, a little worried about the future.</p><p>  Members have asked if people cannot drink the water in their homes, will they have to pay for it?  However, the position is worse.  Not only can people not drink it but they have to stand over their children to make sure they use bottled water when they brush their teeth.  The children in my town, Castlerea, regularly have stomach aches way in excess of what to me was the norm years ago because try as one might, children will run for the tap.  We live in fear that they will go near the product Irish Water is delivering to our houses.  Reference was made to the company putting infrastructure and systems in place.  The same structure will be in place and there will be an umbrella over it called Irish Water.  That was obvious in the past while but it became even more obvious when Councillor John Murphy from Castlerea contacted the company about the water supply.  He received a letter stating Irish Water took "responsibility for water services on 1 January 2014.  As the agents of Irish Water, the local authorities will continue to operate the Castlerea schemes on our behalf as well as working with Irish Water to resolve the problem".  If we end up with the same system to monitor water, how will that solve our problem?</p><p>  I do not know if the officials are aware of this but I imagine they are.  If not, it is terrifying to think that they have missed it.  When people see polluted water, they are meant to go the EPA.  When I contacted the agency, it instructed Roscommon County Council to investigate the problem.  Irish Water says the council will continue to operate the Castlerea schemes.  Where are our assurances that the water quality will improve?  If one reports a problem, the council will get to investigate itself.  What will change in the system?</p><p>  It is bad enough that when one goes to the EPA, the agency then goes back to the local authority but I am sure the officials are aware of the pollution An Taisce has highlighted over the past week in a so-called SAC lake in Glenamaddy, County Galway.  Raw sewage was being pumped into the lake.  The EPA is aware of this and it was known by the agency as far as back as June 1997.  The An Taisce report referred to Galway County Council's attempt to consider alternative sewage disposal options for several years but almost five years since the application, the problem remains and the EPA is yet to make a decision.  Irish Water is the umbrella group for this disaster and the company will supposedly deliver drinking water to us.  How is this possible?  The officials talked about the system changing but it will not.  The company will continue to work with local authorities.  The public made the State's agencies well aware that raw sewage was being dumped in a lake in Glenamaddy.  Members of the local turf cutting committee stood in front of Mr. Justice Quirke, a former High Court judge, and informed him that this was going on but nothing happened.  What magic will the officials employ to change that?</p><p>  The urban water in my town scheme is the subject of a boil water notice now as well as the rural water scheme.  Families are spending on average &euro;500 a year on water.  When one has to use water to brush one's teeth, one has to use a lot of it.</p> <p>If Irish Water cannot provide us with drinking water, will it buy this water for us?  Someone will have to provide it for us and at the moment that is not happening.  The local authority on which Irish Water is relying has advised us that it is responsible for providing the water but it is not responsible for it being polluted.  What hope would that give us?  How will things change under that system?</p><p> Rainwater harvesting has been mentioned.  Those who install a rainwater harvesting system will end up using less water from the mains.  Will that not put up the price of water for everyone who does not have a rainwater harvesting system?  From what I have heard about what Irish Water is planning to do, if people do not use enough water and they save water, the price of the unit will need to go up.  I cannot see how this will help environmentally and from many other points of view.</p><p> The CER has advised that the charging scheme will be decided in June.  Why does Irish Water not inform people before the local elections?  Has Irish Water gone political now?  We heard that there are a number of key dates.  As far as I can see there is only one key date, 23 May.  That is made even clearer in the letter sent to Mr. John Murphy.  The answer to the question as to when Irish Water would know what will do with my drinking water was two months' time.  So it will have news for the local elections, but after the local elections the urgency will be gone and we will be back to going down to the supermarket to get water.  All the supermarkets in Castlerea now have bigger drinking water sections than they have alcohol sections, which is some achievement.  The problem will not be solved.</p><p> On the previous occasion representatives from Irish Water appeared before the committee, I was told I was not allowed to bring up previous experiences of people who were running this organisation.  However, today we have heard about the previous experience of other employees of Irish Water and how they need to be well paid, etc.  While we are going on about previous experiences, can we please deal with this issue?  Efficiency was mentioned.  The head of Irish Water is described as-----</p></speech>

The primary reason for setting up Irish Water was to take the system from where it is and use the utility model to bring about change in the system so that issues regarding the quality of water that the Deputy mentioned in areas of Roscommon are dealt with, building on some of the decisions that have already been taken regarding projects to be done down there.  I will ask Mr. Grant to outline in detail our approach to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021100023#Z03600"><p>The water quality issues being experienced in Roscommon reflect that many of the water supply systems were originally developed from groundwater schemes, partly reflecting that these are very good quality water sources in most cases.  However, in situations of high run-off in winter conditions, they are prone to bacterial and microbiological infection.  The necessary barriers were not put in when the schemes were installed and therefore they are wide open in that situation.</p><p>  In a general sense Irish Water is absolutely committed to what are known as water safety plans for every water scheme in the country.  Water safety plans start with the source and finish at the tap.  That means policing the sources in order to minimise the risk of degradation of drinking water, then providing a minimum level of barrier within the treatment or production part of the cycle and then following it through in distribution so that the reservoirs, pipelines and so on do not allow for recontamination.</p><p>  I fully acknowledge that a number of schemes are on the books and ready to be started by Roscommon County Council.  These are proceeding and obviously the Boyle scheme is well in hand.  The Kileglin plant is also about to start or has started on site.  We are absolutely committed to getting people who are on current boil notices off them in the shortest possible time.  We will do that by putting in appropriate treatment.  In the case of the Kileglin plant we are working with the contractor to try to accelerate the programme on that.  We are now looking as a matter of urgency to see how we can get a plant as quickly as possible into Castlerea because that situation is as unacceptable to us as it is to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Clearly we will not be funded to carry out water services if we cannot deliver water to the required standard.</p><p>  Regarding operations, we will do whatever it takes.  Part of the general contribution of Irish Water will be to have capability regionally and centrally in process optimisation, in the training, in the auditing of plants and in ensuring that plants are run correctly.  It is very difficult for individual local authorities to have those capabilities in-house on a county-by-county basis.  That is particularly true in a county such as Roscommon, which did not have much sophisticated treatment for the reason I mentioned - originally those water sources did not require much treatment and therefore there was no tradition of providing treatment.  We have been and are using outsourcing DBO contracts and a number of the Roscommon contracts are ten-year DBOs, which means the contractor will continue to operate under our supervision.</p><p>  Our annual service plans under the SLA with the local authorities will set out for every county objectives to be met each year, in terms of improving quality and delivering transformation and efficiency.</p><p>  We have many mechanisms in place.  Irish water will make a difference through all those mechanisms, but in the first instance in investing where drinking water is not up to scratch is our top priority.</p></speech>

It was a temporary solution but a solution nonetheless.  I know about the specific engineering problem in Boyle, but it does not arise in Castlerea or Kileglan Springs in south Roscommon.  Why can people in Castlerea and south Roscommon not have a temporary solution, pending introduction of a long-term solution, as in the case of the Roscommon central supply?</p></speech>

Where we have schemes in progress on site and know a solution is imminent within 12 months, we are driving on with them because it would probably take that length of time to procure a temporary plan and have it commissioned on site.  In Castlerea, where no contractor has been commissioned, we are examining whether we can put in place a temporary plant.  We need to have it sized properly and figure out requirements.  The treatment requirements are not the same from scheme to scheme.  Ultraviolet radiation can work in some cases but in others we need coagulation filtration.  We need to know what the answer is and will then set about doing it.  If we can put in place a temporary skid mounted plant, we will do so, but even this takes a certain length of time.  One must investigate and solve the problem and go through a procurement process, build the plant, get it to the site and undertake the ground works.  In the case of the Kileglan and Boyle schemes, it will be quicker to put in place the permanent scheme, as the contractor is working on the ground.</p></speech>

A temporary scheme, including the procurement process, was put in place in Roscommon central within eight or nine weeks.  It was expedited within the Department.  I cannot understand why this cannot be done in Castlerea and Kileglan, pending introduction of the full treatment plant in however number of months it will take.  People should not have to tolerate boil notices continuing for 12 or 18 months, or three years in the case of Castlerea.</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, said in the House prior to Christmas that Irish Water should not be allowed to charge for water supplies subject to restrictions on health grounds.  In its evidence today the regulator stated the new charging regime would not be agreed to before August and that it would be a number of years before issues regarding commercial users would be resolved.  In the interim, as a measure of good faith, will Irish Water ensure commercial users of water who are charged for water which is unsafe to drink will have these charges removed?  We are speaking about a relatively small number of commercial users such as restaurants, bars and food and drink suppliers in the affected areas.  Will Irish Water give an assurance that commercial users will not be charged for water where they spend a huge amount of money on replacement ice and water supplies?</p></speech>

My next question is for Irish Water and the regulator.  When the roll-out of meters is complete, approximately 30% of households in the country will not have a water meter.  These are houses in rural areas, apartments and houses in urban areas with multiple connections to the same water supply.  How will water and user charges be calculated in these cases?  It is unfair for people to be charged based on usage in some areas, while people in other areas are penalised because of geographical location.  How is it intended to address this issue?</p><p>  Mr. McGowan has stated costs and charges will be benchmarked against best international practice.  What is the international practice in charging for water which is unfit for human consumption?  Are people charged for it?  It is a simple question to which people want to know the answer.  Will they be charged for water which is unsafe to drink?  What is the position where the supply is inadequate?  Deputy Paudie Coffey mentioned water pressure which is not suitable for showers, washing machines and dishwashers.  Should people be charged for a water supply which is significantly insufficient to meet their basic needs?</p><p>  Ms Mannion addressed the issue of water in and water out.  I would like a definitive answer on the issue of water in and water out, or pay as one flushes, which is what it seems will be introduced.  In this room 12 months ago I questioned the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on this specific issue.  He stated people would not be charged for flushing toilets or water out.  I specifically raised the issue on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 19 December and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, interrupted me to state the water out provision would apply only to commercial premises.  The evidence we have heard today from the regulator is that there will be a charge for water out; therefore, a flushing tax will be introduced as part of the water charges to be levied.  I want a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer.  I can see the merits, but there are conflicting messages from the Minister, Government policy and the regulator.  Will there be a water out charge and how will it be calculated as a percentage of the water in charge?</p></speech>

An individual has a property that is broken into four apartments.  He is paying property tax on each apartment, for example, a total of &euro;800 per year.  He wants to install a water meter in each apartment and is willing to pay for them.  From my telephone inquiries with Irish Water, however, my understanding is that there will only be one water meter per property with a flat charge applied to the four sub-properties.  As a landlord, he does not believe that will work because it will lead to disputes between tenants who believe that one should pay more than the other.  It seems perfectly reasonable that, if an individual pays property tax, he or she should be able to get a water meter.  What is the witnesses' opinion on that?</p></speech>

Regarding Deputy Timmins's question, we have done some pilot work on apartments in respect of a second phase of metering.  There may be the potential to install meters in approximately 120,000 of the 290,000 or so units.  It will have a cost, but we have presented our proposals to the Department.  If a property has four separate supplies, they can be facilitated.  It could also be done in a common area.  As Mr. Grant explained, the supply to some apartments can come from three sources, each serving a different purpose.</p><p>  Regarding Deputy Humphreys's question, 5% is the estimate for leaks on the customer's side.  The first fix policy has not been decided by the Government yet.  The intention was to produce it so that people would have a period within which to assess their usage and take advantage of the policy.  Permanent reinstatement is done under the contract.</p><p>  Most of Deputy Naughten's questions were to the CER.</p></speech>

This is probably what the Minister was referring to, namely, the section 16 charge.  Otherwise, the charge relates to water in, water out.  If one does not have water in or water out, one will only pay for whatever service one is receiving.</p></speech>

The Minister and Minister of State have told the committee twice that there will not be an additional charge for wastewater treatment for properties that are on public sewers.  This is the specific question that I put to them.</p></speech>

The charge will be applied on the basis of water in despite there being two supplies.  If properties do not have a water out service, they should only be charged for water in.  This is our approach.  If a property only has a sewage service, it will only be charged for that.</p></speech>

It will measure the water that enters the property.  As Mr. Tierney mentioned, the cost of the provision of clean water and the treatment of wastewater must be covered.  Some people have both a water supply and wastewater services whereas others only have one or the other.  Therefore, we must devise a fair charging structure that deals with all of these scenarios.  International experience tends to show that the bulk of the water entering a property exits it through a wastewater treatment service if there happens to be one.  The charging system should reflect this.  If, for example, the cost is split 50:50, there would be an identifiable charge for water in and another for water out.  How this is presented in a bill is yet to be determined, but it stands to reason that we must determine a water in charge and a water out charge in order to put a fair system of charging in place for all customers.  The only caveat is that the nuances and how it will work will be subject to public consultation.  We are also subject to ministerial direction.  That could happen.

I welcome members and witnesses to this meeting this afternoon.  I welcome Ms Magdalen Rogers, development manager of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, Professor Orla Hardiman, professor of neurology and head of the academic unit of neurology, Trinity College, who also is a consultant neurologist at Beaumont Hospital, Dr. Colin Doherty, consultant neurologist at St. James's Hospital and Mr. Jim Lawless, who is attending as an advocate.

Before we commence, I will remind witnesses concerning privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing ruling of the Chair and parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Ms Rogers to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

It is the only national umbrella dedicated to representing issues affecting this population, which is estimated to be more than 700,000 people in Ireland.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland has played a significant role in developing the policy agenda for neurological health services in this country.  It represents the interests of patients and patient organisations on a wide range of fora.</p><p>  There are a number of characteristics of neurological care in Ireland.  They include long waiting lists for access to neuro-specialists, including for diagnosis.  In addition, multidisciplinary care is hampered by extremely stretched and under-resourced teams, where they exist, as in some neurology centres there is little access to multidisciplinary support.  Moreover, community aftercare and rehabilitation is extremely under-resourced and underdeveloped.  There is only one specialised neuro-rehabilitation community team established in Ireland, working in the mid-west region.  All these characteristics combine to result in access to neurological care that falls far below what should be expected in a developed country.  There is a largely disjointed and unco-ordinated approach in this country for those who require neurological care and neuro-rehabilitation.  Individuals and families require services on a continuum basis, due to the nature and often the complexity of the neurological conditions with which they are living.  The current service delivery model is largely episodic, almost exclusively medical in nature and does not reflect or meet the real needs.  This is costly and ineffective, not good practice and incredibly frustrating for patients and families.</p><p>  Our presentation today concentrates on community aftercare and neuro-rehabilitation.  Access to neuro-rehabilitation services was highlighted in a case reported on just two weeks ago in the health supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i>, in which a victim of traumatic brain injury was informed there was a four-month waiting list for one of three high-dependency beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH.  The then clinical lead of the national rehabilitation medicine programme made the following statement in an interview with the<i> Irish Medical Times</i> in 2011:<blockquote>There are insufficient numbers of rehabilitation medicine consultants, insufficient access to specialist rehabilitation at a local level, lack of support for primary care teams in managing very challenging cases and lack of support for the patient and their families.  Even if a patient has been through the services of the NRH, once they get discharged they&rsquo;re very often left in a kind of limbo.</blockquote>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland carried out a national survey in 2013 asking patients and family members about their access to neuro-rehabilitation services.  The results highlighted the critical issue of access to therapies in the community as 40% could not access neuropsychology services and 25% could not access physiotherapy or occupational therapy services to meet their needs.</p><p>  It is difficult to propose comprehensive solutions to the complex and wide-ranging challenges affecting neurological care in Ireland in the scope of this brief presentation.  However, it is clear that steps must be taken to address the critical lack of aftercare services for people after diagnosis or onset of a neurological condition.  There are salient points which can be made in this regard this evening.  First, Ireland could address a critical issue in respect of neuro-rehabilitation by putting in place the community neuro-rehabilitation teams recommended in the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy published by the Government in 2011.  To date, there is only one such team in the mid-west.  The steady erosion of community-based therapy provision and the lack of new investment will significantly hamper the establishment of those teams.  Case management is essential for those with complex needs, such as people with acquired brain injury, to avoid the type of disjointed care experienced by these individuals.</p> <p>Cuts in community health services are critically impacting on people with neurological conditions who are among the most dependent on such supports.  Cuts to home care packages are forcing people to stay in acute units or to be discharged home with inadequate care.  Either way it leads to long-term pressure on the acute system.</p><p> The medical card is a vital portal to services for those with chronic illness.  Not having a medical card excludes people with neurological conditions from many of these supports.  Ireland is uniquely reliant on not-for-profit organisations to provide neurological health services that are normally provided by the state in other jurisdictions.  The reality is that the infrastructure of community-based neurological care is hugely reliant on the services provided by patient organisations.  Disability organisations have seen a 15% drop in funding in recent years and many have had to close or curtail services to people with neurological conditions.</p><p> The message which we want members of the committee to take from our presentation is that community aftercare for people with a neurological condition in Ireland has historically been underdeveloped and under-resourced and well below what is routinely available in other countries; and the services that are in place are being decimated by cuts to community health services which are significantly affecting the quality of care available for people with neurological conditions in this country.</p></speech>

I have been reflecting on how things have changed since my first submission over a decade ago.  At that time the main problem that we had was that there was a severe shortage of neurologists.  I am pleased to say that we have had a substantial increase in the number of consultants since that time &ndash; our numbers have increased from 11 when I was first appointed in 1996 to 34 currently in post.  We have also had in improvement in the distribution of neurologists.  There was a major problem when I started but there is now a service in all regions of the country, albeit still limited in some areas, such as the north west.  However, as we came from a very low base, the increase in the number of neurologist from 11 to 34 has uncovered a huge unmet need within the community.  It must also be noted that our understanding of the brain has also improved considerably in the past decade, and that we now have new treatments for many conditions - ultiple sclerosis and stroke come to mind - that can have a spectacular impact on the course of illness, and both quality of life and survival for those affected.  That has of course had a big impact on the type of work that neurologists do.  Our role in previous generations might have been to provide accurate diagnoses - the term was "diagnose and adios" - but we are now integral members of multidisciplinary teams that provide long-term care and life-sustaining treatments for patients.</p><p>  In the context of how we are doing with regard to the number of neurologists we have improved but there is still scope for considerable expansion.  To provide a truly responsive service, we would need to build both on the numbers of neurologists, and in particular in the numbers of neurologists with an interest in stroke, but perhaps more important, we need to build effective, highly professional multidisciplinary teams including other professionals such as nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians, social workers and many other professionals that make up the team.</p><p>  That brings me to the main thrust of what I would like to address today.  There are really two main points that I would like to make that I think members, as our elected representatives, can address on our behalf.  The two points are linked but I will discuss them separately.  The first is about consistency and accountability within the HSE, and the very poor communication and delays in decision making that we all encounter.  I have attached for the information of committee members extracts from a transcript provided to me by one of my patients.  Some of the details have been changed slightly to preserve anonymity, but I can assure members of their authenticity.  I will not read it out but it is available.  The person concerned, and many others in a similar situation, was trying to establish the status of their medical card.  I am sorry to say that their interaction with the HSE would be better placed in a script from &ldquo;Irish Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;, or "Little Britain" rather than real life.  It is truly horrifying and I am sorry to say that it is not unique.  The extract probably encapsulates how we treat our fellow citizens in a far more effective way than anything I can say to the committee.</p><p>  We are told that people are provided with medical cards on the basis of a means test, but that some people with severe and progressive illness can apply for medical cards on discretionary grounds on the basis of hardship.  We are told that the HSE, on the instruction of the Department of Health, interprets &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; in a narrow financial context.  We are told that such discretionary applications are reviewed by a medical board, and that a formula is used to determine whether the likely hardship encountered by the patient meets a certain threshold that would qualify for a discretionary card.  We are also told that the eligibility is subject to review and re-review.  We would like to know how this formula works.  We would like to see exactly how financial hardship is measured, exactly what formula is used and how it is applied.  We would also like to know why some people with clear evidence of progressive neurological disability, supported by many letters and other documentary evidence, are regularly subjected to review of their eligibility, sometimes as frequently as at six-month intervals.  We would like to see how the system works because it should be transparent, reproducible, and open to scrutiny.  We would like to be able to then challenge the decisions with our own models, based on sound health economic analysis, that show that it is actually more cost effective to give people with progressive and disabling neurological conditions access to community services free of charge, than to make them pay for inferior poorly co-ordinated services in the private sector, and by doing so drive them back into the hospital system.</p><p>  The second point is about joined-up thinking.  I and my colleagues such as Dr. Colin Doherty work in major teaching hospitals.  These are subjected to HSE-driven targets.  That is understandable because we have long waiting lists for some specialties including neurology.  Reducing waiting lists is very important.  Nobody should have to wait for nine to 12 months for a specialist opinion.  Part of the problem is that the number of available neurologists, and other professionals such as nurse specialists, is still lower than it should be for the size and expectations, which are increasing, of our population.</p><p>  We also have some concerns in how we are currently asked to reduce our waiting lists because we believe that it is damaging our ability to take care of people with neurological illness.  The HSE has asked us to prioritise new patients and to reduce the numbers of patients returning to our clinics but at the same time we are under greater pressure to follow return patients as their disease progresses, particularly those on expensive drugs that require surveillance such as MS.  Indeed, we are now required to reissue hi-tech prescriptions every six months.  How can we do that if we are not allowed to review patients receiving the drugs?  How can we discharge people to community-based services that do not exist, and even if they do, that they cannot access because they have been denied a medical card?  I do not need to remind members that cut-backs in health are biting really hard.  As Ms Rogers mentioned, many primary care teams exist only on paper, and essential posts are vacant for months on end.  The maximum number of hours available within the community for essential services to those with disabilities has been radically cut back.  For many patients attending the neurology clinics in our hospitals is the only way by which they can continue to access any sort of service that is relevant to their needs.</p><p>  As for what we would like members as our elected representatives to do about the situation, first, I and my colleagues would like the committee to recognize that the one-size-fits-all model that the HSE applies does not work in neurology.  Our role in continuing to care for people with chronic neurological disease must be valued.  In neurology, the returning patient must be recognised as equally important as the new patient in the HSE metric.</p><p>  Of course, we need to reduce waiting lists, but the policy of excessive prioritisation of new patients over return patients, as required by the HSE, is bad for our fellow citizens.  We recognise that our models of care must change and they are changing.  Some of the shortages in neurologists could be addressed by building capacity in collaboration with other professional groups.  We have had some major successes in this regard, as evidenced by the epilepsy programme where the model of care includes highly trained nurse practitioners with extensive clinical expertise.  Dr. Doherty will speak about the experience in that regard.  However, for us to provide a responsive, cost effective and valuable service, we need joined-up thinking with a strong emphasis on accountability within the HSE.  I refer to simple accountability such as accountability on how medical cards are delivered.</p><p>  We must remember that there is a continued role for specialist clinics in hospitals, while at the same time we must strive to build really effective multidisciplinary neurorehabilitative services, as outlined by Ms Rogers, that are both patient-friendly and that link expertise within the hospitals with high-functioning neurorehabilitative service within the community.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to present a perspective on the state of care for epilepsy patients in Ireland.</p> <p>Yesterday was European Epilepsy Day and it is therefore timely that we have been given this opportunity to present our work.  I will outline the progress made in the national epilepsy care programme over the last three to four years and underline the significant challenges that remain to be overcome.</p><p> Epilepsy is a chronic disease characterized by unpredictable, sometimes lifelong, seizures.  The condition affects about one in every 100 people and is second only to stroke as the most common chronic neurological disorder in Europe.  Of the 40,000 sufferers in Ireland only about 70% are well controlled on medication, leaving about 12,000 to 15,000 people who have regular breakthrough seizures and are in regular contact with secondary and tertiary hospital services.  The condition is responsible for about 6,000 hospital admissions per year in Ireland, more than 95% of which are through the emergency room.  The condition kills about 130 people per year.  International evidence suggests that there is significant variance in care for patients presenting with seizures at the emergency interface and that too many patients are being admitted when often they could safely receive care and advice and rapid follow-up as an outpatient. </p><p> The national epilepsy care programme, under the direction of the office of clinical strategy and programmes has been charged with improving access to expert care and information, improving the quality of care and shifting care where possible from expensive hospital-based care to the community.  The core of the plan to deliver these objectives is to address each aspect of care with different care pathways.  The first is managed primary care which will be delivered by general practitioners working with practice nurses and with the guidance of epilepsy advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, in every region in the country, who will manage stable patients with epilepsy in the community and who will guide others though the health system, providing them with the resources for self-management and contact and referral information for expert care.  Some contractual issues need to be resolved before widespread uptake in primary care of this pathway.  </p><p> The second aspect is the development of six regional epilepsy centres nationally - four adult centres and two paediatric centres.  These will be staffed by epilepsy experts from a nursing background who will be the main contact within the community services.  Working in tandem with medical consultants, they will begin providing rapid access service for epilepsy patients, telephone, e-mail and web-based advice.  In time, they will provide outreach services to secondary care hospitals, maternity hospitals, residential intellectual disability services and primary care centres.   At present every region in the country has, to a greater or lesser extent, access for epilepsy services with these nurses in place everywhere except from HSE south.  The national epilepsy care programme and the HSE have provided funding for the seven additional nursing staff required to deliver the programme but for unclear reasons, nothing has happened.  At Cork University Hospital a sum of &euro;500,000 has been invested in equipment that is awaiting staff.  <br /><b></b>The third pathway is the use of an integrated care pathway, administered though emergency departments and acute medical admissions units whereby front-line doctors and nurses will use an evidence-based protocol to help with management of patients who present to hospitals with seizures.  An early version of the pathway has been in use in St. James&rsquo;s since 2009 and we have published a research paper showing significant reductions in admission rates, length of stay, readmission and follow-up time by the use of the pathway. <br />Finally, the 15% of highly complex epilepsy patients who need to be assessed for possible epilepsy surgery will be dealt with by expanding the pre-surgical evaluation beds in Ireland from four - two adult and two paediatric - to ten - two paediatric and eight adult.  These beds will be spread over three sites - two paediatric beds in the new national paediatric hospital, four adult beds in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin and four in Cork University Hospital.  Last Friday the Minister opened the state of the art, fully functional and staffed epilepsy monitoring unit in Beaumont Hospital.  This investment of capital and staff is the first such development since 1982 and is most welcome.  A similar investment in equipment has been made in CUH but again, without staff, it will remain idle and without action will become obsolete. </p><p> The opportunity for and necessity of using health care data and information intelligently has never been greater.  The information generated from health care data is an essential tool in the transformation of health care, which aims to improve quality, safety and efficiency of patient care.  The epilepsy programme is a leader nationally with the implementation and use of the award winning epilepsy electronic patient record, EPR<b>, </b>in a number of regional epilepsy centres including University Hospital Limerick, University College Hospital Galway and St. James&rsquo;s, Beaumont and Connolly hospitals in Dublin.  This secure web-based EPR is facilitating the sharing and exchange of clinical information across traditional organisational boundaries.  The epilepsy EPR is currently seeking an industry partner through a Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, funding model for further developments over the next five years to the tune of &euro;250,000. </p><p> The national epilepsy care programme has a ten-year vision for the transformation of epilepsy care in Ireland.  The aim is to provide the best value care for all people with epilepsy in the right place, at the right time, sharing the best available information.  By then a whole cohort of new experts in nursing will be helping to manage the requirements of good quality care for those suffering from this chronic disorder.  Care will be centralized in six regional epilepsy centres when necessary and decentralized in a structured primary care programme where possible.  A sophisticated and robust means of electronic information management will be developed.  Front-line physicians delivering care at the emergency department interface will be provided with an integrated seizure care pathway that will reduce admissions and length of stay, while improving patient safety by eliminating treatment variability.  What we need from this Joint Oireachtas Committee is a recognition of the gains made and continued support and focus on the needs of people with epilepsy, a common disease with serious consequences that will require further investment in staff and equipment to reach international standards once the initial investment in the programme is complete. </p></speech>

Subarachnoid Haemorrhage, SAH, is an immediate and life-threatening emergency.  An estimated 460 to 1290 people suffer a brain haemorrhage each year.  Ten to 15 per cent of casualties die before reaching hospital and about half of all patients die within the six months.  Guidelines for the management of SAH patients were introduced by HIQA in 2010 to clarify the criteria for admitting patients for emergency neurosurgical or endovascular treatment but these guidelines have not improved access to treatment, nor could they.  The reality is that the neurosurgical centre is grossly under-resourced.  There are just ten neurosurgical intensive care beds.  A report entitled &quot;Towards Excellence in Critical Care&quot; by an expert group on critical care services in the Republic of Ireland was presented to the HSE in 2009.  That report assessed a need for 52 intensive care and eight high dependency neurosurgical beds.</p><p>  I advised HIQA in 2008 that standards and measures of performance were required to address the inconsistency of decisions being made in the neurosurgical centre to admit SAH patients for treatment.  No action was taken by HIQA until after the authority had been challenged in <i>The Irish Times</i> in September 2009.  The measures of performance or key performance indicators, KPIs which HIQA introduced were customised to satisfy the constraints of inadequate resources.  Consequently, they restrict access to treatment and are unsafe.  HIQA has also failed, despite several requests, to put in place a standard to measure the outcome for SAH patients admitted to an acute hospital but denied treatment in Beaumont Hospital. </p><p>  HIQA is not an independent authority ---</p></speech>

There is no clear separation of roles and responsibilities for patient safety between the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the investigating authority, and the Health Service Executive, HSE, which funds health care.  In 2012, out of 238 SAH, subarachnoid haemorrhage, patients who were diagnosed, 138 were treated but 100 were denied treatment.  There is no information on the outcome for these patients.  If poor grade patients were to be admitted to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, 53% could expect a good recovery.</p><p>  We need to know the outcome for SAH patients who were denied neurosurgical treatment between 2011 and 2013.  This information is available in Beaumont Hospital because the neurosurgical centre is required to provide a patient management plan for each SAH patient referred for treatment.  Letters are sent from the centre to each referring hospital, so the records are in place.  There is a culture of secrecy and denial, however.  The statement by Beaumont Hospital to <i>The Irish Times</i> that appropriate protocols were in place to ensure SAH patients receive emergency neurosurgical treatment was misleading.  HIQA claims the HSE is responsible for the safety of patients who require treatment.  However, the HSE relies on assurances from Beaumont Hospital that the neurosurgical centre can provide access to treatment but assurances from Beaumont Hospital are not reliable.</p><p>  My written submission makes 13 recommendations which I urge the joint committee to carefully consider, approve and recommend for action to the Minister for Health.  I particularly recommend an increase in the number of neurosurgical intensive care beds in line with the recommendations from Towards Excellence in Critical Care and review the corporate and clinical governance standards at HIQA and the HSE.  I also recommend the urgent review of mortality and morbidity for SAH patients denied treatment between 2011 and 2013.  One small change, which would not incur any costs, relates to the interhospital transfer of critically ill patients.  This should have the same urgency as a 999 emergency call.  There was one case where it took three and a half hours to transfer a patient from one hospital to another.</p></speech>

While I admire him for his passion, his views are his own.  The committee does not have any remit to examine the neurological centre at Beaumont.  It is examining national health policy.  I must point out that the HSE, HIQA and the hospitals referred to are not here to offer a counter view.  For fairness and balance, we will have to offer an invitation to them to address the committee on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-11a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021100006#G00300"><p>I thank the delegations not just for their presentations but their work in the preparation of these submissions.  This is an important area of health care and I welcome the fact we are addressing it once again.</p><p>  Ms Magdalen Rogers set out clearly the significant shortcomings in the provision of neurological care, including long waiting lists for access to specialists, inadequate access to multidisciplinary teams, lack of community after care and neurorehabilitation.  Professor Orla Hardiman made the point about a largely disjointed non-co-ordinated approach which is costly and ineffective.  Reference was also made to the recruitment embargo in the public sector putting pressure on therapy services.  This is a policy that the committee has not overlooked.  We need to get the message through that it cannot continue because it is having serious detrimental impacts on treatment programmes and outcomes.</p><p>  I have previously highlighted the inadequacies of neurorehabilitation services with the Minister for Health at the committee&rsquo;s July quarterly ministerial meeting.  The response I received was wholly inadequate and was deeply disappointing.  I commend the launch of the alliance&rsquo;s neurorehabilitation manifesto last year and hope it continues to have good luck in all it undertakes.  Its latest survey on the numbers suffering neurological conditions demonstrates a point the committee has addressed repeatedly, namely 27% of them have had medical cards refused or withdrawn.  This is further evidence of a point we have argued consistently with the Minister and the HSE executive at this committee.  In fairness, it is not just Opposition Members on the committee who have raised this matter.  We are all universally angered by this fact and have asked for changes to the policy.</p><p>  I thank Professor Hardiman for providing us with a transcript of the telephone conversation between a patient and the medical card centre.  All Deputies and Senators would have similar exposure.  I note she identified the lack of joined-up thinking and asked how we can discharge people to community-based services that do not exist.  While the number of neurological consultants has increased from 11 in 1996 to 34 now, this has only uncovered a significant unmet need.  What is the proper complement of consultants to address needs adequately and in line with European norms?</p><p>  I thank Dr. Doherty for his review of epilepsy services.  He stated managed primary care will be delivered by general practitioners working with practice nurses and with the guidance of epilepsy advanced nurse practitioners, ANP, in every region.  Are such ANPs in place in every region?  He also referred to contractual issues that need to be resolved before widespread uptake in primary care.</p> <p>Are these contractual issues with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and how near are they to a resolution?  It is very worrying that Mr. Lawless said the NECP and HSE have provided funding for seven nursing staff to deliver the epilepsy programme in the HSE south but for unclear reasons nothing has happened and, as a result, over &euro;500,000 worth of equipment is lying idle.  Who bears direct responsibility for this shocking exposure of the failure properly to provide and see the utilisation of expensive and important equipment?  Who should make the appointments that have not been made?</p><p> I sincerely thank Mr. Lawless for his presentation.  It has been some years but this is my first opportunity to offer him my sincere sympathy on the loss of his dear wife back in 2005, as he indicated in his presentation.  I very much welcome what Mr. Lawless has presented to us.  It is a significant piece of work.  He has made several recommendations, some simple, some more complex.  We should send Mr. Lawless's presentation to each of the various entities, such as Beaumont Hospital, the HSE or HIQA, and ask them to respond.  I hope that would be in some way a useful employment of the work and effort he put into preparing his submission to us.  It is deeply appreciated.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate that it is very difficult area.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the issue regarding Cork.  If the people have been interviewed, does anybody understand why the appointments have not gone ahead?  The people to fill the vacancies seem to have been selected.  The worry is that if the people who have been selected are left hanging around for a long time, they will find jobs elsewhere.  That is the big issue I would worry about.  Why have the appointments not gone through when the interview process has happened and they are deemed to be suitably qualified?  That is my only question because I am very concerned that all this has happened and that the end result has not been achieved.</p></speech>

I have a number of very focused questions.  In common with most parts of the health service, neurological services such as neurosurgery, neurorehabilitation and neuropathology, are grotesquely understaffed by any international comparison.  I will ask some specific questions on that.  I do not want anybody to think that any part of me is criticising my professional colleagues or colleagues from other professions.  They do extraordinary and heroic jobs under very difficult circumstances in which they have been placed by successive Governments and by the permanent government, which has historically had a very unrealistic view of how a health service should work.  This view is coloured virtually entirely through the prism of Her Majesty's National Health Service which, for all its glory, is by modern, western standards, not the standard we should emulate.</p><p>  I would like to address some questions primarily to Dr. Doherty and Professor Hardiman and they will probably need to get their pens out.  How many neurologists, neurosurgeons and neurorehabilitation consultants are there per head of population in Ireland?  What is recommended by the local professional authorities?  What would the numbers be, in so far as they know, for the UK, continental Europe and North America?</p><p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I have mentioned neurorehabilitation in other fora over the last year, specifically regarding D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which I mentioned in the Seanad last year.  Compared to other countries, Ireland has approximately 60% to 70% of the number of neurorehabilitation personnel per head of population that would be found in the UK.  We have one fifth of the numbers that would be found in general in continental Europe.  The number of beds we have per head of population is 10% of that which is available in France.  That is just one example.  I strongly suspect that for all the other disciplines our numbers are similarly low.</p><p>  Speaking from the perspective of my day job, I have always been troubled by the adequacy of neurosurgical services in Ireland.  This is not because I have any problem with the quality, competence, dedication and diligence of the people who work on the front line in Beaumont, Cork and other units but because they are grotesquely under-provided and it has always been my impression that as a result of this a series of Band Aids has been put over an inadequate service.  Let the witnesses correct me if I am wrong.  Is it appropriate that ambulances in Dublin can take somebody potentially with head trauma to a hospital were neurosurgery may not be available?</p><p>  In Dublin neurosurgery is available in only one hospital.  Most of the acute hospitals which are on call for neurosurgical trauma and sudden catastrophic neurosurgical events such as brain haemorrhages will not have the expertise on campus.  This means, by definition, that in five out of six hospitals to which patients will be brought, if they have such a problem which requires that backup, there is a built-in delay and <i>triage</i> of having people at a remote site trying to deal with a problem telemetrically by assessing scans that have been forwarded over.  If one of my precious family members had a neurosurgical catastrophe, I know the kind of service I would like them to have and the kind of service they would have.  I do not believe this is the service that is routinely available to people who dial 999 and are brought to hospital in an ambulance.  We need to seriously look at that situation.</p><p>  I met Mr. Lawless and he is obviously somebody about whom it will be said that he is bearing a personal grudge or acting as a crank.  I will not speak about the specifics of what happened in Beaumont Hospital.  However, the general perception that somebody could examine how a person with neurosurgical potential catastrophe in Ireland is dealt with and find the situation to be wholly inadequate is very plausible.  I am sorry about that.  I am not pointing fingers at individual people or units, but we do not do this very well.  One of the reasons this meeting is happening today is because I suggested it, and one of the reasons I suggested it is because I met Mr. Lawless.  Mr. Lawless was, to an extent, singing from a hymn sheet from which I had been warbling a few bars to myself over the years.</p><p>  I am a little troubled by this.  Identifiable individuals have a right to their reputations.  Publicly funded bodies do not, be it St. Vincent's University Hospital or the board of that hospital, Beaumont Hospital, HIQA, the HSE, the Department of Health or any other entity.  Recently we had the absurd situation where a respected medical journalist, Dr. Ruair&iacute; Hanley, wrote a piece about the problems with medical cards and got a threatening letter sent by a PR spokesperson for the HSE.  The HSE should have no PR spokespersons.  Public servants should speak for themselves on their own track records.  They should not spend taxpayers' money to hire people whose primary purpose is not to foster communications but to defend their reputation.  It has a chilling effect.</p></speech>

I will gladly hold the door open for him.  I have no problem.  I will buy him a cup of coffee and say it to his face.  I have not mentioned him.  It is wrong.  The backbone of a democracy is a critical press and it should not happen that we cannot criticise public bodies because the public body has a newly-defined reputational right.  Can one imagine if somebody was prevented from criticising the FDA, the National Institutes of Health or the Pentagon in Washington because somebody there stated he or she would threaten to sue if the reputation of the organisation was questioned?  We would have no investigative journalism whatsoever if that happened.  For these reasons I must state I find myself very much in sympathy with the tenor of Mr. Lawless's comments.  I have not read the submission in detail but Mr. Lawless has an absolute right to criticise any organisation he wishes without fear of legal retribution if it is a public organisation.  I hope he has not criticised individuals in an identifiable way.</p><p>  I will return to the core of the questions I asked.  I understand I am catching the witnesses on the hop and I understand they may not have the figures at the tips of their fingers.  By and large there is a rule which applies across the Irish health service.  In general we have approximately 60% of the number of consultants the UK has, and the UK has approximately one fifth of the number in continental Europe and one tenth of the number in North America.  This is generally how it works.</p></speech>

It is a difficult question.  In Ireland we have approximately one neurologist per 117,000 people.  Dr. Doherty did a quick calculation and in the UK there is approximately one per 80,000 people.  The difficulty with the question on what is the remit of neurology is the remit is quite wide.  The biggest neurological problem we have is stroke, which falls somewhat in the remit of neurology and somewhat in the remit of medicine for the elderly.  If stroke is included as part of the remit of neurology we are grossly underresourced and undersupported.  To have one per 100,000 people we should have 45 neurologists and to have one per 80,000 people, which would be equivalent to the UK, we should have 54.  We would need another group of specialists with expertise in stroke and it should include neurological support.</p><p>  Dr. Doherty will probably develop the point that a neurologist in isolation is not a particularly helpful animal.  We are pretty good at making diagnoses but to implement the best care we would like to have for ourselves and our families we should be part of a team, which brings us to the employment embargo which is a huge problem.  The model by which we deliver care should change to a multidisciplinary form whereby we are part of a multidisciplinary team.  We would need another ten or 20 neurologists to make the team work, but it would not work without the other disciplines.  Dr. Doherty has described a very good model on the important role highly-trained clinical specialist nurses and nurse practitioners can play in the delivery of care.</p><p>  We have a tangible request to make of the committee with regard to medical cards, which is to investigate the formula used to define the difference between the means test for the medical card and the discretionary medical card.  We have been informed a financial mechanism or metric is used in the HSE with regard to the difference when somebody exceeds the mean but falls into the discretionary category.  We would like to know the health economic basis of the metric.  It is a tangible question on which we would like the committee to come back to us because we would like to test it with our own health economic analysis.  I will leave the committee with this very simple question.</p></speech>

With regard to managed primary care and how it will be delivered and why it may not be very advanced, it goes back to what Professor Hardiman stated.  What patients seek, particularly when they are diagnosed with a chronic disease, is a pathway of care.  They do not just seek one specialist.  We know from chronic diseases unless we can use all of the resources the health services have to bear, including community services of which primary care doctors are leaders and engage them in delivering some of the care, we will be overwhelmed.  Academically everyone agrees with this.</p><p>  Our nurses are in place everywhere except the south.  They are available and willing to deliver care.  We are engaging with the primary care nurses with an e-learning programme to teach them how to deliver care.  We believe 70% of patients with epilepsy can be managed safely in the community.  Our real problem is a contractual issue.  It is not an issue of privilege and no one needs to be here to answer it.  A new contract is being negotiated which will, we hope, deliver a clear remit for primary care to deal with chronic disease.  At present it does not exist.  The letter of the existing contract does not state there is an absolute role to deliver chronic disease management.  Until this is fixed we will not be able to get this moving in a widespread fashion.</p></speech>

Once the negotiations are concluded and the new contract comes out it will have a remit for chronic disease.  This is the kernel of it.  There may be other issues regarding funding but it is about involving GPs.  Individual GPs are eager for this and really want to help.  We have some pilot data which is fascinating.  We know we can manage the patients through contact with our nurses and primary centres.  We conducted a pilot with one large practice in the south of Dublin with 4,000 patients.  All of the epilepsy patients were put through this programme and we have a checklist for safe care which the GPs and nurses can use.  Only 10% required to be referred back to the hospital which means 90% of the patients were managed in primary practice and did not need to go to the specialist centre.</p></speech>

They were managed through contact with the primary care nurses using e-mail.  We are in contact with primary care nurses and GPs are very eager for this to happen.  However, it will not happen until the contract negotiations have concluded.</p><p>  With regard to who is accountable and what is happening in Cork, I take responsibility for it.  I act on behalf of the HSE and I am the clinical lead for the programme.  I was given control of the budget to hire the nurses.  I oversaw the interviews through the national recruitment service.  I know they were interviewed, but they have not been put in place.  I must take responsibility for this on behalf of the HSE and the national programme.</p></speech>

We were given a budget in the service plan from January 2010 for the nurses to be appointed.  We oversaw the appointment process and the requirement for training for these nurses to be approved.  We provided the equipment and identified the space in Cork University Hospital for the epilepsy unit.</p> <p>We put in the &euro;500,000 worth of equipment, but one crucial piece was missing - the local hospital did not have the capacity to burst through its employment ceiling to hire the people, despite the fact that the money was there.  The money, equipment and space are available, everybody is aligned and everybody knows it is needed but, unfortunately, there was a critical problem with the employment ceiling locally.</p></speech>

This is where it becomes unclear to me.  The official answer would be that exceptions were made by the clinical programmes to the employment ceiling.  In a programme that had a defined model of care and sanction from the clinical programmes office, exemptions were made for employment ceilings.  It is a failure on my part, I suppose, that I do not know why people who were interviewed and appointable have not been appointed.  We must take collective responsibility for it.</p></speech>

It is not enough.  Is the witness in a position to give the committee his sense of how this can be addressed?  It appears to be simple.  Has the witness taken steps within the HSE to address the local freeze, for want of a better word?  The committee must complement whatever efforts Dr. Doherty has employed or will now employ to get to a better position on this.  I believe we are on the same page.  Despite the fact that Dr. Doherty has taken responsibility, that is not really the case.  He has overseen all the respective and required steps for that recruitment, but we must see those people in place and their professional skills put to the use and purpose for which they were designed.  How can we get to that place together?</p></speech>

There are the nurses to run the epilepsy unit, which is very important for this small group of highly complex epilepsy patients.  However, the majority of the patients are those we must manage in the community.  Two nurses who have been interviewed and are appointable will work in this advanced nurse practitioner capacity, which is needed to supplement the work of Daniel Costello, who is the consultant neurologist running the epilepsy services there.  They will support the 80% of patients and maintain them in the community.  I do not want the Cork unit to open and for that to be final word.</p></speech>

I am wearing my management hat for the HSE, but to my right and left are people who are speaking in a very personal capacity.  Their points are well made.  I got involved in this because I think the most complex thing we do is deliver health care, and it must be delivered.  People are crying out for process and data.  When I started this programme we were a group of experts who were all providing care.  If a person in Galway had epilepsy, their chance of getting the same type of care as a person in Dublin was minimal.  It was all very different.  Now, we are starting to standardise everything we do.  I acknowledge the hurt of Mr. Lawless and the points he makes.  He is crying out for a process to be put in place for what happens to people.  That might be what HIQA meant to happen in 2010.  It is a question of whether we, as a profession of consultants, have delivered on that process.  That is where the concern lies.  If I talk about what I am delivering on a daily basis, I should point out that the people I work with on a daily basis are crying out for process.  Unless we put a process around it, it will not be fixed.</p><p>  With regard to neurosurgery, there are numbers, resourcing and bed issues.  However, one must put a process around this complex delivery of care.  For example, I do not believe that one cannot safely manage a patient who has some neurosurgical issues in a distant centre, but unless one gets the governance right and somebody takes responsibility at the neurosurgical centre for managing a patient who is in a distant centre, they will never be looked after properly.  There must be a set of trigger points for the movement of the patient.  The patient must be moved according to a set of protocols.  If the patient runs into A, B or C trouble, the ambulance service must deal with that as an emergency, like a 999 call.  They are all process issues, not resourcing issues.</p></speech>

It goes back to the theme we all have today.  It is very easy to say that our health service is inadequate.  Obviously there are many problems in the way the service is delivered to our patients, and they are not all resource issues.  We are conscious that we are in the middle of the worst recession ever and that extra resourcing for the service we are trying to deliver is something that we would like in the longer term in whatever iteration we have to ensure the system is fair and delivered appropriately.  In the meantime, the four of us present today would agree that there are many things we can do differently and more effectively with the same resources.  There is a deficit between the policy and the process.</p></speech>

Is there any integration between the HSE, hospital management and the professional consultant delivering on the ground?  Let us park the resource issue for a moment.  As you said, we are in a recession and have had to cut back budgets.  If it is not about resources, why is that not happening?</p></speech>

My colleagues here might wish to develop it.  The issue is accountability, as Dr. Doherty said.  He is responsible.  Who is accountable for the transcript I gave the committee?  The issue is responsibility-taking and accountability.  The person who is responsible should be accountable and the person who is accountable should be held accountable.</p> <p>That is not happening anywhere in the system and that is what Mr. Lawless and Dr. Doherty were driving at.  The presentations shared the common theme of an absence of clearly defined accountability within the system.  For example, a train driver is accountable to the head of train drivers; a conductor is accountable to the head of conductors; and a line manager is accountable but there is no mechanism.  Therefore, if the train is unsafe and it is unclear then who should be held accountable.  That is where the problem lies.  Does Dr. Doherty agree with my comment?  </p></speech>

We have two maternity hospitals with an outreach programme providing an epilepsy service and one more must come online in Dublin.  We have four intellectual disability centres where a nurse visits people who are intellectually disabled.  That means they do not have to be put in taxis, transferred to and made sit in the unfamiliar environment of waiting rooms in adult hospitals.  We are making progress and it is all about a process or structure that we have put around the service.  The national clinical programmes - and I only represent one aspect of them - is the way forward.  However, it is the way in which one implements the process.</p></speech>

However, the neurosurgical research and development unit does not have the resources to retrospectively review these letters.  </blockquote>Those letters are about patients who were referred for treatment to Beaumont Hospital but were denied treatment.  I and others still cannot get an answer on what the outcome was for those patients.  I, along with a lot of people, want to know the answers to the following questions.  How many of those people died?  What was the level of mortality?  What was the level of morbidity?  I specifically want to know the following.  What are the figures for 2011, 2012 and 2013, inclusive?  My question is legitimate and the information should be available.</p></speech>

I am disadvantaged in terms of knowledge of the subject but Professor Hardiman explained the issue very well in her final contribution.  The strong theme that ran through the presentations, not only by the four contributors but from all of us on this side of the House, was that we want a better service.</p><p>  As previous speakers have said, we can talk to the wall all day but nothing will happen if we cannot make sense of the questions raised.  However, that is not the fault of the witnesses because the HSE and HIQA have a responsibility in this matter.</p><p>  Apart from better service, all of us want accountability because it is a cardinal point.  If one does not have accountability then one does not have anything.  Taxpayers should not have to pay for a service that is devoid of a system of accountability and information on how it is carried out or performed.  With all due respect to the medical profession, doctors are not above the law and accountability which is the way it should be in a caring society.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in put the issue perfectly right and I agree with him.  I may not use the blunt language used by Mr. Lawless in his interesting contribution.  I read all of his informative contribution.  I have used worse language than Mr. Lawless used but I would not put it in print but he had the right to do so.  However, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the matter should be forwarded to the HSE.  The recommendations made by Mr. Lawless are flawless.  Perhaps they are flawed but I am not a medic.  He is perfectly correct that his recommendations should be sent to the HSE and that we should know all of the information. </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I extend our sympathies to Mr. Lawless and his son on the death of his wife, Nuala.  I admire his passion.  I have read his report and met him.  He needs to get answers, and not just in a personal capacity, but answers must be given in the context of the Bill.  As part of our debate there needs to be a further meeting of the committee.  I thank everybody for attending and I ask members to stay behind for a private session.  Does Ms Rogers with to comment?</p></speech>

We used to attend committees like this but we lacked a focus in terms of an initiative within the health services that would tackle the needs of people with neurological conditions.  The clinical programmes in neurology, rehabilitation, epilepsy and stroke represent a vital initiative which should not fall down through a lack of resources and the health service is accountable for delivering on the initiative.   </p></speech>

In terms of accountability and transparency, we have a system whereby we award people access to a wide range of community services - patchy though they may be - but it is completely non-transparent, the discretionary component is unclear and is based on financial hardship.  We want to know exactly how it works because we want to test the system.  It has caused a huge amount of damage to our fellow citizens who have chronic conditions, encounter huge financial hardship and are denied or repeatedly asked to submit and resubmit information, as seen in the transcript.  We would like to know the metric applied and who makes the decisions because we want a transparent system.</p></speech>
