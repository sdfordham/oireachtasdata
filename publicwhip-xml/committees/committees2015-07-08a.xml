    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#B00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile telephones.  We are meeting to discuss the national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development.  I welcome from the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. Richie Flynn, aquaculture executive secretary, aquaculture committee, from The Environmental Pillar, Mr. Michael Ewing, co-ordinator, Ms Karin Dubsky and Mr. Rory Keatinge, from Iascair&iacute; Int&iacute;re Cois Cladach na h&Eacute;ireann, Mr. Eamon O'Corcora and Mr. John Connolly, and from the Irish Seal Sanctuary, sea fisheries advisory group, Mr. Brendan Price.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee to discuss issues contained in the draft national strategic plan published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which seeks to chart a path for developing a sustainable aquaculture industry.  The committee was notified of the process and that a draft policy had been published and a consultation process was under way.  In order to assist the committee in preparing its submission to the draft plan, we decided to invite in a number of representative organisations.  The timeframe was short and that is why the meeting is being held at this hour on a Wednesday evening.  Committee room availability is limited and I appreciate that some people have travelled quite a distance to be present this evening.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>As there are four groups, I propose that each group have ten minutes to make an opening statement, after which we will go to questions from members.  A Bill is on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and some votes may be called.  I have agreement from the Whip that if a member stays, such as Deputy Martin Ferris or Deputy Pringle, to cancel me out, we can continue the meeting rather than suspend, which would be unfair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Flynn" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#B00300"><p>Anyone looking at the seafood sector will have noted a sudden rush in official reports and consultation processes on aquaculture and seafood in general in recent months and it is safe to say there is some confusion about the role of each document.  The information overload is felt by the industry as well.  The 300 active producers of oysters, mussels, salmon, clams and trout that we represent, however, only want to hear about a clear plan to deal with the single biggest issue, namely, licensing.  The total failure by successive governments to simply do their job has been hurting development, corroding confidence, ruining markets and stifling investment.  All the industry asks is that the Irish State provides a clear, modern and transparent working licence system.</p> <p>  We have the operational programme for seafood and FoodWise 2025, which was launched last week and which had a lot to say about seafood.  Over the next few days, the harnessing our ocean wealth plan will be launched in Cork.  The matter before the committee is the national strategic plan for aquaculture, a bit of bed time reading.  To put it simply, the NSP is a technical requirement from Brussels in which every Government in the EU sets out how they will spend a portion of what they get in European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, funding, as well as what those national Governments can put up to match that.  For states like Spain, France, the UK, Denmark and Ireland, where the marine industry is important, this has gained a lot of attention and we are all operating at different speeds.  The rules are set down and agreed in law and anyone who has been following the progress of the EMFF through Brussels will know that the rules have passed through the Commission, the Parliament and the Council.  We have had a fair go at them, from the point of view of colleagues sitting around the table, and using the federations in Europe, to get to the new review.  The Common Fisheries Policy review was overshadowed by the review of the Common Agricultural Policy review as the two were happening at the same time.  We are dealing with the funding application of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, review as our farmer colleagues have done with respect to their review.</p> <p>  The European Commission attached a high priority to aquaculture development in the new programme to offset imports of seafood into the EU and to address a greater demand for seafood while wild fisheries were static.  There is a lot in the CFP about wild fisheries and aquaculture is just a portion of it.</p><p>The national strategic plan, NSP, is a virtual shopping list of potential investment headings, some of which are in the form of grant aid directly to farmers who must convince shareholders or lending institutions to assist them with at least 60% of the overall project cost.  If they want to build a new shed, boat or put out trestles, they have to put up 60% of the cash.  Up to 40% could be available in grant aid for capital costs if they fulfil a range of criteria first.  It is not a hand-out.   The NSP also contains schemes to fund State agencies on training, research and development and measures to alleviate hardship caused by long natural biotoxin closures for shellfish producers.  We have seen such occurrences in the south west, particularly over the past 12 months.  If the NSP comes into shape in its current form, the Minister will have funds available to look after people in such circumstances.</p><p> However, the entire NSP is purely waste paper, just like its predecessor the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, in which we handed back much funds.  There were virtually no grants awarded for investment to my members or Irish small and medium-sized enterprises in the last fund.  Investment in the industry came to a standstill.  The fund was recycled into other areas while Irish fish and shellfish farmers watched as competitors in other EU member states accessed it.  The reason for this was the same Department which could not deliver licences insisted that a licence was a pre-requisite to getting a grant.</p><p> The joint committee has had several submissions from IFA aquaculture and others over the years and has been supportive of a common sense approach to solving this problem.  In the face of systematic inertia, however, it appears that even a cross-party committee cannot get the right people to roll up their sleeves and tackle an administrative issue.  The committee is once again showing leadership in preparing a submission on the NSP.  The IFA urges the committee to be focused and not distracted by irrelevancies.</p><p> We speak for the companies and individuals who have put their families&rsquo; futures on the line, who have re-mortgaged their houses and put their kids through college on the back of aquaculture.  We speak for the people who want to hand over their farms to the next generation to farm the sites they set up in the 1980s and who want to be able to set out new development plans.  We speak for the entrepreneurs who want to stay in their communities instead of making hard decisions in the face of yet another demoralising and frustrating six years of kicking the can down the road.  It is time to have clear deadlines and achievable targets.  It is time to change the emphasis in all these reports to focus on profitability rather than production targets.  It is time to give our sales people and marketers something to work with and allow us the scale and continuity of production which customers want.  Confidence will only come into this industry with clear deadlines in the NSP.  The committee must remember two points, namely, clearing the licensing backlog in six months and set a time limit of 30 weeks, or 150 days, from receipt of application to determination.  These are simple, achievable and yet incredibly valuable targets for 2,000 people and 300 businesses around the coast.</p></speech>

I call on Ms Karin Dubsky of The Environmental Pillar to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karin Dubsky" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#C00300"><p>I am pleased to be seated beside the IFA witness and agree with much of what has been said.  Section 13 of the Fisheries Act needs to be commenced to enable us to clear the backlog of licences.  The Environmental Pillar is happy to have this NSP.  However, it has come too late.  It should have been introduced for public discussion four years ago.  It should have been delivered to Brussels 14 months ago, which was the deadline.  To give it to us now with no public consultation means there is time pressure and little real change is likely to be made to it.</p> <p>  However, we will never give up.  The Environmental Pillar has an alternative vision.  Ireland has more, and a better, diversity of marine resources than any other EU member state, particularly those in the coastal zone.  We have the luxury to say that we will have a different and top quality of aquaculture, building on our diverse shellfish, crustacean and fish species.  We still have more native oysters per area than any other country.  Germany is now giving &euro;6.5 million in its EMFF allocation to get its native oyster stocks back up and running.  The German authorities have prospected in Ireland to do this.  However, there is not even a word about the value of our native oyster in the NSP.  The NSP makes it out that native oysters come from aquaculture but they do not.  They are a combination of wild harvest and aquaculture.  The data are not adequate to separate the two.  There are many unknowns in the NSP&rsquo;s data.  How many of the jobs figures are part-time and full-time?</p> <p>  Our vision calls for building aquaculture slowly, using the huge number of local people, like our colleagues here from Galway, who still have knowledge of the marine environment.  I have just been to France where I examined areas where climate change has meant lands have become inundated.  They are using this land to make shallow basins and lagoons for aquaculture, so that marginal farmers will be able to diversify into aquaculture.  Such potential is not explored in this plan.</p> <p>  This plan concentrates on significant tonnages from salmon and gigas oysters.</p><p>We do not necessarily need gigas oysters.  I know they grow faster, but they carry a lot of diseases which our native oysters get.  If we put the emphasis into showing how valuable our lobsters are, instead of exporting 97% of them, our jobs would be in creating that wealth.  In Boston, where my intern comes from, there are a huge number of jobs in the lobster industry.  I would like to see that kind of vision but is it now too late?  Are we stuck with this or can the committee make recommendations for a review of this report so that it can be amended?  Or can we cast it aside and have a genuine discussion as was had in Northern Ireland?  We were invited there to participate and see what the different scenarios and options were.  </p><p> Aarhus convention compliance on land is pretty okay now.  I think we are at the European average.  When it comes to the marine environment, however, it is woeful.  We share that frustration with the industry because we cannot get information or public participation.  That is because access to justice in An Bord Plean&aacute;la is questionable.  For example, the cumulative effects of many farms are not taken into account.  Unless one is very rich one cannot go to the High Court.  We have a history of adversarial argument, but we need to work together with all the different parties, including research and tourism.  They must all mutually support each other so that we get a top, world class aquaculture.</p><p> I will now pass over to my colleague Mr. Rory Keatinge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rory Keatinge" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#D00200"><p>I wish to make four main points about fin fish and how they were dealt with in the reports.  There is very little information in the documentation before us on the impact of fish farms on wild salmon stocks.  For example, there is a lot of information in chapter three of the SEA on the impact of disease on farm fish, but not on wild stocks in the vicinity.</p> <p>  I know there is some disagreement among scientists at present, particularly with regard to the impact of sea lice on farms and wild salmon stocks.  While we do not agree on these issues, the legally binding precautionary principle will often apply until we can agree on these matters.  </p> <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has called on salmon migratory routes to be factored into the SEA.  It does not appear anywhere else and is certainly not mentioned in the plan.  To this effect, NGOs will be proposing that a 25-km buffer zone from salmon bays and estuaries be enforced for the location of farms before any other factors are considered.</p> <p>  The second point concerns current laws.  Current laws are by protocol and, as such, are extremely difficult to enforce.  We have enclosed in the document as an appendix our current situation with two marine harvest farms where over-stocking is occurring and criticisms are being ignored.  Protocols are often seen as soft law.  We would like statutory instruments and statutory regulations on aquaculture, so that the couple of bad operators are brought to justice, held to account for what they do, and the rest of us do not get dragged along with it.  This is a system by which the rest of us live, including the terrestrial farming community, and it should be the same for the aquaculture industry.</p> <p>  Third, there is concern among the communities - as we have seen in this country - about the impact of aquaculture on the natural environment.  That is why so many people protest in Galway Bay.  Many NGO groups are also concerned with various aquaculture issues but they do not seem to be involved in the strategic assessment process or the plan itself.  Public participation is a key component, yet it seems to be lacking.  Some of these groups have requested an audience with this committee and, unfortunately, have been refused.  Many of them have far more relevant things to say that I do and are much more qualified to do so.  There may be contrasting views from what they have to say, but their views need to be heard. </p> <p>  Fourth, closed containment aquaculture is now considered to be the most sustainable and what a lot of the world considers to be the future of fin fish.  It is becoming more popular worldwide.  It is acknowledged in the report that a good percentage of future development will consist of this closed containment aquaculture.  We do not get much detail in the report, however, as to how, when or where this might happen, or an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of that system.  There is an indication of &euro;1 million funding in seven years, which does not seem like a lot for the future of this industry.</p></speech>

It is not sustainable, despite the name.  The moves in it are basically designed to support major industries, but not small people working on inshore areas or coastal communities.  It is a big missed opportunity and we ask the committee to take that into consideration.</p></speech>

It was late in the day when I received it, as I was out at sea, but we will do our best anyway.  The inshore fishermen's point of view is seldom listened to, unfortunately, but we have had hearings with the committee before now.  We were satisfied that, at least, we were shown some respect. <br/><br/>To get back to our presentation, we would be totally opposed to this new strategy that seems to be the Government's strategy of industrialisation of large fin fish farms.  We do not agree with it and feel it is damaging to the environment.  There are several examples of this.  <br/><br/>From our own research on fin fish farms, the problem concerns cages at sea versus land.  We are totally opposed to cages at sea and would like to see closed contained fish farms onshore which have no problems with lice or pesticides.  Recently, I have been looking through a lot of data on fish farms and we are worried that some of the feedstuffs and chemical treatments have an awful effect on wild salmon and wild trout.<br/><br/>For years we have been lobbying politicians to install shellfish hatcheries to save our lobsters and crayfish in particular, as well as shrimp.  We seem to be 30 years behind every other country in Europe, as well as America, Canada and Australia.  We could go on.  We do not have a problem with bivalve aquaculture, involving oysters and mussels, provided it is done in an environmentally friendly fashion.  <br/><br/>As we seem them, the issues are pollution by cages at sea from fin fish farms, involving salmon and trout; escapees from fish farms, as we had in Bantry Bay during the storms last year; and the use of feed sources for wild stocks.  In particular, two countries have been licensed by the EU to take up to 600,000 tonnes of krill and capelin from the cold waters of the North Atlantic.  They have been doing that for years while a small number of people who were drift-netting for a few days per year in Ireland were stopped.</p><p>They have done far done damage than any Irish fisherman has ever done.</p><p> The content of feed pellets that is allowed by the EU is another problem, with some of them containing the likes of chicken and pork.  That is completely unacceptable to us, but it is approved in Europe, as one can read online.  Another is the use of pesticides and antibiotics, with several reports showing it is a danger to health for people to eat fish treated with those types of substances.  Sea lice, too, are a serious problem.  In fact, tests done in 2012 showed that on some Irish salmon farms, there were up to 44 lice per salmon.  That has a terrible environmental impact.  As we see it, it is a case of commercial fishing versus fish farming and there is not enough regard for the welfare of local communities.  There are 1,800 small fishing vessels in operation in this country and each one of them is as important in its community as is the small family farm, shop or post office to other communities.</p><p> Ours is a dwindling industry and it is in serious trouble.  I hope the committee and the Oireachtas will agree, immediately or at least after the election, to put their shoulder to the wheel and do something about this.  What we really want for the inshore fleet is a sustainable lobster stock for commercial fishing.  We do not want to see lobster farms being set up instead of lobster hatcheries.  All of this should be done in conjunction with small-boat fishermen.  I have given 36 years of my life to this; my colleague, Mr. Connolly, has given some 50 years.  The decline in the industry is happening at an alarming rate and poses a serious risk to many small coastal communities.</p><p> We have seen from other countries what can be done.  In the UK, for example, there is the National Lobster Hatchery in Cornwall and, in Scotland, the Orkney Lobster Hatchery.  The latter has been in operation since 1985, which makes one wonder why Ireland, as an island nation, is so far behind on this.  Other facilities in Britain include the Firth of Forth Lobster Hatchery in North Berwick, the hatchery to be constructed at Bridlington, and the Lobster Hatchery of Wales on Anglesey Island.  Moving to North America, we find the New England Aquarium Lobster Lab and the Pictou Lobster Hatchery in Nova Scotia.  Australia is home to the Redclaw Hatchery and a crayfish hatchery in Queensland.  Senegal has a shrimp hatchery.  In Ireland, on the other hand, we have overfishing, no regulation, unlicensed operators and a blind eye being turned to all of it.  We should not be 30 years behind other countries; we should be 30 years ahead of them.  I emphasise, however, that the changes which require to be made must be done in conjunction with coastal communities and the local fishermen who have earned a living from these activities for many years.</p><p> We recommend that there be a strategic environmental assessment of closed aquaculture practice, using onshore tanks, which offers better water quality and increased production capacity.  Scotland has been looking into this in recent years and there has been an application on this regard from an operator in west Cork.  We must have a rejuvenation programme whereby lobsters, crayfish, shrimp and other fish that are under threat would be released into the wild.  That is vital if we are to be able to sustain our livelihood and keep our communities alive.  A coastal community fund for projects like that is available elsewhere in Europe, but we have never had anything like it here.  Unfortunately, coastal communities in this country are ignored, with the perception among those communities being that they just do not matter.</p><p> The strategic plan should include provision for onshore fish farms and shellfish hatcheries, which would help to rejuvenate wild stocks, ensure a viable commercial fishing sector and offer an environmental benefit.  A study done in Senegal shows that prawn reintroduction can help to fight infection and safeguard a sustainable future for rural coastal communities.  There is also tourism potential in hatcheries, as anybody who has visited the National Lobster Hatchery in Cornwall will know.  That facility is a real money spinner.  In addition, the construction of hatcheries will lead directly to the creation of jobs as well as creating spin-off employment potential.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Price" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend the meeting.  The Irish Seal Sanctuary welcomes the committee's input to the development of a national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development and is happy to assist it in any way.  Unfortunately, the draft plan is somewhat insubstantial and is 14 months too late in the wake of the consultation period for the seafood development programme.  As other speakers mentioned, we certainly need to avail of the time left to us to effect changes in the plan or, if necessary, extend that time.  The Commission, in making this issue a condition of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, has indicated that the stakeholding must be widened and deepened.  The reality, however, is that many stakeholders in Ireland are unacknowledged, including most of those involved in small family enterprises in local coastal communities.</p> <p>  Having said that, the draft strategic plan is very welcome and at least gives us something to get our teeth into.  In the context of Food Harvest 2020 and the focus on harnessing our ocean wealth, we have an opportunity to examine what our growing contribution to the EU demands.  The strategic environmental impacts, appropriate assessments and the plan itself generically indicate that we have the capacity to meet the types of targets indicated, but they fall far short when it comes to offering any type of specific reassurance.  The national strategic plan for aquaculture must be economically, ecologically and socially sustainable, but neither the plans nor the assessments really address the realities for operators.  Much of the work on the assessments is either yet to begin or is in progress.  With due respect to the authors of the plan, they were dealing with massive information deficits and outdated data.  Both the plan itself and the assessments are quite disconnected.  There is no breakdown of how the &euro;30 million in funds allocated under the EMFF might actually be matched to projections.  On that basis, the plan falls very short, with no attempt or opportunity to measure the projections and deliverables.</p> <p>  There are some amusing minor oversights to be spotted as one goes through the document, such as the statement that our aquaculture programme is located at 40 degrees of longitude to the west, which would put it somewhere off Newfoundland.  I assume that is just a typographical error, but it suggests the haste in which the document was put together.  There is insufficient acknowledgement of the need for major regulatory change.  A new aquaculture regime requires a new, independent and sovereign regulatory system, independent of outside agencies such as the Aquaculture Stewardship council, the Marine Stewardship Council, endorsements by the World Wildlife Fund, and the old-fashioned patronage of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and others.</p> <p>  A glaring recent example of green washing was the Marine Harvest Ireland incident, which was mentioned by another speaker.</p><p>The fishery press wrote that Marine Harvest Ireland obtained global environmental and social sustainability industry standards for Irish salmon farming.  This is quite unacceptable and it was over the heads of Irish environmental sector non-governmental organisations, ENGOs.  The response of the World Wildlife Fund, WWF, to articles on the subject with its endorsement was that it was for the American market and there was no real need to consult with Irish interests.  The Aquaculture Stewardship Council was set up by the WWF and Dutch sustainable interests.  It is an outside accreditation body with no input from Irish ENGOs, civil society or wider stakeholders.  That presents a real problem because the aquaculture industry is plagued with this backlog of licences and perceived conflicts as they would call it with the Natura sites in many cases.</p><p> These problems, as Mr. Flynn indicated earlier need to be addressed urgently.  They are two points that we would all take up and agree on.  The idea of allowing accreditation continue without stakeholder input is unacceptable and if it is found out how lacking it is that will put at risk the whole Origin Green programme.  That jeopardises the beef and dairy sectors and others availing of the programme. </p><p> Further incidents include 83,000 salmon escapees from Inver in 2010; pancreas disease and the attempt to prevent its disclosure by the Marine Institute, on commercially sensitive grounds, in 2014; 230,000 escapees, the biggest ever escape in Ireland, from Bantry Bay; a 3.5 km illegal pipeline from the Kilkieran-Carna public water supply to treat amoebic gill disease, AGD; and the programme states, with respect to fish farming, that the offshore fin fish farms and fish farming generally does not require fresh water.  It very much does, it requires it on site, on the landward side and for the treatment of AGD.  These things need to be factored in.  Marine Harvest is not alone.  There have been other incidents, such as the Mannin Bay Salmon Company damming the Bunowen river to treat AGD.  Can these farms, relying on grant aid, support and proposed compensation, faced with parasites, infection, algal blooms, jellyfish and extreme weather events be considered sustainable?  The plan advocates public insurance.  Is it fair to expect the public to pay out for unfortunate events, if unfavourable sites are selected and projects approved?</p><p> In terms of stakeholding and the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, &euro;30 million goes to aquaculture.  Various sums go to the research and management agencies and there are massive conflicts of interest in the management authority for the EMFF.  Very often the management is a beneficiary of research money too.  There is a conflict of interest between those disbursing the money, those receiving it and those in receipt of contract services or proxy inspectorate positions.  That needs to be addressed.  The ENGOs and community and civil society are not included as stakeholders in Origin Green or in the break-out of figures to assist with its work.  That needs to be addressed because it is not wide. </p><p> The proposal to EMFF fund Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to appoint aquaculture agents, an archaeologist, ornithologist and sustainable development expert makes nonsense of these roles.  In the case of agents, BIM officers are there for that purpose; archaeologists should be employed by the OPW; biodiversity experts and ornithologists - and certainly having only one for the extent of farms envisaged - will not do.  They should be employed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, which has a vital role.  Often when the old licences were granted and the NPWS was unable to be present at the assessments or meetings there was a teleconference about the strategic environmental assessment.  In recent years the NPWS has seen 30% staff cuts and 40% budget cuts and it is not in a position to even attend these meetings.  It is the statutory, sovereign, independent, competent legal authority for the conservation of our biodiversity, the implementation of the nature protection aspects of the Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework directives and the Common Fisheries Programme.  Most important, what is left out of the plan is the governance and partnership which is alluded to in the assessments and in the plan to include all stakeholders.  With these limiting factors the plan is unsustainable.  Without the break-out of funds I do not see how it would pass an investor, never mind a bank manager although maybe we do not talk about them.</p><p> The strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and appropriate assessment, AA, repeat the aspirations of the national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development, NSPA, and analyse them generically but say specifically they cannot assess them in any meaningful way.  They are inadequate.  This will come down to licence applications, project analysis and compliance with the nature protection directives.  These things cannot happen if they are all in the hands of the one authority.  BIM cannot be developer, beneficiary, licence holder and inspector.  The protocols mentioned earlier need to be given statutory recognition so that there are independent sovereign assessors who will assess and monitor these firms in our interest and the wider interest of the environment. </p><p> Ireland should set high standards and not be controlled by one or more major players if its object is to be organic, sustainable and qualify for EMFF support.  The organic standard is wide open to challenge and it puts the entire Origin Green programme at risk.  Already, the United States and some Asian countries will not recognise the cage farming of fin fish and salmon as organic in any way.  Discredited accreditation will destroy this plan before it starts, and I hope the committee is able to use its influence to persuade the Minister to extend the consultation period to embrace wider and deeper stakeholding from civil society and the ENGO sector.</p></speech>

We should recognise this is a document published by the Minister.  We will make a submission and the Minister will then publish a final document.  We are not writing the document.  Whatever we do as a committee, the witnesses have to understand that while we could argue that we might not start where we are and might not finish where the Minister intends finishing but we have to try to influence the document if we feel changes need to be made.  It is important in today&rsquo;s discussion that we work within that framework.  My guess is he is not going to totally rewrite his own document.</p> <p>  Several big issues have been raised.  There seems to be concurrence that the licensing regime needs total reformation.  In chapter 8 the document refers to progressively removing the current aquaculture licensing backlog.</p><p>Everyone who submits a licence application is entitled, within a fixed timeframe, to have it approved, approved with conditions or declined.  I tabled a parliamentary question on behalf of a small fisherman who submitted an application for an oyster fishing licence in 2012.  I was informed yesterday that the engineering section of the Department is still dealing with the application and no further information was provided on the timescale for finalising the process.  An application to build a 50-storey office block must be processed within eight weeks.  The planning authorities may ask for further information but they must give a decision within eight weeks unless the applicant extends the timeframe.  The Department should be able to deal with an aquaculture licence application within a similar timeframe. </p><p> If studies have not been completed on certain bays, licences cannot be approved for the bays in question and people should be told they cannot apply for a licence until the relevant study has been completed.  The idea that someone will submit a costly application and wait for years for an outcome is unsatisfactory.  I accept that this is not a new problem and also occurred when my party was in government.  It is time the Oireachtas addressed it. </p><p> Action 22 is to review and revise the aquaculture licensing process, including the applicable legal framework.  What is the witnesses' view on removing responsibility for the initial and final decision from the Minister and leaving the Department as the promoter of aquaculture?  We can debate what type of aquaculture we want but if the Department's role is to promote aquaculture, surely it should not sit in judgment on licences.  One cannot promote a sector and, at the same time, make decisions on licensing applications.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on having a new legal framework that would provide for time limits, keep the decision-making process at arm's length from the Department - technically it would be kept at arm's length from the Minister, but Ministers generally do what their officials recommend - and introduce new decision-making and appeals systems.  Establishing a proper framework for licensing is a big issue.</p><p> The submission made by the environmental pillar appears to say two things.  I fully agree with its call for a much greater emphasis on using native skills, meaning people who understand the sea and their coastline, rather than an approach focused on large multinational companies.  It would be better to have many small operators with indigenous knowledge than a big bang solution.  On the other hand, however, the submission also frequently refers to environmental impact statements and so forth.  In cases involving applications for seaweed or aquaculture licences I find that if the process is not proportionate to the activity, small local operators who do not have sufficient resources to carry out the studies required tend to lose out.  I am interested in finding out how a balance can be struck in this regard. </p><p> I am particularly interested in the shellfish sector.  There has been a major problem in Connemara with the importation of French oysters and the spread of disease.  B'fh&eacute;idir go dtabharfaidh Mr. &Oacute; Corcora freagra ar an gceist seo mar is m&oacute; tuiscint at&aacute; aige ar an gcladach n&aacute; &eacute;inne anseo.  Do we have enough native species of seaweed and shellfish on our seashores to allow us to forego the importation of species from outside the island?  I understand, for example, that we have some very good and valuable native oysters and we will be in serious trouble if they become infected.  This issue needs to be teased out. </p><p> I was particularly interested in the issue of lobster hatcheries.  I assume these hatcheries use native seed.  I was in contact with a gentleman from Achill for a long time who was trying to promote this idea.  The problem was that no one would give him money because there was no significant commercial benefit to him.  If his proposal had been funded, it would have had a significant benefit for fishermen who are involved in lobster fishing.  This is interesting issue. </p><p> As I stated, the joint committee will make a submission on the document, rather than seeking to rewrite it.  Salmon farming is a vexed issue.  Agreement or willingness to allow fish farms varies from place to place along the coast.  Some communities take a positive attitude to salmon farms, while others oppose them.  The committee must examine the issue objectively.  The document refers to 7,000 tonnes of biomass, whereas Bord Iascaigh Mhara referred to a figure of 15,000 tonnes.  It was intimated to me that one cannot compare the 15,000 tonnes measured by BIM and the figure of 7,000 tonnes - because it is a biomass measurement.  It is a bit like live weight and dead weight for cattle.  For example, a sheep that is measured as having a certain dead weight will have been twice as heavy when measured as live weight.  For this reason, the measurement we are given here would not necessarily be half the size, max, of the proposed Galway Bay fish farm.  I hope I have made myself clear.</p><p> I am interested in finding out the views of the witnesses on the proposed maximum size of fish farms, allowing that they would not ban cage fish farming.  How appropriate is the proposed maximum size, on which there are diverse views?  On our visit to Scotland, people there were stunned to learn of the sheer size of the proposed fish farm in Galway Bay.  I understand Bord Iascaigh Mhara intended to replicate this around the coast in its big bang approach.</p><p> I would appreciate responses to the issues I have raised.  The purpose of meetings such as this is to allow members to get a balanced view that will help us in making a balanced submission to the Minister.</p></speech>

I do not propose to repeat the questions Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked.  On the presentation by the Irish Farmers' Association, Mr. Flynn asked members not to be distracted by irrelevancies.  Will he expand on that comment?  What are the irrelevancies in this debate?</p> <p>  I was interested in the point that the Department could not deliver licences because it insisted that a licence was a prerequisite to obtaining a grant.  Surely grant aid should only be given to people who are licensed to carry out a specific activity.</p> <p>  I accept the difficulties people are experiencing in having licences processed and fully support the two recommendations made in this regard.  The joint committee should make a strong statement on the need to clear the backlog of licensing applications.</p><p>I have been raising the delay in processing applications since 2011, when I came into the D&aacute;il.  I understand it is quite a technical process, but it appears it has been neither resourced nor given a lead Department.  It crosses so many different Departments and institutes that nobody has ownership of the licensing process.  That has been a big failure.  I would agree fully with the 30 week timeframe for the processing of licensing applications.  There is no doubt that an investor hoping to get a licence should not have to wait forever to have a licence application processed.</p><p> On the environmental pillar and the protocol on enforcement, I wonder whether the witnesses could expand on the difficulty that causes in terms of regulation and enforcement of activity in the aquaculture sector.  Any sector must have open and transparent regulation to be reputable.  That is vital.  It is something of which the sector should not be afraid.  It is something that should exist to benefit everybody.</p><p> I would be interested to hear the IFA's views on the future of closed containment fish farming.  I have made inquiries about the funding.  As has been pointed out, there is potential funding of &euro;1 million over seven years for closed containment projects, which amounts to &euro;50,000 per site or application.  I know very little about it, but &euro;50,000 probably would not come to within 5% of the cost, rather than of the 40% level of grant aid.  That is totally inadequate.</p><p> The lobster and crayfish hatcheries are vitally important.  It is something that we should be rolling out, particularly in the area I come from in Donegal, because all fisheries have been closed in area 6A and inshore fishermen can only go after lobsters and crabs.  Have they any detail about the impact the hatcheries have made on stock levels in the areas where they have been operating?  They might expand a little more on that.  That is something we should include in any submission we make on the plan.  It is interesting to hear the views on it.  There are cross-views that this plan probably is not sustainable and is a rush job.  It goes back to the fact that under the EMF we did not get our act together and we did not draw down any funding until maybe the last year of the previous programme.  This seems to be a rushed attempt to be in a position to draw down even the limited funding available there.  I doubt the Minister will redraft it or put it back out to public consultation, but I wonder whether the witnesses would see any merit in a mid-term review, with a proper and wider consultation process as well.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that there was not broad agreement on what kind of forestry we should have in Ireland and what was environmentally sustainable as regards forestry, but it was agreed that if one wanted to encourage people to get into forestry one must be able to grant felling licences in a particular period of time, and substantial work was done by the committee on Committee Stage, and more on Report Stage, to achieve a degree of certainty, which was a big step forward on what it was.  If we, as a committee, could achieve that or at least point to that with regard to licensing, we would be doing a lot.</p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms Dubsky had to say with regard to the possibilities of producing a high-end product.  The same goes for all sectors of food production in Ireland.  We are good at developing for the mass market, but sometimes one wonders whether we are doing enough as a country to develop for the high-end market, which is clearly growing.  Increasingly, consumers are worried about where their food is coming from, for their own health reasons but also for the health of their successors.  If this planet is to be sustainable, consumers want to know that the food produced is sustainable.  Not everybody is interested and not everybody who is interested can afford it, but many who are interested can afford it.  I visited Brittany relatively recently and was struck by the fact that everything around Mont Saint-Michel was labelled.  The lamb was labelled Mont Saint-Michel, the postcards were obviously Mont Saint-Michel and so was the cheese, but we do not do that in Ireland.  There was an effort with Burren beef and Burren lamb, but that did not get very far.  Maybe that means that what I am pointing to is pie-in-the-sky and cannot work.  I do not fully understand, if it can work so well in other countries, why it cannot work here.  I wonder what is being done with regard to labelling a sustainable product with iconic sights in Ireland that tourists increasingly want to come to, such as Galway Bay - viewed from the Cliffs of Moher, viewed from the Aran Islands or viewed from wherever - or Bantry Bay or Dingle Bay, and then getting a premium price for that.  What is being done, what can be done and is there anybody looking into it?  Should the Department be looking into funding the development of these brands or labels abroad?</p> <p>  On the fish farms, I would agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had to say about what we saw in Scotland, particularly with regard to finfish, and how they were slightly taken aback by the scale of the proposals in Ireland.  The shellfish sector in Scotland seems to be much more developed, and also with regard to ensuring that those who operate it have a degree of control over the market, that it is not so dominated by the multiples and that, through the use of co-operatives, they are able to exercise some degree of control.  Regarding the contained farms, how much more expensive is it to produce fish out of these, and is there any evidence that consumers are interested in paying any more for it?  Clearly, consumers are prepared to pay more for wild salmon caught at sea than for farmed salmon, but there is an issue about the labelling of that too.  There was a fairly famous brand - one could get the fish at Dublin Airport - that was flogging off farmed salmon as wild salmon, but that is a different issue entirely.  Is there any evidence that consumers are prepared to pay more and how economically sustainable are contained finfish farms?</p></speech>

I will let the witnesses respond to the points and questions asked and allow the Senator to contribute when he returns.  The easiest way is probably to go back through the rotation, starting with Mr. Flynn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Flynn" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070800002#H00400"><p>This is a big ask, as there were a lot of questions.  I will not get to them all, but let us pick the ones that are most relevant.  The others can be picked up later.</p> <p>  We would very much welcome Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's viewpoint on a better system based on the model used by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is what we thought we were getting with the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act, to which he and other Deputies in the House were party, and to which I was party as well, in seeing through the system and in talking through all of its various ins and outs.  That did not happen for a combination of reasons.  I would point primarily to Ireland not being able to deal with Natura 2000 across a range of issues.  Aquaculture was only one of many areas that it was not prepared to deal with on the habitats directive.  Also, the eye was largely taken off the ball about manufacturing in general, and the food sector in particular, during the good times.</p><p>I recall beating a path to the doors of many public representatives only to be told about the benefits of the construction sector and others over going out and trying to earn a living from the sea.  I think anybody involved in fishing, processing or aquaculture would share my view in that regard.  When a refocusing eventually took place, the same public representatives began to ask questions as to why there were so many licence applications outstanding.  It must be remembered that these applications were for renewals in the main.</p><p> I return to Deputy Thomas Pringle's point about the prerequisite to have a licence.  Of course, having a licence should be a prerequisite in obtaining a grant, with a lot of other things.  In the past, however, one could not seek a renewal.  Where one could not do so, one was granted protection by the Minister under section 19 of the original Act.  One continued to operate, to be inspected, to complete the various forms and pay one's licence fees.  Effectively, one had a licence because one was working as a licensed operator who was playing by the rules.  In addition, the conditions of one's licence still stood.  The one exception was that one could not draw a grant to continue to replace essential equipment.  Anyone who deals with boats and equipment in a maritime environment will be aware that it is necessary to either repair existing equipment or replace it with new equipment.  In many cases, one must constantly invest just to stand still.  If one has plans to develop, has customers coming to one's farm saying, "I would like to buy 100 tonnes this time next year," and one has not been able to make the necessary investment, one will be obliged to just shrug and say, "I cannot do it."  If these customers ask why that is the case, one will have to provide them with an explanation as to why the Department cannot process one's licence application, etc.  Customers such as those to whom I refer have already walked away.  We lost a great deal of that business in the past ten years.  I know the people in Scotland very well and they were completely mystified as to why we could not make progress here.</p><p> We were stuck on all sorts of point.  Whether it is finfish or shellfish, all of the talk about grant aid fuelled development is simply unfounded.  There have been no grants provided, as I think I made clear at the outset.  As a result of the licensing system in place, we have not been able to access capital grant aid for many years.  As a result, the business has been left to stand on its own.  This is a fantastic product and we should be earning whatever we can from the market.  We accept this.  However, from the point of view of there being a level playing field, very successful and much larger Scottish companies - what would be considered large companies here are dwarfed by their counterparts in Spain, France, Holland and the United Kingdom - have access to 40% grant aid.  We do not receive such grant aid, which leads very much to a queering of the pitch for SMEs in Ireland.  SMEs involved in the export trade should be getting a fair crack of the whip if the rules state this is allowed.</p><p> I represent people who have real farms and deal with real fish and shellfish.  These individuals are managing their concerns, but they wonder about what they are going to do.  They are trying to find markets and dealing with real businesses.  It is for them that the plan should be catering.  I was afraid that we would become involved in a long discussion about whether a farm that did not even exist should produce 5,000 or 7,000 tonnes.  Since the issue of Galway Bay was first raised, I have tried to take every available opportunity to emphasise the number of people who have spent the past 20 or 30 years of their business lives involved in this activity.  I accept that we should have a strategic plan, but these are the important individuals from my point of view.  I make no bones about it; that is my job.  I represent these guys - the real people.</p><p> When it comes to questions about whether the figure should be 5,000 or 7,000 tonnes, my view is very simple: if one is long enough in this game, one knows that one does not start with the top figure and say, "That is where we are going and that is what the farm should produce."  One tests the site and discovers the environment and what can one do within it.  There is no one size fits all; that is the bottom line.  The various parts of the coast are extremely different.  It is like saying one is going to grow the same amount of grass on the Burren as one grows in the Golden Vale.  As Ms Dubsky and everyone else is aware, that is the difference.  What one finds underwater off our coasts is just as diverse as what one finds on land.  It is not possible, therefore, to adopt a one-size-fits-all policy in this regard.</p><p> The concept of recirculation is brilliant.  I have seen many recirculation farms in the past 20 years and met many of those who designed, built and are using them to farm all sorts of species.  Those to whom I refer are very good at what they do and their methods have improved a great deal in the interim.  This is not a new technology and those involved in the business would not be unfamiliar with it.  However, it was not invented to replace marine farming.  That was not the point of it.  Recirculation was invented to conserve water.  It was designed to allow a farm to be put in a place where one could have control over the size of the fish, particularly those fish, including turbot and barramundi, which required warmer water.  I refer to any fish that would grow outside the natural cycle.  The variations in temperature of both seawater and freshwater do not suit an awful lot of fish.  That is why they migrate.  Recirculation is required in the case of some fish, for example, abalone, which is a shellfish because the technology makes it possible to control the temperature.  That is one reason for using it.  We have learned that freshwater recirculation is relatively simple. but it remains quite expensive because it requires a great deal of energy.  Seawater recirculation is a different ballgame altogether.  It comes down to the chemistry of seawater versus that of freshwater.  Seawater is a very aggressive liquid.  Without getting into the nuts and bolts of the engineering, one cannot compare like with like.</p><p> Those of involved in the industry are not Luddites.  I do not want a message to go out that we are opposed to recirculation systems.  However, we have to base it on economics.  If it is going to cost &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million to establish a farm that could, perhaps, replace one third of current Irish production, one would have to seek the money from a bank, provide matching funding and factor in to one's accounts paying back one's loan during the years.  When would one actually start to make a return from the business?  There have been many experiments involving recirculation technology across the globe, but, in total, less than 2,000 tonnes of salmon have been produced through the use of this technology.  We produce 2 million tonnes of salmon; therefore, 2,000 tonnes is a very small amount by comparison.  We have to monitor matters closely, but I want to know what the figures are.  I am not going to go around saying this is the answer to everything.  I want to know what the figures are and whether this technology can be used in Ireland.  If it can, we need to know what method of recirculation would be involved.  I know that can be done by means of the use of freshwater recirculation technology, namely, that it produces a better smolt.  This would allow us to have greater continuity of supply during the year and put larger fish out to sea where they would spend less time.  That would be a really interesting way to move forward.</p><p> Major investment will be required.  I am sorry Senator Michael Comiskey is no longer present.  There used to be a fantastic facility on Lough Allen in the constituency in which he lives, at which really good smolt were produced.  However, Leitrim County Council decided to close down the facility a number of years ago.  The facility was a model for what is required in this regard.</p><p>We need good freshwater capacity for the salmon industry.  </p><p> I hope I have answered all of the questions asked.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to cheese, Mont-Saint-Michel and so on.  Behind the lovely artisan stall to which he referred are people who are working hard to ensure the availability every day of the products he mentioned.  There is a substantial operation behind ensuring continuity of supply.  The problem is we do not have this in Ireland.  While I can guarantee that from September to December we will have a particular amount of salmon, oysters and so on available, I cannot because of a lack of investment in our farms guarantee that they will be available from January to March.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, what we need in Ireland is continuity of supply, which means scale.  This year Ireland will I hope produce 12,000 tonnes of farmed salmon, the equivalent of under two days work in production in Norway.  I would like to see that figure increased to one week.</p></speech>

I thought there would be a little more contention on the issues raised.  It is good to see that there is a lot of common ground on them.</p> <p>  An issue which has not been mentioned but which I know has been mentioned a lot by the Marine Institute is that of multi-trophic farming.  I would welcome the delegates' thoughts on the potential of that type of farming or if it is a pie-in-the-sky type of farming that will not be viable for some time to come.  </p> <p>  On the issue of closed onshore salmon farming, each time this issue is raised the question that arises is where has it been successful.  Perhaps the delegates might provide examples of where it has been successful and state how it could be copied here.  The argument usually made by the offshore open cage farm operators is that it is not viable.  Is the opposition to the use of offshore open cages primarily in the case of salmon or is it in the case of every species?  In other words, are the delegates opposed to all species?  </p> <p>  The issue of imported oysters was alluded to.  An issue was previously brought to my attention about a bay which contained native oysters, a number of which it was said were diseased, but in respect of which, after a fallow period, only one diseased oyster was found.  However, there was no recourse to have disease free status reinstated.  I would welcome the delegaqtes' thoughts on that matter.  Every time I raise this issue on behalf of oyster farmers the excuse is that even if those with the authority to do so wanted to reinstate disease free status, they could not do so because of a hiatus in the legislation.  The picture painted is of a licensing regime that is in a total shambles.  This issue has been raised for as long as I have been a member of the Oireachtas.  It is a key issue.</p> <p>  In previous briefings with the IFI, the competent authority in the case of wild salmon, I was told that it saw scenarios where there was open cage salmon farming and wild stocks in the same ecosystem.  It is its view that they do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive, but they do need to be regulated and managed properly.  Would delegates concur with that view or would they take issue with it?  </p> <p>  On the suggestions made around the licensing regime, regulation, hatcheries, etc. I agree that the independence of the regime is of paramount importance to the system.  I voice my support for the recommendations made in that regard.</p></speech>

However, that provision was not commenced.  This also happens in the case of other legislation.  The wider issue of the inclusion of a sunset clause to provide that a section which may logically not be commenced immediately can automatically come into force within a year needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  On the licensing regime being in a shambles, while there is no licensing system on Lough Foyle on the Donegal side, planning for aquaculture on the same Lough on the Northern side is of A grade quality.  We need a cross-Border approach to this issue as the level of habitat destruction in the area is serious.  Many of the farms being established do not involve local people.    </p> <p>  The question was asked if there was potential to label our product.  The answer is, "Yes," but more money is required.  We need to provide additional resources.  We need to ensure our shellfish product is of A grade standard.  Much of it is currently is of B grade.  There is a need for a greater effort in the context of product promotion through tourism.  In this regard, we could do what was done in Boston where an old boat was transformed into a lobster hatchery which tourists were encouraged to visit and taste the lobster produced.  The entrance fee covered the cost of operating the lobster hatchery.  A similar operation, perhaps in Galway, could prove really interesting.  I agree that the hatchery issue could have been better addressed in our strategic plan.</p> <p>  On law enforcement, it is hit and miss.  There are many excuses given on the reason staff do not report non-compliance.  There are more than 600 farms operating, the licences of which have lapsed.</p><p>In 11 years, not one did anything to warrant it being brought to court.  The Department told us that it could not take someone to court if he or she was non-compliant and operating outside the area where he or she should be because a judge would throw out a virtual licence.  Judges like dealing with real licences.  There needs to be a change.</p></speech>

I will make a short intervention relating to fish farms and organic labelling.  I was around 40 years ago when organic certification started in Ireland.  I was at the original meeting on that.  What I see happening with this process in terms of fin fisheries and organic labelling is shocking.  Imagine a farmer in a field.  I live in north Roscommon and there are plenty of farmers around me.  They would be horrified if they were told that they were allowed to spray antibiotics and toxic chemicals all over their land, which is effectively what happens on a fin fish farm.  All of this stuff is basically poured into the water because that is what is necessary to control the diseases that the fish get.  It is crazy, yet that fish is being labelled as organic.  If the basis of this plan is to get the premiums for organic products, it will fail because the product is not organic and is already seen as such in some parts of the world.  We have a serious problem.  We are investing money in a plan, supposedly for the benefit of coastal communities, but actually for the large companies that will operate there.  Those companies will walk away and we will be left with the mess.  It will be another Ispat steel plant, just offshore.</p> <p>  Regarding the commitment of the companies compared with the commitment of local communities, the communities live there.  It is their place and they have been there for generations.  Whatever they do, they are committed to it on a personal level.  They are not large companies.  They do not walk away from messes.  They deal with them themselves.  These points should be taken into consideration in whatever decision the committee reaches.</p></speech>

I know as little or as much as him about dead weight or live weight.  All I see is what we have in front of us, namely, the figure of 5,000 tonnes to 7,000 tonnes.  I agree with Mr. Flynn that the main factor in determining any size is the location of the farm.  It must be, as we have such a varied coastline.  It is worth noting that our largest finfish farm, which is on Clare Island, comes in at approximately 3,000 tonnes.  To increase this to 5,000 tonnes and then to 7,000 tonnes is to double what we know, which will also double the known impact.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about protocols versus enforcement.  I agree that we have a slightly ambiguous law that ties into our licensing problems.  When someone does something wrong, he or she should be caught and should pay for it.  In 11 years, a number of fish farms have operated without licences.  In the past five years, just one fish farm was taken to court.  It won.  That is the only case of which I know, but I am not an expert.  Other groups campaign on this matter constantly and would happily let the Deputy know the details.</p> <p>  Regulation would help.  Farmed salmon and wild salmon populations must live together.  We are not so stupid as to think that they cannot.  They must.  However, the situation is reliant on enforcement.  We need 100% positive knowledge that the farm will not impact on the wild fish swimming by on their way out to sea.  Sea trout spend most of their time at sea in the inshore area.  They do not migrate into the Atlantic.  They spend their time around the Irish coast, so they feel a greater impact from the farms within their habitat.</p></speech>

We mostly fish oyster, lobster and so on.  Lobster is an endangered species.  There are no lobsters because there is too much overfishing, larger boats and more gear.  The worst thing ever was the money given to fishermen last year to get lost or damaged gear back in the water.  Most of those who received it were those who already had money, as people had to put so much in to get it.</p> <p>  Something should be done about the lobster season, such as reducing the number of pots to 200 per boat or starting in March and finishing in September.  I am 62 years old and started fishing when I was ten years old.  Connemara is full of oyster beds.  In 1963, when I was ten years old, I saw the oysters and scallops dead in the bay because there was a heavy frost that year that killed everything.  Before that, an old organisation that had a factory did a great deal of work on the banks, but since it went out of business, no money has been invested in the banks.  We are discussing aquaculture, farming oysters and so on, but if there is too much farming, native oysters cannot be sold.  This year, they were priced at only &euro;4 per kilogram.  They used to reach &euro;6 or &euro;7.  Something must be done to control how many oysters are put on the market so that people who have fished native oysters for years can make a living out of it.  The money is decreasing every year.  No money is invested in oysters.</p> <p>  In terms of oyster hatcheries, spawn is not being put into the bay.  People will fish for one or two weeks per year and clean out the stock.  A great deal of money should be invested in hatcheries for lobsters, oysters, scallops and native shellfish.  Fishing abalone was tried in my area but did not work.  Fishing turbot was tried in my area but did not work.  The first mussel farming happened in my area in the 1970s.  They achieved &pound;600 per tonne more than 30 years ago.  Now, it is not even worth going out.  In my area, mussels could not be harvested last year because of the bad weather.  They spawn in March, April or May, so one cannot sell any caught then either.</p> <p>  The most important thing is that people who have been fishing for all of their years can always make a living from the sea.  There should be investment in hatcheries for lobsters, oysters and so on.</p> <p>  Everyone is discussing seaweed.  Arcadian Seaplants wants to come in from Scotland.  In my area, everyone is discussing sea spaghetti and so on.  Young lads are cutting it.  I hope that people will do it the same way.  Approximately two months ago, I saw a programme about the same thing happening in Scotland.  They used to do it the same way - they cut it with knives and left 4 inches on the rocks - but large machinery came in and pulled the seaweed off the rocks, which meant that it would never regrow.  I would not like to see the same happening in Ireland.  I would like to see the healthy way we have done it for years continuing.</p></speech>

With regard to salmon farms and cages at sea, last year a presentation was made in Scotland by Professor Mark J. Costello of the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Auckland in New Zealand on the problem with sea lice on wild and farmed salmon.  I do not have a copy with me, but it can be found online and we can make it available to committee members.  It is a damning report on cages at sea.  He has listed all of the problems, including the amount of lice found on fish and the types and amounts of pesticide used, and it is frightening.  I urge committee members to read it.</p><p> I have a copy of a letter sent to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, by the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture.  It is with regard to persistent breaches of sea lice levels in Irish salmon farms.  I have yet to find out whether the Minister has replied.  I hope it has better luck with him than I did.  We have not received an answer to any of our letters or e-mails.  This issue will have to be examined.  There are many reports and one can refer to any of them.  There is an issue with regard to high levels of toxins, particularly in European salmon farms.  The list is endless.  Unfortunately, we do not have a budget to hire somebody to research this for us.  We must do it ourselves.  I have a young family and I am being pulled and dragged in 20 different directions every day.  It is very difficult to conduct research.  As far as I can see, cages at sea should be very small and in areas that are not near estuaries, because if large-scale salmon farms are in these areas, salmon or trout coming out of rivers and even trout in bays will all be killed.  The committee speaks about the cost of onshore farms and closed tanks, but are we entitled to destroy our marine environment?  This is my view.  I do not have a degree in marine biology and I am not a qualified ecologist, but I would love to see our national broadcaster or the Oireachtas sending a team of divers with sophisticated camera equipment to see what is underneath the cages in our salmon farms and what sea life is dead.</p><p> With regard to lobsters and hatcheries, I have visited the National Lobster Hatchery in Cornwall and I know fishermen in Bridlington and North Berwick in Scotland.  All these areas have very healthy lobster stocks.  Using far less gear than we do, they can at least quadruple the catch.  In recent years, sending fish to markets in Europe has been a problem for us.  Some buyers go as far as China for fish.  While our stocks are seriously depleted, Canadian lobsters are coming in with no country-of-origin labelling.  Someone in an Irish restaurant does not know whether he or she is eating Canadian or Irish lobster, and this is a shame.  The hatcheries are very important.  From a tourism point of view, the hatchery in Cornwall has everything.  It has T-shirts, St. Valentine's day events and educational visits for schools.  The lobster stocks in the area are very well managed.  It is a real money spinner.  Why can this not be done here?  Instead of being 30 years behind these people, we should be 30 years ahead.</p></speech>

An essential component of this to address the backlog and adequately assess the Natura sites in particular is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is adequately resourced to participate in the decision-making process. Otherwise it will not happen and there will be a bigger backlog.</p> <p>  With respect to the cages and the figure of 5,000 or 7,000 tonnes of biomass, looking at some of the licences over the years, there are a range of biomass figures, as it is in the latter stages of growth that the fastest profits are generated.  Unfortunately, what would happen without proper regulation is the exception would become the rule.  Already, some of these operators, including the two in Bantry to which reference has been made, have been overstocked for three years running and have had a huge escape.  It is a great danger and can only be addressed by adequate regulation.  As to the finfish farm cages, essentially, the fish are being fed in a toilet.  These chemicals are going in and they are dissipating into the environment.  It is a throwback to the old days of "dilution is the solution to pollution".  Some of these chemicals are directed at crustaceans.  I cannot make the connection myself, but it is certainly worth exploring.  It is probably the reason many crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters are missing from certain areas.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the mid-term review.  Mr. Flynn is all too familiar with the loss of European fishery funds to the aquaculture sector.  There is every danger that something like this could happen again.  A mid-term review will be set for the programme if it is approved.  It might be worth underlining that it needs approval.</p> <p>  I find multi-trophic aquaculture fascinating.  It is almost like science fiction, but so are many other things.  I will leave the committee with an image.  The Irish Sea used to be a multi-species fishery and we sought multi-species and multi-annual management plans for it.</p><p>Now it has almost become a single-species fishery.  If we go in the direction to which Ms Dubsky pointed, namely, using local technology and knowledge rather than the big-bang approach, perhaps there will be opportunities.</p><p> Mr. Ewing spoke far more eloquently than I could on what is happening with the finfish farms but I will refer to the operator I mentioned at the start.  The operator credits the operation with &euro;15 million for the Irish economy.  The plan credits it with &euro;50 million.  There is something of an anomaly there.  Marine Harvest in Chile acknowledged it was overstocking cages and over-using antibiotic and it had to cut its operations to a great degree, with the loss of 1,000 jobs.  If that is the way the large-scale operations are going, we have to ask whether this is what will happen to us or whether we can avoid it through judicious input at this point.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the hatchery on Lough Allen.  There is a potentially very big fishery in State ownership at present at Parteen Weir, the Shannon hatchery.  Very little is being done with it.  Have the witnesses any views on whether more could or should be done with it?</p> <p>  One of the things I would dearly like to see is a committee considering fisheries under State ownership, particularly the Shannon one.  I appreciate the workload of this one is such that we cannot facilitate this.  The Shannon fishery has failed miserably.  A variety of obstacles could and should be examined.  One is neglect by the owners over the years and also the State by extension.  We gave the fishery to the ESB and asked it to go ahead with it but what is required of it is nothing like its core activity.  However, it is potentially very important to the Irish economy.  Have the witnesses any views on this?</p> <p>  When I referred to labelling, I was referring specifically to PGI rather than the organic labelling of finfish.  The delegation was very critical.  Would any distinction be drawn between finfish and shellfish with regard to the criticism, or the question of compatibility with meeting the needs of environmental sustainability?</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora should not take the failure to reply to his letter personally.  As a Government backbencher who has supported the Government up to now, I rarely get more than an acknowledgement from any Minister, much less a substantive reply.</p></speech>

That was about three years ago.  There will be a need for a rolling programme of environmental sampling and monitoring of the bay so we will not end up again without licences and unable to produce proper assessments and conservation objectives.  I am sure that over time the conservation objectives might change slightly, so we need to keep up to date.  What are the witnesses' views on the need to continue the monitoring of the Natura bays to keep up to date with the conservation objectives?</p></speech>

That always raises two questions.  First, who would work in these factories?  Would it be the indigenous population?  Therefore, is the gain quite as high as it is made out to be, especially for local populations?  Second, does one have to introduce non-native species to achieve the required quantity?  Is much more in-depth analysis required?  If everywhere else opted for production and the island of Ireland, North and South, decided to proceed in the natural way, could one create a very sustainable industry with mussels from Killary and lobsters and scallops?  Could one create, while taking local people, in particular, into account, a very sustainable industry that would support a large number of communities?  Would one get the extra price in the market if one proceeded in this way?</p> <p>  The second question I have relates to ceist a th&oacute;gadh n&iacute;os luaithe.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag f&eacute;achaint ar Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Conghaile.  Is &iacute; an cheist at&aacute; ann n&aacute; seo.  Luadh ceist na feamainne.

One could also consider this in connection with shellfish.  If a licence were to be granted to somebody to cut seaweed, the cutter would either have to have a grandfather clause - in other words, five years' experience of cutting seaweed of the species in question on the seashores in question - or would have participated in appropriate training on the specific type of seaweed and the specific types of shoreline, such that he could not employ many people who would cause a lot of destruction because they did not know the eco-balance.  Would this be relevant in the issuing of licences?  Should it be required that the people doing the farming &ndash; I am not saying the owners &ndash; should have knowledge of the local seas and nature?  If a farmer does not understand the nature of his own land, all the expertise in the world is of no benefit.  One cannot buy the kind of expertise local knowledge gives one, particularly in the very dynamic and quite complex environment at the seashore.</p></speech>

Perhaps the development is five, ten or 20 years away.  Any facility that has reached production level, with farmed salmon all the way through to market size, has been significantly subsidised.  The latest edition of <i>National Geographic</i>refers to a large American foundation that states it put millions upon millions of dollars into this to determine whether it would work.</p><p>No farm so far has managed to get fish to the market without massive subsidisation because that is the only way it would work.  They have not proved that they are a commercial entity yet and they have not sold anything that would return a profit that would show that it is possible.</p><p> Some deliberately provocative statements have been made, to which I will not rise.  Some of what has been said today is very sad because of a lack of knowledge about the industry, which was expressed through some of the language used.  That is unfortunate.  That is not what I came here for today but I will let it pass because, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, we would need a lot more time.  I urge those who have never been to a salmon farm to visit one, as it is obvious that some have not been to one.  I would be happy to show them around.</p><p> Reference was made to local people.  I do not understand the emphasis.  Who does Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v think runs the farms at the moment?  Who owns them and who works on them?  It is local people.  These are local jobs for local people.  Some people have been living and working on the farms for 20 years and 30 years.  The Deputy knows them and I know them.</p></speech>

It is not always possible to employ people from the local area.  People from all walks of life are living in the town in which I live in Leitrim and all around the coast and they contributing.  They are local.  I do not really follow the point there.  Again, perhaps that is for another day.</p> <p>  Deputy McNamara asked about the ESB in Parteen.  Perhaps I am showing my age but the ESB was one of the pioneers in salmon farming in this country with the Salmara company.</p></speech>

It divested itself of its interests in salmon farming in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  I was not around then but it seems to me that it was not for commercial reasons it was more for political reasons.  That is a long time ago.  Salmara left behind some sites that are still in use, which could be looked at again.  The re-establishment of major salmon rivers around the country is not my area of expertise but it is an issue that should be examined.  Programmes were recently initiated on the River Lee and other water systems with hydro-electric work.  At one time they were the jewel in the crown of Europe&rsquo;s wild salmon industry.  More work needs to be done to examine what happened and what could be done.</p> <p>  On the Natura 2000 issue and ongoing monitoring, part of the delay was due to setting the baseline.  That was a huge amount of work.  Members should be aware of the paperwork generated in the appropriate assessments for the bays at Cromane and Roaring Water.  Our understanding is that the Marine Institute has completed all of the conservation objectives for practically all the bays at this stage.  It is a case of getting the appropriate assessments done, which is a big job of work.  That means having the ornithologists and archaeologists in place.  I would love if they worked for the National Parks and Wildlife Service but whether it is due to recruitment bans within the service or whatever else, they cannot seem to get them online quick enough.  I do not understand why they are not continuing to roll.  The Minister promised 150 licences this year.  Given that it is mid-July, I do not see how that it is possible or how that can happen and where they will be, even using the Department&rsquo;s very conservative timetable that is outlined in the strategic plan.</p> <p>  Shellfish is a real bugbear of mine.  I spent all day yesterday with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority discussing improving water quality for shellfish producers in 80 different bays from Malin Head around to Carlingford Lough, according to the classification to which Ms Dubsky referred.  We were dealing with local authorities on discharges but now we must deal with Irish Water.  Shellfish should be the best in the world in an area that could attract tourism such as the Galway Bay and north Clare area.  One has &euro;20 million coming into that area in tourism revenue every year from two festivals that depend on oysters and yet all the times I have met and talked to the local authorities in the area, they do not seem to get the connection between having clean water, good shellfish and the tourism product they are using.  I do not understand the disconnect.  The county councils have a big responsibility in terms of their investment, planning and where they put holiday homes, including situations where they did not properly deal with the planning of towns and villages near shellfish beds around the country.  There are some prime examples but I am pleased to say College Bay is back up again thanks to our fine work.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service has finally set the conservation objectives for marine protected areas.  However, the Commission is already looking at the issue.  Many of the sites we have were assessed in an Article 17 report, which was sent to Brussels.  It shows that our marine environment much more than our land environment is in serious trouble.  An awful lot of the inshore habitats are not in good conservation status and that means this country does not continue monitoring but must takes measures to get it to good conservation status.  That is almost like putting the two together because when one has grade A shellfish waters, one is quite likely, although not necessarily, to have one&rsquo;s habitats in better condition, so it would serve a double purpose.</p> <p>  I understand the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is however doing something on integrated water management but I do not have the detail.  It appears that farmers would get training and extra funding for agriculture in sensitive areas.  If that included shellfish waters then we would be moving in the right direction.  What was done in the Bay of St. Michel by the French was very interesting because it was a Natura 2000 site and it still contains aquaculture and wild fisheries, but only certain aquaculture, which is compatible with such a fine site.  The farmers were doing a combination of tourism showing people why the site was designated, what measures were being taken to get it to good conservation status and, at the same time, they were also showing small-scale aquaculture and wild fisheries.  The products are all labelled as to location of origin and whether the oysters are native oysters.  They do still have gigas oysters but they are in the process of phasing them out because one of the main problems is that the gigas can become an invasive alien.</p> <p>  I concur with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about the need for in-depth analysis.  The money went into looking in-depth and on spending millions on how to help fish farms.  We should have done it before but now we urgently need money to be spent on seeing whether it is possible for us to develop the industry.  I maintain that is absolutely the case because we have a fantastic diversity of shellfish and crustaceans.  It is possible to develop the industry but we must find a way to do it.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if everybody else was to go one way and the island of Ireland was to go another.  I have been involved in fishing for 36 years and I fish for oysters in winter and early spring in Tralee Bay and it is the best example of a managed fishery in Ireland.  It is also the best example of native wild oysters.  It is coming under pressure from two different sources, namely, discharges and no compensation to the daoine bochta who have to try to make a living out of it.  There has also been a question over the last few years about the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive which have slightly affected things also.  These studies have to be carried out, which is one thing, but I note the following on water quality.  Kerry County Council asked a former Minister to ban drift-netting for salmon as it was damaging tourism, but at the same time in 2006, not one of their waste water systems met with European environmental standards.  Today, almost ten years later, up to 50% of them still do not.</p> <p>  Salmon ranching may have been something like what was happening on the River Shannon, more so than with the cages there.  It was wild salmon and it was the ESB.  The salmon ranching in County Mayo is very good and I have no problem with it.  Lobster hatcheries for crayfish, lobsters and shrimp are to help sustainability as one can only take so much out.  It is like a farmer having 100 sheep on a mountain.  If one keeps selling off one's lambs every year, in ten years one will have nothing.  In the same way, one has to have a breeding stock.  The system we have at the moment is not working.  We are 30 years behind the UK and others where we should be 30 years ahead.</p></speech>

That was 35 or 36 years ago, but very little has improved since in open sea fish farming with the technology of the cages, etc.  The arguments about them are still the same.  I do not know what can be done with Parteen.  Its future may be in something to do with freshwater aquaculture.  However, it was a very exciting time and we really believed in it.  It was a secondary objective of the ESB, its primary one being energy.  It lapsed and largely was lost.  If we are to believe Ken Whelan of the Marine Institute, by and large the Irish wild salmon is already gone.  What we have are mixtures, hybrids, corrupted strains and all sorts of freaks coming back into our rivers and in lower and lower numbers.  It is not a case of being frivolous about that, it is a reality.  We have lost something.  If one reads Fahy's <i>Overkill!</i>about fisheries generally, we have had boom, bust and crash.  That is what I fear for with Irish aquaculture.  If it is not a niche, quality and premium product, the chances are that the same thing will happen.  The image of marine harvest leaving Chile could well be marine harvest leaving Ireland in ten years' time.<br/><br/>On the need for ongoing monitoring, of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, or EMFF, &euro;30 million goes to aquaculture.  Nothing goes to NGOs I might add, just to make the point again.  I have forgotten the exact figures, but approximately &euro;40 million goes to the Marine Institute and another approximately &euro;20 million goes to the SFPA.  I have forgotten the exact figures, but huge sums have gone to enforcement.  It is approximately &euro;40 million.  This is all very well, but if that money can be found for these objectives to keep the resource in a sustainable condition and develop it, surely some of the money can be found for the National Parks and a Wildlife Service.  I do not know what the politics of it are.  Then, we would be working with the competent statutory authority to deal with these AAs.  I will not say get rid of them but it is certainly about sidelining to the sovereign interest accreditations from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, the Marine Stewardship Council and others like them.  If we go with those accreditations without really being in control of what they are and they let us down at some stage, Origin Green itself will go.</p></speech>

Salmon now are for the market in one year.  On the health of the salmon, the fishermen cannot use them.  There is something wrong with them although I do not know what.  I looked at the Dublin market today and there were heads there to be sold for human consumption.  Why can they be sold for people but fishermen cannot use them as bait?</p></speech>

I hope everyone will agree that it has been a very fair hearing.  As I said at the outset, the purpose of the meeting is to help us prepare a submission.  While I am a little bit at a loss in terms of the fishing sector, I can certainly relate to some of the issues that are also relevant to the area I am more familiar with.  It seems that adequate resources to manage the objectives of an expanding sector are always going to be required, if for nothing else to ensure the integrity of what has been stated is maintained.  In the same vein, there appears to be general agreement with regard to licensing, which is complicated.  Certainly, everybody agrees that there is a need for an improvement in the process.  We will have done something similar with regard to the manner in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la has responsibility to respond.  That is not quite satisfactory either.  Hatcheries seems to be an issue which everybody agrees with.  It seems to make sense to ensure that stocks are maintained.</p><p>There are areas of division among the witnesses here today and that is part of the healthy dialogue that should take place.  It takes place here in an open forum.  The members of the joint committee are from a range of groups lest anybody think anyone is trying to put a lid on the nature of these hearings.  From our perspective, it is being done in such a way as to help inform us in good faith at very short opportunity.  As the witnesses will know, the D&aacute;il rises next week and we have to try to have this submitted by the following week, which is the closing date.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for taking the time to come in.  Some of them have travelled a considerable distance.  It is 9 p.m., which is unusual, as the joint committee has not sat until this time at least in this session.  We will therefore adjourn.  I note that as luck would have it, under the lottery system, the joint committee's report on rural, coastal and island communities which refers, <i>inter alia</i>, to tourism and aquaculture as part of a sustainable socio-economic model, will be debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il on Friday.</p><p>As second item up, it will be taken some time between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., but probably more likely between 11.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m.  Of course, it would happen on the same day that the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth conference takes place in Ringaskiddy in Cork but if we defer it, there is a chance we would not get it back on the system.  Therefore, we have decided to go ahead.  There are members here present who had taken the time to contribute to the work on the sub-committee and I hope the Deputies present all will have time to contribute to that debate.  As a committee, we have committed to keep this on the agenda and we are doing that as best we can.</p></speech>

I'll be as, move as quickly as I can through this statement.  I'm here to resume my evidence and discuss with you matters relating to this inquiry during my time as Taoiseach from May 2008 to March 2011.  I wish to reiterate a couple of points I made the last day regarding my own approach to the events and policies that relate to the Government I led during my time as Taoiseach.  In setting out my position and answering all questions, it is not my intention in any way to pass my responsibility to others.  I'm stating clearly from the outset today that I accept my share of responsibility for what happened to our country and our people during the time in question.  Last Thursday, I pointed out that we pursued an economic policy that had a plausible basis, based on the assessment of risks, leading up to the crisis.  I've stated that it is now evident that there was a clear misjudgment of the risks and the possible impacts.  The overall conclusion, when looking at risks and opportunities for the economy during those years and the mid-term outlook at the time, was that there would be a continuation of economic growth, and that we wanted to expand the productive base of the economy by investing in our infrastructure and improving the provision of public services.  I provided ample evidence that this developmental approach is one that was broadly shared across the political spectrum at the time and much of the public debate was whether the rate of improvement and investment was going fast enough.  I've also accepted in my evidence thus far that had we spent less, we would have been less exposed when the crisis hit.  It would have come at a cost of having less employment and economic growth but that in turn would have reduced our ability to come out of the recession as relatively quickly as we have.  One way or the other the impact of the financial crisis has meant a serious adjustment in the public finances, which could not have been avoided in any event.</p>  <p>  I will now outline, to the inquiry, some key elements of my written submission.  The domestic standing group continued its work after I became Taoiseach throughout the summer months.  On the banking front this ... the briefing remained that the Irish banking system was soundly based on all key indicators of financial health, solvency, liquidity, acid quality and profitability.  Irish banks had no meaningful exposure to the sub-prime securities, which were deemed to be at the root of the international liquidity crisis overall.  Irish banks were experiencing significant challenges in rolling over their funding sources and international sentiment was negative.  While banks were working extensively to exploit any funding opportunities available internationally, the banks in Ireland had built up large reserves of assets that were eligible to be used as collateral against lending by the ECB in the event that other funding sources weren't available.  In general, Irish banks were reluctant to access this funding owing to the risk that it would send a negative signal to the market and lead to the shutting down of other credit lines.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank were monitoring the liquidity position on the banks on an ongoing basis.  The Financial Regulator was impressing upon banks' boards and top management about the need to examine all options to pre-empt the emergence of any difficulties.  It was stated that State intervention is only appropriate in circumstances that problems in an individual institution run the risk of creating systemic difficulties in the national financial system as a whole.  Strong performance in recent years of Irish financial institutions was providing a good cushion, it was believed, to deal with the then financial market environment.  By late June, the continued disruption of wholesale financial markets and its effects on banks securing funding on an ongoing basis had persisted and commentary was now suggesting that it would extend well into 2009.  The scale of the impact on the sub-prime housing market in the US was gathering momentum.  Work was also being done in relation to competition policy issues in the case of one financial institution being taken over by another participant, or the prospects of that, and the need to ensure that any Competition Authority approval could be speedily provided if required.  </p>  <p>         Liquidity issues continued to be monitored over the July-August period.  The assessment of the international financial market situation as it was affecting Ireland stated that in the context of the general loss of confidence in the financial sector, the perceived vulnerabilities in the Irish domestic financial sector and the high levels of exposure to the property and construction sectors had come into sharp focus.</p> <p> The share prices of individual banks at this stage were worth about half of their values compared to February 2007.  Irish banks were coming under pressure to maintain dividends.  There had been a decline in growth and lending.  New mortgage lending had declined from &euro;16.5 billion in the first six months of 2007 to &euro;13.8 billion in the same period in 2008.  There was little international financial investor appetite in Irish financial institutions.</p> <p> In the context of international concerns regarding the growth and dependence by banks on liquidity from central banks, while it was noted that the overall level of ECB funding availed of by banks in Ireland had increased from &euro;39.5 billion to &euro;44 billion, domestic banks accounted for just &euro;15 billion of the total, though this figure fluctuates over time.  The increased costs and reduced availability of wholesale funding on international credit markets particularly for longer terms had led Irish banks to tighten lending standards coinciding with the downturn in the real economy driven by the necessary adjustment of the construction sector.  The principal focus remained on the restriction of liquidity to the Irish financial institutions.  Contingency planning in relation to legislation related primarily to bringing an individual lending institution under State protection and at no stage did the work of the DSG embrace the possibility of a systemic risk to the whole banking system.</p> <p> Things escalated in September when, first of all, there were rumours about INBS.  It was evident that confidence was fragile among the individual depositors and this lack of confidence rapidly spread to all lending institutions.  Reports of people withdrawing their money from Irish lending institutions became amplified through media commentary and there was a general disquiet at what was happening at home and abroad.  A silent run by depositors had begun on Irish banks.  It was felt as a first step that ordinary individual depositors needed to be reassured in response to this worrying development.  The Government decided after a consultation with the relevant authorities to increase the existing deposit guarantee scheme from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 and to increase cover from 90% to 100%.  This appeared to have the desired effect in reassuring people about the safety of deposits up to &euro;100,000.  As a result of that Government decision, the amount of money covered under the new terms of the deposit guarantee scheme was over &euro;70 billion.  This decision had the desired effect of providing confidence to depositors who had deposits in accounts up to that amount, in that Government was standing behind those accounts.  The number of depositors covered was numerically large although wholesale deposits were significantly of greater value.  It temporarily bolstered confidence in the system generally, though deposits of over &euro;100,000 remained outside the terms of the scheme. </p> <p> Analysis up to this point was based on information from and conversations with PwC regarding Anglo and Goldman Sachs regarding INBS.  The initial focus by Merrill Lynch had been on Anglo and INBS but this soon expanded to include all six banks, encompassing Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, EBS Building Society, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  The Merrill Lynch draft preliminary analysis presented a number of options and the main elements of each option were considered.  On 28 September Merrill Lynch presented a memo containing more information and an in-depth analysis and this memo stated that liquidity issues aside, all of the Irish banks were profitable and well capitalised.  However, liquidity for some banks could run out in days rather than weeks.  The memo highlighted the need for the Government to preserve the stability of the Irish financial system as a whole and to safeguard the interests of bank customers to avoid widespread panic.  PwC was engaged to review the loan books and the capital position of the six Irish banks covered by the guarantee.  The PwC report stated under a number of stress test situations that all of the Irish financial institutions which they reviewed would have sufficient capital to meet the regulatory requirements up to 2011.  We knew over the weekend of 27 and 28 September that Anglo and Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent were going to find it hard to get through the following week in terms of having cash to conduct their day-to-day business.</p> <p> At the Government meeting on Sunday, 28 September, the Minister for Finance gave an oral presentation to update the Cabinet on the evolving situation.  He made them aware of the context in which we were operating in general terms.  It's noted that no decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting on that day in relation to this matter.  The international banking situation was very volatile and the liquidity position of Irish banks was being seriously affected as a result.  At that meeting the Minister for Finance reiterated the position that the Government was committed to the stability of our financial system.  </p>  <p>         The Government wanted to protect the whole financial system and secure its stability and ensure that all deposits in Irish financial institutions were safe.  By Monday, 29 September there had been more banking casualties: Hypo Real Estate in Germany, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Bradford and Bingley in the UK.</p> <p> Regarding the guarantee night I wish to state that what I relay here about what happened on the night of 29th and 30th ... sorry the 29th and the morning of the 30 September 2008 is, to the best of my recollection, knowledge and belief, a true and accurate account.  However, I cannot be absolutely certain of the exact chronology or events as they unfolded but I believe that this account provides a substantive recollection of that night's events and the process by which decisions were reached.</p> <p> Money continued to leave the system and the rate run increased to such an alarming degree that arrangements were made for a meeting to take place at the Department of the Taoiseach after close of business on the 29th to review the situation.  This took place in the meeting room adjacent to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal office.  It's worth remembering that over the course of that evening, while I remained in the meeting room, some people left the room for the purpose of consultation, information gathering or to undertake some technical work.  All major decisions were taken in the meeting room.</p> <p> From the beginning of the meeting, those in attendance were: myself; the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan TD; Attorney General, Paul Gallagher SC; the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, David Doyle; assistant secretary of the Department of Finance, Kevin Cardiff; the Governor of the Central Bank, John Hurley; deputy governor of the Central Bank, Tony Grimes; chairman of the Financial Regulator, Jim Farrell; chief executive of the Financial Regulator, Patrick Neary; and Eugene McCague, from Arthur Cox and company solicitors.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy, joined the meeting after it had started having been delayed performing other duties in preparation for a Cabinet meeting the next day.  I have a recollection also that another Department of Finance official, William Beausang, was present for some of the meeting also.  The meeting began around 6.15 p.m. - 6.30 p.m. and as I was chairing the meeting, I didn't take any notes myself.</p> <p> As the meetings began, the seriousness of the discussion become clear very quickly.  Governor Hurley outlined what had been happening during the course of the day regarding the lending institutions.  He referred to a situation which had developed at Anglo where it had lost &euro;2 billion in deposits that day and they expected the rate run ... sorry the run rate to continue the next day.  Before Monday, the opinion was that Anglo would have sufficient funds during the course of that week - this was now not going to happen.  The issue was going to have to be addressed immediately.  Bank shares were down in the stock market and he pointed out that Anglo had run out of cash.  He said a very serious situation had developed.  Other institutions were also having significant liquidity problems and unless the outflows stopped and reversed, we were heading into a very dangerous territory indeed.  This had developed into a system-wide crisis.</p> <p> Mr. Neary and Mr. Farrell, from the regulator&rsquo;s office, outlined their serious concerns.  I recollect that they were of the view that something significant had to be done immediately to stabilise the situation.  In that respect, they spoke of the need for the introduction of a guarantee to be considered in view of the serious situation which had developed across the financial system.  I recall I asked the Governor what the view of the ECB was and to provide us with an update as to what the ECB&rsquo;s position was at that point.  Governor Hurley had been in touch with the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, over the weekend and confirmed to the meeting that there was no euro-wide initiative in the offing and just as other countries had to take decisions on their banks, it was clear that we were on our own, we would have to deal with this at a national level.</p> <p> The position of the ECB, of which Governor Hurley was a member of the governing council, was that no bank was to be allowed fail because of the contagion effects that would ensue in the euro area.  In other words there could be no Lehman Brothers type event in the euro area.  Confidence had to be restored as a matter of urgency or else the run rate of outflows would ... could accelerate and leave us with an irretrievable situation.  The Governor made the point that we would have one go at addressing this and if it didn't work, we may not get a second chance to revisit it as confidence could be gone.  Where a first initiative may be deemed inadequate by the market, putting forward a second course of action could then completely undermine our credibility.  His outlining of the seriousness of the situation had an immediate impact on all present.</p> <p> The Minister for Finance contributed to the meeting at this point and agreed with the analysis and the up-to-date position given by the Governor.  He indicated that he felt part of the solution would be the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  I did not think that nationalisation should be a first course of action and I said so.  As I said, my first thoughts in assessing the situation that had been outlined was that if ... I did not find ... that I did not find the nationalisation option attractive as a first response.  I had a number of reasons for thinking like that.  First of all, I did not see it as a confidence building measure at that stage given the volatility in the markets.  For example, would it create an expectation that other nationalisations were to follow?  Secondly, nationalising a bank meant taking all of the assets and liabilities onto the State&rsquo;s books there and then, immediately.  </p>  <p>         The nationalisation option was in effect an open-ended guarantee.  The guarantee option looked like a safer option if it was time-limited.  Given the sentiment in the markets and the state of the banking inquiry internationally, as well as the ... sorry, the state of the banking industry, internationally as well as domestically, there was no likelihood of what has subsequently been termed a &quot;temporary&quot; nationalisation, but a temporary guarantee was a possibility.<br/><br/>The question I was asking was: how do we get liquidity back in to the system and quickly?  That was the most important immediate objective.  Without doing that successfully, all of the banking system could drift into insolvency because the shortage of cash in the system would mean that day-to-day operations in the banks could not continue within a short space of time.  The view was that the banks in Ireland were solvent but illiquid to varying degrees, depending on the institution, and the best of them had, at most, only a few weeks left, assuming the deposit outflow rates did not accelerate.  The Financial Regulator confirmed to the meeting that all the institutions had sufficient capital and were solvent.  Allowing Anglo to fail was simply not an option on the night.  It would have implications for the whole system.  The costs involved in terms of causing a run on other banks as well would put the whole payments system at risk and cause irreparable damage to the economy as a result of a banking meltdown.  It would, in Governor Hurley's words, &quot;set the country back 25 years&quot;, as he put it.<br/><br/>We were clearly in an unprecedented situation, the dynamics of which were moving very fast.  Emergency liquidity assistance is not designed to address a situation when all of the banks are in trouble.  It can work in a specific institution which has liquidity problems once it does not come to public notice.  The Northern Bank, sorry, the Northern Rock example, proves that in those circumstances the use of ELA can have a more destabilising effect and cause the opposite of what was intended.  Putting together an ELA fund from the country's own domestic sources, made up of cash balances from the Exchequer and assets from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the Central Bank itself and simply applying that to the liquidity requirements of banks was not going to restore international confidence and get capital flowing back into the banks from external sources.  The options were narrowing down to a nationalisation plus a guarantee, or simply a guarantee of the system itself.  The other options referred to by Merrill Lynch, which had been discussed, were discounted at that stage.  It has to be emphasised that no decision was risk free.  There was no one good or right option that would guarantee a solution to the problem.  It was about trying to pick the least worst option, and make sure that if we had only one go at trying to stabilise the situation, that it would have every prospect of doing so.  Trying to forecast where all of this would go next was extremely difficult to predict.<br/><br/>It was strongly stated to us by our own regulatory authorities that this was a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem.  At no stage was it contemplated then or, indeed, until the NAMA valuation of loans emerged, that the funding gap for the banks would reach the levels that it did, or that the impairment of loans in the banks would be of the horrific nature or magnitude that came to pass.  I was coming to the view that, given what was potentially at stake, whatever we did would have to have an immediate and dramatic effect in stopping the outflow of funds from banks and, indeed, reversing the trend if possible.<br/><br/>Word came into the meeting that the chairman and CEO of the two main banks were looking to meet with us.  We further discussed it, and I adjourned the meeting for a short break.  During that break I decided to get an external view.  Mr. Alan Gray, an economist and a Central Bank board member, was someone whose views I also respected.  I phoned him and asked him what he thought of a guarantee option being used.  Mr. Gray emphasised that providing a guarantee would, obviously, give an advantage to those institutions to whom the guarantee would apply <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>competitors, since they would have the backing of the Irish Government.  In that respect, it was important to be mindful how other lending institutions would regard it, and he stated that compliance with EU state aid rules would be an important factor to bear in mind.  In dealing with that issue, it would also be important to be seen to charge a proper fee for the value of that guarantee to those institutions who got the benefit of it.  Mr. Gray also stated that if we were considering the introduction of a guarantee of any kind, that it should be strictly time-limited.  This would assist in arguing that it was proportionate to meet the serious situation that was being dealt with.  I thanked him for this advice.  </p>  <p>         During this break from the main meeting, the Minister for Finance and I weighed up options ourselves in my personal office as to where we were at that stage.  We reviewed the discussions from the meeting thus far and he was minded to still go the nationalisation route for Anglo and guarantee the rest of them.  I explained my reservations about it and reassured him that nationalisation was something that we couldn't rule out in the future and would remain an option available to us.  I also told him that a time-limited guarantee seemed to me preferable than giving an open-ended guarantee which a full nationalisation would entail.  I emphasise this point.  We were talking the issues through and there was no question of our conversation being in any way adversarial or confrontational with each other.  Both of us were deliberating and striving to find the best course of action for the country at this point in time.</p> <p> The meeting resumed with senior officials in the main meeting beside my personal office.  We were reminded that the bank representatives were waiting in the building and after some time they were called into the meeting.  The representatives from the banks confirmed that the position was every bit as bad as the Government believed and immediate action was necessary to address what was happening.  We were informed that the money markets had decided that Irish banks were to be avoided.  The bank representatives were concerned about INBS as well as Anglo and they wanted to be differentiated from those institutions in that respect.  Without stating it openly, it was clear to me that they wanted those two institutions nationalised and a guarantee to be provided for their institutions.  What was clear was that these two well-established banks were finding it very difficult to get money to keep going.  They had enough at their present run rate to get through another couple of weeks.  There was certainly no indication from either bank that they felt they were in any way exposed to the extent and level that they believed the other institutions were.  They wanted to be treated differently and sought a guarantee.  They felt there was an adverse reputational impact being imposed on them as things stood at that time.  I did not comment on the presentations made by the banks. We would consider their views but they were not going to be participants in any decisions. They then left the meeting.  It was clear that all the banks were running out of cash and, depending on the run rate, it could be days rather than weeks.  This reaffirmed my view that something comprehensive would have to be done. I was also under no illusions that they were putting themselves forward as safer bets than other banks and what concerned me was that they were looking for a guarantee for themselves while telling us to take what they saw as problem institutions onto the State books immediately.</p> <p> I recall Kevin Cardiff, assistant secretary of the Department of Finance, being asked at some point by the Secretary General, David Doyle, to give his view having heard all of the arguments.  Mr. Cardiff was of the view that a nationalisation of Anglo and a guarantee for the rest of the banks was his preference.  He accepted it was a judgment call and there was no single right answer to our dilemma.  The liquidity problem was the essential initial hurdle that had to be jumped for us to have any chance of getting through the first stage of this crisis.  The market was going to react to whatever initiative was put out there: our collective hope was that it would react in the right way.  I remained of the view that we needed to keep this as simple as possible so that nationalisation was not ruled out down the line, if such a measure proved necessary, as I had explained earlier to the Minister for Finance.  The Governor emphasised again that we only had one go at it and we needed to convey a message that was easily understood for it to work and even at that it might still not work.  The discussion continued about the nationalisation or guarantee options.  I recall too that if we decided we were going to go the guarantee option that it would be limited to two years.</p> <p> Eventually, I put it to the table that it seemed to me that a full guarantee option provided the best prospects of addressing the urgent liquidity problem and of sending a clear message that Ireland was standing behind the financial system - which would be understood by the markets - and for a limited time.  We hadn&rsquo;t much room to manoeuvre.  It would have the benefit of being an impactful measure which could solve the immediate and pressing problem.  It is my recollection that I then asked everyone could we run with a guarantee-only approach in principle.  There was agreement on that and further details would now have to be worked out.  The question arose too that we needed to make some contingency arrangements if the announcement didn't work and Anglo needed some support the next day.  The bank representatives were brought back into the meeting and the issue of liquidity support for Anglo was raised with them.  My recollection is that their response was very cautious and ... as it was a technical issue and ultimately was dealt with in discussions in another part of Government Buildings afterwards.  </p>  <p>         We went on to discuss then what way a guarantee would be structured.  The pricing mechanism and the category of cover was also discussed.  When that meeting ended, bank representatives left; it was time for detailed decisions to be taken.  In deciding upon the senior bondholders, it is important to point out that the holders of these type of bonds in Irish financial institutions include proceeds of Irish pension funds, large credit union deposits as well as deposits from religious and charitable trusts.  While no one would suggest that those funds should be at risk, in law, all holders of bonds of the same category, whether foreign or domestic, have to be treated the same way.  In other words, you cannot protect some senior bondholders and not others.  When considering the case for including existing senior bondholders in the guarantee, we decided that if these bondholders were disadvantaged by not being included, the system would end up relying exclusively on new bondholders to lend their money to the financial institutions with the prospect of driving away existing funders at a time when confidence in lending to those institutions was so low.</p> <p> Later on that night, the question of including junior bondholders, i.e. dated subordinated debt, came up.  I have a recollection of being in the room with the Governor of the Central Bank at the time when this issue was raised.  It had been mentioned earlier in the Merrill Lynch stuff, but we decided that given the uncertainty that was in the market, it might be best to include junior bondholders on balance as they were a very small percentage of the total securities that were being covered and we wanted to maintain maximum market access to the ... for the Irish financial system from outside.  I have made the point before that the great portion of this subordinated debt did not mature during the two years of the guarantee in any event and 80% to 90% was not paid back because these junior bondholders were excluded from the eligible liabilities guarantee which was ... we adopted, I think, in November 2009.  And that ... the maturity of those bonds came up after the September 2010 two-year deadline when the first guarantee had expired.  This meant that there were substantial haircuts when it matured for payment after 2010.  It represented just 3% of the total liabilities covered.  At some point, I was notified that the TARP proposal had been voted down by the US Congress when this was going on as well and I immediately said to myself, "If there were problems on money markets today, what's it going to be like tomorrow?"</p> <p> The Attorney General emphasised the need to get together to marshal the arguments for the EU competition director general to ensure that the guarantee complied with EU state aid rules.  The necessity to deal with an extreme disturbance in the economy is allowed under those rules.  We, obviously, had to meet the criteria and there was also work to be done to prepare for the D&aacute;il the next day.  I do recall there was a drafting process regarding the wording for the guarantee decision itself and arrangements had to be made for the announcement and publication of the decision before the markets opened the next morning.  At one stage in this drafting process, Mr. Cardiff voiced his concerns to me that the draft wording which the banks had given him was too vague.  I told him to make sure that only what we had decided on would be included and to tie that down to his own satisfaction.  Minister Lenihan had at a late stage to ... gone home because he had a very busy schedule to fulfil from early the next morning.  I had suggested to him that he might do that.  He told me some time afterwards that he wasn't present in the room when the dated subordinated debt issue was decided upon.  The decision having been made, an incorporeal Cabinet meeting took place.  Ministers were contacted and the decision was confirmed.  The minutes of the incorporeal meeting that confirmed the decision were adopted by the Cabinet meeting we held on the next Tuesday morning, that following morning, 30 September.  My recollection is I left the building around half three.</p> <p> In the period post-guarantee, the Department of Finance, along with Central Bank, Financial Regulator and NTMA worked with Anglo and other financial institutions to examine all options to maintain stability and proper functioning of the banking system.  Arising from these discussions, in early December 2008, the Government announced its decision to support a recapitalisation programme for financial institutions in Ireland of up to &euro;10 billion.  Despite the Government's efforts to reassure the market by pledging capital support to the bank, negative market sentiment towards Anglo continued.  In December, the board of Anglo told the Government that it required help to raise ... in raising capital.  Merrill Lynch and PwC were sent in to advise the Government and the Minister on what the next steps should be.  </p>  <p>         Liquidity concerns mounted over the course of December and January and approximately &euro;3 billion in corporate deposits were lost, and the liquidity position in the days leading up to nationalisation were extremely fragile.  Further credit rating downgrades were imminent, which were expected to drive a further &euro;6 billion of outflows in the near future.  At that point in time it was not felt that the use of Central Bank or NTMA options to replace this liquidity would be appropriate.  It was decided, following consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, that greater certainty could be provided by taking the bank into State ownership.  NTMA and Merrill Lynch were in agreement with the nationalisation.</p> <p> At the time the decision was made I was in Japan leading a trade mission.  I received a phone call from the Minister for Finance stating that it was necessary to proceed with the nationalisation decision immediately.  His advisers and the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were in agreement that this was now necessary to protect our banking sector.  He confirmed that this was his own view also and then authorised the T&aacute;naiste to call a Government meeting and a memorandum from the Minister for Finance be put to Government for decision that day.</p> <p> An important factor in the decision to nationalise Anglo was the concern that corporate governance issues could destabilise the bank itself and threaten the stability of the wider financial system.  The Government could not allow a situation to develop where the collapse of the bank might have occurred and the Government and the taxpayer would have been faced with the prospect of immediately having to pay out billions of euros to customers who had deposits at the bank.</p> <p> Throughout the bank guarantee period, September '08 to September 2010, it is readily recognised that the European Central Bank provided significant liquidity assistance to the Irish banking system, enabling it to continue to function with the necessary cash for day-to-day operations, which was indispensable to the functioning of the economy.  From the time Greece required external assistance from other member states in April or May of 2010, the interests rates on Irish sovereign debts started to increase significantly.  And by September 2010, Mr. Trichet of the ECB began to articulate concerns to Minister Lenihan regarding the pressure that was coming to bear on our fiscal and banking situation.</p> <p> The Government was committed to developing a four-year plan that would set out how Ireland was going to reduce down its structural deficits to 3% by the end of 2014 as an effort to rebuild confidence in the international credit markets about our ability to bring the public finances back into reasonable balance.  Although the ECB was very concerned about the large commitment they were continuing to make to the liquidity of our banking system, they also wanted restructuring proposals.  Throughout the financial crisis there were more frequent meetings taking place, both at the level of Council of Ministers and Heads of State and Government level.  We were anxious not to have too big a time gap between the announcement of a four-year plan and the budget for that year ... for the following year.  The European Union, through Commissioner Rehn's office, was anxious to know what we had in mind in terms of the fiscal parameters of the plan.  The ECB were liaising very closely with the EU Commission on these matters.  I would say that they were more hawkish in terms of the rate of adjustment they felt the markets needed to see in order to restore confidence, which had been shaken since the Greek crisis erupted.  Minister Lenihan had developed a very good relationship with EU Commissioner Rehn and indicated to him that what we had in mind was a &euro;15 billion adjustment, with budget 2011 the first instalment of &euro;6 billion.  I recall this indication was given in early November.  Being funded until June 2011, we felt that maybe a precautionary program could be discussed with the EU, to be available if we needed it.</p> <p> It became very clear to me very quickly that people were trying to bounce us into a programme in principle.  I have no doubt that there were elements within the EU institutions who were providing inspired leaks to the media with that agenda in mind.  Subsequently, the rumour machine went into overdrive from what were termed generally as "eurozone sources" that suggested we were applying for an EU-IMF programme.  The Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, 16 November heard from Minister Lenihan on the outcome of the previous two days discussions.  He had to go to a Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings that week and, on the basis of the progress that was being made, he was continuing to engage and report back to Government.  The pressure was intense at those meetings.  The ECB were at all times pushing for this position of Ireland being in a programme without explicitly confirming that it would continue to support the Irish banking system.</p> <p> At the start of ... going back for a moment, at the start of 2010, though in deep recession, Ireland, through the NTMA, was able to borrow at rates that were only slightly higher than normal.  </p>  <p>         At the end of April 2010 the budget was fully funded until mid-2011.  Around this time EUROSTAT, the statistical agency of the European Commission, announced that the transactions involving the recapitalisation of Anglo would have to be included in both the measurement of the Government budget deficit and debt.  Although this was largely a matter of statistical classification with no underlying financial impact, the optics were bad because it pushed up the budget deficit for 2010 as a percentage of GDP to a high level, albeit on a once-off basis.  By April it was becoming clear that Greece would no longer be able to retain the confidence of market lenders, it had large budget deficits, long-standing structural problems and low growth, which put its public debt on a clearly unsustainable trajectory.  International perceptions were not helped by a consistent pattern of Greece, unfortunately who had ... where there was data that wasn't correct ... that it provided to the EU and other international bodies.  Greek Government bond yields soared to over 15% and its Government could not borrow any further.  It applied for external assistance in April 2010.  Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, gave an unfavourable rating assessment for Ireland in August 2010 and Irish bond yields, Irish Government bond yields, increased sharply.  At the end of September 2010, the Government announced its intention to withdraw from the markets as a tactical move since we were fully funded until mid-2011.  At the end of September, higher costs of the bank recapitalisation programme were announced.  Mid-October, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy declared that a new permanent euro area financial rescue fund would be set up by 2013 and would require private sector creditors to accept some debt restructuring.  This statement was known as the Deauville declaration.  It was clarified afterwards that the debt restructuring provision would only apply to new debt after 2013.  The original statement had caused further market jitters and the damage was done and bond yields jumped further.<br/><br/>We had indicated in September 2010 to the EU Commission and to the ECB that we were preparing a four-year national recovery plan to be published in November, prior to the budget, which would show that we were committed to an adjustment programme that would bring the budget deficit down below 3% by 2014.  On 4 October Minister Lenihan received a letter from the ECB President expressing concern about the situation of Irish banks.  On 8 November EU Commissioner Olli Rehn visited Dublin and on 11 November the bond yield rose to 8.6%.  Governor Honohan suggested that bond yields would fall to more sustainable levels if the planned fiscal adjustment was implemented.  On 12 November the ECB, the Governing Council, decided that it could not sustain its large exposure to Irish banks.  On the same day, ECB-EU sources commenced off-the-record media briefings leading to reports that Ireland would need a bailout and the discussions were under way.  On 13 November there were internal discussions with myself, Minister Lenihan and key officials.  We were clear that if discussions were to take place it would be, if you like, talks about talks.  In other words, we made no commitment at that point to formally apply for assistance until we were satisfied what the authorities had in mind and the conditionality attached to it.  The off-the-record briefings were clearly trying to create a situation where a formal Irish approach for assistance was being portrayed as a <i>fait accompli</i>by those informed sources, without prior agreement on conditionality.  This was unacceptable to us.  We were not against exploring the issues with the EU authorities but neither should they presume or anticipate what decision the Irish Government would make.  We wanted to know what they had in mind before we would indicate what position we intended to take.  We were looking to explore what possibilities there were before giving our considered view.  At the Cabinet meeting on 16 November the Cabinet was brought up to date about the situation that was developing.  I did not like the continuous anonymous briefing against Ireland, which I saw as an attempt to bounce us into a decision before we had further clarification.  At the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels on Tuesday of that week, it was included in the Council's published conclusions that an EU delegation, with IMF staff joining them for the first time, would travel to Dublin to continue the consultations.  I underestimated the impact of the &quot;IMF coming to town&quot; element, which immediately sent the message that this was now a done deal, rather than a genuine continuation of existing discussions up to then.  This perception was further reinforced when the Central Bank Governor gave an interview with RTE, from Frankfurt, on the morning of the meeting in Dublin by saying that while it was a matter for the Government in the first instance, he said he believed that a deal would be done and a loan would be agreed.  This development showed the Government in a bad light because the interpretation given to events, that we were keeping what was going on away from people.  </p>  <p>         In fact we were trying to put ourselves in the best position we could before any question of formally requesting assistance.  We wanted to know exactly what we were getting into before we agreed to formally apply for the programme.  On 19 November the ECB President, Mr. Trichet, sent a letter to Minister Lenihan threatening withdrawal of ECB funds in the absence of a formal bailout request.  This was not well received by us.  We knew that providing a fiscal framework under the EU-IMF programme gave us access to funds at a cost cheaper than was available on the markets at that time and into the future.  It would provide in that respect funding certainty over a three-year period that therefore gave a better prospect to implement the plan that we were announcing.  We knew that it would be difficult but the plan was robust and rigorous and we were confident that the growth prospects in it were achievable and could complete the journey begun in 2008 to try and turn the country around.<br/><br/>We had a Government meeting on Sunday, 21 November and made the decision to formally request EU-IMF assistance.  Based on the progress that had been made in Dublin, we decided to formally enter talks.  Efforts had been made from time to time to put our corporation tax rate on the agenda, which we refused to countenance.  We were adamant that our own four-year national recovery plan, which was approved by the Government before its detail was shown to the European authorities, would form the basis of any programme we would agree.  We were determined to meet our responsibilities and build on the three budgets we had already introduced.  Though now faced with a funding crisis, by the latter half of 2010 we had halted the severe contraction in the economy of the previous two years.  We have greatly improved our competitive position<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our EU partners and had seen the return to increased exports year on year for the first time since the crisis broke.  The IMF and others were now predicting a return to growth for the Irish economy if the programme was implemented.  When we tried to see if there could be a burden sharing by unguaranteed senior bondholders during the subsequent discussions, the IMF personnel in London were sympathetic but when it was referred to a higher level within the IMF and the discussion took place with some of the larger member state contributors to the IMF, there was total opposition to it.  Mr. Timothy Geithner, the US Treasury Secretary, was opposed because he claimed it would totally undermine market access for those European countries, including ourselves, that were in trouble.  We also understand that the ECB were opposed to it for the same reason.  Without the EU Commission the ECB and the IMF all being in agreement, it was not possible to have the burden sharing issue included in the programme.  It was made clear to us that any attempt by us to burden share with senior bondholders would mean no programme for Ireland.<br/><br/>The Cabinet had adopted the four-year national recovery plan as policy.  The troika representatives had sought sight of the programme before Cabinet considered and adopted it, so there was no question of that happening as far as I was concerned.  We decided on the rate of adjustment over the four years in the best way possible for the country by the Irish Government.  When the troika did get it after Cabinet approval, they agreed to adopt it as a central plank of the programme.  It was, as we believed it to be, rigorous and realistic and designed to meet the economic challenges we faced.  The EU-IMF programme was finalised and adopted by Government on 27 November 2010 and one additional year was allowed to reach the general 3% deficit threshold if required.  On the banking side the programme provided for an immediate &euro;10 billion recapitalisation for the banks and they were required to deleverage.  With the exception of Bank of Ireland, all financial institutions came into State ownership, deposits from Anglo and INBS were to be transferred to other banks and put into wind-down mode.  Regarding the interest rate that would apply, there are two points I would make: the IMF part of the package was based on IMF rules and was a technical issue.  In relation the EU side of the funding programme, we were faced with the fact that we were the first country into this EFSF-EFSM model of funding being provided by the EU and member states.  The ECOFIN Council was anxious not to provide a rate which would make it attractive for countries whose risk premium on their sovereign bonds was so high that the rate available in the EU programme would prove attractive, while at the same time providing it at a rate that was affordable and less than the market price.  Minister Lenihan negotiated ably and secured a 5.8% rate of interest with the proviso that if there were subsequent lower rates available, on the basis of equality of treatment we would avail of them.  This subsequently proved to be the case.<br/><br/>The cost of this crisis has been borne by the people of Ireland.  The banking crisis exacerbated a serious economic downturn, which caused job losses, emigration and a reduction in standard of living across all sections of our society.  The Government took every remedial step it could to reduce the gap which opened up between what the Government was spending and what revenues were coming in.  This resulted in a painful adjustment across all Government activity after more than a decade of prolonged sustained growth.  These spending cuts and tax increases involved a total adjustment of over &euro;15 billion in the four budgets we introduced, including the 2011 budget.  It represented two thirds of the total required adjustment to bring our budget deficit below 3% as required by EU Stability and Growth Pact rules.  We strove strenuously in the design of the four budgets we produced to spread the adjustment as fairly as possible.  The depth of the recession and the measures needed to address it meant that people who were previously out of the tax net came back into it and those who were in it had to pay more.  While highly unpopular, these measures were absolutely necessary as part of the process of bringing order back to the public finances since 2008 to date.  The Government has met the growth rate set out in the plan and continues with the necessary structural changes to rebalance the economy.  The EU-IMF programme also provided the means and the Credit Institutions Act 2010 provided the legislative basis to implement the necessary restructuring and downsizing of a domestic banking system to a more sustainable model for the future.  Thank you Chairman, I am happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

One relates to an article in this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i>by Sarah Bardon that relates to the Department of Finance discussing methods of addressing financial difficulties of Anglo Irish Bank on the same day in September 2008 that the then Minister for Finance, yourself Mr. Cowen, met Anglo officials at a social function.

I am just looking for a copy of it here, I don't recall...  I don't know what it refers to, to be honest with you.  If I could see the e-mail, what they're talking about, it would be helpful.  I saw in the paper that was going to be raised with me here.  If it is, I presume it would have been in the documents that was sent to me but it isn't.  I am free to ... happy to answer any questions people have about it.  My evidence here last week is the same today.  I didn't discuss any issues of substance with Anglo Irish Bank officials then or subsequently.  As I say, I don't know what this refers to.  I was ...

Have you got a copy of it there?  It relates to ... it's an internal e-mail that refers to some issue regarding the State Guarantees Act 1954.  That relates to, if you go back to the scoping paper relating to work that was being done in the domestic standing group regarding the question of the guarantee, making sure there were sufficient powers available if you were ever to do a guarantee, as a contingency planning measure.  I see it there now.  That's what that's about.  It's not cc'ed to me by the way so I don't know, maybe it's not that one at all.  That's the only one that's been shown to me.</p></speech>

I wouldn't be looking at e-mails coming into my office and if there was anything, they would take it out and leave it on my desk for reading material.  But as I said here last week, I don't recall although it may have been the case that some briefing material was given to me generally about Anglo Irish Bank on the basis that I was going down to a dinner there but I don't recollect anything about it to be honest.  The important point is this is any event, a lot of this can be a distraction, the important point is the evidence I gave last week is truthful and accurate evidence.  I didn't discuss anything with Anglo Irish Bank of any substance that day.</p></speech>

Can I just bring up one issue before I invite in Deputy Doherty, Mr. Cowen?

I had a discussion with the then Taoiseach when I returned from being away on St. Patrick's Day to brief him on what had happened while I was away in terms of the calls I'd got and the fact I had referred Anglo Irish Bank down to the regulatory authorities in respect of this issue that they were talking about - an overhang of shares in relation to the Mr. Quinn issue.  So obviously, when I came home, I updated the Taoiseach about that verbally and I don't recall anything after that, from that time on.  There were changes, as you know, after that, but the ... that ... I do recall briefing him on that issue.</p></speech>

It would have come up first of all, I think, in relation to the Northern Rock issue.  The Northern Rock situation had a very ... it had a ... a problem had arisen and they had a sort of ... a banking model that had ... related to that and we were, sort of, watching how that was working out and we, sort of, looked at the ELA aspects of that and how that had unforeseen consequences.</p></speech>

When I heard that evidence, I presumed that, you know, this was John Hurley as the Governor out there checking with banks and checking with whoever knows something about financial markets as to what the situation was and what ... but I always found, when I dealt with John Hurley, you got the Central Bank position, whatever their synthesised position was, but I never ... he never told me, for example, who he was talking to beyond what the Central Bank position was.</p></speech>

But, to answer your question directly, I have no recollection of anyone coming to me, or anyone on anyone's behalf, coming to me, saying, "You should have ... you know, we think a guarantee is a solution."  I've never discussed that with anyone in any of the banks at any time.</p></speech>

And one of the things that came out of that was that you wouldn't use the 1954 State Guarantee Act for a systemic guarantee, if that were ever required; that you'd provide legislation specific to what it is you were doing and you'd incorporate that power into the Act and the D&aacute;il would vote it up or down, whatever.  So, that was a ... if you like, part of the ... where they were looking at legal issues, what ... what ... have we enough powers to do whatever we want to do, in any given circumstance?  Similarly, they were preparing legislation, as you know, for State protection.  Similarly, they were looking at asking the ... would there be a question of the NPRF money ever being used, if needed, as a, sort of, a fighting fund.  The NTMA were being asked to get involved and put their tuppence worth into the arguments.</p></speech>

So, would that be about the earliest possible time that you, as Minister for Finance, would have been aware of the possibility, or the potential, or the need to look at legislation that could allow for a Government guarantee?</p></speech>

I mean the scoping paper was pretty comprehensive, the original scoping paper, and it looked at all of these things.  But it was doing various things at different rates of priority, if you know what I mean.  They were looking at ... it seems to me, looking at all the documentation, and based on the ... what we were hearing back is that you're looking at institution-specific solutions.  You weren't looking at systemic solutions for a long time.  It's only when the trigger comes in, in September, and you have a ... it's not just an easing or a tightening of liquidity; it's an actual, big event happens, like the Lehman's thing, which happened.  And that really, sort of, put everything under stress very quickly, that you start realising they're looking at options ... they're going to have to look at all options.  And then Merrill Lynch, who were employed on 24 September, come with a paper on 26 September and that started to look at strategic choices for the banking system as a whole.  It's coming in that ... that's the way it's coming.</p></speech>

My question is ... is just what is the earliest stage that you were aware that there was a need to start to prepare legislation that allowed for the potential of a guarantee to bring forward?  Was it when this e-mail was circulated that you referred to, which was April, or was it earlier?</p></speech>

I wasn't ... I was, sort of ... I had no problem with whatever preparations they had to do and whatever options, let them be at it.  I wasn't ... so to give you ... to answer your question, I was aware of what the multitude of solutions might be very early on, but I was, sort of, saying to myself, "We have an institution-specific analysis here, the whole way up through summer and into the autumn", so, you know, I was aware that ... you know, I remember ... I was a young TD in 1986 when a Government, at the request of, I think, it was AIB decided to nationalise ICI and that was ... you know, so that was ... I was aware that things can happen quite quickly and people looking for assurances and getting guarantees or whatever, nationalisations, all this sort of stuff.  </p>  <p>         But, to answer your question, I wasn't going around in the back of my head saying, "Oh, can't wait until I bring in a guarantee here."  You know?</p></speech>

Appreciate that.  Can I ask you, in your state ... you refer in your statement to consulting with economic consultant Alan Gray.  Did you consult anybody else in reaching your conclusion on the guarantee options, even in the days beforehand?  And, for each such contact, what were the principal elements of their advice?  And specifically, can I ask you did you consult with David Doyle or John Hurley?  And, if so, please elaborate on the advice received.  So who, in total, did you consult with in relation to the guarantee options?</p></speech>

And I explained before here that the reason why it would be appropriate to talk to him, apart from the fact that he was a guy whose opinions I respected, he was also a member of the Central Bank.  So he was, if you like, you know, subject to the confidentially and other ethical standards you'd expect from a member of the board of that sensitivity.  So it wasn't inappropriate, if you like, to talk to him and it was just to get an external view.  When your in the midst of a crisis like this, you like to think "Is there someone outside who I can ring just to see are we ... are we in the right ballpark at all?"  Secondly, there was no one else there other than him who I spoke to about this.  As regards David Doyle and John Hurley, obviously I was in touch with the Governor and the Department of Finance Secretary General from time to time as this thing was intensifying.  Over that weekend there was a number of meetings which I attended at which they would be in attendance and they would give the view of their institutions or whatever.  And Mr. Cardiff would be there obviously and Mr. Lenihan would be there.  So, in that context, yes, talking to them, but not ... they hadn't ...  I mean, when, when we came to the actual night itself, you know, I hadn't my mind made up what we were going to do.  I didn't know what we were going to do.  I mean, anyone that would claimed they'd know what they were going to do before that meeting would be a pretty ... a pretty clever guy.  I didn't.  I wanted to be briefed, I wanted a discussion, I wanted us to look at all the angles, look at all the possibilities.  But I did, as I've said in my statement ... in an emergency situation, I know the type of man that John Hurley is, or was, as a public servant and how he articulated himself.  He was a man of very moderate language and not prone to exaggeration and it was very clear to me, listening to him as to what went on that day, that we had a very, very serious situation here.</p></speech>

Kevin Cardiff, Mr. Cowen, stated in his testimony that a one-page draft guarantee document was produced by the banks on the night.  Did you receive a copy of that draft guarantee from the banks and what eventually was done with the copy circulated?  Can you outline to the committee the contents of this document and explain to us why a copy of this document doesn't appear to have survived the meeting?</p></speech>

So that obviously is a draft from a bank, in my opinion.  Which bank, I don't know.  But, fair enough, if they wanted to come and have a draft, that's fine.  But the issue is this, that they will have worked off that as a sort of a template but on the basis that we were going to have what we said we were going to have, which was ... it was an extensive guarantee, but it certainly wasn't to be any more extensive than the extent we were going, which was a fair bit.  And as I say, Kevin Car ... Kevin Cardiff made that point to me and I said, "Well, you stick to what you ... you don't agree ... you don't ... draft this according as we want it."  Now, that was that.  So I don't recall that being a very big document.  Three was, you know, maybe four or five lines maybe, from memory now.</p></speech>

And Kevin came back to me with ... not a draft but he was saying, "Look, I think this is too wide", and I said, "Go back and do it right and to your satisfaction."  And eventually he came back with what he believed was an accurate reflection of the political decision that we were making.  And I don't ... as regards where the copies of it are, I cant ... I'm sorry.  Sometimes when there's reiterations ... iterations of things going around, you end up with the final document and all the previous drafts are, you know, they're not part of the process, they're put away or they're ... tore up or whatever.  You end up with the final iteration.  That's only speculation on my part, but I don't have ... I didn't see anything beyond that.  It was this sort of four or five-line thing, you know, based on what you'd be including.  Kevin Cardiff not happy with that, going back out and coming in with something that was in line with what we wanted and that's fair enough then, that's it.</p>  <p>  There's a separate issue then, I think, that maybe some ... causing some confusion.  I might come it to, as well, at some stage and that is ... after we made a decision ... a Government decision was needed to be made late that night and we made it incorporeally.  Part of that decision was that obviously we'd have to ... we would issue a statement to the markets before seven o'clock.  And arising out of that decision then, you would go off and prepare a statement for the next day in line with the decision.  So, I think, there's two things here, there's this-----</p></speech>

D&aacute;il term in July - or whenever the D&aacute;il summer term was finishing up - and we had already, as you know, brought forward an adjustment in the ... Brian Lenihan, God have mercy on him, had brought forward a memo for Government about ... because of the slippage that was coming and the figures, the need to reduce expenditure and we came up with &euro;464 million, I think, which would be a billion in a full year.  But it was simply an immediate reaction by Government to ... a Department of Finance recommendation that we needed to start paring back because the figures were showing, that early in the year, that there was going to be a discrepancy.  It was hard to indicate what the end-year position would be but certainly, based on what it was then, you were looking at that sort of correction as being appropriate for that time.  I'm not saying that it was going to solve all the problem but ... at that time.  So it was clear, therefore, that the Government ... that the economy was starting to slow down.  And I was talking to Fintan Drury one day and I said to him:</p> <blockquote> 	Look, I'm going away, I'm going to try and get a couple of weeks off.  I haven't had a break in a long time.  But before I go away, could we get a few people together?  I just want to talk about people about how they see the economy - how they see things going - because we're seeing here a slowdown. </blockquote>  <p>And I wanted to see was there things ... was there a ...you know, was the assessment right.  It was just, again, to get an outside view.  And he suggested that he'd get a few people together.  I didn't suggest to him &quot;Get this, this, this and this.&quot;  He said, &quot;I'll get a few people together&quot;, and that happened and we had that conversation, as you're saying.  And he said to me, &quot;Look ...&quot;.  It was on a Monday, I think it was, in the week, I think, and I said that ... he said, &quot;Yes, look, do you want to play a game of golf while you're at it?&quot; and I said, &quot;Fair enough, I haven't had a game of golf in a long time.&quot;  So-----</p></speech>

I knew Gary McGann from the time he was chief executive in Aer Lingus.  He was a very reputable businessman ... good businessman ... was with Smurfit Kappa afterwards up until recently.

It was a sort of an informal get together.  I didn't dictate the company and I'd no problem with the company that was there at that point in time.

This was said by Governor Honohan in a book on Brian Lenihan and repeated by the Governor when he gave evidence to this committee on 15 January 2015.

I think it's ... if Professor Honohan says that Brian said ... characterised it in that way to him at some time later, maybe a good time later, well I'm not going to question what Professor Honohan said.  If that's ... if he said Brian said that to him, I accept that's what he said to him but I've explained in my statement the context of that when I was there.  It wasn't a question of me dictating ... overruling or anything.  The two of us were trying to grapple with a very serious problem.  There were a number of issues that were being narrowed down to a couple of issues and one of them was whether we would nationalise or not.  Now, there's pros and cons with that decision.  It's not saying ... you can't say one is 100% right and one is 100% wrong.  You're trying to work it out and what I was saying was ... and, in fairness to him, as Kevin Cardiff put it, that he spoke to Brian about it subsequently, probably sooner than when he spoke to Mr. Honohan about it, he said he felt that we needed to come to a common position on it, which was true, we do ... we did need to come to a common position on it.  And I ... I said to him, "Look, you know, I'm not saying ... I'm not ruling out the idea that at some stage in the future we might have to nationalise a bank - it's not that I have an ideological problem here with nationalising a bank."  That's not ... and, in fact, when it came to having to nationalise the bank, we nationalised the bank.  I'd no objection to doing that once we had gone in and done a sort of a ... we weren't doing it off ... you know, they were doing it on the basis that this was what we now had to do.  It was a last resort - there was no other option.  Because before ... so that's the first point.  The second ... so, you know, he's reassured on that point, obviously.</p>  <p>  The second point is that I was making the case that a nationalisation, you know, as we know, when you do nationalise a bank, it doesn't ... it doesn't ... it's not the panacea, it doesn't solve all the problems.  You take on all the assets and liabilities onto the State's book immediately.  Now, I am aware, of course, that the other option, which takes on a contingent liability, is also very high.  But my view was that a temporary time-limited support mechanism was better than an open-ended support mechanism for one of them and a time-limited support for the rest because, what that might say is ... the market ... I mean, remember now, this is a volatile ... very volatile situation in the markets.  It's like ... you're talking about Wall Street 1929 stuff, no one knows where anything is going.  I'd say, it could be ... it could be interpreted ... it may or may not be, but it could be interpreted that you've identified something and it's going to spread further and you're going to have more nationalisation.  So, really, it's ... it's ... it's ... you know, I'm not suggesting I'm correct or right or any more correct or right than anyone else.  It was a political judgment that we were trying to come to as to what was the best thing to do in the circumstances.</p></speech>

And, remember, this liquidity problem was now 14 months old.  It was longer than any liquidity problem that had arisen since the Second World War.  So that when the thing started, there was a view that, you know, this last might last five months, it might last three months, it might last six months, and as things were getting ... going on longer and then you had the second round effects of the sub-prime crisis in America and how that was affecting that banking system, suddenly you had a real problem and you had the globalisation of risk all over the place, then you had more problems.  And the fact of the matter is that, unfortunately, there wasn't a clear understanding anywhere, as far as I can see, anywhere of what the cross-border risks of all this were and where it would end up.  And when you're left then ... but, say, like, you're on your own, it's ... there isn't an EU competence in this area at that point in time.  There isn't a single supervisory mechanism.  You have to deal with it.  You have your people around you and you're facing this.</p></speech>

Now, that was a mistaken analysis but that was the analysis we had and we had to go with the analysis that was in front of us at the time, the information that was available to us at the time and, you know, things developed ... worst-case scenarios, even stress testing that was being done - and there was stress testing being done by the Central bank and the Financial Regulator - wasn't envisaging the worst case scenario that we ended up with, and I don't think anyone was.</p></speech>

The timeline of a two-year guarantee, where did that originate from and whose idea was it?</p></speech>

It was an issue, I think, that would have been discussed when the banks were there and it was an issue that was decided upon ultimately by just ourselves - the State actors.  </p>  <p>         I was always, I was very clear in my mind that whilst I recognised the views of everybody, the decisions that would be taken would be taken by the appropriate people, not people who were involved in the industry itself.  They were entitled to come and give their view, that's no problem, but at the end of the day we had to make our own mind up.  So, the question ... it was either, the question was whether it would be a one year or a two year.  And the one year, the problem with the one-year thing was that you'd have, would it have the effect, because if you're saying within 12 months this guarantee is up, it mightn't gain traction in the markets at all.  It would also have the possibility of a funding cliff arising within 12 months again.  The two year, how long would this go on for, it already on for 14 months so, the view was that two years seemed to be, in the judgment of those that were there, the best guesstimate they could have of having a credible but time-limited guarantee that would do what was needed to be done and at the same time not be there forever. </p></speech>

Secondly ... a couple of things happened, the, the, the Secretary General of the Government wasn't there at the start of the meeting.  He was, he was preparing for Cabinet the next ... there are various things he has to do and he joined the meeting, you know, it was on a while but not that long, it was on a while before he came in.  And he was the only other one from the Department of the Taoiseach there apart from Finance and Central Bank, and you know, the other people.  So when he came in I said, 'listen up here this is serious stuff' in other ... which to say, contribute here, you know, I value his input.  Third point is that when, when there's ... if you have a Cabinet, I know this wasn't a Cabinet sub-committee meeting but it was, you know, something of ... akin to it if you like.  You normally have a free-flowing discussion and you actually ... note the decision so, so there may have been a bit of thinking on that lines.  But I personally would have liked, I'm sorry there isn't a record, let me say that, I personally would liked there to have been a record.  When it wasn't, when I, ... what happened then that night, when I got two or three hours' sleep, we had to come back, we were in the D&aacute;il, I'd a Cabinet meeting by the following evening.  I mean, I, when there wasn't a contemporaneous note I then, what then happened was, the Attorney General sent me ... advices if you like, which captures pretty well the argumentation.  That was to me within, it might be a letter dated the 30th or 1 October.  Now I know that's a privileged document, but I understand that, you know, you'd be able to ask questions of the Attorney General, even though it's a privileged document.  So that, that might be a way of helping the committee.  I know it's ... you're having to reconstruct the thing a bit, and you've heard different versions because people's recollections are different, genuinely, genuinely not thinking of one thing and not another.  But I have to say, you know, and I have to take responsibility, I am sorry that there isn't an accurate, full note of that meeting.  It would be to the protection of all of us, if there were.</p></speech>

Now, Mr. Cowen, I know you don't have this document and I'm sorry about that, but this is a briefing note that was given to Brian Lenihan as he came into office, right.  So I suspect that everything that's in it is material that you already know, all right.  So, effectively ... it effectively discusses some of the dilemmas facing Mr. Lenihan, "we are now factoring in a &euro;2 billion shortfall in taxes but have not publicised this as yet".  This represents a significant worsening of the position for this year, with serious consequential impacts for next year.  Again, that's something you would have known.</p></speech>

Major financial institutions continue to disclose major write downs. </blockquote>  <p>Now when you left, when you were here last week, in your own evidence you said when you left the Department, you say, you had a co-ordination mechanism in place at the Department but you said there wasn't a crisis at this point.  However, these are the documents that were handed to Mr. Lenihan.  Are you saying therefore that there wasn't, those, those observations and those documents did not amount to a crisis?</p></speech>

The crisis that triggered, the crisis that triggered was triggered in September.  It was a totally different problem in September.  From the previous August, right up to, for nearly 12 months we were , we were managing the situation, it wasn't ... I'm not saying there was no problems but you're managing it.  There's liquidity issues there, you're not ignoring it, you're getting contingencies ready, you're saying if something goes wrong here we're ... we have things in place.  I'm not saying there isn't ... you know, so crisis is something, you know, I don't use it easily.  A crisis is when your, when your State ... you're told that unless you do something big, something's going to happen.</p></speech>

What was happening during that time as well, is there's a Central Bank was organising the banks to make sure they had eligible collateral.  I mean they may, they might have a whole range of mortgages and if they put them in as an asset-based security or whatever, you know, get an asset-covered security, get all that sort of technical work done, they would be able to get eligible collateral.  So what was happening was, the ECB by this time, from September or October of '07, had got involved from the time I think the first problem arose in the Paribas Bank, of providing what they're called long-term re-financing operations.  And what that was doing was, providing the liquidity that was being ... supplementing if you like, the tightening liquidity arrangements that banks were contending with in the new market situation had develop.  So, the Central Bank was actively involved in making sure that Irish banks had access to that collateral and making sure that their collateral was in such a way, organised in such a way that they could get that liquidity assistance.  And that was what was happening the whole way up, and I was making the point to you that, you know, when you consider, after the guarantee, which had the short-term benefit of stabilising the situation and bringing money back into the system, which was critical at the time - without that, I don't know where we'd have ended up - but getting money back into the system, back to levels that were there in June and July, and we'd ... so do you understand me, June and July, we weren't in bad shape in October in that sense.  And we were back to June and July levels, which wasn't bad.  In the context of what was happening, I'm not saying it was normal but it wasn't the crisis if you know what I ,mean.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#R02400"><p>All banks, all banks ... I mean all shares in banks were falling and ours, it's true, was falling higher than maybe the UK ones or US ones ... But, the point I'd make there is Anglo was falling even a bit more than that again.  And what was being assessed as the problem there was, the overhang situation of the Quinn share was having an impact on confidence in that respect.  So, if you like there were, there were reasons being given for these.  I'm not saying you're welcoming the fact that share price is dropping but it was, it was a reflection of market sentiment generally ... of sentiment towards Ireland generally was disimproving plus these, this specific issue that had arisen in March, where people ... there was evidence of short selling going on.  So people were buying share, buying ... making Mr. Quinn put more funds in to avoid the loss appearing and then they making money afterwards.  So there was a lot of manipulation going on in addition to market sentiment, that would explain some of the drop in the bank share.</p></speech>

This was part of the documentation that was given to Mr. Lenihan at his handover.  Therefore, I'm assuming it was information you already had; you just talked about the short-selling.  It was marked, "Highly confidential" and it was a note in relation to Se&aacute;n Quinn and the Quinn Group and it talked about Se&aacute;n Quinn being a major investor in Anglo Irish Bank, had entered into extensive contracts for difference and so on.  It is understood that Se&aacute;n Quinn is very significantly exposed in relation to CFDs and that he has transferred significant funds from within the Quinn Group, particularly the insurance component, to meet margin calls.  And it goes on to say: "The Financial Regulator is actively pursuing the resolution of these funding issues but if not quickly resolved, there is a risk of an event of default with consequent ensuing publicity with potential for far wider implications."</p> <p> So Mr. Cowen, I'm asking whether or not that was information that you had, that you knew about, and what were you doing at that time, given the seriousness of this document here?</p></speech>

That was brought to my attention probably just before I went away on the St. Patrick's thing and ... from the Central Bank Governor that there were rumours to that effect.  It was confirmed to me by the CEO at the time ... sorry, chairman, I think, at the time, Mr. FitzPatrick in a phone call to me.  And I had spoken to the Central Bank Governor before I took that call and spoke to him after I took that call.  And I had referred Mr. FitzPatrick and the Anglo people straight down to the ... I said there should be a meeting this week about that.  I think it was Easter week.  It might even have been Good Friday that that meeting took place.  And that matter was now being taken up by the regulatory authorities who were the lawful people to deal with this.</p></speech>

At a meeting on 24 September, I believe ... We're now in September, Mr. Cowen.  This was just before you flew to New York I think, to speak to the United Nations.  You refer in your own statement to PwC's "hopelessly optimistic analysis of the loan books and capital positions of the six Irish banks covered by the guarantee".  And I'm wondering if you recall whether you expressed concerns about this information, about their reliance on management information.  Do you recall if you expressed concerns or did anybody else at that meeting express concern?</p></speech>

But the point I would make out to you, Senator, is that, you know, there is no process that you could be doing there without having had management information.  I mean, the only way you could have a process other than that, if you like, would have been what happened in the NAMA process, which took many months to do, which was to ... you'd have to go in and check every loan, check the security against that loan, be satisfied as to the validity of that security etc., etc.  Now, in other words, you do it on the basis of a buyer.  If you're a purchaser of loans from a bank, that's what you'd do: you'd check out each and every one of them.  But in a regulatory situation ... I'm not saying that this excuses anything, I'm just saying, you know ... in a regulatory situation, or in a situation like in Pricewater house - and remember subsequently we sent in Jones LaSalle as well - and we sent in those people ... They take a profile of loans and they give you an assessment and it's based on various ... and various baseline scenarios are worked out and worst-case scenarios are worked out and what the trends are and they give you a view.</p></speech>

I'm trying to explain the situation as best I can.  The first thing we had to decide was what we were going to do.  Now I take the point and it's a matter of regret to me - and a former colleague of mine has made this point in an essay in another place - that it would have been better for me to call a meeting ... even if I had to call a Cabinet meeting at six o'clock the next morning, it would have been better.  I accept that.  But my judgement on the night was that we had ... this thing had to be out by seven in the morning, we would talk to all our people incorporeally.  They were all in different parts of the country; this was a Monday night.  They had been up at a Cabinet meeting on Sunday and, probably, the thinking might have been, when I look back on it, that we may well have to consider making decisions some part of Tuesday or Wednesday you know what I mean.  It was ... it moved that quick that we had to make the decisions Monday night.  I just want to give a contemporary memory of what was going on and the context of what was going on.  So ... and I'm sorry to colleagues if any of them feel that we should have had that meeting ... It wasn't meant on my part to be ... not to have a meeting.  I'd been very much a chairman rather than chief, for those who remember my chairing of Cabinets.  But, anyway, the point is that we did have ... we had to make the decisions.  These were the recommendations that were going to Cabinet.  We did have ... we were already due to have a meeting the next morning anyway.  We had that meeting and it was confirmed that this was what we had to do.  I don't recall ... I don't want to get into what happened on at the Cabinet meeting but there was support for the position, put it that way.</p></speech>

On the night there is ... there was a contemporaneous note ... I'm sorry, this is Kevin Cardiff's note, I think that's KCA 00001.  So, this was the note that Kevin Cardiff kept from the night, the one ... you know, the one ... one of the notes that we have from that night.  And he observes in that that Brian Lenihan said:</p> <blockquote> 	Anglo is now a bank with no cash and with fiduciary obligations.  [And he also said] A guarantee might be seen as a banana republic measure. </blockquote>  <p>Do you remember?</p></speech>

But it was ... I think it points up to the need for everyone just to calm down and discuss it all rationally.  I mean. we had to go through ... you know, it was an emotional time, people were getting ... it was very tense and people were saying, "Janey, should we do this or should we do that?", so all I would say I don't recall it personally, but I'm sure if that's ... he didn't make it up either so, if he said it, he said it.  But it was a question of us ... "Look guys, let's take this step by step, you know, we're not ... we have to discuss this out, let's calm it down a bit and let's go through the-----"</p></speech>

I don't believe ... I don't believe now that the Merrill Lynch document was circulated.  It had been discussed, as you know, at a previous meetings.  I'm not sure was it that day, but during the course of that week, there was a meeting at which a lot of people attended which included Finance people, Taoiseach's people, legal people, Merrill Lynch people, Central Bank, others, the regulator probably.

We hadn't come to a point where a decision had to be taken but that, certainly, things were serious.

Mr. Cowen I just want to deal with one more question and then I propose that we take a short suspension.  So just one question before we go.  I just want to revert back to your opening statement of this morning and it's point 79 of your opening statement in setting out your reasons for making the decision for ... to guarantee the banks, you say: "It was strongly stated [it is the very top of the page there] to us by our own regulatory authorities that this was a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem."  Given these circumstances that you've outlined, and particularly the need to inject liquidity back into the system quickly, what different approach could have been taken, if the true financial positions of the banks had been known on the night?  And would have an alternative approach in any of these ways have reduced the losses, which were ultimately sustained by the Irish taxpayer, given the apparent insistence of the ECB that no bank should fail?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#T04900"><p>Well, that's a, sort of, hypothetical ... it's a hypothetical ... it's very hard to answer but I'll try as best I can.  Well, what would have happened?  You'd ... First of all, you'd have to make the decision: do you want ... do you think it's important to have a domestic banking system?  Is it of strategic importance for the modern economy to have a domestic banking system?  I think there's no doubt that the question to that ... the answer to that has to be "Yes", for a whole lot of obvious reasons.  Let's be clear that this is a question of pressing a nuclear button or saying, "Okay, let everyone ... let it fall where it may."  That would have had devastating effects on the Irish economy, devastated it.  And as I say, one person said to me, "We'd go back a generation, 25 years."  Now we went back five or six, let it be said, because we were back to revenues ... it was '05, maybe we had to go back to spending then of '06 to try and get it sorted out over time, or '07, so we did lose some years because of this, the progress that we had made, but we didn't go back 25 years.  Secondly, as people can see, I don't ... and I wish ... I want to make it clear that I wish the people of Greece well in their situation.  </p>  <p>         You know, you can't allow a bank to close, in my opinion.  It's not the problem when the day the bank closes is the problem, it's the next day it opens is the problem.  Because everyone walks in and says, "I have X euros here, I want it all and I want it now."  And every bank business model, however conservative it is, is dependent upon deposits in and loans out, that not everyone that has a deposit comes in and looks for their money the one day.  So, I'm answering your question the best I can.  That's the second point.</p> <p> The third point is there was no cost-free solution.  We were hoping there might be a cost-free solution but there wasn't a cost-free solution.  And the third, the fourth thing is, was there anything else you could do?  Well, what the guarantee did, it wasn't that it brought the liabilities on us that night, fortunately the liabilities were in the system, they hadn't been identified and the market drop hadn't been completed to know what the difference between what the funding gap was going to be.  It was an issue that was emerging over time.  But, what it did do was a), as I say, without us putting up money upfront, it got us money back into the system which was critical to keep the thing going.  So we bought time.  I'm not suggesting that a guarantee is always a solution to the problem but it's part of a solution.  What would have happened, to answer your question, is we would have had to recapitalise much more quickly and come up with money far more quickly for that purpose.  If it was a case that we wanted to keep a domestic banking system and we had problems about ... even if some of them had a problem with solvency, you'd probably work them out over time, but you'd have to do something to keep your system going.</p></speech>

But I suppose the core to the question is, if a true financial position of the banks had been known on the night, do you believe that there was a true financial position?  Was that accurate in terms of the information that you had that evening and did you act upon what would be considered the best information or just the information that was available?</p></speech>

I would make this point to you, that when we sent in people immediately after that night to, as Deputy McGrath said last week, how do you look under the bonnet of these things?  Do you go in and see what's going on?  You know, they came back again with an analysis was that it wasn't as bad as it turned out to be.  So even in real time, when people had time after we had to ... and we had to make a decision ... I mean we could have done nothing there that night.  We could have walked away from our responsibilities and abdicated our responsibilities saying, "I'm not big enough, we can't make this decision.  It's too big."  With all the risks and all the pros and cons, you'll find 20 arguments why you wouldn't do this, and 20 arguments why you won't do that.  And if you lose the sight of the basic thing, that if you don't have a banking system tomorrow or next week, there's people ... hundreds of thousands of people who are waiting for their wages who mightn't get them and all the rest of it.   People find it hard to understand how it can get that bad that quick but to answer-----</p></speech>

As of that night, I don't question the good faith of everyone who was working on behalf of the country that night to do they best they could in the circumstances.  And we can have criticisms of me and everyone else afterwards, I don't mind that, that's life, that's the way life goes.  But what the point I'm making to you is, that when we sent in people after the night to look at it, they came back to us after looking at it for weeks and said what they said, that it was okay until 2011 at least.  So, you know, that was wrong too because the situation ... that's what happens in a crisis, it moves and takes on a life of its own and you don't know where it's going to end.  You have to take judgments and you have to make calls, and you do the best you can if you're given the responsibility of making those decisions.  All I'm saying is that everyone in there who was trying to make that decision was trying to do the best they could for the country.  I can assure you that.</p></speech>

But, to answer ... I don't know why they called it that.  I agree it's not a very ... it's not a very great name, but anyway.  This was an administrative structure really, it wasn't a ... it wasn't an organisation that was set up by way of legal decision or anything.  It was ... it came out of the Heads of State and Government meeting that was held under the Presidency of France by President Sarkozy on 3 October.  And arising out of that, there was a strong feeling, obviously ... where every state was having to come up with solutions themselves, there was a need to try and improve the co-ordination.  The co-ordination mechanisms were obviously not working very well because in a crisis, everyone is looking to their own situation and you're not going around talking about everyone else's problems when you have enough yourself.  So this group was ... it was made up of representatives of the Presidency of, at the time, the six-month Presidency people, whoever they would be.  In that case it was a French official, I presume.  You know, a representative of the Presidency of the Commission, you'd have a representative of the Presidency of the ECB, you'd have member state reps, if they needed ... what would happen is, basically, this would ... you would activate this if you were ... if you were the member state ... let's take an example: if Ireland ... if this had been up and running, Ireland would be expected to make contact with these ... this group to continue ... to improve contingency planning, to make sure everyone was in the know ... that you could exchange information on a confidential basis.  That would be an important part of it.  And really it was about trying to strengthen what was not only the lack of co-ordination but maybe even the absence of co-ordination that was taking place as people were trying to deal with this financial crisis as it was affecting countries throughout Europe.</p></speech>

It's the old issue - who do you call when there's a problem?

Certainly we were facing into economic ... serious economic challenges, there's no doubt.  We had come off ten years of consistent growth and now, as has been said, we had two successive quarters in recession, so we were now officially in recession.  And I was basically wondering, apart from just a public finance response that would emanate from that, were there other things that we could be doing that might be helpful to deal with the rising unemployment and things like that.  So it was that sort of ... to find out had people ideas about we might come through what was coming up economically.</p></speech>

And at that very time, Mr. Cowen, the issues of toxic debt internationally and, for example, the sub-prime crisis, the Freddie Mac, the Fannie Mae, those issues would have been quite prominent, which related to the financial situation internationally and the banking situation internationally, could it be possible really to have such a discussion on the economy without a major reference to the banking situation in Ireland, and particularly how exposed the banks were to property?</p></speech>

You know, you're just basically out there fishing for some ideas.  It wasn't a sort of a formal think-tank operation like that, you know what I mean, where you're sitting down to have an agenda item meeting.  It was basically to just get a read from people as to how they saw the economy going.  Now, clearly, there was, as we know, there was a contraction in the economy, there was a reduction in lending.  We all know that.  And it was what effect ... where might this go or how can we ... just apart from just looking at the figures of it, how do we come up with some ideas that will improve competitiveness in the economy, improve job prospects in the face of what we were facing into?  And, obviously, investment and education and research and development ... looking at all these sort of things as positives in the context of clearly having to deal with the public expenditure and taxation problems.</p></speech>

They were the people that he brought together.  It was to discuss those issues, it wasn't, as I say, about banking at all.  And, you know, in retrospect, I know that people ... if people are of a certain demeanour or a certain mindset, you know, people add two and two and get 20, and there's nothing I can do about that.

But the Taoiseach raised the issue of a broad pre-emptive guarantee [very] early [on].  It seemed to me [that he already had a preference for this approach going into the meeting or that it was at least] the baseline approach against which every other option would be considered. </blockquote>  <p>Can I ask you, number one, if his suggestion is true, that you came there really intent on the guarantee?  And secondly, and lastly because of time, did ... how seriously, if at all, did you and the Government look into the position, particularly of Anglo and INBS, and the figures that Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs had both thrown up to the Government before this night, when it was clearly shown in those figures that INBS was insolvent on the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>

But, as I said in my statement, we got ... we first of all, got an appraisal from the Central Bank and the regulatory authorities as to what was going on that day, and the level of outflows and all the rest of it.  And then John ... John Hurley spoke as well on the ... sorry, the Governor of the Central Bank spoke, and he spoke in quite stark terms about where we were at and how serious the situation was.  And that made a deep impression on me and it made a deep impression on everyone else that was listening to it as well, because suddenly you realised, you know, there are going to have to be some decisions made here pretty quickly, urgently anyway.  So, that was ... that's all, I mean, he said it "seemed to him", one of two things, it seemed to him I had my mind made up, which I didn't, or that I was putting the baseline scenario against the guarantee.  Well, obviously, in the midst of a crisis if the ... if you have ... you can't ignore the Governor of your Central Bank.  The Governor of your Central Bank says this situation is very serious and we could ... and he had been an advocate of a guarantee.  Now, he had said, in his own evidence, that he was ... he only came to that view, you know, as things developed.  It wasn't his original view back, when he came back from ... from having been hospitalised.  He was back around September.  And, he said that in his own evidence, so it ... he came to that view himself, and when he came to that view, I said, well then, knowing the sort of man Mr. Hurley is, if he's coming to that view we are in as serious a situation as he says we are in.  Finally, the other part of your question, we were not ... it was not the situation that Irish Nationwide was insolvent on that night.  We were told and certified by the regulator that they were solvent.  The problem with this ... the problem with this liquidity problem is that, you know, when is it illiquid or when is something becoming insolvent?  These are arguments that you've been having with various people here before ye but I can only go by the advice that I get.  And, in relation to previous, you know, indications of problems or issues that were coming up for banks, including those two that you're talking about, the ... the background to that was that we were being told it was well capitalised and that there were sufficient buffers to meet the situation.  Now, when we put in Pricewaterhouse after 29 September, and they looked at all of these, all of the banks again, they came back and said ... certified them as being solvent.  So, if we had that information before it ... if that was the information we were getting, would it have been any ... would it have made a substantive difference?</p></speech>

We had gone past that point at that time, by the time that was set up, and, I'm afraid you'd have to ... you'd have to ask someone like Mr. Cardiff as to what interaction there may have been thereafter.  But, I just know that it was an effort to improve co-ordination where clearly an absence of co-ordination had taken place before, when everyone was dealing with their own crisis as best they could, in their own way.</p></speech>

Now, I can't prove the counter-factual.  I know what happened when we made that decision.  When we made that decision money stopped going out and not only did money stop going out, money came back in and it stabilised the situation, as I said, bought time, for the ... for us to try and see in what way we could deal with, as you say, a banking system that had got probably too big, and ... and a banking system that was having real difficulties because of the, the property loans and the commercial property loans etc.</p></speech>

I mean, as I'm saying to you, if I had ... if the ... if the thing hadn't happened until 29 October, for example, and we had sent in Pricewaterhouse, as we did on 3 September, and we came back out with the information that they were ... was coming ... emerging from there, that would have given us information that would have been ... would have been reassuring, as it turned out too reassuring, but it would have been reassuring regarding this solvency question, and regarding what was the right thing to do to get liquidity back into the system.  So, I'm just trying to ... you can only deal with it as it is, and there's a suggestion that, well if you had more information you'd have made a different decision.  Well, the more information we got was within six weeks of making the decision.  And that was reaffirming the fact that the basis upon which we were making the decision was correct, if you know what I mean.  So, the counter-factual is this, would it be ... would it have been ... you see, there's no ... I'm not saying that, you know, there's only one answer to this.  I can't say that, because, to be honest with you, if you tried ... if you tried a more intermediate step, would it have worked?  Could you take that chance?  I mean, if, if you ended up with just nationalised ... so you just nationalised Anglo, and you put ... gave a ... this idea of a political guarantee, and you just ... out ... words, saying that we will stand behind the system as necessary.  We had made that comment in relation to the ... when we increased the deposit guarantee limits.  That broader statement was made, so if you like, you know what I mean?  </p>  <p>         And it certainly assuaged the vast majority of people who have deposits under &euro;100,000 in the financial institutions because that silent rummaging stopped and the negative commentary stopped because people could see "okay, my money is safe", because for the vast majority of people that was the, sort of, money they had there but, as you know, there was a wider market sentiment that had to addressed as well.  </p></speech>

You're giving a guarantee, you're standing behind the system, they pay for that so you're going to raise money, if you like, on that bet.  They weren't going to get it for nothing.  They were going to get it for a certain amount of time and if you could get through this liquidity crisis and they come out the far side of it solvent then, of course, you had a situation where you had given a guarantee and had got revenue for giving the guarantee.  But, clearly, you know, that was a best-case scenario in all circumstances.</p></speech>

For example, if it was to be a recapitalisation, that they'd get it from private sector sources.  But that was all dependent on when was this thing going to end and when was sentiment going to change.  And when it did come, within two months we had committed ourselves as a Government to a &euro;10 billion programme and that was on the basis, of course, that we would be getting a shareholding, a value that would have an upside as well in terms of how the warranty was set up and all the rest of it, that we'd get money back in the immediate term as a price for that and we'd get back money in the future were they to come through it and improve their situation.  So again, Deputy, it was a moving situation.  It is true to say - I have to say this I suppose to you - that the immediate priority was get money into the system because if you don't get money back into the system all of this becomes academic in the sense that all illiquid banks become insolvent.  If you can't get money into the system...  You know...  So unless you achieve that first, your problems are going to increase and your commitment to trying to keep a banking system is going to increase.  So that was your first point.  Eventually then you're going to have to get to a recapitalisation phase and a restructuring phase.  You're hoping that you'd have a private sector solution to the recapitalisation phase.  If you haven't, obviously, the Government would have to step in and take whatever levels of ownership were appropriate and still have the prospect of them getting private sector investment by not going for total nationalisation, if you could avoid it, or, ultimately, go to a nationalisation, if confidence has increased-----</p></speech>

Now in his witness statement to us in recent weeks, he speculates on the net cost of the guarantee decision itself and he made the point:</p> <blockquote> 	All in all, a possible net economic saving in the area of &euro;2 billion to &euro;10 billion could be imagined but surely no more than that.  If so by September '08, well over 90% of the net economic cost to Ireland of the boom and bust had become unavoidable.  </blockquote>  <p>How do you react to that?</p></speech>

No matter what decision you made that night you were caught with it or you'd a problem, put it that way, I'm not saying you are caught with it - that loss was in the system.  But the other assist he comes up with is as you say an imagined scenario.  Now I have looked at the report because Professor Honohan ...  I have a lot of respect for the man, obviously, he did a good job when he was in there as Governor, as did his predecessors all work hard to the best of their ability ... the point is that he is saying in his report that a guarantee was required on the night.  Now, he says ... he argues, maybe it shouldn't have been as extensive, and he specifically refers to the dated subordinated debt issue.  That's the issue he refers to in his report, which was 3% of the total coverage.  Now if I thought for a moment  I got something 97% right, instead of 100% right, I'd take the 97%.  But the point is that, even on that 3% issue, as you know, none of that dated subordinated debt matured during the two years of the guarantee and, therefore, was substantially haircutted, subsequently, under the eligible liabilities guarantee that we brought in in 2009, when we narrowed the guarantee.  And let's remember that we agreed to review the guarantee with the EU within six months, which we did.  And the problem of trying to get long-term bond issuance was a critical factor and that's what the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme was about.  But we also took the opportunity to narrow the dated subordinated issue because that was, in fairness, again a call.  You could, in normal circumstances, leave that out, you know, if you were looking at it in a normal market situation.  Just to come to the point.  I'm sorry if I'm ... This question of between &euro;2 billion and &euro;10 billion.  As you know, that's a pretty big difference between &euro;2 billion and &euro;10 billion, first point</p></speech>

First of all, let me say it is a valid thing to put on the table.  I am not suggesting it's not.  This is equally valid as what we ended up with in terms of its validity to be considered.  One of the problems with nationalisation is, as I saw it, was you are taking it on straight away and you are taking it on for an unlimited time.  You do that only if you had to do it, if you absolutely had to do it.  Now on the basis of where were at, I didn't believe we had to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank that night.  Now I didn't have a problem ideologically about that but I decided when it didn't have to be done because of other issues that came into play, like corporate governance issues, etc., then I didn't hesitate about nationalising a bank.  That wasn't my issue.  The question ... what Brian was I suppose...  I'm very conscious of the fact that he's not here so I don't want to say anything other than that he obviously felt - and I've said it very clearly - his preference was for nationalisation.  The problem with that is...  That cuts both ways.  Will it bring on more nationalisations?  Will it be a confidence-building measure or not?  Some would say it will, some would say it won't be.  I mean, in the context of all the turmoil that was going on - and this was unprecedented stuff - my view was, at the end of the day, let's go with a temporary guarantee and if it ends up  we have to nationalise this or any other bank, we'll do it but we'll only do it if we have to and there might be no harm, as we did with Pricewaterhouse, to go in there and get a better handle of what's going in, what way is-----</p></speech>

I have given the reference already.  So this was on 30 September. So later on in the day after the guarantee had been announced, this is a memo by Dermot McCarthy of a conversation you had with Gordon Brown and it would appear to have been quite a difficult tense conversation.  But, Mr. Cowen, can you confirm what was his essential point to you in that conversation?  And was he looking for you to extend the guarantee to UK banks with operations in Ireland?</p></speech>

They had done things themselves and everyone was trying to handle their own national situation as best they could.  I mean, during the debate in the House on the actual guarantee itself, you know, clearly, there were banks in Ireland who were making this point and it was being articulated in the D&aacute;il debate - there is nothing wrong with that.  People were saying, "Are you sure you have to leave .. how are you going to handle that aspect of the situation?"  And we, obviously ... Brian Lenihan discussed all this with the banks concerned and, at the end of the day, they made a decision not to come in on the guarantee scheme because of the conditions we would have had to set for them to do so.  Because one of the things you have to bear in mind is that a subsidiary here of a very large bank in the UK, you know, you'd want to have a very clear view as to what was their situation going into a guarantee and make sure that other aspects of the activity wasn't coming back in through the subsidiary, if you know what I mean.  </p>  <p>         So, you know, we ... I simply said to him that we would continue to work with those who had concerns but that we had a national interest that we had to protect and we were doing so in as broad a way as we could, without taking on more ... we were already taking on a lot in a contingent liability without taking on anymore.  So, you know, it was a civil and appropriate conversation.  There was nothing untoward about it at all.  They had concerns, it was their job to communicate those concerns to us, and we were saying, "We'll be mindful of those as we move forward over the next few days trying to get an EU state aid approval for what we've decided to do."</p></speech>

Mr. Cowen, say in the previous, we'll say, period in '07 and '08, you were ... and even prior to that, you were getting warnings from the Department of Finance officials about the exposure to the property market and could I make reference to document DOF 01962002?  It's Vol. 2, Department of Finance.  And it specifically relates, Mr. Cowen, to a memo from the domestic standing group to yourself and Mr. Beausang back in 16 November 2007, where they speak about that there was a problem with liquidity coming down the tracks for the Irish banks.  So, the question I suppose I want to ask you is that, when you went in as Taoiseach, you would have been ... you would have seen this memo - it's coming up on screen - that was ... and this particular memo was the bones of over ten months before the bank guarantee was put in place.  What type of instructions did you give to deal with this unfolding crisis?  And how did we get to a point that, over ten months later, on the night of the guarantee on 30 September, that, in a room alongside your office as Taoiseach, that people were standing around looking over a cliff to make a decision in a eight-hour period, it would have monumental implications for Ireland in terms of eventually leading to a gross of &euro;64 billion on the heads of-----</p></speech>

And some needed it at different times of the year, or at different periods more than others, and that was a fluctuating situation.  Now, saying that, the total amounts, coming to July, was about &euro;15 billion in total for Irish banks.  There was a lot of non-Irish banks who were getting a lot more liquidity assistance than our banks were getting, because the total amount was &euro;44.5 billion for banks in Ireland.  So, &euro;15 billion of that was, if you like, what we call Irish banks.  So there was ... it was being managed.  The situation was, as I said before, this liquidity squeeze, if you like, went on ... it was the longest one that went on since 1945.  It wasn't initially thought that it would go on that long and that it's something that had to be managed.  Again I say to you that the regulatory authorities were informing the Government that the ... they had done ... they were doing stress tests.  You'll know about stress tests.  It's mentioned in the Honohan report where interest rates go up another 2.5%, what would be the position, etc., etc?  And all of that was indicating that the banks, whilst managing, while there were difficulties, the background was we were getting through this.</p></speech>

The crisis management that was ongoing, and it's ... a trigger moment happened in September ... that's the sort of way it's been described by people who were there as well, like ... people like Kevin Cardiff.  It wasn't just you were managing a tightening situation.  The whole thing ... the nature of the problem changed completely because Lehman's - which is not a big bank in US terms, certainly not a big bank in global terms - what had they had ... what had happened there at that bank had brought about a situation where, you know, the government, the US Government, were practically pleading with Congress, on the same night that we were meeting, to give them something like $600 billion or $700 billion to throw at the problem because they didn't know where it was going to end up.  That's what ... that's ... and when you're asking me what the plan ... the plan was in place that we were ... all of the work had been done.  We had a nationalisation bill ready to go, if that's what we wanted to do.  We had made arrangements to have a fighting fund established, if that's what we needed to do.  We had legislation ready to go, if we were going some, sort of, a guarantee route.  That was ready, you know, so, in fairness, an awful lot of contingency work was done.</p></speech>

You've got to go with a comprehensive response and you've got to make sure that you arrest this thing now because you'll only get one go at it."  And you've got to sit in my position then, Deputy, if you can at that point and say, "Right, where would I be today if I had gone..."  ... I'm not saying ... just ... because we can't prove counter-factuals, unfortunately, but say "Where would I be if I went with an intermediate step that wasn't what we did and it didn't work and the word came out subsequently that I didn't go with the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank?"  There'd be a problem there too, wouldn't there?  So, I mean, the fact that we ... I know we hadn't unanimity.  Like, people had a variant of the same thing, if you like-----</p></speech>

Because basically, it's really ... it's a question of integrity.  It's a question of my integrity as a person.  It's a question of whether I would conduct public affairs in that way and the answer is "No".  And I look to 27 years of public life, against me going to play a game of golf on a particular day, and I put those two against each other.  And that's all I can do for you.  I can't satisfy a curiosity that I can't satisfy because nothing untoward happened.  But if people want to set it up as if something happened, I mean, I can't do anything about that only to say, here under oath, that there's no substance to it.  And there's no indication, subsequently, that there is any substance to it, because it's not the way I operate.  Contact does not denote collusion with people.  I make up me own mind on issues of importance.  I was given a job of responsibility to do; I did it to the very best of my ability.  It is unfortunate from an optical point of view that people say, "Well, there, there, there" ... you know, that happened, and people want to put some, sort of, a wrong spin on it.  Yes, of course, I'd rather it didn't happen.  I'm sure the other people rather it didn't happen too because someone is tying to look into something-----</p></speech>

If I could maybe just ask you one question there, Mr. Cowen, and then I'll move on.  Did you, as Taoiseach, receive any warnings or analysis in 2008 from officials either in the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance of overheating in the construction sector or of a housing bubble, and, if so, what form did that actually take?  Was there ... I know we were discussing banking matters, but there are fiscal issues as well that are in place at the time, particularly ones relating to the housing sector and the creation of a property bubble.  Was that on your radar at all?</p></speech>

Yes, well, I mean, once I became Taoiseach from May on it was clear that the ... after two quarters, that we were heading into recession, so rather than there being a bubble or an overheating, there was certainly an under-heating going on or people were heading in the other direction at that stage.  And the Minister for Finance made public comment about that, and rightly so.  Secondly, it was clear that the budgetary situation was changing and we would have to make adjustments and we made adjustments within a few weeks of the new Administration being set up as a first step, and we brought in an early budgetary recall as a second step, before the budget due in December.  So we were seized of the issues in terms of having to deal with an emerging deficit, and having to come forward with policies that would address a new situation-----</p></speech>

I think in June or July, within six weeks I'd say, Brian Lenihan had a memo to Government setting out reductions in expenditure and outlining what he'd be requiring for 2009, which would be further reductions.  And then implementing those and then moving towards bilateral discussions on the budget in the autumn and bringing forward the budget in an effort to try and create a build ... to see it as a confidence-building measure against the sentiment that was coming up against the country at the time.  So there was no analysis ... to answer your question, there was no analysis of a bubble, because clearly the August to August, year-on-year situation showed a reduction in residential homes of, nationally, of about 3.5%, and that was going to continue but, obviously, continue far more precipitously than was originally envisaged.</p></speech>

So fiscal taxes, stamp duties, VAT returns that would have been coming out of the construction sector and their margin and percentage of what was your annual income of that time, the longevity and how long these would be sustained into the future were not being discussed?</p></speech>

And there was clearly a reduction ... a clear reduction in the ... income taxes were showing okay, and corporation tax a little down, but it is true that the VAT and the stamp duty were showing a significant decrease, a serious decrease, as of the ... as of second quarter.</p></speech>

And as I've said, I hope I've outlined in my statement, because I want to do justice to him as to what his position was, it was different to mine as I was outlining, and we chatted it out.  And we came to the position we came to on the basis as I've outlined, that I wasn't ruling out nationalisation in principle.  I was saying we'd have to have another look, a long look at that before we'd come to that conclusion, but that, clearly, we needed to have a comprehensive response and he agreed with all that.  And clearly, you know, we were all learning from everyone else as this conversation was ... we weren't ... you know, there was no one going in saying, "I have the answer and no one else has the answer".  We were grappling with a situation here which was very serious, and, as been said by others who attended, we came, ultimately, to a conclusion as to what we felt, on balance, on balance, with different degrees of enthusiasm as well - no one was enthusiastic, obviously - but different degrees of conviction, I suppose, what was going to be the best thing to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#BB03800"><p>So when you re-emerged from your private office to the main meeting, was there absolute unity in terms of the position being taken in terms of you're articulating to the rest of the meeting as the chairman of the meeting that we're going with the guarantee?  Was Minister Lenihan full square behind you on that and articulating the same or had he gone home because you mentioned he left-----</p></speech>

I don't want that to be ... That was very late in the night and Minister Lenihan was ... had a long day the next day, and I suggested to him in his own interest ... we had practically completed everything at that stage, so I mean ... you know, he was going to be up even sooner than I the next morning so I don't want that to be taken in any wrong sense at all.  He'd have stayed up all night if he had to, there was no problem.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question of ... sorry, you were asking the question about?  Oh yes, when we came back into the room.  When we came back in ... actually we decided then to call in the bankers.  They were around at this stage; they were in the building.  And they were asked in and they gave their views.  And we listened to what they had to say and we discussed what they had to say when they left.  And then we brought them back in again, subsequently, about this question of how ... would they be prepared to provide liquidity support, help, to Anglo if it was a case that what we were suggesting didn't work.  All of this was being discussed.  And at the end of the day, when we discussed it all out, again, you know, we had to come to a decision.  I mean, people were saying to me, "Look, if we're going to nationalise, we'd need to be making a decision by now."  We had certain things to do, if were going to do something else, you know ... so people were saying at this point, "We better come to a decision."  And I ... so it wasn't for the absence of discussion and trying to work out the best thing to do that we arrived at that point.  So, I said, "Okay, look, based on everything we've heard, based on the need to ... we've only one go at this, that an intermediate step may not be enough, that we have the strong view of the Governor of the Central Bank, strong view of the regulatory authorities, we're interfacing with them on an ongoing basis.  Will we go with the guarantee ... the temporary guarantee, rather than nationalisation, i.e., permanent guarantee plus temporary guarantee.?"</p></speech>

Let's be clear, when I put that, from Department of Finance point of view, Brian agreed, Mr. Doyle agreed - that was the Sec Gen and the Department of Finance - we had ... Mr. Hurley agreed, Mr. Neary agreed, Mr. Farrell, if he was there at that point, agreed.  So the regulator was ... agreed anyway.  I was agreed.  So that was basically it.  We put it and there was no ... we weren't ... there was no dissent, if that's what you're saying.</p></speech>

Can I ask so, if, in your view ... that Mr. Honohan's evidence, in that Minister Lenihan was overruled ... to your recollection and with hindsight, would that represent an unfair account of events?</p></speech>

But what I also say is that Brian also said to Kevin Cardiff ... he put it that we were coming to a common position and that's ... because he thought it was important that we ... and it was important that we do that, so I think that's ... that's sort of the demeanour of ... that he was adopting.  We were all trying to do the best we could, come up with a conclusion, come up with a decision.  And I'm sure he respected my position as well as I respected his, but, you know, at the end of the day, I had to chair the meeting, I had to pull it together based on all of these views that were ... that were being held.  So, in that sense, you know, it wasn't an atmosphere where I was overruling people.  I don't want to get into pedantics here and get into, you know, word games.  I've explained in my statement, conscientiously, what I believe happened.  We had a long discussion about it.  It wasn't in any way an acrimonious ... why would it be?  We were both on the same side trying to do the best we could in a difficult situation.</p></speech>

You mention that you had, during a break, consulted Brian Gray by phone, whose ... Alan Gray, sorry ... Alan Gray, whose opinion you respected and ... just to bounce a few things off and you talked about a guarantee and he pointed out to you the importance that there would be some kind of a fee for that guarantee, obviously, because of the European rules and so on.

I wouldn't think that'd be right.  They didn't look for a guarantee for free.  They never said "Guarantee us and nationalise ...".  It was clear that they were making ... it was clear to me what they were saying.  You know, people can be diplomatic about how they say it but it was clear to me what they were saying.

When the nationalisation of Anglo was being contemplated at the end of 2008, was there any indications as to the scale of large loan exposures involving a small number of borrowers - for example, 70% were &euro;50 million or more in value - or was this not clear until the later NAMA, kind of, analysis?</p></speech>

At the end of the day, the real situation only arrived for ... to be seen in all of its horror, if you like, when the NAMA exercise of going loan by loan through every book, through every transaction, and then coming upon with what the real situation was.  And you'd have had to do that sort of granular case-by-case assessment to get, ultimately, what an accurate picture was.  Now, if you'd done a granular case-by-case assessment based on valuations in October '08, it would be different to the ones that you had in March '09 or September '10, because the market valuation was deteriorating over time.</p></speech>

So what changed that decision?  What brought that on?  Or were we, in fact, with the benefit of hindsight, destined to nationalisation from the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>

They assessed what the situation was for all six banks.  We then had, in November ... late-October-November, you had the Minister for Finance meeting with bank executives, firstly, in Farmleigh and, secondly, in the Department, maybe a week or two later, making the point to them that the market situation had moved where they needed to have capital ... more capital in the bank, that they were going ... that they needed to get capital if they could get it themselves and if they couldn't get it, that the Government were going to have to make our move and get it to get it into the system and that obviously there would be a price to pay for that.</p>  <p>  On the Anglo situation, we had indicated ... of the &euro;10 billion recapitalisation package, that &euro;1.5 billion would go into Anglo, if you recall.  What was envisaged at that stage was that that would probably be worth about 75% of the shareholding.  We then had ... went in and did some due diligence on the basis that we were considering doing that.  And what emerged from that was some of the corporate governance issues that arose.  We also had the resignation of the chairman of the bank.  We'd the resignation of the chief executive of the bank.  We had a situation where ... share price was under attack again because of loss of confidence this time ... completely.  And then there was also liquidity problems re-emerging in the bank in terms of outflows, people taking deposits out.  So that led us then to a situation where we had to consider a further step which was a nationalisation of the bank.  The Minister for Finance took advice on those issues from the requisite people - from Central Bank, from regulator, from NTMA and all the rest of it.  This was now into January and I was away on this trade mission in Japan and he rang me to discuss all this with me and say to me that he felt that we now needed to urgently nationalise the bank.  I discussed that with him as to who was saying that, what was the ... what was the background to that.  He went through all that in great detail and I then said, "Okay, we'll authorise the holding of a Government meeting and you can put a memo to Cabinet today."  </p></speech>

Mr. Cowen, you're welcome.  Mr. Cowen, you've mentioned on numerous occasions today about the PwC analysis that occurred subsequent to the guarantee.  That's Project Atlas.  Were you aware that the PwC work took the valuations that the banks had and found the result that the banks were solvent based upon the banks' valuations?</p></speech>

But we had also sent in, as you will recall, valuers ... independent valuers as well ... subsequently, as well, so to try and get as much information as we could that wouldn't be just reliant on management information but also valuers like Jones LaSalle ... Lang LaSalle going in to work with PwC.  So we ... that was our, if you like, our extra effort to objectivise the thing as best we could.</p></speech>

Yes, I mean, all of us were surprised.  I mean, the Minister for Finance employed Mr. Bacon to assist him in dealing with the next part of the problem which was: how do you make sure that banks continue lending?  </p>  <p>         And one of the ways you do that is you look at the options with how you deal with the non-performing, or the non-performing loans as you'd call them, or the loans that weren't being repaid, what do you do with those?  How do you get a valuation method in place that would be accurate ... reasonably accurate...  so that if you did go then that road, that whatever further responsibility the State was taking on to deal with those assets in order to make sure the bank got back to some sort of a functioning system to support the economy in some way, how could you make sure that you could accurately forecast the real valuation of those in the context where the market wasn't working and where you're going to avoid fire sales obviously and do this over a period of time?  And I think that the work that he did was very helpful to the Minister and to the Government in coming to the decisions we came to.</p></speech>

And I'm quoting Department of Finance booklet Vol. 2. I'm not sure if that booklet was made available to Mr. Cowen but the, it's the memorandum from Merrill Lynch, it's page 113, dated 28 September 2008.  And the second last paragraph, the last line of that and it states, "The liquidity issues facing the Irish banks are compounded by investor concerns with regard to the high concentration of commercial property risk in their respective asset portfolios."

I'm talking about the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Civil Service also, as well as the body, as well as the Government ... were unaware and yet the market sentiment was very clear and was very clear from a long period of time?</p></speech>

We weren't unaware of that.  The problem was being able to accurately evaluate where all this was going to end up.  And that was a big problem.  So ... and the efforts that we were making both before and after the guarantee decisions, was about trying to get more information, more of what we thought would be accurate information.  But as you know, as the markets situation was, you know ... this was a moving matrix every time you looked at it as far as I could see.  That you had a situation where we had to put in capitalisation ... recapitalise for the purpose of meeting market requirements for capital ratios, that was the first thing.  Then by spring of that year when we got into the NAMA process or got into a NAMA-type decision - set that up administratively.  Get into the business of getting full cooperated in the banks to get into the case-by-case state of the loan books.  You know all of this.  The disadvantage of it was it was taking time to do that.  But at the end of the day when it's all boiled down, the only way you could be sure of where you stood in all this was to do a case-by-case assessment and spend that time.</p>  <p>  As you said before, as I think was said before, you know, going into the D&aacute;il with a policy proposal such as this, you know, quite rightly the Opposition and the Government representatives or Government Deputies would be saying, "Well what are we talking about here, what sort of scale are we ... do we envisage?".  And you'd then give your best guesstimate at that point.  And of course that doesn't prove right but once you put that out there then that becomes a benchmark, and if it's over that you're criticised, but if you don't give the information you're wrong as well.  You know what I mean?  You're trying to get your handle around a very, very big problem.  Get your arms around a very big, very big problem very quickly.  So on the one hand, you know you must have due diligence, clearly, and on the other hand people want information that when they're being asked to support legislative proposals that they have a good idea what it is they're being asked to support.</p></speech>

And Merrill Lynch say, "It is clear that certain lowly rated monoline banking models around the world, were there is concentration on a single asset class (such as commercial property) are likely to be unviable as wholesale markets stay closed to them."  Did you expect that you would be nationalising either one or two financial institutions in a matter of weeks on the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>

I mean at the end of the day, it may be that we had to take a position in terms of the capitalisation of some of these, and take a shareholding, which was the initial thinking we had on the Anglo situation when we were putting in the &euro;1.5 billion.  But other issues then came into play there which meant we had to go the full nationalisation route straight away.</p></speech>

I mean there was a lot of competition for deposits.  And you know there was some indications from the other side of the water too that, you know, banks, Irish banks here were being talked down.

It was causing a lot of problems, people were calling into their bank branches looking for their money, you know people were wondering was their money safe.  And, that was a public concern that needed to be addressed and addressed quickly.  We hadn't ... at European level there was already discussion going on about trying to harmonise, or trying to coordinate all of these national deposit guarantee schemes to try and get some sort of a European norm if you like established.  But obviously this issue had arisen for us in the context of those discussions being ongoing.  I mean they weren't going to be resolved very quickly but there was this background policy development going on in the back at EU level.  So we met on this point and I wasn't there myself, I don't know was Brian at it, but certainly the recommendation that came from that meeting was that we should increase the deposit guarantee scheme from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  I agree that it was a bit larger than elsewhere.  I think in UK it was &pound;35,000, but in fairness within a few weeks most of them were up to the &euro;100,000 mark as well.  Most of them reacted ... we just reacted maybe quicker than the rest because it was coming to us quicker than the rest.</p></speech>

And ... because they looked I think at &euro;80,000 and then &euro;100,000.  So they came to the considered view, "Look you need to get this to stop."

I take the point that it was a &euro;70 billion contingency but, I mean, it had to be done.

And thank you Mr. Cowen, you're very welcome back.  In your opening statement on paragraph 59 you talk about the ECB role in the guarantee decision and you state that "The position of the ECB ... was that no bank was to be allowed to fail".  And we have this, that this came from Trichet through the Governor.  How would you regard that position of the ECB, would you regard it as an order from the ECB or a threat?</p></speech>

So, in other words, if you were to allow that to happen then and not abide by that, apart from dealing with the problems you're going to have to deal with, which in my opinion would have meant a run on all your banks, would have made no sense.  But even if you allowed it to happen, then you ... it would be very hard to find a co-operative ECB in the future to fund your banking system with liquidity.</p></speech>

We were asking the question of, is there any prospect of a European initiative coming here?  Is there any prospect of the euro ... the European level interjecting here to try and see can we arrest the problem?  And the problem was, as you know, probably people have all talked about it now is that, you know, at the time of the design of the euro in 1999 there isn't an EU competence ... there wasn't an EU competence on the supervisory side at that point.  There is, thankfully, now and that's sort of a response to what's happened but at the time there wasn't.</p></speech>

I was conscious of the fact, by the way, that we were a sovereign Government, we had to make a decision as we understood it, as to what was in our national interest.

There were other cases where the Germans had sought to protect or to guarantee a bank earlier, not immediately earlier, but I read documentation on it where they weren't able to get the approval through because they hadn't put a time limit on it.

And Kevin Cardiff wrote in his long statement on page 77:</p> <blockquote> 	it was also evident that some governments had provided background briefings to journalists denigrating the Irish decision and its lack of community spirit.  Worse than that, some of those briefings appeared to be deliberately seeking to question the validity and reliability of the guarantee. </blockquote>  <p>Why, in your view, would other eurozone countries want to undermine the Irish guarantee and how real was that threat at that point in time?</p></speech>

I was the person who represented the country at that meeting.  It wasn't an easy meeting for us, I suppose, because you know, we had to do what we had to do as others were doing their thing and they were afraid, I suppose, of the effect that this would have on their flows, you know, would Ireland suddenly become a location for funds to come to Ireland that would otherwise stay in country A, B or C or whatever it was.  And I think that was an over-exaggerated view anyway.  We were simply trying to retrieve what we had lost, we were not trying to take anyone else's resources or treasury, you know.  We were trying to get back into a viable position ourselves from a liquidity point of view in terms of cash in the system.  And we were a small part of the overall financial system in Europe anyway.  So, I hear what he has to say about that, he obviously observed that from some of his official contacts in other jurisdictions.  I don't think it was warranted, if that was their view.</p></speech>

It's the January financial stability issue scoping paper, which we discussed last week.  You said earlier on this morning this was the longest liquidity squeeze since 1945.  You said that about the September period.  </p>  <p>               Nine months earlier in this scoping paper it said "If a period of illiquidity continues it is likely that an illiquid institution will move closer to insolvency."  Then nine months later ... how long does that period have to be?  We're in the longest period since 1945, before these solvency issues start to be questioned by-----</p></speech>

We'd reached the situation in relation to Anglo Irish Bank then, where that ... they had run out of cash.  So now you're next ... you're down then to some ... you're down then to ... do you let this illiquidity become an insolvency and let it go?  What's the impact of that in your wider economy?  It's devastating from the advice we're getting, okay.  It is systemic and by the way, there was a lot of debate in subsequent years about whether it was systemic or not, Patrick Honohan makes it very clear it was systemic.  He makes it clear that a guarantee was required, he has views as to the extension ... the extensiveness of it but he accepts it was required.  So, you know, that's ... when you've reached that point you have to make these decisions and ... what I made in the point earlier as well, Deputy Murphy, is that post-Lehman's, post mid-September, that trigger point meant that the liquidity problem that was being managed - being managed with difficulty, but being managed - turned into a horse of a different colour altogether and that's a problem.</p></speech>

You talk about trusting the advice on the night, because that same scoping paper, on page 16, and this was written nine months previously to September, says that:</p> <blockquote> 	In a period of severe financial markets turmoil, it may be very difficult to determine the true worth of the bank's assets, including its net contingent assets. ... it is much more difficult for a central bank or a financial regulator to know whether the bank is just illiquid or has become insolvent, especially in the light of the incentives a bank may have to disguise its true state of health from a central bank or financial regulator. </blockquote>  <p>And earlier today you said no-one knew where anything was going, this was 1927 stuff-----</p></speech>

What do you think is the situation and what's your basis for saying that?" and they gave us the basis for saying that.  Now, the point I'm making to you in turn, and I accept these are difficult situations, if it's insolvent, what do you do with it?  If you let it go you're told "It's a disorderly wind-up and you're in bigger trouble."  If you nationalise it you're taking on all the liabilities there and then anyway.  So now you're taking on the losses.  If you go with a temporary guarantee and a contingency and you hope the liquidity thing will sort itself out, you may well end up in a situation where you might have to provide some recapitalisation down the line but you will have a shareholding for it in a bank that's viable, or that bit of it that's viable.</p>  <p>  You're trying ... these are ... you know, and I'm ... I know by the, you know, the questions you're asking me that obviously you, you know what you're talking about as well.  I'm trying to explain, you know, you can't ... you've got to ... what's ... you can't kill everything with the one stone, do you know what I mean?  You can't ... you've got to say "What is the most important thing here as  we ... from where we stand?"  And the most important thing from where we stood was, if there isn't cash got into this system pronto, now, immediately - if we don't get that in, this whole thing can go wrong on you.</p></speech>

Because in March of '08 you had the Governor of the Central Bank asking two pillar banks to lend to another bank and those banks said they would if that lending was guaranteed.  You go forward to September, you have the exact same situation, also you're already ... you're also bringing in a system-wide guarantee for all the banks, it's now a system-wide problem.  But an intervention could have been made, or could it not, in March with a particular institution, to protect the rest of the system?</p></speech>

There was a situation that was arising in relation to the liquidity of that bank for reasons which I have given earlier to Senator O'Keeffe.  But the issue was, you know, there was no recommendation coming to us, from our advisers, that that is what you do in this situation.  And you know, 20:20 is great now.  It's great now but all I'm saying to you is that we acted on the best advice that was available to us.  Was there a mistake in analysis?  Yes there was.  There was a mistake in analysis but at the end of the day, you know, that's ... we now know that.  But even whether it was mistaken or not, on that night, what do you do if your system is running out of cash?  That's the issue and we had to address that problem, because if you didn't address that problem everything was at risk, that's what a systemic risk is.</p></speech>

And in line 293 you said "Taking all perspectives into consideration when the present was hard to assess and future developments hard to predict was challenging."  Now, in your statement you explain this.  Can you explain to us then as to why no contingencies, or there seems to have been no contingency in place for worst-case scenarios being requested from the Department of Finance during the period from late 2007 until shortly before the guarantee?</p></speech>

I mean that's the problem and you're looking at a rise in interest rates to 2.5%.  People said "That won't happen in the next six months, but we'll do that stress test for you anyway, we'll look at your impairment of loans as 0.03%, we'll move them to 0.1%."  You know, all of these things are based on assumptions that were regarded as being within the realm of possibility but clearly, you know, no worst-case scenario met the once-in-a-century event that we were dealing with.</p></speech>

It then goes on in paragraph 2 to talk about the term &quot;constructive ambiguity&quot;, we might come back to what that actually means later on, and it then on the next page, it talks about scenario 1.  This is what would happen if a financial institution ... so we now know that this is being discussed in early 2008.</p> <blockquote> 	Scenario 1 [is] An institution that is illiquid [or illiquid but in]solvent.  If an institution is experiencing liquidity difficulties and has exhausted any opportunities for accessing liquidity in the wholesale [market] the first step must be for it to seek liquidity from the European Central Bank (ECB) in [formal] operations. </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               It talks about in the next paragraph, the role of CBFSAI in this situation, &quot;The authority responsibility for the provision of ELA to an illiquid institution is CBFSAI.&quot;  And then further down that paragraph just beyond halfway it says, &quot;Therefore if there is any concern that a financial institution seeking ELA is insolvent, the CBFSAI would not be in a position to provide liquidity support without the question of some guarantee arising from the Exchequer.&quot;<br/><br/>Then on to the next paragraph 3.2 it says, &quot;Department/Minister's role in this situation.&quot;  It is quite explicit it says, &quot;Traditionally, it would [not] be considered that the Minister for Finance does not have a specific role when an institution is illiquid but solvent and there is no legal role for the Minister in such an event.&quot;<br/><br/>We then move on to paragraph 4 and scenario 2, &quot;<b>An institution that is insolvent (or approaching insolvency).</b>&quot;  And it says:</p><blockquote>	If a period of liquidity continues it is likely that an illiquidity institution will move closer to insolvency.  As referred to above, it is important to note that, from the outset, any major financial institution drawing on ELA will be in very serious financial difficulty and is likely to be in need of rescue. </blockquote> <p>That lays out the agreed themes of scenario 2.  And then rolling on to paragraph 4.3, it says:</p><blockquote>	<b>Role/Legal powers of the Minister in this situation.</b><br /><br />As outlined above, if a sovereign bank sought ELA, the CBFSAI [Central Bank Financial Services Authority of Ireland] would be legally prohibited from extending it.  However, if the bank was systemically important and the Government agreed to extend a guarantee to its liabilities, then this would turn it from an insolvent bank into an illiquid but solvent one (with the State bank guarantee backing up in its capital). </blockquote> <p>In layman's terms, the State is standing behind the bank, it doesn't matter how much illiquidity difficulties are in the bank, the State solvency <i>de facto</i>making the bank solvent.  So CBFSAI could inject liquidity to prevent contagion effects into the wider system and this gives the Central Bank then the permission to get into the space.<br/><br/>It also talks about letters of comfort in the very last paragraph of that page, &quot;&quot;Letters of Comfort&quot; is a somewhat loose term used to describe a form of written assurances to lending institutions or others in relation to borrowings or other financial commitments where there is no statutory power to guarantee or where guarantees up to the statutorily authorised level have already been given.&quot;<br/><br/>Very last line of that paragraph then, &quot;The CBFSAI's view is that a letter of comfort from the Minister to cover CBFSAI's risks would not be sufficient for the CBFSAI [Central Bank and Financial Services Authority] to lend to an insolvent institutions (sic) - a comprehensive guarantee would be necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>We'll then go on a very, very good number of pages, as I said, scenario 1 has a whole load of sub-headings on it, scenario 2 has a load of sub-headings on it, and then it goes to scenario 3:</p><blockquote>	<b>Unclear whether institution is illiquid or insolvent.</b><br /><br />This paper details two scenarios: (a) a bank that is liquid but solvent and (b) bank that is unequivocally insolvent or unequivocally approaching insolvency (section 4).  </blockquote> <p>Which was the option that you were facing on the night, Mr. Cowen?</p></speech>

On page 1 of your witness statement you state that the focus of the work of the domestic standing group became concentrated on Irish Nationwide Building Society as a result of negative news reporting that emanated from Reuters.  In your opinion, does that reflect a worrying failing of the regulatory regime, relying on reports from an external news agency, rather than information supplied by the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#GG01100"><p>Well I understand that the negative news report from Reuters was exaggerating, wasn't accurate, in relation to Irish Nationwide.  As I understand it, they got Goldman Sachs to come in and do some work for them.  And ultimately the regulator got Goldman Sachs to do work for Irish, for the regulator, when they were inside at Irish Nationwide.  They looked at the top 30 loans in Ireland and in the UK and decided that there was value there over a period of time but obviously there were some problems.  But not to the extent that the Reuters were saying, that they were insolvent; they weren't insolvent at that point, or at any point that I know of, up to then.  And when we got the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee scheme in place, a lot of the deposits in Irish Nationwide were in respect of small depositors like that who left their money in and the flow that was coming out of Irish Nationwide stopped as a result of the deposit guarantee.  It probably benefited them more than anyone else because there was a higher percentage profile of depositors in the small category, if you like, of under &euro;100,000 than would have been the case with other ones.  So, that's the first point.</p>  <p>  The second point is, these agencies ... credit rating agencies and international news organisations who are close to the financial situations often have an influence that can be very detrimental to any institution, particularly a small institution like Irish Nationwide.  But to answer the point about it coming to public notice if it was ... any notice that came to the authorities in respect of any institutions that were in trouble under the regulatory regime we had would deal with that, if you like, with the constructive ambiguity that the Chairman was talking about before.  In other words, if you're out there transparent on something, if there's a problem it can be ... it can roll into a bigger problem than it actually is and you cause an insolvency when in fact it was a liquidity problem to start with.  It's ... these financial issues, as you know, have to be dealt with with discretion.  It doesn't mean that you're trying to hide things that people should otherwise know.  It's a question of trying to manage it without it becoming a wider problem or bringing others into it that weren't in the trouble in the first place.</p></speech>

But the question of at what stage ... there was a certain point at which the European Central Bank said, "Look, we have been as helpful as we can be for a long time here. This is emergency liquidity assistance, it's not, you're now on this emergency liquidity assistance for a time that's beyond the contemplation of what we expected, and therefore this question of the need to restructure has to come onto the table quickly."  I think that's where ... in fairness to them ... that's where they're coming from.  From our point of view we were saying, "Look, we're preparing, we are behaving in the right way, we want to get our public finances into order, we are producing a plan to do that.  We're prepared to talk to you about a parallel or probationary programme if that will help ye guys to reassure ye guys that we're heading in the right direction here."  Well, it suddenly became a situation where it was "Get into the programme."</p></speech>

I mean, you know, Mr. Cardiff, I think, in his testimony has been able ... as only a public servant can, put a good balance on the benefits that we must attribute to the ECB in this situation.  But from the political point of view, it was difficult for me because I felt that there were sources putting it about that the Government had made a decision which it hadn't then made and I think, you know, those democratic procedures should be respected even by bureaucracies, however powerful.</p></speech>

It was almost, you know, as if there was a trail of correspondence without decisions being taken and people putting counter-views to the regulator's requirements and this sort of thing.  I mean, I agree that there ... it seems to be the case, based on Mr. Honohan's work and his report, that ... I'm not saying forbearance, that's probably the wrong word, I'm saying there was a failure to bring issues to completion ... regulatory matters to completion, one way or the other, as to what was to be the outcome.  And it was, sort of, trails of correspondence going on for months and, in some cases, more than months, which seems to me to be ... not to be the most efficient way to operate.</p></speech>

I recall when all this happened, we had the recapitalisation and the nationalisation of Anglo in January.  If I may so, there was a Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis in February, I think, and I made the point that we were going to change the Central Bank arrangements, that we were going to reintegrate the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator's department ... office, that we were going with the Canadian structure - the Canadian model - which had proven itself, probably uniquely, as having been the one democracy that I know ... one western country that I know that came through this crisis relatively unscathed because of the sort of regulatory culture that they had brought to bear over there.  We were going for that sort of structure immediately.  Now, we were saying "This is the way we want to go" because we weren't happy.  I wasn't happy that we had ended up where we did but, at the end of the day, you know, as you say, the responsibility falls ... the political responsibility falls on our desk and I have to accept that and I do accept it.</p></speech>

Briefly at the start, Mr. Cowen, and you're welcome back, I want to refer to scenario 3 again on that document which we just had up, which is Vol. 4 of your core documents, page 16 ... the bottom of page 16.  You have - today and the last day - outlined that you placed, I suppose, trust in the position of the Financial Regulator.  And this is a document that was prepared for you ... prepared for the Department, when you were Minister for Finance, which we extensively referred to the last day.  The bottom of that paragraph reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	In a period of severe market or severe financial markets turmoil [which, I think, we were certainly in September 2008], it may be very difficult to determine the true worth of the bank's assets including its net contingent assets ... it is much more difficult for a central bank or a financial regulator to know whether the bank is just illiquid or has become insolvent, especially in the light of the incentives a bank may have to disguise its true state of health from a central bank or a financial regulator. </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               Now, you've presented - the last day and today - that you placed faith in the regulator and in the Central Bank and yet your own Department of Finance document is explicitly warning at ... in January 2008 not to place faith - or maybe not to place faith but to question that faith-  in the regulator and in the case of severe financial markets turmoil.  Can you explain why ... why you didn't follow that-----</p></speech>

It's saying, basically, that it can be difficult, maybe, to decipher which it is in the question of extreme market turmoil and that banks will be saying things to make it look as good as possible from their point of view.  I think that's what they are saying.  And what I am saying is that, you know, when you're in a crisis situation that we were in ... you know, I take the responsibility.  Let me be clear, I'm taking responsibility for the decision.  I made this point at the beginning of my opening remarks last time and yet it was suggested that "Oh well [subsequently] he  didn't take responsibility for the decision."  I am taking responsibility.  People are asking me about other players who were there and I have to say that in a crisis situation you have to rely on the people who are ... who have the statutory responsibility in this area.  I mean, what else do you do?  What else can you do really at one level?  You know, you've got-----</p></speech>

Do you know what I mean?  They're there assessing the situation and they are mindful of these things.  It's not that, you know, I was mindful of them and they weren't mindful of it.  They were mindful of this situation that was ... that had developed.  And they were assessing the situation as best they could, based on the knowledge they had.  Now, what I am saying about that is that people say, you know, "You should have had more knowledge".  Well, what I am saying is ... the following five weeks we sent in forensic ... or sent in accountants and we sent in valuers and they come up six weeks later... which if we had had it six weeks before, wouldn't have changed that assessment.  So, that's the best way I can explain it when people are wondering, "Well, if you had a different assessment or a more detailed one before 29 September would you've come up with a different decision?".  I'm just looking at the evidence that's in front of me-----</p></speech>

But, let's be fair now, Deputy.  You look at these, sort of, paragraphs in the scoping papers of nine months ago and tell me that, you know, you should have had that beside you when you were doing the crisis or trying to act.  I'm not saying you're saying that but I'm just trying to put the thing in perspective.  You know, you can be mindful of all those things, at the end of the day, you've got to make a decision.  And you've got to make a decision based on your best assessment, based on everything you've heard.  Now, people can have genuine points of view about what that right decision was, even with the information we had.  I'm not arguing about that.  But I'm saying ... I'm giving you the rationale for what we did, why we did it and on what basis we did it.</p></speech>

I'm not taking a view on any of that.  Maybe there's more issues arises as a result of that, I don't know.  But the point is, I had been in touch with Alan Gray but I never discussed the question of a guarantee with him until the night of the ... okay, because that was the only time we actually came down to decide we are going to do a guarantee.</p></speech>

I mean, I was saying to him:</p> <blockquote> 	Look, we have a guarantee decision, or a variant of that, seems to be on the table.  A nationalisation plus guarantee or a guarantee, that seems to be where things are at here.  What's your view in terms of what would we need to be watching out for if we go down the guarantee route anyway? </blockquote>  <p>And he tells me what he ... and I say, ''That's grand, thanks''.  But I didn't ... we hadn't made any decisions at that stage.  I was simply asking, are we, you know, getting an outside view on the context of a meeting at that point saying, &quot;If we were to go down the guarantee route, what do you think?  What should we be considering?  What do we need to be looking out for?&quot;  Because, obviously, it was a big decision and he talks about state aid rules, he talks about, you know, the fact that some would be an advantage compared to others ... there was a state aid issue there.  Make sure it's time limited and make sure they pay for it.  In summary, that seems to be what he's saying.</p></speech>

He gave his opinion of that conversation to <i>The Irish Times</i>in 4 January 2011.  You stated today that you asked him what he thought of the guarantee option being used.  He stated that you rang him to obtain his views, as a director of the Central Bank, on likely market reaction'.  They are not quite the same.</p></speech>

I've two other examples of other letters which I won't go into now, Chairman, on page 62 ... 61 of Vol. 2 and page 125 Vol. 4 ... of letters which you wrote - of a very friendly nature - to Mr. Cardiff outlining his position.  Really what I am asking is, what authority, what role did have to be writing to the acknowledged senior official on banking in the Department of Finance - at the height of the biggest banking crisis the State had - giving his advice.  </p>  <p>               Was he on the payroll or what was his capacity-----</p></speech>

Now you can take them, you leave them, you can do as you wish with them.  He's setting out, as I see it, to Kevin Cardiff, "Here's some views.  You were in talking to us and the Central Bank about this, that and the other, about where things are at.  Here's my views on it."  And there's nothing prescriptive about it.

In relation to the area of recapitalisation, in answer to I think Deputy O'Donnell earlier, you spoke that eventually we would move to the recapitalisation phase.  You chaired the discussions obviously on the night of the guarantee.  Did you ask either of the two banking representatives, either of the two institutions that were represented on the night, their view as to potential taxpayer funded recapitalisation, in light of the fact that you may have seen the evidence earlier that two weeks after the guarantee decision was made, Bank of Ireland in their minutes at their board meeting, were acknowledging that there was a significant prospect that State money would have to be injected?  Did you ask, as chairman on the night, the position of the banks in question?</p></speech>

Why on the night in question, when you were chairing ... I'm not talking about capital injections in general, I'm talking about taxpayer-funded capital injections.

And that's ... and you know the results of that.</p></speech>

I'm going to invite Deputy Doherty and then Senator O'Keeffe in.  I just want to ask one question in terms of recommendations and the final report that we'd be working towards, Mr. Cowen.  And that is on the situation of Anglo and maybe you offering a view as to when would have been the optimum time to intervene in some way, whether with Anglo Irish Bank, considering that it was a main issue in September 2008, and one of the motivations for the banks to be seeking to meet with you, that in that regard, and bearing in mind that no bank was lending to it later in the year, and bearing in mind that the share price had actually been wiped out, when would be the optimum time for the Department of Finance and Government have been to make an earlier intervention and an intervention of what type with Anglo?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.656" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#KK04300"><p>I don't know the answer to that.  I mean, what I'd say to you is you'd only take on a nationalisation if you had to take it on.  That would be my view.  You don't just decide, "We'll just ...let's just take on ... let's take over an institution."  You'd take it on if you had to take it on.  And by the time it came to us when we took it on we had no other option but to take it on.</p>  <p>  The question then is back to your view of the nationalisation.  Do you want to take this onto your books straightaway without looking at it further, considering it further?  Or do you want ... and if, for example, there hadn't been these other issues that arose that drove the nationalisation, made it inevitable, the question was arising, what was the percentage that we needed to take for any recapitalisation money we were putting in?  Now, clearly it was after ... it went totally way beyond where anyone was at subsequent to that, and clearly a nationalisation became obvious, and it became obvious with others as well.  I mean, AIB, who had been in on the night saying, "You better do something with Bank X."  I mean we had to something with them which was quite significant too and they didn't seem to know, obviously, the position they were in themselves, quite apart from giving opinions about everyone else.</p>  <p>  So my view, if you want my view of what it's worth, is you only nationalise a bank where you have to nationalise a bank.  That's my position.  You don't take on that asset and liabilities willy-nilly.  You need to have a pretty considered position on it.  That night I didn't think it was appropriate, because I was afraid that if ... you could look at it either way, but I was afraid that it would indicate further nationalisations on the way pretty quickly.  And then you were in a very difficult situation, in my opinion.</p></speech>

I want to go to Vol. 4 of the evidence books, page 45.  And I want ... you were at this meeting, Mr. Cowen.  It's a meeting dated around 25 September 2008, and it's the note we've referred to on numerous occasions in the committee.  It's the note of the minute of the meeting.  It talks about the Financial Regulator saying there is no evidence to suggest that Anglo is insolvent in an ongoing basis.  But then follows on to say, "D[avid] Doyle noted that Government would need a good idea of the potential loss exposures within Anglo and INBS - on some assumptions INBS could be 2bn after capital and Anglo could be 8.5 [after capital]."  Is that not the first suggestion that there was loan losses in both of those banks?  Or what ... an early suggestion?</p></speech>

But regardless if it's after capital or before capital and that's been disputed by certain people, does it not suggest that there are substantial loan losses running in the billions of euro in two of these financial institutions, on some assumptions?</p></speech>

And you talked about the PwC report in November.  </p>  <p>               What I'm saying to you, is this not a suggestion that capital may be required by banks which were locked out of the capital markets for months at that stage, or at least one of them was locked out, and therefore the inevitability of the State having to step in would be ... is that not the case?</p></speech>

Can I go to ... can I go to David Doyle's testimony to the banking inquiry, on page 115, and David Doyle, under questioning by myself, talked about there was a consideration that illiquidity would rapidly become insolvency, this is on the night of the guarantee.  But, I pushed him in relation to, setting aside that risk of an illiquid bank becoming insolvent, was there an analysis, from some financial institutions or others, that the bank themselves, given their loan losses, could be insolvent in the future?  And he responded, and he says:</p> <blockquote> 	Well, that debate around nationalisation reflected the concern that there could be a problem emerging.  And if that problem emerged, that would damage the market. </blockquote>  <p>So the argument that they should be nationalised related to the concern about the quality of loan book.  Isn't that not the case, the reason why Minister Lenihan and Kevin Cardiff was arguing for nationalisation of the bank as opposed to a guarantee, is because they were concerned that there was loan losses within Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank, that a guarantee, while solving the liquidity problem, would not solve the loan losses that were emerging in those two institutions?</p></speech>

Recapitalisation would have to come up on the table at some stage.  So, you know, so I, you know, we weren't saying this is a solution to the problem.  This is getting the liquidity back into the system.</p></speech>

The reason that there was two very senior individuals, the Minister for Finance and the probably most experienced person in the Department of Finance, arguing for nationalisation, is because, as, as David Doyle himself said, there was concern about the quality of the loan book.  And the issue of potential insolvency in relation to those, reflected the debate around nationalisation, as opposed to a guarantee.  Was that not what was at the centre of this?</p></speech>

But, we were ... were not aware of the fact that we were going to end up with an insolvency situation the way we did and we were certainly not aware that we were going to have the loan losses of the magnitude that we had.  That was certainly not on the table.  And then, therefore, to just ... I'm just coming back, just for the purpose of confirmation, the issue on the nationalisation question was, what is likely ... what way is that likely to be taken by the markets if you do it now?  And that's the story, and if ... will that bring more money into the system or would it mean less money coming back into the system?  And, first priority is get money into the system.</p></speech>

He has several times said that he took his advice from the Governor of the Central Bank, isn't that correct, this morning?  That ultimately ... now, I'm asking why, on the night, Mr. Gleeson said that he, and the Bank of Ireland, were asked very clearly to assemble &euro;5 billion each, I think, on ... he says on the foot of the very clearest representations from the Central Bank Governor, made in the presence of the Government, and he says, in fairness, although not endorsed by the Government, that an orderly dealing with Anglo would occur at the weekend.  So, I'm asking Mr. Cowen, why is it that Mr. Gleeson recalls from the meeting, that the Governor was advising "Give us the money so we can keep Anglo going to the weekend and then we'll deal with it?"</p></speech>

When you were talking to Mr. Lenihan, you say: "I explained my reservations about it [meaning nationalisation] explained my reservations about it and reassured him that nationalisation was something that we could not rule out in the future and would remain an option available to us."  So if it was to remain an option available to you, why not exercise the option then?  Why go for a guarantee with the nationalisation opportunity still there?</p></speech>

Now the point is I'm making the point to them ... the point I was trying to make as well at that time was, if we do something in an intermediate step here and it doesn't work, how will it look if I didn't take the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank?

With that said, I now propose that we suspend until 3.30 p.m.  In doing so, I'd like to remind the witness that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to evidence or matters that are being discussed before the committee.  With this in mind, I now propose to suspend until 3.30 p.m. and remind the witness that he is still under oath until we resume.  Is that agreed?  Agreed</p></speech>

In this afternoon's session, we'll broadly focus upon Mr. Cowen's tenure as Taoiseach from January 2009 until the general election of early 2011.</p> <p> Mr. Cowen, if I can maybe just deal with a couple of matters that are outstanding from the morning and then we'll get straight into this afternoon's business.  You were discussing earlier this morning the issue of junior bondholders and their inclusion in the guarantee.  Could you tell us was there a discussion with junior bondholders with Mr. Lenihan when he was still present on the evening?  Was the decision made with the Minister still present or was that decision made after Minister Lenihan had departed?  And could you also explain to the committee the reasoning behind the including of junior bondholders in the guarantee?  </p></speech>

Well, I've made ... in my comment, I've made the statement that Brian ... Brian Lenihan subsequently told me some time later that he hadn't been in the room when the junior ... when that decision was taken, and I just wanted to have that recorded because he did say it to me.  Regarding that, I mean, my ... everyone's recollection is slightly different, I suppose, in terms of what you remember but the question of junior bondholders came up in the context of looking at the Merrill Lynch stuff as well because it was ... they seemed to suggest that it should be included, talked about the possibility of cross-collateral, cross-default etc.  There was also the view that the number of ... the pool of investors for Irish bonds is relatively small compared to other large countries and therefore, some of them may be in the category of subordinated and senior bondholders.  But I took the ... I take the point that it was, in the normal ... if it was normal conditions, you wouldn't be considering including even dated subordinated bondholders.  Undated subordinated bondholders were left out of the equation.  The fact that I remember, as I say, specifically a conversation that I had with the Central Bank Governor about it where he mentioned that they were a very small part of the overall amount that was being considered, about 3%.  This question of giving clarity to the market the following day was given a very high premium.  Even when we had sort of done the deposit guarantee scheme there was queries coming in about ... there was ... surprisingly since it looked like a very simple arrangement.  The amount of queries that people have on these things would surprise you sometimes but ... so they were saying that people ... in the interests of clarity, in the interest of total understanding by everyone where we stood that we should include them, taking all things into account.  And what I would emphasis is the volatility in the market was such that it was felt you shouldn't restrict market access for Irish banks from any source, even one that would normally not be included in a guarantee in normal circumstances.</p></speech>

Certainly Brian was ... the Minister for Finance was there when the banks were there, and some of the evidence given by others suggested that this issue was mentioned there but it may have been the case that we didn't make a formal decision on it while he was there, that maybe he had gone at that point.  So I just wanted to, in fairness to him, make that point that he said that to me some time later.  So it wasn't a week or two later, maybe some time later.</p></speech>

Just two other matters then and then, as I say, we'll move onto this afternoon.  And, returning to matters discussed this morning, did you receive any proposal, written or otherwise, from either Mr. Alan Gray or Mr. Fintan Drury on behalf of any bank, with recommendations on how the funding crisis could be dealt with for any particular bank?  And if you received, what action, if any, did you take on the basis of these recommendations?</p></speech>

And just one other matter along the same vein is, can you outline any representations received from any senior executive or board member or of any bank or through any intermediary on their behalf, prior to the decision taken to increase the level of deposits to the NTMA or the deposits the NTMA were holding with the Irish banks and, if received, what action, if any, did you take on foot of any such recommendations or representations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#QQ00200"><p>No I didn't receive any representations.  The ... when that issue came up back in January of '08, when I was Minister for Finance, I stated last week in my testimony regarding that time that that was an issue I recall, there was a discussion with the then Secretary General, David Doyle, about.  Who spoke to me about it and he had been a member, he was a member of the NTMA board.  The question of the NTMA seeking, you know, insisting you write to them to say, so they go and do what was being suggested was at their insistence, and I did that for a period, that covered a six month period and it was renewed in July by my successor.</p>  <p>  I think the background to that, just to clarify it, is you know there was a view that obviously the NTMA acts independently and if they want to put its money into the Central Bank rather than anywhere else that's a matter for them.  In their view I think at the time they weren't putting any money into any banks anywhere.  So I suppose it was felt that with the tightening liquidity situation back in December ... December '07, January '08.  You know if banks, Irish banks were out there looking for funds from internationally, it would be important to be able to say that their own NTMA, their own treasury was putting some money into their accounts, into their banks as well.  Otherwise if they weren't able to say that was it going to make it less likely that they'll get funds out, would they be on the road getting funds for that purpose?  So I think it was in that context that the letter was issued.</p>  <p>  Secondly, of course the NPRF at this stage I was also writing to the NTMA asking them to get involved in you know, be available for contingency planning for this liquidity issue that was continuing.  And we were sort of ensuring by putting ... getting the NPRF possibly involved at some stage in the future was something that was being mooted.  It was a case that we would ever have to give direct liquidity support from within our own funds ... as a country, so they were involved in a way that in that sense as well.  So that's basically the background to all that.</p></speech>

So maybe as we move towards the ... from the banking guarantee to the bailout, Mr. Cowen, could I put the question to you, did the structure or design of the banking guarantee, along with its period of duration, which we discussed this morning of two years, have any baring on the Irish state entering a bailout programme two years and two months after the guarantee was put in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#QQ00400"><p>Well I think what pushed us having to go into a guarantee, or to look at a guarantee ...  not look at a guarantee, look at a programme with the EU and IMF, relates to what was happening in Greece.  On the bond market we were doing reasonably okay, in March and April if you look at the cost of funds for Irish Government it wasn't ... it was well affordable, it was in the four's anyway, 4 per cents.  You then had the Greek situation developed where they had to go into a programme.  And that sort of created ... this distinction started to be made in the markets to a greater degree than had been the case before within the euro area where different risk premia were being applied to different countries.  In other words, the parameters, the range in which bonds were issuing were starting to widen.  And the peripheral countries were affected by that, including Ireland.  So by the time September comes and October, we're sort of we step out temporarily out of the market when we went to 8.6% in the bond market and we tactically stepped out on the advice of the NTMA.  And then you have what happened subsequently as I outlined on my statement.  So did it have an effect?  I suppose it had some effect because when you've got to the end of the guarantee period you had the ECB obviously were starting to talk about the level of ELA, or the level of liquidity assistance that they were giving to the Irish banking system.  </p>  <p>         And we were also in the process, of course, of trying ... of preparing plans before a budget to instill confidence in the international markets that we were committed, as a Government, to moving to a reduction of our deficit over a three or four-year period.  So it had some effect, I'm sure, when it got to the end of that two-year period; it must have had some effect, people assessed the situation then-----</p></speech>

I mean, I think that the issue was the funding was continuing through the euro system.  Clearly, there was an issue of restructuring that would have to come up and, if you like, they saw the need to bring back to some, sort of, decision process to see what would happen so that when we did go into the programme, there was, as you know, a restructuring that took place and the &euro;10 billion amount of the facility that was made available at the time was provided for that to start.  And we brought in legislation in December of 2010 to enable that to happen.</p></speech>

And he went on to explain that there was discussions already in that regard.  And speaking on the same related matter when this committee met with Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet when he appeared before the IEA hosted event at Kilmainham in 30 April this year, he goes on to say, "As you know, we could also have continued on our side after having gone up to 100% of GDP to go to 200% of GDP, and why not 300% of GDP?  That would" ... Or, he then says "Then what would a Commission of Inquiry be asking for?" referring to this inquiry.  You would say, "Were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue when you were going into the wall at 100 mph to continue to provide liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?"  So Mr. Cowen, could I put the question to you: was Mr. Trichet right?  If this action hadn't happened and the entry into the programme had been delayed for a further period, would the cost of the bailout actually have been bigger to Ireland, and if you could answer that, please?</p></speech>

And we had been, you know, in the normal way, in discussions with them since September in the Commission and they were obviously, you know, you had this annual budgetary interaction between the Commission and the member state of a euro country.  And we were outlining to them what our thinking was, the need to provide a four-year plan, to provide a clear statement to the market as to what Ireland's intentions were over the medium term, that we were intent on getting our deficit, which we had brought under control in 2010 ... we had seen growth for the first time in GNP since the crisis began, we saw year-on-year improvements in our exports for the first time<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the more competitive position that we had established because of the reduction in our unit labour cost <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>competitors.  So there were things starting to show that was ... and, of course, our balance of payments was coming back into surplus, which was indicating that we were earning our living in the world, if you like, by reason of a positive balance of payments outcome.<br/><br/>So, we were indicating that we were committed to this process and we had shown from 2008, you know, without any prodding from Europe we were adopting a very responsible position in terms of getting our budget back under control over a period of time because the gap that had opened up was quite substantial.  So there was no question of, sort of, having to contact a recalcitrant government about meeting its responsibilities in terms of euro area Stability and Growth Pact criteria.  We were conscious that we were well over it, we needed to reduce and we were going to reduce, and we were doing that.  </p>  <p>         So the question is, when you ask me ... when it's said that it was superfluous, in that sense we felt we couldn't understand why it was necessary for to put that in writing since we were already in conversation with the Commission.  They had a fair idea where we were going but the ECB obviously had come to a view on the liquidity assistance at a meeting earlier that week.  I think by the time we got it, you know, we were in the process of moving towards a decision on whether we go into a programme or not, because we were getting certain assurances from that process of engagement that we talked about earlier when we sent over some officials to have these talks about talks what had they in mind.  We wanted to make sure that you didn't end up in a situation where you were accused of being in the programme, not knowing what the terms were and then people laying out terms to you, and that wasn't going to work politically.

Mr. Trichet's statement, yes it is true, I mean obviously I'm not questioning the fact - it's been made by officials here - that the ECB were very helpful in making sure that that liquidity assistance was available to fund the banking system.  So no-one is being churlish in that respect.  But what I am simply saying is that we as a Government were moving to a position of making decisions that were of importance and the idea that we would have to be .... get a letter to remind us or to say to us, you know, focus in on this issue - we were very focused on the issue.  We just wanted to make sure that the institutional people we were dealing with were going to ... we were going to end up with a programme that we believed was consonant with what we thought was possible and doable, consistent with maintaining to the greatest extent possible, employment in the economy.  And to come back to your point, that's what his discussions with Olli Rehn were about in September.</p></speech>

Because the entry into the bailout programme had to be cognisant of two issues; one was the crisis that was still in the banks and capitalisation and all the measures that were legacy issues of the guarantee, there was also a structural deficit.  What was the sum that had to be corrected in the structural deficit that the programme of assistance was to provide?</p></speech>

So we would, if you like, have ... I think ... sorry I'm getting my figures wrong, I think between ... my apologies, between 2011 and what we'd done since 2008, the correction was about &euro;20 billion of the &euro;30 billion journey that had to be travelled to get us back into a position of balance as far as the Stability and Growth Pact was concerned.</p></speech>

First of all, there was this question of ... they would be interested in the fiscal side of the equation, first of all.  And in this sort of budgetary engagement that takes place between the European Commissioner concerned, Mr. Rehn, and the Finance Minister of Ireland, Brian Lenihan, there were also some ECB people who were in on those discussions.  Mr. Stark would be one of them.  And they would always be more ... they would be saying "Cut this deficit by &euro;8 billion", and we'd say, "No, we don't think that's doable and we don't think that's right.  We think, you know, we have other things in mind."  So you'd start discussing that and eventually it ended up with ... it wasn't quite &euro;6 billion, it was some ... there was some one-off savings that we made that was included in that &euro;6 billion, it might've been maybe &euro;5.3 billion plus &euro;700 million of a one-off benefit.</p></speech>

Obviously, you'd use your relationships with the European Union to make sure that you were ... that if we were coming forward with a plan, that they would have an understanding of what was doable and how the Irish Government saw you closing this gap over a period, rather than some desktop operation over in the ECB or the European Commission coming in and telling us "You have to do X, Y and Z."  We were saying, you know, "We have to do this.

So as the guarantee comes to an end in September, close to &euro;19 billion of unsecured senior bonds come out of the guarantee - &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion were bonds issued to Anglo and INBS.  And between September and the bailout agreement, &euro;2.4 billion of unguaranteed, unsecured senior bonds were repaid.  So, approaching this position at the end of the guarantee, did the Government have any plans for burden-sharing?</p></speech>

You'd also the situation where the ECB, the monetary authority they were not in favour of burning bondholders-----</p></speech>

I wouldn't say it was expressly ... made expressly known but it was clear what their policy was.  I mean, there hadn't been a bondholder burned since Lehman's.  Even the United States, who have a much more aggressive resolution programme for wind-ups of banks or closing down banks or winding them up, they hadn't burned a bondholder, I think, since Lehman's either.  And the reason was that ... the effect this could have on market sentiment.  So that's-----</p></speech>

I mean, you wouldn't say you're not ... it doesn't mean you're not going to try it if you think it's the right thing to do and if it's ... if everyone's on the same page.  So, I mean, it's back to this contingency planning again.  But the issue was, as far as I could see, that for so long as we were out there looking for financing on open markets, the question of burning bondholders from the position we were in was a very difficult proposition.  Once we came out of the markets, once we were talking about going into a programme, where we had three-year money in prospect and a sort of a fiscal framework where you could plan your way through the next three years, I wasn't that worried about, you know, the bond market because we wouldn't be in the bond market for three years anyway if that was the case.</p></speech>

It's becoming increasingly part of the process before Council meetings where the French President and the German Chancellor meet and have some things to say, which, I think, is really about trying to reposition the Franco-German entente or alliance at the centre of European decision-making, and, sort of, suggesting that, "This is our position as we go into this meeting, whatever about the rest of you."  I think, you know, the community method remains the best method for European decision-making as far as I'm concerned because it puts the Commission in the central role it should be, of policy initiator, and ensuring equal treatment for all states, including small states and large states.</p></speech>

This idea the IMF were in town immediately created this view that it's a <i>fait accompli</i>.  What we were doing was, at the time, and that was the situation right up to the meeting, I think, of the 16th, on the Tuesday when Brian was ... Brian Lenihan was there as Finance Minister for the country at an ECOFIN or a Eurogroup meeting was ... he was coming under pressure all right.  </p>  <p>         People ... there were colleagues were saying to him, you know, &quot;You need to go into a bailout programme&quot; and Brian was simply saying:</p><blockquote>	Well, I haven't a mandate to that, that would have to be a Cabinet decision.  We're making progress, we're discussing what it might look like were we to do it and we have legitimate concerns that we want cleared up, including on corporation tax. </blockquote> <p>And we were ... he said to them, in an effort to be co-operative, in an effort to be helpful to show our bona fides<i>, </i>he was saying, ''Well, the next meeting we can have it in Dublin.  The next meeting with officials we'll have it in Dublin.  You come over to us.&quot;  And that, sort of, then very quickly became a <i>fait accompli</i>as far as some people were concerned.</p></speech>

Sorry, just to clarify, the miscalculation was agreeing to have the talks in Dublin or not telling the public?</p></speech>

IMF personnel coming over.  If the EU were just coming over and we were having continuing consultations, I don't think it would have the same impact if you hadn't an IMF person with them.  Now, they were coming over and there was no intention ... what we were trying to do basically, is to ... and I know it's done in a way that ... it's not meant in any way to mislead because there's no benefit in a Government misleading its own people.  We weren't doing that.  I was in a Cabinet that did a devaluation once and we knew about it the minute it was done.  Sometimes you have to do things that way to for the purpose of confidentiality and for the purposes of maximising whatever leverage you have.  But the point is, in relation to this particular matter, we were simply trying to get as full a picture as we could before formally applying for a bailout as to what it would look like.  And if we ... because I can understand ... you see, the political miscalculation is, you know, the negative of people saying, "Oh you're entering a programme."  But the positive was we were going to get money for a three-year period without wondering what the fluctuations in the market ... the markets were going to be.  You were going to have money at a certain rate for that period to do a job which you'd set out in the four- year programme, which is going to be very difficult to do anyway but which had to be done.  So, the point I am making is that we were, as I say ... Brian was saying, "I don't have a mandate to say ...", it's not for Brian Lenihan or Brian Cowen on his own to say, ''We're going into a programme', it's a question of the Cabinet making that decision.  And we were coming to the point where we were getting the necessary clarity about where they were going and what they were looking for from us that we felt was in line with what we wanted to do anyway.  And the final point I'd make - I'm not stopping you - is that when we did go into the programme, it was on the basis of a prior Cabinet decision that we were adopting our own programme.  In other words, they weren't going to be imposing it on us, we had a central plank prepared and ready to do-----</p></speech>

This was on a Sunday morning in ... Sycamore Room, I recall, and there was myself and himself and a couple of officials from the Department of Finance and my own Department and we were ... he was saying to me that he was having to go out to an ECOFIN meeting on the Tuesday.  You'd usually go out to the Eurogroup on the Monday evening and you'd have the Eurogroup ... or, sorry, the ECOFIN meeting on the Tuesday morning.  And he wanted some ... he wanted a line ... some line of instruction as to how we were going to handle the situation as it was developing and I said to him ... he said, "Our people are going out to have a chat with him because we have to go up and talk to them.  They want to talk to us and we'll go out and talk to them."

And they were told, ''No, there was no talks going on'', and they went out and just gave that simplistic position instead of just saying ... what I would have said is ... not saying what ... I wouldn't criticise them in any way, they simply said what they were told by someone in the Department or whatever.  They didn't get the nuance of the situation at all.  I'd have said, "These are matters ... we're here opening a road, these are matters for the Minister for Finance.  You'd better talk to him about it."  </p>  <p>         But the point would be that they were ... it was seen as if, you know, they were giving misinformation, which they weren't.  Not as they understood it.  They weren't giving misinformation.  Technically we weren't in negotiations with anybody.  There were discussions going on, we had not agreed to go into a programme, we had not applied for a programme, but we were in discussions about the possibility.  But until we knew where that was going we weren't even acknowledging that, not because you're trying to mislead anyone, but you don't want the European people you're talking to to think that this is all ... that you can say what you like to us and we're going to go in anyway. </p></speech>

As I've said to you, I was in a devaluation ... I was in the Cabinet one time when they did the devaluation.  I wasn't Minister for Finance thankfully, although it was successfully done, but the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and Bertie Ahern, I'd say, were the only two who knew around the Cabinet table when that decision was going to be taken, and made it.  And there are good reasons why that was done in that way.  The Cabinet were there when it was made but it was being made, it was sort of ready to go at that point.  Now, that wasn't the same situation here.  I'm not suggesting you'll have that level of secrecy in this situation but there was a miscommunication, there was a miscommunication that happened, and as head of the Government I should take responsibility for that.</p></speech>

Well, basically on 21 November we were outlining where things were at.  The Minister outlined where things were at at that point.  He informed his colleagues that preliminary discussions have taken place with the IMF, the EU Commission and the ECB.  He also spoke about the serious liquidity problems currently being experienced by the Irish banks again, the difficult budgetary situation, the high cost of Government bonds, meaning to say that we had tactically stepped out of the market for the moment, and the dangers to international stability as perceived by our partners in the European Union.  And he went on to talk about those issues and he made the point that discussions at the European level were such that he felt we could and should apply for a programme on the basis that the conditionality he had gleaned from them would be consistent with where we were going ourselves as a Government.</p></speech>

Sorry, one second.  It would involve, obviously, the question of bank sharing or, sorry, not bank sharing, bank restructuring.  To return the banking system to long-term sustainability and viability in relation to their funding capacity, in other words to start reducing the balance sheets.  It involved restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS and there was legislation would be involved in that as well, including a bank resolution regime to enable the restructuring of distressed institutions.  </p>  <p>         The actual question of, of burden-sharing is not ...

And it was very clear, as I said, from the US point of view, from Mr. Geithner's point of view, since they hadn't burnt a bondholder from ... since Lehman's themselves, they were also concerned and ... and the ECB, I think, were concerned too about what would happen if there was, from a European perspective, if there was burning of bondholders, what impact would that have on other countries who were lining up to be possibly programme entrants, what impact would that have on access to the bond market, and, therefore, they steered well away from it.</p></speech>

So, how is it understood, on what authority and on what basis was the bailout conditional on the burning of bondholders, senior, unguaranteed and unsecured bondholders, and was it your intention to burn these bondholders at a future date?</p></speech>

We come to the final decision of the Cabinet on 27 November.  </p>  <p>               And the question is really, that decision that was taken, given everything that was now known about the conditions of the bailout, what would not be happening regarding burden-sharing and the interest rate that was going to be applied, was the decision to accept the bailout as straightforward as the decision to approve the guarantee in terms of Cabinet support?</p></speech>

Nothing was straightforward, Deputy.  I mean, these are big decisions; they are not straightforward.  You know, the Minister for Finance puts out the position, he explains where it's at, he goes through the details of what's envisaged, what's involved.  We got, in writing, recommendations on this from the NTMA and the Central Bank that this was something we could run with if we had to.  So the question of what we are trying to achieve here is to drop the balance sheet, you know, there's pros and cons in all of this but there's no doubt, at the end of the day that you see regardless of ... leave out the European involvement for the moment, leave out all the other stuff ... Ireland as a country had to get to this position.  We had an economic programme that we had agreed on that would get us to that position.  That economic programme formed the central plank of this programme that gave us access to the money to implement it.  So, in that sense, we were facing up to our responsibilities.  Thankfully, there was a programme there which helped us get through this very difficult period.  We had made the point and it was clear in the memo that whilst the IMF percentage interest is a calculation, and the European one - we were the first entrants into the programme, it was the first new programme - they were, sort of, on the basis that, I think I've referred to it in my statement ... on the one hand, they wanted it to be affordable, on the other hand, they didn't want it to be so attractive that those who were getting into trouble wanted to come into it.  So they were sending it out, it ended up basically about 5.8% composite interest rate but we had it in the .. it's in the memo and it's an understanding in the programme that we could continue to talk about that, we could continue to talk about this interest rate issue because we weren't exactly saying, you know, "That's great."  So the point is that we continued to work on that and, as early as November and December, discussions were ongoing about that interest rate.</p></speech>

Thanks Mr. Cowen again.  Just to begin with the call by Governor Honohan to go on the "Morning Ireland" programme.  Mr. Cardiff, when we had him here giving evidence, had mentioned that he would have liked an hour's notice that it was going on.  He also said that this put the Government very much on the back foot as far as the public relations were concerned, but also it provided some clarity to the situation.  So just on those three issues, why or would you know did Mr. Cardiff have the view that an hour would be sufficient?  Was it that a decision had to be taken within an hour or was it the case that a plan could be put into practice within an hour or would you have any view on that?  Secondly, what comment would you have on Mr. Cardiff's view that this put the Government in the back foot from a PR perspective and that, finally, it also gave clarity to the situation?  So there are three parts to that question.</p></speech>

Well, in relation to...  I think, he may have been referring in the first part of your question to the fact that the Department of Finance, I suppose, are saying they'd like to have had, or he personally would liked to have had some prior notice that this was going to happen.  I'd make the point that when Mr. Honohan did have his interview that he did say that this was a matter for the Government.  And then, of course, as the interview developed ... well, quite quickly, as it developed, he went on to say that he believed the programme would ensure over these discussions and that it would be of the order of what it was.  Obviously, that was a difficult situation for us politically because, suddenly, people like Michael Noonan or whoever come into the D&aacute;il and say, "Patrick Honohan has told us what's going on.  You haven't told us what's going on."  </p>  <p>         And what we were doing at that point, of course, was coming to a conclusion with them over the next couple of days on preparing for the 21 November Cabinet meeting.  So, it did put us on the back foot.  As I say, it was very unfortunate that that's the way it came out, that's the way it was presented.  That was a job for us to do and it put us in a poor light.  And I'm not suggesting that the Governor set out to do that or anything like that.  He answered the questions as they were put to him and the bottom line is we should have been able ... we should have been saying, "Look, we have these people coming over, we haven't applied yet.  We are in discussions with them, we'll see where it takes us.  We should come to a conclusion fairly soon on this, one way or the other" and that would have actually been the very accurate, up-to-date situation as it was.</p> <p> The third question you asked me was what?  Sorry, the third bit?</p></speech>

Do you feel that Governor Honohan was, either unwillingly or willingly, part of this strategy, in terms of masters or senior colleagues at the European Council of the ECB, who presumably would have met the night before, do you feel it's potential exists that Governor Honohan was told, or suggested in very strong terms, "You should get yourself on the national radio and get this out there because" ... you know?</p></speech>

I don't believe that for a moment.  What happens in these situations is, you know, the European Central Bank, there are a lot of people on it and there are a lot of people have an awful lot of things to say about other countries and not a lot of things to say about their own.  And some people, as we know, can't pass a microphone when they're passing it, on the basis that they'll give you the full story once you don't mention their name.  They're all very brave, sincere, honourable people, I'm sure, but they're not ... it's not a very ... a nice practice to be engaged in.  It doesn't show any respect to the native governments, the member state governments.  You know, we didn't any ... need any reminding from anybody about what our responsibilities were.  We knew exactly what our responsibilities were.  We were simply trying to create a bit of space for ourselves, as anyone would, to get as much clarity on what it is we were having to face into, rather than just simply saying, "We're going in" and then they can walk in and impose whatever conditionality they like on the basis that we've already publically declared we're going into a programme.  You've got to use ... even if you know you're in a weak position, you've got to use as much leverage as you can or try and create a bit of leverage, so at least there's a mutual respect when you're sitting down and that you, as a Government, are acting in a ... in good faith, but obviously prudently and carefully before you decide ultimately on what is a major policy position.  So, regarding then whether Professor Honohan was pushed, I mean, Professor Honohan went out, he was obviously ... maybe ...

They were talking about the consolations will continue in Dublin.  Now consultations are consultations, it's not a decision to apply to anything.  But we were acting in good faith.

And while you getting close to that, was the timing of this interview, this intervention through the national airwaves by the Governor of the Central Bank ... did it in any way weaken or have a tangible negative or positive impact on the remaining issues to be ironed out to your satisfaction before applying to a programme?</p></speech>

It's only speculation on my part.  There's clearly ... there are ... there were people who liked to ... who felt ... who didn't like the pace at which we were addressing this issue, which was quite fast as far as I was concerned.  You know, we had a Government to run, we had serious difficulties on our hands anyway.  And the Minister was a person who was ... the Minister for Finance was highly regarded by his colleagues and rightly so.  And he was giving an indication as to what we were ... you know ... generally, where the situation was heading for subject to him being satisfied on a number of points.  And that should have been accepted.  I don't see why we have to receive letters about it, I don't see why people have to source anonymously about Ireland being here ... in or out of a programme.  We were doing our job engaging with the institutions and we should have been given a little bit of space and time and respect to come to a decision that we eventually came to.</p></speech>

There was an issue in terms of outflows again and banking system, we needed to get this sorted out.  We had come through the NAMA process, we'd been very transparent.  I mean let's be clear, we had gone through a process of valuation on loans and inspection of loans and collateral and security and everything else that I don't think that anyone else had done.  So we had been very anxious to be up-front about what the level of losses were, how we calculated them, that we had a process in place through this asset management agency to take these assets out from the balance sheets.  I mean in fairness, the best ... in fairness to the ECB, can I say this in another respect, that the benefit of the asset management agency model was that we were able to get, you know, provide bonds to be presented by those banks for those loans to get liquidity from the ECB as well.  So I mean, you know, they were being helpful as well and we ... it would be churlish not to acknowledge that or to say that we were unappreciative of that.  We were appreciative.  But there were just a couple of things in relation to the programme situation that could have been handled a bit more diplomatically.</p></speech>

When it came to the ... when it came to the negotiation, you were dealing with the institutions, and the institutions were being ... both the Council, the Commission and the ECB were being represented in the troika situation and they had a mandate under those funds to complete a programme and we felt that once you had ... once we had applied for the programme it was important to get those negotiations dealt with quickly and efficiently and not create a lot of uncertainty about it.  As I say, the work that had been ongoing beforehand, before we formally applied meant that we were able to do that, because a lot of interaction had taken place, if you like, on what ... because we had in our plan, you know, there were structural reforms as well as fiscal issues and expenditure issues.  So we were in a position to produce all of that.  And that was quickly assessed by the troika people when we handed it over after the Cabinet had approved it and they acknowledged its rigour and they acknowledged that it would fit the bill, it would meet the requirements, that it was substantive, it was good work.  So the question then of looking for support beyond that, we had ... we had the agreement of the troika to what it is we were putting and they were going to come to us then on the banking side with their proposals on restructuring and all the rest of it and how that would be funded and those discussions were ongoing and then you had the whole ... the question of the IMF stuff then after that.</p></speech>

I mean, these people would have a ... obviously, a very good desktop analysis of every member state country and would know a lot about it but we were sort of wanting to bring to their attention what our thinking was, what our commitment and determination to do this was, what we felt was how you'd look at this correction over a period of years and obviously you'd need to make a statement early on in the programme that show that you were committed to doing it and that you were going to get it done.  So we were prepared to say that a 40% correction in the first year, which would involve not just expenditure cuts because people will recall tax rises as well.  Now, one of the issues that had arisen was clearly that you had about ... I think, from memory, I think about 45% of people in work were not in the tax net.  </p>  <p>         There was only about ... there was about 14% in the higher tax rate.  So we had built, in the good times a very progressive income tax system where those at the highest were being asked to pay progressively more.  I think the top 6% paid 60% of total take ... tax take on the income tax.  And we did that because we were ... we had been very ... you know, driving employment as a key national priority over those years and ensuring that people on lower wages - in some cases less than the industrial wage would - would be encouraged, you know, that they ... they would have a good return on the money that they were earning and it wouldn't be taken all back on tax.  So, that was an issue that clearly had now to be fundamentally reassessed given where we were at in terms of the economic cycle and in terms of closing the gap ... that the Revenue would have to make a contribution.  And Brian was of the view that, you know, everyone has to pay something and obviously the most ... the best or the highest paid pay the most.  But everyone would have to ... we'd all have to be contributing at what ... at a time before when we were able to exempt people from that, that that was going to have to come back into play.  So-----</p></speech>

On the other side of the fence, the expenditure side of the fence or, sorry, the adjustment side of the fence, we had to come to an agreement with them or an understanding, I suppose, that what we were doing would be deemed by everybody as being sufficient.  And we ended up, as I say, with a figure close to &euro;6 billion for the first year, which included some one-off non-recurring savings or revenue raising, if you like, that would get us to &euro;6 billion but would, in an ... in an ongoing year round ... would probably be about &euro;5.3 billion, &euro;5.4 billion.</p></speech>

We sent a letter.  I sent a letter to them as I was told that if we wanted that to happen we should just send an instruction to them because they have a statute which is about their independence and if a Minister involves himself in any of the things that they do you have to produce a letter for their file and I did that and they put it in.  And the amounts they were putting in were very modest.  Before that they weren't putting in anything and I think all it was about trying to make sure that you didn't have an Irish bank was out trying, looking for funds, having to say to someone "Well, your own National Treasury Management Agency doesn't lodge any money with your bank", I mean, that wouldn't make sense.  And certainly you wouldn't do anything that would put anything ... it wasn't at risk anyway.</p></speech>

If you burn them on the one hand and you end up having to pay 7% and 8% for bonds over the following 15 or 20 years, you'll probably end up in a debit situation compared to what you've burnt.  You know, you've got to figure out and be advised what ... where the balance of your interests lie.  And as long as we were in the markets, there was a view that certainly we shouldn't do it.  Not because you'd be ... you know, just being deferential to them, it's in  your own interest not to do it because you want to make sure you have a group of people out there to fund your deficits as you try to get into a budgetary balance and move to growth.  But the other point is that, you know, if it's in your interest to do it then there's nothing to stop you doing it but you better know what the consequences are and have them factored in.</p></speech>

It's what you'd expect it to be in some respects.  But the point I'm making is, you know, it wasn't a case of whoever's on the list determines what we're going to do, that wasn't the issue.

It's not ... and in fact in fairness, you know, when the incoming, when the present Government came into office and had ideas on that front, you know, they went and discussed that in the corridors that ... the relevant corridors and they made the decision that it was, you know, a valid decision from their point of view, that it wouldn't be in our interest to proceed along those lines at this time.</p></speech>

Can you give us your view - because Professor Honohan has speculated in his evidence as to whether this view was a valid one or would bear out - that ELA would be withdrawn from the country ... following the letter saying ... threatening that it would, unless we entered a programme?  In evidence here he said, "But would they?"  What's your view on that?</p></speech>

And what the programme provides us with was a fiscal framework at an affordable price which was not available anywhere else to do what needed to get done as difficult as it was.  So that was one aspect of it.<br/><br/>The other aspect that you're raising with me is, would the central bank have carried out their threat to withdraw liquidity?  Well the central bank had made it very clear at their governing council meeting earlier that month that the present situation could not continue indefinitely.  It doesn't mean ... what does that mean?  It means that a resolution had to be found, a policy response had to be created that wouldn't be on the basis of <i>status quo</i>plus.  And it was in our interests too by the way to find a way of restructuring our banking system, of finding a way of downsizing the balance sheets and getting confidence from the international community again that we had a sustainable banking system.  And, you know, so I have to acknowledge all of those facts in terms of ... rather than saying pro-ECB, anti-ECB.  I'm not getting into that I'm just saying these are the facts.  And when you're in a position of responsibility and when you're in government you have to take all of these things into account.  So Professor Honohan says, at the end of the day, doesn't mean that they were going to pull it immediately.  I'd probably concur with that.  But does that ... where does it get you if the situation is that the present policy isn't sustainable?  It is not in our interests if it's not sustainable and it wasn't in their interests.  So we had to find a solution to the problem.</p></speech>

Could I go to core documents DOT/BCO Vol. 5, page 6?  Mr. Cowen, in terms of the analysis for NAMA, the expectation was, and Minister Lenihan on the floor of the D&aacute;il said it would be something between a 25% and 30% write-down.  When the analysis was concluded it was a lot more than 25% to 30%, it was almost ... I think it was 59% was the average.  Did the establishment of NAMA lead, subsequent to the guarantee, lead the State with no option but to accept the bailout?</p></speech>

The question of the 30%, this was the problem that I might have mentioned before, earlier, and that was, you know, you had the duty of accountability to the ... to the House, when you're putting through the legislation, where people were asking what sort of haircuts are we talking about?  And, this was the first guesstimate, if you like, well it was a guesstimate, by definition.  And, the problem is, you know, on the one hand you're trying to give the House an idea as to what might be entailed here and the second thing then is if it doesn't work out right ... you're not accused of misrepresenting it or misleading ... but it creates another problem and it creates a ... an issue, externally more so than internally, where people are saying, &quot;Well, do they know ... have they got their arms around this at all?&quot;  So, to that extent, it wasn't helpful.  If you were doing it again, you'd still have to go into the D&aacute;il and ask people to take on ... on ... take on legislation without you being able to give them the detail that they were looking for, and, of course, that's difficult as well.  So, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.  But, the point is in any event that it wasn't a good ... a good way of building confidence in the process, when you ended up with a 57% average haircut, as distinct from a 30% prediction.<br/><br/>It does have the benefit though of being transparent.  People always look for transparency.  Transparent in the sense that, you know, you're ... you're putting your cards on the table as to what ... the number of loans you were talking about, what number of debtors you were talking about and what the haircut was gonna be, having done a very granular case-by-case examination of ... of the loan books.  The question you then ask is, did this ... was this a contribution to us having to go into the bailout?  I think, unfortunately, that the ... the bailout issue arose in terms ... in terms of the banking situation was that the ECB was running out of patience in terms of the ... the liquidity provision being provided and the amount that was being provided.  And they felt that we needed to come up with a solution that wasn't based on, as Mr. Trichet said, providing liquidity <i>ad infinitum</i>.  So, I don't think ... I don't think the NAMA process contributed to it but, I think, sometimes the predictions you were making about what the level of haircuts ... and not being able to stand over it when you got to the end of that process, did create a sort of a dissonance out in the international investment community as to whether we were on top of it or not.</p></speech>

While the IMF rate was fixed, the Commission and the ECB moneys were not fixed.  I understand the logic behind it not being too cheap where people would try and access it, but the term was short and other conditions were ... were difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.948" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#KKK00900"><p>Well, I think ... that's a fair point.  I think that the issue there was that we were the first ... the EU were not expert or <i>au fait</i>with doing this process.  It was the first time to be in this sort of a ... IMF were more ... regular people who did this sort of thing.  But the issue was ... so, we were the first ... we were the first in line, if you like, for ... for a programme.  </p>  <p>         What was clear is that if you put in a programme that is sufficiently ambitious and rigorous and stands up to scrutiny, and if you start implementing that programme, you build goodwill with the programmers and you start saying to them ... you start getting the sort of flexibilities you are looking for.  Plus in relation to the interest rate we were back in negotiation, not negotiation but back with them again in December after we had completed the negotiation and we had formally adapted the programme in the House.  And in fairness to the present Government, over a couple of years when an opportunity arose in the IBRC situation to lengthen the years of the repayment period, the schedule, then obviously that was a commendable achievement as well.</p> <p> So what I am saying is you have got to build your credibility with these institutions.  The fact that we could do it quickly, the fact that we had a credible programme - it wasn't easy and I am not suggesting that for a moment, it was going to be very difficult domestically to do it.  But once you got into a position where you are able to deliver and of course the quarterly and monthly reviews that were going on, showing that this State had the capacity to deliver logistically on the sort of details that they wanted about the programme and how it was doing and all the rest of it, that all added to the goodwill for us to continue with getting improvements.  As I've said I am not involved in public life now but I would acknowledge and commend the work that this Government has done to improve some of the terms.</p></speech>

Okay they are subject to the same fiduciary obligations as every other director because you're a director of the bank, but they are people who have had an experience in their public careers as to ...  they would be <i>au fait</i>with government policy or public policy and would be bringing that perspective to the table while others from the private sector expertise might be bringing a commercial experience to it.

It was still possible having conducted a negotiation.  It was quite entitled as a party and say, &quot;We don't agree with this proposal.&quot;  But I mean it would not make much sense if you were walking away and did not have a plan B.  The plan B would have to be how are you going to fund your deficits and the markets weren't funding our deficits at that point.  They were but they were doing it at a rate that we didn't believe was affordable and putting more burden on taxpayers and therefore more burden on the sort of corrections and adjustment you'd have to make because you were already in deficit <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what you were spending and what you were bringing in.  So you have got to be pragmatic.  It doesn't mean you try and, as I said, negotiate and discuss to get the best possible terms.  But the best possible terms wasn't about how we to we evade our responsibilities, the best possible terms was how do we undertake our responsibilities in a way that optimises our ability to get back, not just to a public finance balance but also do it in a way that maintains social cohesion and provides economic prospects as well to the best extent we can.</p></speech>

I think that the biggest mistake we all made was failing to analyse as regularly - as Regling and Watson analysed it - when you're in a new currency situation, where interest ... you no longer have control over your interest rates, you've got to find other parts of the toolkit to make sure you don't end up where we ended up.  In other words, your fiscal policy and your incomes policy has to be ... has to compensate for the fact that you ... when your economy is growing, when your economy is moving ahead at full-trend growth, you can't produce interest rates as a domestic policy instrument to calm down the economy, so you've got to find other ways of doing it in a monetary union.  There's great benefits to being in a monetary union, but that's a lesson that we certainly have to learn.</p></speech>

There was ... there is a famous or ... well, a famous Trichet letter of 19 November, but there is an earlier letter from Trichet to Brian Lenihan on 15 October and it's in your core booklet, page ... Vol. 5, page 31-32.  But the last paragraph on page 32 is to quote Mr. Trichet, &quot;As I told you, a key element of the monitoring by the Governing Council of Eurosystem exposure to the Irish banking system, and the related decisions the Governing Council may take, will be its assessment of <i>progress in implementing the four-year economic strategy</i>that the Irish Government envisages to announce in early November.&quot;  And then goes on a little bit and says, &quot;I trust that the four-year strategy will target a fiscal deficit of below 3% in 2014 and a decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio from [2010/12] onward...as well as a strong structural reform programme&quot;, which, to the ordinary person, means strong austerity.</p></speech>

But this ... well, the structural programme, it doesn't say, but what is being demanded essentially is the type of austerity that you implemented.  So, were you ... did you draw up that programme in the expectation that you would be reliant on the troika and, therefore, that you would go along with what they were demanding?</p></speech>

It is true to say that, before that, back in September, from September on, the ... as I was saying earlier in a previous session, the Minister for Finance was discussing with Commissioner Rehn, in the normal way between member states and the Commission, what our plans were for fiscal consolidation in the following number of years.  We had to ... we hadn't a sustainable position, Deputy, that we could contain, so, in other words, he is simply here confirming that he hopes that the strategy that we're developing will meet these things he's talking about.  Now we were, it was clear ... under Stability and Growth Pact rules, we wanted to get back to below 3% as quickly as possible.  We didn't want to be in excessive deficit procedure with the European Union.  We also wanted to obviously start reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio because, if it kept going up, you could get to a point where it wouldn't be sustainable and you ... the, sort of, measures you'd have to contemplate at that stage would be even more severe than the corrections we had to contemplate.  </p>  <p>         So, whilst he's setting out here parameters, it's as a result of discussions that had been taking place with the Irish Finance Minister that he is coming, sort of, saying, "We hope that the strategy that you had is going to be along the lines that you've suggested."  We were suggesting these programmes.</p></speech>

I knew that there were discussions ongoing ... that they were aware of what we were trying to achieve within the European Union institutions ... certainly the Commission.  And it seemed to me that the Central Bank was acting on the basis of it meeting ... it had ... saying it wasn't going to continue with liquidity assistance<i>ad infinitum</i>.  They were bringing that to our attention.  Now, had they just rung the European Commission they'd know that we were working on and finalising a programme that would meet the requirements of ... our own requirements and their requirements in terms of working within the Stability and Growth Pact.  If you're a member of a currency union, you have to work within the rules.  And if you go outside the permitted deficit, you have to give an indication as to how you're going to get back within deficit otherwise - if everyone does their own thing and deficits just balloon - you undermine the credibility of the currency.  So, you have to play by the rules.  So the benefits you gain can sometimes mean that you have to also comply with the rules.  And they're there for good reason, they're there for our benefit as well because I think we're in a better place now than we were at this time that were ... under discussion.</p></speech>

And in ... then, in the second last paragraph, "I'm sure ... you are aware that a swift response is needed before markets open next week".  Did you see that as him trying to blackmail the Irish Government to panic ... into a decision?  And did you consider threatening the ECB back, saying, "Why should ... why should we ... or on what authority do you demand that the Irish Government would place the burden of German and French and British banks, and US banks perhaps, private banks, onto the shoulders of the Irish people?"</p></speech>

There was a need ... so there wasn't a question of panicking, there was a question of we being at an advanced stage of discussions with all of the institutions on that point.  We were also trying, as I said earlier, to get to a position where we got the maximum possible leeway we could, given that we had very little room to manoeuvre but it was worth trying to do that.  But, thirdly, the question of a programme was something that the Irish Government saw as their duty to undertake anyway.  We needed to show to the international community ... investor community, as well as everyone else, that we were serious about getting our public finances ... continuing to move down a path that we had started.  And we had gone from, you know, serious contractions, starting in '08, worse in '09, then a slight GNP increase in '10 and then moving on to '11 where IMF and others were starting to say, yes, you will see growth coming back into this economy, you will see employment being created again, because we are starting to get our house back in order having come through this crisis.  So that's where we were at.  It wasn't ... you know, its often portrayed that, you know, we we're in ... we have to recognise this, its often portrayed that everyone was imposing things on us.  We had things to do in our own interests, regardless of what others thought about it.  You couldn't continue to run deficits of 11.5% or 10% GNP - its not possible to do that.</p></speech>

I mean, if we had a situation where, given what had to be done on 29 and 30 September that we weren't capable of making a decision, and if there was a bank closure, the impact that would have on public sentiment, on a run on other banks, you know, we don't ... we don't have ... we don't wish to see that happening anywhere.  I don't like to see it happening anywhere.  And I'm just saying no, we didn't get to that point.  They got to that point in Cyprus.  They got to that point in Greece.  And I hope they can find a way out of it that's ... will alleviate the hardship of the people that are suffering under this situation.</p></speech>

And, in retrospect, how do you justify putting a burden of &euro;64 billion on the ordinary people for debts of banks and bondholders that they had no responsibility for?</p></speech>

It's a question of going to ... we have a Constitution and the Constitution speaks about our parliamentary responsibilities, our governmental responsibilities.  You require a referendum in respect of a change to our Constitution - there was no constitutional amendment required in respect of this.  This was a legislative matter, a matter tied up with our membership of the European Union.  So that didn't arise.  And, secondly, the fact is that, you know, when people talk about the difficulties that it caused, and I know it caused difficulties, but I often think what difficulties would it have caused if we didn't meet our responsibilities, if we left, from 2008 saying, "We won't do anything about this, we'll just give out about it and say nothing about it and let the deficit stay at 20%."  I mean, who was going to fund this 20%?  Who was going to produce this &euro;1 in every &euro;5 that was being spent by Government outside of what we were able to create ourselves?  You know, you've got to face up to it that we've got to bring it back into balance and, as I say, we lost ... we had 2006 ... we'd 2004 or '05 levels of taxation we had to get back to 2006, 2007 levels of expenditure and that's not easy.  But the alternative is to continue with levels of expenditure in 2013 and 2014 knowing that you're going to hit a wall and you're end up with 1977 levels of expenditure and 1980 levels of tax revenue.  You can't ... you can't fly in the face of what's in front of you and what's in front of you is, get back growth as quickly as possible, get your public finances back in order as quickly as possible, consistent with doing the best you can for those who are least able to take it, but get back, in the interest of those very people, because you won't be able to provide public services for them in the future if you don't do it.</p></speech>

DOF03558.  There was a decision to proceed with an injection of &euro;3.5 billion for Allied Irish Bank, given that it was clearly outlined that this amount was insufficient to meet their capital needs ... Allied Irish Bank ultimately required a total capital injection of  &euro;19.8 billion.  Can you comment on the decision to proceed with that injection at that point?</p></speech>

And those discussions took place between Department of Finance people, Brian Lenihan may have been directly involved, I can't recall, and the banks themselves.  That was regarded as being not, we're not saying when that initial capitalisation was made that that's all that was ever required, although at that point it looked like it might be all they ever required, because you didn't know until you actually got into this question of loans and getting the NAMA process going.  And it didn't seem to me, or else they were very much in denial, it didn't seem to me that they thought that they were in that sort of trouble either.  So, I think what was, I was reading some transcript here, it may have been Mr. Cardiff, who would be <i>au fait</i>with the logistics of this thing, that they agreed on &euro;3.5 billion each between both banks in order to show parity between the two of them even though, Bank of Ireland could have taken three and the others could have taken four, so AIB insisted on &euro;3.5 billion as being sufficient, so that's just the detail.</p></speech>

It may have happened when they were drafting or talking about it.  I understand, again, reading from documentation that, that may have been on the basis, I think even the regulator was ... if I'm right in this I'm not sure, saying that his job wasn't to give a warranty either, it was a question of leaving that out rather than sinking the ... they weren't solvent but I think probably though the banks, those two banks didn't want to be involved in deciding on other people's, what other people's position was.  They clearly didn't know what their own was.</p></speech>

On the contrary, the impression was that actions were delayed while uncertainties about what would be done increased.  He said Jean-Claude Trichet made several attempts in private conversations on the margins of the European meetings to urge Mr. Cowen and Mr. Lenihan to move swiftly.  He said, "We took all opportunities to tell the Irish Government they had to take bold actions very quickly."  This is suggesting that they were urging bold actions and none was happening.

I mean, there's some people in the euro system who thought if you have a deficit of &euro;15 billion why can't you take &euro;10 billion off it next year?

It says, "I would like to re-emphasise that the current large provision of liquidity by the Eurosystem and the Central Bank of Ireland to entities such as Anglo Irish Bank should not be taken for granted as a long-term solution."  Were you taking it for granted?  Were you continuing in this manner or were you, meaning you the Government, concerned that actually this better stop quick, because we've gone beyond our limit?</p></speech>

We had real commitments to fund our deficits in terms of providing social and public services.  We had this other problem in our banking system which was not making it easy for us.  And when we acted transparently in terms of going through every loan in every bank that was problematic and putting a value on it and providing the bonds to these banks to go and present to the European Central Bank, that was improving the liquidity position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the European Central Bank and Irish banks.  But of course we had this one-off impact on our deficit because it had to be part of your GDP and that brought it up to, what was it, 30%?<br/><br/>I hear, you know I hear Government representatives in recent times talking about the fact that they brought the deficit down from 30% down to what it is.  I mean, they don't mention the one-off statistical impact that that decision we made had.  They have done well on reducing the deficit, I am not here to be churlish about that.  But I don't think they should exaggerate either that they've reduced the deficit by 27% all on their own, clearly they haven't.  And ... so, I mean, that's ... you know, let's all be honest with each other here.  There were one-off hits on that deficit figure that weren't there next year which is one of the reasons why you're getting down to the figures you're getting down to.  Otherwise you'd never get down.  So I just think, you know, when we're having public debate, there's sufficient achievements for everyone to ... in terms of correction of the public finances without exaggerating.</p></speech>

But I don't know why that was the case because in Brian Lenihan they had a very credible Minister for Finance who had ... who had been delivering budgetary results that were making changes and adapt ... and adjustments greater than any other EU country.  Now, we had further to travel so why they should question the fact that he was simply trying to manoeuvre to a position where he could formally recommend to Government that we apply for a programme, based on the discussions he would have had and the clearing up of some issues that he wanted cleared up to his own satisfaction ...

And, you know, I can only say that I am very sorry that I was there in government when some of this came to light.  In terms of, I've said, "Was I not doubting enough, was I not questioning enough"?  I've asked myself, I can assure you, on many occasions, privately, was there anything else that ... what did I miss and why did I miss it, and all the rest of it.  But we are ... you know, the situation is that there have been many lessons learned, new institutional arrangements in place, new personnel in place, new legislation in place, a much more rigorous and better regulatory regime now than we had in the past, and there is absolutely no room for complacency, either personal complacency or institutional complacency, in dealing with matters of this vital importance in the future.</p></speech>

So, therefore, when it came to getting that loan sorted out, you hadn't the legal wherewithal to do it because the various legal niceties hadn't been observed.  </p>  <p>         So there might be another loan where it's non-performing but you can get paid because the security is good.  So you've got to actually to get into this thing on a micro level.  The point is regarding our regulatory system, we now have a far more intrusive one.  I've read ... or I've read where Mr. Elderfield, I understand, is going to be submitting his proposals to you.

Mr. Cowen, in your statement, you said with regard to the Financial Regulator there was:</p> <blockquote> 	A failure to properly judge the risk that was building up in the banks and that the 2003 legislation dividing the micro and macroeconomic responsibilities between the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank did not work as well as intended, and that consumer protection aspects were emphasised at the expense of the prudential responsibility that the Financial Regulator had.  </blockquote>  <p>Now, we know that the Financial Regulator was accountable to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Finance.  So do you think that a part of the failure of the Financial Regulator was due to the lack of oversight from the Minister for Finance and the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

As you say, he was answerable to the Oireachtas, you've heard from the Department of Finance people as to what they saw their role as.  In many cases in the past, we had moved over time in terms of public administration to get Departments out of day-to-day affairs of various agencies and people with other responsibilities and get on with strategic policy planning and all this.  But I agree with you that you've got to find a balance there all the time and you can go from one extreme to the other where you have interference on day-to-day issues and then you go to the point where you ... the oversight is such that the independence of these agencies allows them to continue on without the act of oversight that you would hope and expect.  I just think there are lessons to be learned from that and I think that, you know, you'd have to conclude that, yes, there would be need to be improvement in both cases.</p></speech>

Would that be a correct view?  I think it was reported that your official diary suggests that.</p></speech>

But I also accept that given what happened here, there is a need for a more structured interface between a Department of State, like the Department of Finance, and these bodies, and I think if a lesson is to be learned is: the assumption that there isn't a problem because none are being communicated to you either by the non-executives or by the executives doesn't cover the situation sufficiently given what's happened here.

Yet, in a four-year period where there is a responsibility for oversight on the Financial Regulator; you only met with the Financial Regulator on two occasions during a time of turbulence at that time in terms of credit boom and so on and so forth.  How can you justify that position?</p></speech>

I didn't meet the regulator himself, personally.  But the fact is that there were people reporting to me in respect of work that was being done by all of these people  The issue of ... on the one hand, as we all know; it is important that there isn't any political interference in an independent regulatory system, particularly one like this.  But I have acknowledged that by the same token, if we are to learn lessons from this; is that we need to have some sort of more structured interface between the Department and the agency.</p></speech>

And the reason I point this out is on page 4 of the evidence book on, sorry, on page 3 of the evidence books, Vol. 5, there is a note there which clearly states that - and this is on ... this is in March 2009, just a number of months after the guarantee decision to provide the liquidity.  It says that:</p> <blockquote> 	At present Irish banks face an extremely unstable outlook.  In recent times they have experienced major withdrawals of deposits and established credit lines leading to substantial recourse to the Central Bank for short-term liquidity support.  This is not a sustainable trend and if it persists would be expected to lead to a serious systemic issue for the Irish banking system over the coming weeks. </blockquote>  <p>This is within months of the Government bringing in a guarantee with contingent liabilities of &euro;440 billion on the Irish State to provide exactly liquidity but this note from the Department of Finance is saying it's no longer working.</p></speech>

It was a success for a short time and as you say, sentiment against Irish banks continued.  But it also provided us with the time and space to try and deal with the issues as they arose, including a recapitalisation and other arrangements that had to be put in place like NAMA and all the rest of it.  So, you know, I am not suggesting, no more than the guarantee was the source all the problems of the Irish banking system, I'm not suggesting the guarantee was the source of all the solutions to the banking system.</p></speech>

So, the point is, the question about the guarantee was to stop a run on the banks to stop an implosion of the banking system.  But the inherent weaknesses in the banking system and the losses that were yet to crystalise in the banking system and to emerge were there.  They were there before 29 September and they were there after 29 September.  But it is often portrayed that is was that decision on the night that brought that loss.  It wasn't.  The purpose of that, that night, was to avoid an implosion of the banking system.</p></speech>

It says:</p> <blockquote> 	The deterioration [of] Irish credit terms associated with the national fiscal position has been compounded by the additional contingent liabilities of ... &euro;440bn under the bank guarantee scheme and the fact that deposits and access to international credit markets have not been stabilised as a result of the Guarantee is compounding the perception that the contingent liabilities could be realised through a bank default which would impact very severely on the State's financial system and creditworthiness. </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               Mr. Cowen, in this memo the Department of Finance appears to be putting forward the analysis that by March 2009 the guarantee decision is having a direct negative effect on the national fiscal position.  Would you concur or not with the analysis at the time from the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

And it did have a negative effect in that respect.  I accept that.  And that was something that was a concern even when we were making the decision.  But the point is we couldn't allow the alternative to happen either, and the alternative to happen could be where the banking system would deteriorate and a run on banks would continue.  So, you know, I'm not saying these are good options here.  You're dealing with least worst options.</p></speech>

March or April 2010.  So, you know, there was a reaction to this, and then there was an easing off, and then when you get to April 2010, the bond yields are fine.  We're well within our parameters to be continuing to go to the markets and obtain our money to fund our deficits.  The problem happens in the Greek situation in May and June.  That sends a big problem into the system again.  In the same way that in 2011-----</p></speech>

How can we credibly say that it was the problem of the Greeks, or suggest, in some fashion, that it was because of the Greeks that we had to go into a programme, given that &euro;35 billion of that programme had to be set aside because of a bust banking system in this country?</p></speech>

Can I ask you finally, at the start of your evidence last week, you said that you fully and completely accept responsibility for the decisions that you had taken in relation to the crisis.  Today you have expressed regret on two areas.  You expressed regret that there was an incorporeal Cabinet meeting instead of a full Cabinet meeting, and you've expressed regret that there was no notes taken on the night of the guarantee.  Is there anything of substance other than those two issues that you regret personally in terms of the responsibilities that you're willing to take in relation to your handling of the crisis?</p></speech>

I take full responsibility in relation to my handling of the crisis.  And, you know, people will apportion blame and responsibility wherever they will.  I'm just simply saying that, as Taoiseach, I take my share of the responsibility in respect of what happened.  And I do so because I'm duty bound to do that.  Now, for political reasons or party political reasons, people will apportion a certain amount of blame greater than maybe is my due, but that's politics.  But I have at all times sought to do what was right for the country, to do what was right in a very difficult situation, to play our part in helping restore our public finances to a semblance of being able to get back growth and get going again, and I believe that we contributed to that, albeit in, as I say, you know, with horrendous decisions to have to contemplate.  But we did it, and were prepared to do it.  And, as I say, the responsibility I accept is where ... where it lies at the Taoiseach's office, I accept it.  It's as simple as that.  And that covers everything, all aspects of the work I did.</p></speech>

Mr. Cowen, in your statement, you mentioned that the most important reform had been the reintegration of the Financial Regulator's office back into the Central Bank as a single organisation, and the skill mix has been upgraded.  Can you outline why you think was more important, a substantial increase in staff numbers available for potential supervision of financial institutions?  Like, between '09 and 2011, the Financial Regulator went up by 64% in numbers, by 243 extra people, and the Central Bank, in that period, went up by 227, 31%.  </p>  <p>               So, can you just ... were both institutions understaffed, both in terms of numbers and in quality of staff-----</p></speech>

I think the most important thing we could do was bring forward that Act that, sort of, improved, in my opinion ... and learned from the experience of what had happened ... about what we needed to do to make sure the Central Bank was fully integrated.  And I refer to the fact that in February '09 I had looked at ... I had suggested that we needed to get to the ... use the Canadians as a model.  It was the best model that I could see where there was a good regulatory culture, an effective regulatory system in place.  Regarding the question of resourcing the regulator and getting more people in, certainly that was needed, given that what we had seen, and, as I say, the funding for that wasn't dependent on the Exchequer, the funding for that could be generated from within the balances of the Central Bank itself and a contribution from the financial services industry.  So, you know, that ... so, I'm saying the most important thing we could was the legislative reforms.  I'm not suggesting that the personnel reforms that were brought in and the ... it wasn't also important, of course it was, because we learnt from the Honohan report about the number of people on the front line that were actually doing the regulating.  It surprised a lot of people.</p></speech>

NAMA was an initiative that was trying to identify all of the problem loans in the banks, in the covered institutions, taking them out of there and getting a situation going as quickly as possible where banks could show repaired balance sheets and get on with lending, get on with the business.</p></speech>

NAMA originally was ...  the plan was 30% haircut discount.  It ended up, basically, being nearly 60%, nearly &euro;19 billion extra of losses.  You had to bring out a new, we'll say, bank plan on 30 September, just literally a month and a half before you applied for the bailout programme.  In essence, is it fair comment to say that the second bailout was really, in substance, a second bank bailout?  And if that level of discounts ...  if you hadn't crystalised the losses in NAMA to the extent that you did, that the European authorities would not have been ... that it caused a degree of panic amongst European authorities in terms of the exposure of the Irish-----</p></speech>

I think ... you see, we were dealing with this issue when it's all boiled down far more up front and transparently than a lot of other people were.  We'd identified the loans.  Now as regards to pricing of them. If we accepted the 30%, then that would have been at a bigger cost to the taxpayer because you wouldn't have got the haircut that you needed to get to make sure that NAMA in doing its work comes out with a positive balance.</p></speech>

But I take the point that part of the economic plan had to incorporate a restructuring of our banking system.  That's a fair point ... that we had been struggling to try and get a solution where confidence was coming back into the banking system.  And the basic problem was that our banking system had got too big for the economy that we had, and that meant that we had to restructure and reduce balance sheets</p></speech>

Firstly, was that not an endemic weakness in terms of the controls and the management of the economy, when you were both Minister for Finance and Taoiseach, that we allowed the banking sector to get exponentially the size it got relative to the Irish economy?  And, secondly, Professor Honohan when he was in here, stated that he went on the "Morning Ireland" programme on 18 November because his biggest concern was that there would be a risk of a run on the Irish banks.  Did you have that concern?</p></speech>

I mean, I'm not going to second guess a Governor of an Irish Central Bank, but it wasn't imminent.  It wasn't imminent.  It was a concern that they had based on the fact that there was a confidence issue with the Irish banking sector still and we needed to find a restructuring problem ... a solution to that problem and the EU-IMF programme provided us with that solution.  We ended up, as you know, passing the legislation in late 2010.  It involved the nationalisation of these banks, some of them, and we were able to deal with it from there, plus deal with the Anglo, Irish Nationwide situation and with the IBRC situation.</p></speech>

What controls were in place, in your period as Minister for Finance and Taoiseach, to look at the level of the balance sheets of the Irish banks and the exposure of the balance sheets of the Irish banks, relative to the Irish economy?</p></speech>

That lending growth was, in the main, going towards economic growth.  When lending growth stopped, economic growth stopped and that was, sort of, the impact, if you like ... the real impact of the financial crisis was that it cut off access to capital at a time when the economy was growing at a strong rate.  But there was also ... a re-balancing would have to be done because there was a level of activity going on, construction-related activity, that wasn't sustainable.  The mistake in the analysis was that that could be ... that could resolve itself through this soft landing idea, rather than the hard landing that came when the financial crisis hit.  And that's, you know ... I think Regling and Watson set out in good measure a lot of the issues that were the causal factors of that.</p></speech>

One comes back to ... I think in your earlier comment this morning, Mr. Cowen, in your opening statement to the committee ... or, sorry in his opening statement to the committee, Mr. Liam Kelleher, former director general of the Construction Industry Federation states, "Representation and lobbying has always been a key element of the CIF's activity".  If I could ask you what impact, if any, on the decisions taken by the Government would you attribute to lobbying activities of such organisations and how did you, as Taoiseach, ensure that the decisions taken by you were not unduly influenced by special interest groups?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#YYY00900"><p>I think during my time as Taoiseach, in my Administration, unfortunately, we were in a period of economic retrenchment, so it wasn't a question of providing expansive opportunities for industry to lobby.  It was about identifying those things that were important, that needed to be ... continue to need investment and the fact that we continued with 5% GNP as part of our capital budget was important.  That was something that the CIF, for example, would be interested in, as the Construction Industry Federation, in terms of the jobs that that could sustain and the replacement it was making, in terms of a public capital programme, as against a diminished private housing sector.  So, in other words, there are some times when people put forward proposals.  If they're consonant with Government policy objectives, you use that expertise to the benefit of the country and, hopefully, come up with policies that are responsive and which have ... are effective and bring a public good, as well as, obviously, being welcomed by sectoral interests who have a legitimate interest in some aspects of what you're doing.</p></speech>

Is your testimony to the inquiry this evening that you didn't know that they were actually outside the door?</p></speech>

What I'm saying to you is that, when Mr. ... when the gentlemen was ... came to the Department of the Taoiseach at 9:30 p.m., he was in an outside room.  He had been asked to be there, he was phoned or whatever or e-mailed or texted by Mr. Cardiff.  I hadn't asked for, "Get me the NTMA."  The official had got him, he knew the other two gentlemen were away.  But he was articulating, you know, there wasn't a question that the NTMA position wasn't known in the room.  It was.</p></speech>

There was an initial proposal in 2005 for a modernisation and simplification of the legislation which was announced in 2006 to bring all the legislation for different ... the different financial industries within the same regulatory framework.  Can you outline for the inquiry what happened to these efforts during your tenure as Taoiseach?</p></speech>

This was sort of a consolidation idea.  It was about consolidating financial services legislation, put it all under the one Act, if you like, and it would be good for the purposes of presenting Ireland as a good location for financial services etc.  But there were far more ... you know, so you we had that in place in various legislative framework and this was all about bringing it all together and reviewing it and all the rest.  And we obviously ... other legislative priorities took over pretty quickly.</p></speech>

Post-nationalisation, why didn't you ask for resignations, be it from the regulator, from the Central Bank, senior executives within the banks themselves, when the true extent or, at least, a partial picture of the true extent of the losses became known?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#AAAA00700"><p>Well the full extent became known over a period of time and there were a lot of management and board changes during that time.  You know, so ... I mean, the Minister for Finance had made it clear about a number of things regarding bonus performance being stopped and salary caps and a whole lot of things like that.  There were other situations where people retired out of their jobs, indeed, before the nationalisation was completed.  So post-nationalisation we ... you know, the Minister appointed public interest directors.  He had a constant interaction with the banking industry and he made it clear what was expected both in terms of codes of conduct in terms of mortgage arrears, in terms of how customers were to be dealt with.  There was a whole range of areas where changes took place at the instigation of the Government.</p></speech>

My view on it was that we had sought to deal with a crisis situation to the very best of our ability.  There were still structural problems there.  There were still changes that had to take place and changes did take place.  And over that period if you look at the personnel in relation to particular banks, you'll see that there was significant changes.</p></speech>

And, if you did, what did you make of it or what ... were you aware of those concerns yourself at the time?  I want to put the direct quote from Mr. Cardiff's witness statement to you.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	During his time as Minister for Finance he was concerned that sensitive information could not be trusted to the whole cabinet because &ndash; in his view &ndash; at least one of his colleagues would not treat the information received with discretion.  This had consequences later. </blockquote>  <p>That's the end of his quote.  </p>  <p>               Were you aware of those concerns?</p></speech>

I don't know about that at all.  I think it's the concern of every Taoiseach, or every Minister of Finance of any Cabinet that confidentiality be respected..  It's absolutely critical for the cohesion of any Cabinet to work properly ... and, again, there's sometimes, unfortunately, people who - I'm not saying there were in my Cabinet - but from occasions of times when people seemed to be unable to understand why that principle is so important; it's not for the purpose of being secretive, it's for ... it's the importance of having free expression of opinion and acting as a collective authority coming to a decision and once that decision is making back that, back that ... back that decision.  and if you can't back the decision, do the honourable thing and step out of the collective authority that makes the decision.</p></speech>

Can I ask you now in relation to the decision of the Government to appoint Peter Bacon to recommend options for property and developers' loans in that crisis period before the establishment of NAMA?  I remember questioning him about it myself when he gave evidence, when I asked him was he procured under the normal procurement process that would apply to such appointments.  He said that he wasn't because it was an emergency situation.  He also said in his evidence that he was a director of Ballymore Homes for a period of years, I think which ended, I might stand to be corrected, in the summer of 2008 - Ballymore Properties I should say.  Considering that that was one of the largest property development companies in the country at the time, is there not potential, at least, for a conflict of interest, that he was now in the role of advising the Government on options in relation to the establishment of NAMA?</p></speech>

Mr. Bacon had, apart from any private directorships he currently had when he left the public service, or whatever, he had a long record of involvement in these, sort of, issues, and an expertise that might be helpful.  You know, I think you have to believe in, you've got to ... you can't allow all the time the suggestion to emanate that because you had an involvement in X disqualifies you from dealing with something in that general area.  I mean, the quality ... the reporting that he did was very good work, very good professional work.  And in my opinion, I have no reason to question the man's professional integrity.</p></speech>

Mr. Cowen, you say in your witness statement that the Central Bank Reform Act of 2010 has provided "a new and effective structure and brought further clarity to the roles and accountability amongst the regulatory and supervisory institutions of the State".  </p>  <p>               So can I ask, in your opinion, to what extent did the banking crisis influence the changes made to the regulatory regime in the 2010 reform Act, which addressed the division of responsibility for macro-level supervision and micro-level supervision between the Central Bank and IFSRA which was set out in 2003 originally?</p></speech>

I think that ... whilst I don't question for a moment that the people who were working that new structure were doing so to the best of their ability and avoiding turf wars and all this sort of stuff, I think it's important that, as a result of what happened, we had a much more simplified structure and that no indication could be given that there was a problem with ... at what stage does who get involved in what and all this sort of stuff.  So it was a question really of looking again at best practice worldwide and, as I say, it was based on the Canadian model.</p></speech>

You referred earlier, Mr. Cowen, to the issue of corporation tax and efforts, perhaps, by others to put that issue on the table.  Can you tell us, specifically, was this requested as part of the bailout negotiations ... that Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate would be changed ... or prior to then?  Can you clarify exactly what happened on that issue?</p></speech>

He was also concerned about some comments that were being made at the time, at various meetings he was attending, as to what conditionality people had in mind - some of it official, some of it unofficial.

And it's giving an overview, really, of the cost of recapitalising the banks and if you look at Anglo Irish Bank, for example, the total of &euro;29.3 billion, this was as of January 2011, and it goes through the chronology there - &euro;4 billion in June 2009, &euro;8.3 billion in the prom note in March 2010, increasing then to &euro;10.3 billion two months later in May 2010, then in June, a further &euro;8.6 billion in the promissory note, then in August another &euro;6.4 billion.

It's there, yes.  The top part of that table, it's just going through the chronology and I'm not asking any question of detail.  My question is: in terms of the factors that led to the bailout in November 2010, is it the case that the extent to which it took so long and there were so many changes in the overall bill for recapitalising the banks, and the difficulty that there was in finding the bottom of that black hole, that that really sapped confidence among the markets towards Ireland ... that we couldn't get a handle on the extent of the problems in the banks, the picture kept on changing?</p></speech>

But part of our problem too was that there wasn't a market out there and, therefore, the valuation issue was becoming a moving feast as far as I could see.  It didn't make it any easier.  It was time consuming anyway but that was another complication and complexity that, again, by definition, didn't feed confidence into the system.  While I think there was a recognition that Ireland was being genuinely ... rather than trying to hide the issues inside in bank balance sheets, we were trying to extricate out of bank balance sheets what the situation was.  </p>  <p>         And ultimately, by the time we set up NAMA, got that work in place, had the statements in banking, then deal with the Greek situation, the impact that had on our own bond market, I mean, there was an awful lot happening and an awful lot going against us so that by the time we did finally get to where we wanted to get to, we were ... we were ... again our room for manoeuvre was restricted again so that our ... to be honest with you, our honesty in getting it out there was militating against us in terms of improving sentiment.</p></speech>

I was happy that the interest rate issue wasn't being closed off to us.

If I can just clear up with you just one question and then deal with two matters.  Mr. Cowen, if I could ask you in regard to, it's in your own opening statement, I think it's in paragraph 301 of your statement you say, "Broadening the tax base, creating new sources of revenue and cutting back Government spending were essential features of a budgetary policy."  And then over the years leading up to the crisis - this is the question I'm putting to you, so over the years leading up to the crisis, a high and increasing reliance was placed upon transactional tax revenue, such as stamp duty.  To what extent do you attribute this to the problem that the Government faced in coming into the years in which you had to restrict Government expenditure and broaden the tax base?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#EEEE00400"><p>It was a serious problem because the construction industry came to a halt, the market collapsed and the idea of a phased reduction of output, which had been budgeted for, had to be revisited because of the fact that output went much lower than what was anticipated.  So whilst we were accommodating a reduction in output in our budgetary strategy, we certainly weren't budgeting for what emerged in the construction sector as a result of the financial crisis.</p></speech>

The first graph I have up there, it's at the top of the page, and what you'll see is capital gains tax as a percentage of total revenue, this is the overall revenue figure.  And in or around 2002 it makes up 2% of the overall figure, going up to 6% of the overall revenue in the period of 2002-2006, an increase by my estimation of about 200%-----</p></speech>

But we move on then, to the next one, and we go inclusive.  The next one up is stamp duty as a percentage of total revenue, from 2002-2006 that moves from 4% up to 8% of total revenue.  And then on to the next diagram which is the total level of cyclical taxes as a percentage of revenue moving from 2002 to 2006.  In or around 2002 it's just in around maybe 22.5% and coming into 30% of taxes by 2006.  Looking at those figures now, and just given your earlier comment there, would you give any consideration, Mr. Cowen, in retrospect as to what changes would have or could have been made in the earlier years to ensure that the Government was not so reliant on transactionary or transitionary tax revenues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070800002#EEEE00800"><p>Well to be less reliant on transactional tax revenues we would have had to increase income tax, had more people paying tax at perhaps higher rates.  The purpose of the personal taxation policies was to maximise employment opportunity for people and by keeping personal taxes low, maximise employment.  I think we had got to a very good position on employment, an historically high position.  But looking back now, I think Regling and Watson have outlined a number of issues that need to be addressed for the future.  And as I say there was no budgetary strategy, however prudent, that could have avoided a major adjustment, given the scale of the crash that happened.</p></speech>

Well, there was a rebalancing that we were hoping to take place on the basis of the soft landing analysis.  That clearly, over the period of years following, be an adjustment of less contribution by those taxes which would involve more contribution by others.  And that would involve probably, coming back to income tax rates or income tax bands, etc.  So the readjustment would have had to take place.  I'm not suggesting otherwise.  </p>  <p>         What unfortunately was that we were very vulnerable at the time it did happen.</p></speech>

Or what it says about the soft landing theory is it says it's a very hard landing theory ... very hard landing obviously, given what happened.  But the analysis up to then which we went into in some detail last week, the assessment was both domestically and internationally, the preponderance of evidence, not all of the evidence, but the preponderance of evidence was that it would be a softer landing.</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff then says:</p> <blockquote> 	Well, I can ... the reason the question was put was, I think obvious enough.  The Taoiseach was about to ... was coming close, I suppose, at that stage at finalising his mind and other people were coming close to finalising their minds so I suppose it was a check of where we were around the room.  As to whether, as to why Brendan was outside, well Brendan was outside the room because the people in the room ... the senior people in the room, didn't chose to bring him in. </blockquote>  <p>Who were the senior people in the room? </p></speech>

I just didn't ... you know, I wasn't saying, "Keep someone out here."  That didn't happen.  I was simply making the decisions based on who was in the room.  I didn't determine ... I knew the two top men were away.  That's all I knew.  Now the fact that there was someone else from the NTMA around for to help with any technical expertise or advice, that was fine if it that was the case.  But I didn't ...

I've explained the rationale behind the policy we were pursuing, and I acknowledge that had we spent less, and I think I acknowledged in the opening statement today that had there been less spending then the level of vulnerability would have been less.

But it would have come at a price of higher unemployment during that period, and less growth.  That's just what I'm saying.</p></speech>

So clearly I wasn't saying that we were going to have a sustainable capital taxes of 30% of total tax take - clearly not.  But you would get back down to maybe 12% of tax take, and 13%, and that would mean having to look at other budgetary possibilities to make up the shortfall, or else adjust your spending accordingly.</p></speech>

So can we imply from that that there was a design fault within NAMA that led to the bailout?</p></speech>

It was ... I mean, NAMA was set up to do a job.  It was set up in a highly politicised atmosphere.  All sorts of mal-intentions was being ascribed to it for the setting up of it.  It has done its job well in terms of the mandate that it has.  People can have their concerns about it as to how it operates, etc., etc., but, you know ... so it did it's job, and it was a job that needed to be done, and is being done.  </p>  <p>         Now, it took some time, it took a considerable amount of time.  One of the reasons it took some time was that the knowledge, either the knowledge or the denial, in the banks, was such that what emerged ... no one in the banks was suggesting that when you do this process you're going to end up with a haircut of X, or whatever it was, none at all, it's not that ...  it's not like that at all.  But when they actually went in and did it, that's ... and that took time, but I agree that it was a ... that was a, if you line ... if you like, a disadvantage of that process, was the time it took.  But, it wasn't helped by lack of co-operation either, or lack of knowledge-----</p></speech>

And just, final question, and I'm sorry to come back to it, in terms of the burden-sharing in November 2010, but it's just to try and get some clarity on your view.

Was there an axis of collusion that led to the difficulties and crisis that this country faced, between Fianna F&aacute;il, Anglo and developers?</p></speech>

It has been a politically fraught time, great difficulty for the people and for Parliament and for everyone.

First of all I wish to thank the committee for the courtesy they have extended to me and indeed the many necessary and rigorous questions they have asked and the spirit in which they were asked.  I have willingly come to this inquiry to be as helpful as I can.  The statements that I have forwarded to you and that I have read out at these two public hearings constitute my considered opinion on the issues that you have raised with me.  I hope our interaction has provided further assistance to you in the work that you are doing.  I think the banking reports that my Government commissioned and the Nyberg Commission of Investigation report, along with the report that will ultimately emanate from this Oireachtas banking inquiry, will hopefully add to people's understanding of the nature and scale of crisis that confronted us and the public policy responses of successive Governments.  I believe the management of the crisis over the last seven years has enabled us to look to the future with greater optimism.  These improved prospects for our country would only have happened by the efforts and sacrifices of the Irish people themselves.  I believe we confronted our responsibilities to the best of our ability and our democratic system is hopefully the stronger for it, despite the strains on it that were undoubtedly imposed from time to time as the crisis intensified and then abated.</p>  <p>  As the person who led the Government at the time, I want to place on record my appreciation for the work and efforts of all those who served the Government in all our Departments of State and agencies at that time.  I believe that they displayed a strong and unswerving commitment to the State and its fortunes at all times and I am personally deeply indebted to them.  In the context of the workload on policy issues that arose during this financial crisis, a particular burden was borne by the Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, and the Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, and those who worked to them.  My fellow colleagues in government and in Parliament will forgive me if I pay particular tribute to the quality of their work, given the budgetary and legislative workload that they have to do and undertake during that time.  Finally I want to reiterate for the record once again that what has motivated me throughout all of my political career has been to serve my country and our people to the very best of my ability.  While I accept as a committed democrat the verdict of the people on the performance of the Government I led, it is my fervent hope that they accept that I never compromised my political integrity or breached the public trust in the performance of my duties as a Minister or as Taoiseach.  To hold the office of Taoiseach I regard as the greatest honour.  I did my duty as I saw it, it was my privilege to serve.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

I welcome H.E. Mr. Patrick Engelberg, ambassador of Luxembourg to Ireland.  Luxembourg's Presidency priorities are wide-ranging and ambitious.  The Presidency seeks to deepen the concept of a social Europe and revitalise the Single Market with a focus on digital technology.  Issues of great significance to Ireland are the Presidency's priorities for completing EMU and in the area of taxation.  The Presidency, of course, has many other priorities.  We look forward to exploring these in more detail with the ambassador.</p><p>Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Mr. Patrick Engelberg" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015070800002#B00300"><p>It is a great pleasure and honour to present to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  It is Luxembourg&rsquo;s 12th Presidency and the first since the Lisbon treaty fundamentally modified the functioning of the EU and the relations between its institutions and, of course, the role of the Presidencies.<br/><br/>Ireland showed us in 2013 that, despite these changes, a committed Presidency can make a difference.  It is in that same spirit that we see this as a genuine opportunity to show our commitment <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>European integration and to the principles and values the European Union is built upon.  Our approach is based on outreach and openness: listening to the citizens, supporting enterprises, and collaborating with partners and institutions with a view to acting in the general interest of the EU. <br/><br/>The Presidency will endeavour to put the citizen at the heart of the European project as the title of its programme suggests - A Union for the Citizens.  The Luxembourg Presidency programme focuses on continuity and on the thorough implementation of the strategic agenda adopted by the European Council in June 2014.  It duly takes the policy orientations of the President of the European Commission, the Commission&rsquo;s annual work programme and the work of the Trio Presidency into account.<br/><br/>The Presidency programme is divided into seven key priorities covering the main challenges the European Union faces today.  Given the post-crisis context, stimulating investment to boost growth and employment is an indispensable response to the main concern of the European citizens.  The actions of the Presidency will build on the Investment Plan for Europe of the President of the European Commission and will focus strongly on putting a better regulatory framework for investments in place, in particular for SMEs.  It will also promote the establishment of the Capital Markets Union in order to enable capital markets to play a bigger role in the financing of the economy.  The Presidency will pay particular attention to two legislative proposals linked to the CMU - first, a proposal to ensure transparent, simple and high-quality securitisation in order to revitalise a market that has not yet regained its pre-crisis levels and to address the risks associated with securitisation and, second, the review of the prospectus directive in order to facilitate access to capital markets for SMEs.<br/><br/>Luxembourg will emphasise and give a strong impetus to the social dimension of the EU.  Social investment policies must go hand in hand with the European Union&rsquo;s goal to create more sustainable growth.  Measures against unemployment and the convergence of social policies rank high on our agenda.  The Presidency will lend its full support to the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to relaunch the social dialogue in order to ensure better economic and social governance at European level.  The Tripartite Social Summit, which will meet before the autumn European Council, will be an opportunity for a constructive exchange between the social partners, the European Commission, EU Heads of States and Governments and Luxembourg&rsquo;s and the Netherlands&rsquo; Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs.<br/><br/>Managing migration, combining freedom, justice and security will be a further priority.  The Presidency will push for progress in the different fields covered by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, ranging from family law and data protection to internal security as well as immigration and asylum policy.  The fight against terrorism and the agenda on migration are pressing issues for Europe as a whole and must be addressed quickly in order to provide adequate responses.  Even if internal security is primarily the responsibility of the respective member states, we believe that the EU can provide added value, for instance, with the implementation of a European passenger name record or the reinforcement of external border controls, information exchange and operational co-operation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is the Presidency&rsquo;s ambition to revitalise the EU Single Market by way of an improved recourse to harmonisation and mutual recognition.  Particular attention will also be paid to the development of a genuine Digital Single Market, which bears new opportunities for citizens and a forward-looking economy.  The three pillars of the Digital Single Market strategy proposed by the Commission supported by the Luxembourg Presidency and which, as we know, are of particular relevance in Ireland, are: better access to digital goods and services; the shaping of the right environment for digital networks and services to flourish; and maximising the growth potential of the Digital Single Market.  We believe that this project should be at the core of the Single Market strategy.  As our Minister in charge of this dossier cited recently, we want to get rid of having 28 mini-markets and instead have one big market.<br/><br/>The Presidency will support efforts for better regulation to ensure a European level-playing field, facilitate competitiveness for businesses and protect the interests of the EU citizens.  We will support efforts to implement the Regulatory, Fitness and Performance Programme, REFIT, seeking to identify and highlight the European added value.  To improve the functioning of the Single Market and to stimulate growth, it would be useful to adopt common European rules in order to achieve legal certainty for market players, failing which, 28 national legislations would be applicable.<br/><br/>Boosting European competitiveness in a global, transparent framework is another of our priorities.  Thus, the completion of the European Monetary Union as well as the fight against fraud and tax evasion will be two key areas of work for the Luxembourg Presidency.  Transparency and the creation of a level playing field are key preconditions to ensure competitiveness.  The Presidency aims at successfully concluding the negotiations on the proposal for transparency on tax rulings as proposed by the Commission.<br/><br/>The international trade agenda will be a key topic in Luxembourg&rsquo;s programme with the signing of the CETA agreement with Canada and the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  As Luxembourg&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Mr. Xavier Bettel, made clear recently, &ldquo;during the Luxembourg Presidency, TTIP will not belong in a darkroom&rdquo;.  Therefore, a public debate will be organised by the Presidency in November in Brussels.<br/><br/>The Presidency will endeavour to promote sustainable development for the benefit of European citizens by supporting the transition towards a green, innovative and circular economy.  The Presidency will steer the discussions in the EU at the 21st Conference on Climate Change, COP21, in Paris in December and will combine its efforts with the European Commission to ensure that the European voice is heard.  Europe has to assume its responsibility to tackle the issue of global warming effectively.  Luxembourg will help contribute to the establishment of objectives for sustainable development that will replace the eight millennium development goals.  <br/><br/>The Presidency will seek to strengthen the European Union's presence on the global stage.  We will endeavour to develop the existing relationships with its closest partners by updating the European Neighbourhood Policy.  Furthermore, the Presidency will work towards the consensual adoption of an annual enlargement conclusion in December.  The meeting of ASEM foreign affairs ministers in November will be one of the highlights of the European foreign policy agenda. <br/><br/>This year, 2015, which has been declared European Year for Development, will also be a pivotal year to bolster the EU&rsquo;s credibility by taking decisive action in the field of development co-operation and humanitarian aid.</p><p>The Presidency will host the closing ceremony in December and, therefore, has a responsibility to inform and raise awareness among European citizens.  It is with these key priorities that the Luxembourg Presidency will commit itself to moving the European integration project forward so as to ensure that our Union will be better equipped to face the challenges of our time.  The past few weeks gave us compelling examples of some of these challenges.  The tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean and the recent events in Calais highlight the necessity for a European response to the thorny migration issue.  The terrorist attacks perpetrated very recently, which hit Ireland cruelly as well, along with those carried out earlier in 2015, require a strong and united reaction.</p><p> Luxembourg is proud to be able to make its contribution to the European project.  Together with our European partners, including Ireland which is deeply committed to European integration, we will endeavour to tackle all the challenges the EU as a whole has to face to maintain the spirit of the EU.  We will endeavour to find constructive solutions to address the concerns and interests of all member states.</p><p> I thank the joint committee for giving me this opportunity to present the priorities of the Luxembourg Presidency and I look forward to further good collaboration and questions from members.  We are prepared for a Presidency that will not be routine.</p></speech>

The committee will be examining the Five Presidents Report on the EMU in the autumn.  The ambassador referenced the current situations in the Mediterranean, which perhaps forms part of the non-routine matters for the Luxembourg Presidency about which he spoke, and also managing migration, immigration and asylum policy.  As there appears to be no end to the flow of migrants from various parts of Africa and neighbouring regions, what in the ambassador's view can be done?  We are all aware of the comprehensive search and rescue operations that have taken place, in which Ireland and other countries have played a part.  The more migrants that are settled in Europe, the greater the incentive for a continuous flow of migrants.  I would welcome the ambassador's view, or that of his Prime Minister, as to the proposed solution in that regard.</p></speech>

One might get the impression from the priorities of the Luxembourg Presidency, which I have just outlined, that we are slightly disconnected from what is going on in the world but that is not the case.  The Luxembourg Presidency is charged with finding a solution to the relocation and reinstallation of refugees.  We appear to be making some progress.  The latest report I read on the matter shows that thus far, 23 countries have signalled to the Presidency that they are willing, on a voluntary basis, to take some refugees.  However, the final numbers in this regard have not yet been determined.  On a national basis, Luxembourg has agreed to take 515 refugees, which includes the relocation of approximately 260 refugees, with the remainder to be reinstalled.  This equates to approximately 0.1% of the Luxembourg population.  This is a first response to the emergency.  We are fully aware that this will not solve the problem and that we need to find a more durable and sustainable solution to this crisis.  Collectively, we are still faced with a huge problem, originating in those countries from which the refugees are arriving.  Additional solutions designed to stop people drowning in the Mediterranean are required.  While Luxembourg is providing support in this regard solutions must be found with the countries of origin.  There are currently in place a number of programmes to assist in the strengthening of structures in countries where these structures have almost disappeared.  The aim must be to find long-term solutions.  Luxembourg will be supportive of all that can be designed in this context.  We must be prepared to face a long-term endeavour.</p></speech>

I wish him and his Government every success during the course of that Presidency.</p> <p>  I welcome also the seven matters of priority mentioned, including stimulating investment to boost growth and employment, the importance of which we are aware of in Ireland.  We hope that Luxembourg is successful in that regard.  On the second priority, deepening the European Union's social dimension, following the recent serious economic downturn, there is an urgent need to address the social issues in any way that is within our capacity.  It is most important to recognise that this is necessary.  </p> <p>  The ambassador has already responded to questions from the Vice Chairman on the third priority of managing migration, so I will move on.  On revitalisation of the Single Market by focusing on digital dimensions, which is an excellent objective, I hope that we capitalise on it to the best of our ability.  The ambassador also mentioned boosting European competitiveness in a global transparent framework, which is welcome.</p> <p>  The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, is an issue that is likely to be dealt with in the course of Luxembourg's Presidency.  Ireland has received a great deal of criticism over the past couple of years on the basis that it, allegedly, operates an unfair system in terms of facilitating foreign direct investment companies here.  It goes without saying that a 12.5% tax was applied to all manufacturing undertaken here by foreign investors.  The allegation was made that some companies in other jurisdictions were re-routing their profits through Ireland.  There is no proof of that.  Ireland is not at the centre of the European market.  It is an island nation on the periphery of Europe.  The only way off this island is by aeroplane or boat.  It is not possible to drive to the centre of Europe from Ireland.  There are issues in this regard that need to be borne in mind in the context of the debate that will take place around the levelling of the playing field, which we hope will happen.  Ireland is often accused, including by some senior politicians at the centre of the European Union, of operating at an unfair advantage.  I refute that.  We have had a system in place that is open and transparent and is necessary to ensure we can compete on a level playing field.</p> <p>  The debate around the economic crash is ongoing at the centre of Europe, in particular in relation to Greece.  I am not familiar with all of the ingredients of that debate.  We get our information via the media, in so far as we can.  I believe there is a necessity at this stage for realism around what the European Union and members states engage in.  We are on the world stage.  A procrastinated debate is demeaning to the European Union and to member states.  It should not continue indefinitely.  There are procedures in place to deal with this type of situation.</p><p>In the case of a member state falling into economic difficulty, there are economic stress tests that take place.  They are well known.  Those who read economics will know this, and I apologise to all economists in the House, but it is not rocket science; it is quite simple.  In effect, it is a due diligence report that indicates the capacity of a company or a country to bear up to its economic or fiscal responsibilities.  It should be possible to identify a route and a path within that, keeping in mind the necessity to recognise the ability of the individual country's economy to stand up to the pressure generated by the situation that has developed, which we in this country unfortunately had to face and not without considerable stress and hardship.  Moreover, it has not gone away and will not for a considerable time.  I emphasise the importance of the focus for the good of the European Union, for the good of the people of each member state of the Union and for the good of those countries that already have made sacrifices and those which continue to be obliged to make sacrifices, while appealing to all concerned to address the issues fairly and honestly and not in a political way to seek advantage of the situation.</p></speech>

Mr. Patrick Engelberg" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015070800002#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan for his contribution and for his encouragement.  I will come back to two topics he raised, the first being the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, transparency on fiscal matters and fiscal rulings.  Generally, the Luxembourg Presidency decided it would put on the agenda all the financial and tax questions that have been raised in the recent past.  Although it might not be obvious to some member states to expect this of Luxembourg, we thought that first it is our duty as a Presidency and that second we believe strongly in the level playing field and that the same conditions and same level of information should apply to all.  The finger is pointed at some member states because they allegedly seem to have certain systems which are then presented as being disruptive.  Luxembourg also often faces criticism or attacks and we thought the best thing to do would be simply to put it into the open, have a general discussion on it and not to be looking at one country or another.  This is why we wish to make progress on CCCTB, on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and on other items as well.  However, to be productive and to avoid creating a system where we might harm ourselves or even collectively as the European Union, we are very much in favour of aiming at OECD standards rather than European Union standards.  This is because OECD standards would be much broader then would European Union-only standards.</p> <p>  On Greece, obviously this is an extremely difficult and delicate situation, which has not been made easier since last Sunday.  All the resources seem to be mobilised this week to find a solution.  Emergency meetings at the level of the European Council have been called and there will be another one on Sunday.  In addition, there will be another meeting of the Finance Ministers on Thursday.  I read this morning that President Obama has called the Greek Prime Minister in order to understand the situation and also perhaps to advise him that good progress should be made.  It obviously is a huge issue and problem that does not merely concern Greece, the eurozone or the European Union as the whole world is looking at us.  The Deputy is absolutely right; the European Union must get it right because otherwise, we will lose credibility.  One message that was made clear yesterday to Prime Minister Tsipras is that we are running out of time.  Certain of our fellow leaders made stronger comments than others, while some of them gave the impression they might be a little more flexible on finding a solution.  While that certainly is a good state of mind, Luxembourg as a country on a national basis could probably accept a further degree of flexibility than it would be able to propose as a Presidency.  That is also what my Finance Minister said very strongly yesterday.  Whatever solution is found, one must bear in mind what other countries in similar situations endured and accepted measures, which then eventually helped them to rebound and improve the finances of those countries.  Obviously, while one cannot compare totally one country with another, in looking at what sort of solution can be found for Greece, one also should bear in mind what has been accepted by other countries in similar situations.  Let us then see what will emerge this week.  Sunday has been presented as the last possible day to find a solution, after which we probably will be in a different world.  I also read that President Juncker has stated he has a Grexit scenario ready in his drawer.  While it is not a perspective anyone is contemplating with anticipation, the Deputy is absolutely right that at some stage, we must take a decision, which obviously must Greece do also.</p></speech>

They also wish Luxembourg well with its Presidency.  The Vice Chairman started his discussion with the ambassador by asking about the specifics concerning migration, to which the ambassador in turn replied.  Similarly, what might he say by way of specific measures regarding terrorism?  I acknowledge it is an extremely difficult and complex area, requiring a multifaceted approach.  That said, the ambassador should set out what are his thoughts and those of the Luxembourg Presidency on specific actions, both by way of controls, etc., and societal changes to eliminate or reduce terrorism as a risk.</p> <p>  I will turn to another issue that has not been referenced by my colleagues and, therefore, merits reference.  The ambassador correctly identified the forthcoming conference on climate change in Paris as being of enormous importance.  His submission further mentioned Luxembourg's desire to make Europe an even greater player on the global stage.  How successful does the ambassador think Luxembourg could be in getting our international partners to buy into the notion of climate change, solutions to climate change and to the question of carbon emissions?  How persuasive, as a moral force, could the European Union be in this regard in respect of its international partners and perhaps otherwise?  What things could be done to achieve this goal, which would be a great and necessary use of global influence given it is a reasonable proposition that we in the European Union accepted?  In the context of climate change, the ambassador should comment briefly on the areas of solar and wind energy.  While Ireland has a considerable number of wind energy options and turbines under development, I do not believe sufficient solar energy has been developed.  Does the ambassador wish to comment on that and on the wave energy issue?  Lastly in that context, the ambassador should comment on the state of nuclear energy and the current position with regard to dealing with the waste therefrom.  Does he envisage nuclear energy providing part of the solution into the future?</p> <p>  Finally, with the Vice Chairman's indulgence, we are very proud in Ireland of having reached an unemployment rate of 9.7% while, of course, not being happy with that percentage.  This is because nothing better achieves social equalisation, social fairness, the liberation of people and a fair society than giving everyone the dignity of work and the ability to participate in the economy through the opportunity to work.  This is the great social equaliser and is the catalyst rather than any kind of paternalistic injections of benefits.  While we are proud of the position we have reached in that regard, as we want to go further and reach full employment, we have another few percentage points to go.  In that context, the commitment of the Luxembourg Presidency to developing the whole jobs area is important, as is its commitment to developing on the &euro;315 billion proposed investment by the Commission in this regard.</p><p>Could the ambassador be specific about where he sees those jobs and what he thinks the Luxembourg Presidency can achieve practically?  If people outside here are watching this meeting, the one thing they would want to get from Luxembourg&rsquo;s Presidency is jobs.  Although every objective the ambassador spoke of is important, nothing takes precedence over job creation and giving everyone the dignity of work.  Nothing is a greater scandal in the EU than youth unemployment.  That is the great scandal of our age.  People who have retired are back at work and there is massive youth unemployment across Europe, which needs to be addressed.  I look forward to the ambassador's comments.  I am asking him to flesh out some of his thoughts, the specifics of how the objectives will be implemented.</p></speech>

Does the ambassador think there should be a write-down or cancellation of the Greek debt, or, as some of us would prefer, that the debt should be parked to give Greece some time to organise its economy?  Most of us believe that the Greek economy is a failed entity and has been failing for many years.  There is a question as to whether it should have been allowed into the eurozone in the first place because it had a failed banking system and economy and an inability to collect tax.  If a government cannot collect tax in an economy, it is bound to fail, and that is exactly what happened in Greece.  There is a view that, having had a military dictatorship for many years and come through periods of intense and absolute corruption, which the German and French governments have acknowledged, it is a bit unfair to come down heavily on the current government on the basis that it has been in power only since January and needs some time to stabilise its finances and economy.</p> <p>  I have been to Greece on many occasions and have met Syriza and other parties there.  The view there is that the people have taken this out of politics.  Many have said to me there is nothing worse that can be done to them.  There are 300,000 houses without electricity, there is 60% youth unemployment and 30% unemployment overall.  A friend of mine, who happens to be a Jesuit in London, has just returned from Greece where he spent three years.  He tells me that people here do not realise that some areas outside Athens are as near as one can get to Third World status.  He met a businessman &ndash; this is very relevant &ndash; who had 1,700 employees but lost his business and everything.  My friend was in this man&rsquo;s house.  He had no electricity and very little food for his family.  He asked what more Europe could do to him, how could it get any worse for him.  I felt, based on the people I had met in Greece, that there would be an overwhelming "No" vote, whether or not it was right to vote that way.  As an outsider, does the ambassador believe that the Greeks need compassion?</p> <p>  Economists all over the world, including American and German economists, whom we have met, have said the Greeks cannot pay this debt.  They cannot pay &euro;360 billion or &euro;380 billion.  They do not have it.  For the past six or seven years, the EU has been asking Greece to increase tax and reduce spending, which will make the economy crumble further.  What would be the Luxembourg Government&rsquo;s view of parking the debt?</p> <p>  Migration affects all aspects of the European community.  It is a very complex issue.  Many of the people migrating into Europe are running away from terrorism and feel they have no choice but to leave the country they are in.  They are also fleeing economic misery.  It is all very well for us to talk about the number of migrants coming into Europe and how they might overflow across Europe but we do not know how we would feel if we were in the same situation and had to leave our country because of terrorism or an economic collapse.  The attitude in Europe appears to be that nobody knows what to do, how many each country should take, if any at all, and how to deal financially with the hundreds of thousands it is estimated will come through Europe over the next few years.  There is no question that will happen because there seems to be no end to the instability in Libya.  We are faced with huge migration and the question of what to do about it.  We cannot simply corral hundreds of thousands of people and leave them.  We have to find some system for dealing with them, economically and politically.</p> <p>  The main issue, however, is Greece and whatever happens there over the next couple of days can have far-reaching consequences for all of us in Europe. </p></speech>

His first comment was about getting international support.  At this moment, it looks quite encouraging as big global players are already making offers to reduce their own carbon emissions.  In its EU Presidency Luxembourg will play a role but it will be one of internal EU co-ordination, with the Commission.  The French are very active because they are chairing the conference in Paris and want it to be a success and seem to be successful.</p> <p>  Solar and wind energy are encouraged in Luxembourg.  Our government is a coalition with the Green Party and we have a Green Minister for the Environment, which reflects the general awareness of the Luxembourg public of environmental issues.  These policies are encouraged.  We have a lot of wind energy, not quite as much solar energy because we seem to have a similar climate to Ireland&rsquo;s, but we do want to push this during our Presidency.  Nuclear energy is a bit more complicated because Luxembourg is not in favour of nuclear energy and for the concrete reason that one of the biggest nuclear energy plants in the EU is across our border.</p><p>The Cattenom nuclear power plant in France<font color="#545454"></font>is the subject of major political debate in Luxembourg, to the point that our Government decided years ago that we would not want to use electricity generated from nuclear power.<br/><br/>The issue of unemployment was mentioned.  We all admire Ireland's record on fighting unemployment since the crisis.  This is also the first priority of our programme.  Unemployment and access to work is what European citizens care about.  This is why we think it is the first major issue we should tackle to make the European Union relevant.  If we are not able to set a framework where employment is created in the EU, our citizens will wonder what value the EU is giving them.<br/><br/>I mentioned the digital economy, which we view as a transversal element of the economy.  To make it possible, people must have digital skills.  We need to educate our youth and also enable people to enter the digital economy in the first instance to find work and then avail of the social dimension to it.  More and more people are excluded from economic changes and access to services and goods because they do not have the necessary skills to be able to enter the digital dimension of society.  We therefore also need to do something about this and to invest in skills and human capital.<br/><br/>Deputy Halligan raised the question of Greece.  I indicated earlier that the Luxembourg Government would be able to accept more in its national approach than it would table as a Presidency.  We could eventually live with a certain write-off of the Greek debt despite the fact that we have extended more than &euro;400 million in this context.  As one can imagine, it is not our preference.  We would rather contemplate a restructuring of the debt and giving the Greek people more time to pay their debts and reorganise their economy in order that they can put themselves into a condition where they can envisage reimbursing those who lent them money rather than deciding the countries would write off part of the debt.  As I said earlier, it is very important to us that when we come up with a solution for Greece, it should respect what has been done by other countries which had been in similar situations and were able to tackle their national economic problems.<br/><br/>On the question of migration and refugees, we believe we need to take a long-term approach to solve this problem.  The Deputy is absolutely right that many people are leaving their countries of origin because they are fleeing war, civil war, dictatorships and terrorism.  As long as the root problems which give rise to immigration are not tackled, we will face more and more refugees trying to come to Europe.  It is easier to cross the Mediterranean now than during the winter months and we will face more waves of refugees.  We try to find solutions to relieve countries such as Italy and Greece who are at the forefront.  It is not easy.  We, unfortunately, had to acknowledge ten days ago that there were difficulties at European Council level in coming up with solutions.  We, as the country hosting the Presidency, have been asked to look into a scheme to deal with the first emergency problem which is to deal with the 40,000 plus 20,000 refugees, but we are fully aware this is not the solution to the problem.  The processing centre will help us to select those who can be classified as refugees and allowed into the EU in order that we can try to find a solution for them.  Given the situation in the countries we are talking about, the numbers will still be very important.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to absent myself as I was obliged to leave for a vote in the Seanad and, unfortunately, we do not adjourn for votes in the Seanad.  I also apologise if I am repeating questions that my colleagues have asked.</p> <p>  I am not going to go over the ground that has been covered on Greece, but does the ambassador think the steps the EU has made toward a more robust banking union will reduce the risk of contagion in the event of an unfortunate Greek exit from the eurozone?</p> <p>  In the course of his statement the ambassador said: "Measures against unemployment and the convergence of social policies rank high on our agenda."  That is a very welcome statement.  From my experience there has been a certain amount of concern that the Europe 2020 strategy has fallen off the agenda and, in particular, the measures to deal with poverty seem to have been dropped from the lexicon.  Given that more people are experiencing poverty than at the beginning of the strategy, I welcome the ambassador's commitment to the convergence of social policies.  I assumes His Excellency approves of the additional measures being taken to deal with poverty, which I think impacts on all of Europe, including Greece.</p> <p>  The ambassador mentioned the importance of the establishment of the capital markets union.  We are in favour of and made observations on this policy.  An issue that concerns Ireland is the definition of what constitutes an SME.  An SME in Ireland is quite a small company in comparison with what an SME would be in some of the larger European countries.  We are concerned that difference across the Union would be recognised in that area.</p> <p>  My final issue relates to Brexit.  As I am sure the ambassador knows, the idea of Britain exiting the Union is of enormous concern to this country for a number of reasons, both in terms of history, our shared border and our status as English-speaking islands on the periphery of Europe.  There are many other reasons, not least our extensive trading relationships, as to why we would regard the British exit as a matter of significant importance to us and a debate in which it is very important that Ireland engages.  What role does His Excellency see the Luxembourg Presidency playing in terms of the negotiations around the UK-EU relationships?  In that context I wish to address two themes in this address, the first of which is revitalising the EU Single Market, which has been identified as a priority for the negotiations around Brexit.</p><p>Mr. Engelberg mentioned more efficiencies and more cohesive regulation and spoke about European added value.  To what extent does he see this assuaging British concerns that Europe is overly bureaucratic?  Does his concept of European added value involve more or less bureaucracy?  He mentioned more social cohesion, which I would welcome, and the importance of committing to moving on the European integration project, which seems to imply moving towards the ever closer union, as expressed in the treaty.  This is an issue which Britain has flagged as a concern and wishes to have treaty change with regard to this choice of words.  On the one hand Mr. Engleberg seems to be assuaging British concerns but on the other, Luxembourg's priorities for the Presidency seem, to some extent, to fly in the face of some of Britain's concerns, particularly with regard to social cohesion and bureaucracy.</p></speech>

It will be sent to the institutions and I am sure Mr. Engelberg will receive an official copy of it, if he has not already done so.  Mr. Engleberg mentioned the public debate in November on TTIP.  What is the Luxembourg Government's opinion on the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, arrangements?  From what we hear, some of the larger states have concerns about it.  Several weeks ago we had a cross-committee hearing where the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation expressed the view that we need to be vigilant about ISDS and we need to debate it.</p></speech>

On Greece, we did well to have the right instrument to make our banking sector more robust and cut the link with the sovereign, but the Greek problem is much broader.  Let us not to prepare for the worst but if there were an eventual default in Greece, the eurozone and EU banks would be affected.  We do not know to what extent because we do not know what provisions have been made.  I expect provisions have already been made in various countries.  The instruments we have in the eurozone should help us overcome it but, nevertheless, it would be a difficult moment for the entire banking world and not only in the EU because we know the US and China are looking at the situation in Greece with great concern.  It would have a global impact.</p> <p>  Luxembourg has made social measures its second priority because our country is very much based on social cohesion.  We have placed it so high on our priority list because we believe it is important to have a strong social cohesion policy nationally and we feel it is necessary in the EU to show citizens we also care about this aspect and not only about austerity policy, which has been important and essential to introduce new discipline in our finances.  We also need to take care of the needs of European citizens.  This does not mean we focus only on welfare benefits or giving more money.  As we discussed earlier, it also means investing in education, human skills and human capital and creating jobs.  The best way to alleviate poverty is to make it possible for those who are excluded from the labour market to access decently paid jobs.  This is the best solution we can propose to fight poverty.</p> <p>  I take Senator Hayden's point on SMEs in Ireland.  They are comparable to SMEs in Luxembourg where the companies are also very small.  One of our main arguments on Capital Markets Union is it will allow us a means to access financing via the capital markets and not only via lending from the banks, which at times has proven to be more difficult.  I imagine this point on the variety of structures of SMEs is taken into account in the ongoing reflection.  Luxembourg is very much involved in and committed to Capital Markets Union, but we know it will be a medium and long-term endeavour and not something which will be done by the end of the year.</p> <p>  On Brexit, Senator Hayden is right to point out some of the themes and issues in our programme are more likely to suit making the EU leaner, more fit, less bureaucratic and more efficient and other parts of our programme might be less attractive.  That is how it is.  Luxembourg has its own EU agenda, because we are a very committed and engaged member state and we want to make progress on European integration.  I did not mention that Luxembourg is in favour of an EU public prosecutor, which is also something not desired by other member states.</p></speech>

It is about shaping compromise.  At the end of the day, we will not have one or the other in the short term.  At the EU Council ten days ago, Prime Minister Cameron presented the four main topics they would like to discuss with EU member states.  This discussion has been launched and we have a rendezvous clause for December.  Luxembourg is not formally involved in this through the Presidency, in the same way as we are not formally involved with Greece or other topics.  The Presidency is no longer what it used to be.  We now have a permanent President of the European Council and President of the Eurogroup.  The institutions have various competencies and roles.  Faithful to our tradition of trying to find solutions, make deals and progress the European project, we will be very active behind the scenes and we will try to build bridges between the positions.  It is the same with Brexit, although I should not call it Brexit as it is about renegotiation and reform of the EU.  There have been a number of high-level contacts between Britain and Luxembourg in recent weeks.  We are very aware of the issues the British want to raise with us all and we assured them that, as always, Luxembourg will be an honest broker and will try to help everyone find proper solutions.</p> <p>  Luxembourg like other countries is very concerned about certain aspects of TTIP, particularly ISDS.  We very much expressed the view that dispute settlements are still for national parliaments and systems.  In May, Luxembourg was among five countries which proposed an alternative to what was on the table.</p><p>The proposed alternative was a more permanent tribunal of independent judges dealing with dispute settlement, rather than something that could be seen as less transparent and impartial.  Otherwise, Luxembourg is very much committed to progressing the TTIP negotiations.  Earlier this year, we were quite optimistic that we could achieve something before the end of the year.  This optimism seems to have vanished a little now.  Nevertheless, we want to move it forward as much as we can by the end of the year.</p></speech>

Some 96% of the people involved in those negotiations represented corporate bodies, and the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the Human Rights Committee in Europe, for instance, were excluded.  Even in America, many democrats and almost all of the trade union movement - like the trade union movement across Europe - have grave problems with TTIP because of the accountability issues relating to the negotiations and the amount of information being given to people.  It is interesting that MEPs across different parties in Europe are saying they feel they have been excluded and their parliaments are being excluded.  Quite bluntly, the ordinary everyday person does not know what TTIP is, and very few others do, because a lot of the negotiations are taking place in secret, which is the difficulty with TTIP and something that needs to change dramatically.  As I said, even elements within the American Government have reservations about how it is being dealt with across Europe.</p></speech>

We are not the only ones having problems with certain aspects of it, such as transparency and secrecy, as Deputy Halligan mentioned, and investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, as the Vice Chairman mentioned.  There are similar concerns in the US.  That is true.  My impression is that the commission understands this message on transparency and openness and has now adopted a much more open and transparent approach.  I think it has been understood that this is the biggest obstacle to public acceptance of TTIP.  All of the 28 Member states and the commission believe that TTIP is a positive instrument to boost trade between Europe and the US so long as certain guarantees and conditions are met.  Deputy Halligan mentioned some and the Vice Chairman mentioned another, which is ISDS.  It is also interesting to note that the debate is not exactly the same in different countries.  Some countries seem to be more sensitive to certain aspects of it.  Public opinion in Luxembourg is also quite sensitive to the matters of transparency, democracy and accountability, and what ISDS could mean if we had gone along with the first version of it.</p></speech>

This is important as they cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  </p> <p>  We will have two sessions today.  In the second which will begin at 5 p.m. we will focus on scrutiny of the draft scheme of the public sector standards Bill.  In our first session we will consider the issue of quantitative easing.  I welcome Dr. Stephen Kinsella, senior lecturer in the Department of Economics at the University of Limerick; Mr. Dan O'Brien, chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs; and Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev, adjunct lecturer on finance at Trinity College, Dublin.</p> <p>  The European Central Bank and central banks in the eurozone have pledged to buy &euro;60 billion worth of bonds every month between March 2015 and September 2016, totalling &euro;101 trillion, to support growth and, in turn, employment across the eurozone.  This initiative is known to us all as quantitative easing, one of the main purposes of which is to combat deflation and promote price stability.  We look forward to hearing the distinctive perspectives of our guests of the effects of this initiative to date and its implications into the future.  I know that what is happening in Greece is on everyone's mind.  I propose, therefore, that we devote some time towards the end of the exchange of views with our guests to this topic.  Rather than allow the entire engagement revolve ground the situation in Greece, we can look at the issue quantitative easing and then deal separately with the situation in Greece at the end of the session.  I will indicate when we will deal with it.  </p> <p>  The discussion will begin with opening remarks made by each of our guests in the order in which I introduced them.  Questions may then be put to them by members.  I invite Dr. Kinsella to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is really good that we are having this discussion.  </p> <p>  As a small open economy on the edge of Europe, it is very important that we take cognisance of the large-scale macro-financial changes we are seeing on the policy landscape.  I have circulated a very small discussion document about which I will speak in a while.  I will not necessarily read every word of it, but I will take the committee through it as it is written.</p> <p>  The first thing to be said is that it is very exciting when one tells an intermediate economics student that what one has been teaching them for the previous year has been a lie.  One watches the shock as one realises this has been happening.  Standard school textbooks tell us that banks exist to facilitate the interaction of savers and investors.  While that is true to a certain extent, it does not give rise to the theory and practice of why and how money is actually created.  Money is not created via something called fractional reserve banking in the modern economy.  That is just not how it works.  The way it works these days is that money is created largely by commercial banks such as AIB or Bank of Ireland in creating loans.  When a bank extends a plumber an overdraft of &euro;1,000, it creates a corresponding deposit on its balance sheet.  This allows it and the Central Bank to see that money is being created, particularly once it is paid back, which is a very important point.  When money is being paid back to the bank, effectively, deposits are being destroyed because they are written off against loans.  It is very important that we understand money is a social institution.  As we will talk about money later, it is very important that this come up.  Money relies on trust to function, but we have been labouring under a misconception, particularly as economic modellers, that the Government can create money.  There are such things as Central Bank reserves and digital reserves, but these days more than 95% of the currency in circulation that is part of the monetary base comes from loan creation by private banks.  For this very reason they are central to the functioning of the economy.  </p> <p>  Since currency is effectively created through the private banking system, there is no effective limit on its creation.  When many thought about the idea of quantitative easing, they said the Central Bank was going to print euros, hand the money to the banks in exchange for some bonds and that this would lead to inflation because an increase in the monetary base should lead to an increase in inflation.  That is precisely what has not happened.  It is not a fact that the commercial banks have been given more money to enable them to do this.  The Central Bank has increased its reserves and that has permitted a series of asset purchases.  </p> <p>  We have a modelling fallacy to which students are exposed.  Students are told that the Government or the Central Bank can control the supply of money, but they cannot.  The way we manage monetary policy is that we set the interest rate on Central Bank reserves, to which every other interest rate is key, for example, trackers.  In normal times the way the Central Bank operates is that it raises the interest rate when it thinks the economy is overheating and lowers it to create more lending at a given moment.  That is what happens in normal times, but we are not in normal times.  In fact, we have not been in normal times for about five or six years.  To give the committee a sense of just how abnormal it is, the interest rate set by the Bank of England is at its lowest rate since 1696 when the bank was created.  It is, therefore, an incredibly odd time in the history of monetary policy.  We call this state of affairs "zero-bound".  We cannot reduce the real interest rate the Central Bank charges much below perhaps 1% or 1% and that changes the dynamics of how the average person wants to hold money.</p><p>If one wants to do that for a sustained period, one must say the euro in someone's hand is only good for a month and he or she must spend it.  In effect, that creates a discount rate.  One can see how that would change the life of the average person in society.  With the interest rate effectively useless - it is a bit like pushing on a piece of string - in a situation where the price level is falling way below its mandate and growth is stagnating, a central bank must consider alternative options.  Increasing the size of the balance sheet has been one of those.  We call this quantitative easing.  Given that a central bank can manipulate the size of its balance sheet <i>ad infinitum</i>and is the only power that can do so, it simply buys assets like government bonds in the open market, changing the pricing of the bonds and, therefore, changing the relationship between those.  Not only can it change the price in real time, by intervening in a bond market and increasing or lowering the price, it can also change how investor expectations react to those prices.  Those two things are crucial.<br/><br/>If members look at the first chart in the document I am showing them, it sets out a piece of really interesting research by Krishnamurthy et al from 2012.  It looks at the US experience of quantitative easing.  One can see that quantitative easing causes a portfolio change.  By exchanging central bank reserves for government debt or any other asset, one gets this very large portfolio change where the banks and financial intermediaries that now hold the reserves simply start moving their money around.  They move it into gilts, corporate bonds or equities and one can see that the demand for cash is pretty flat there.  The US QE example is the largest and it has the most developed markets, but it is important to say that every experience of quantitative easing has been different.  It is not fair or accurate to compare the US experience of quantitative easing to that of the Japanese because the institutional differences are so vast.  The way they operate is different.  My colleagues will speak to how the ECB's QE is being done.  Overall, QE is a success if the amount of inflation one wants to see is increasing and, obviously, one is not having very large changes in inequality.  This is something that everyone has been concerned about because in effect one is handing people who are, if not cash rich, certainly asset rich a great deal of cash.<br/><br/>There are many channels through which QE can work and we can talk about that, but I give an example in the handout of the impact on balance sheets .  I look at the situation before asset purchases in asset and liability space.  At the top of the table, members will see a pension fund.  Look at the assets and look at the liabilities.  The pension fund simply swaps its government debt, which in this case was Irish Government ten-year bonds, for deposits, which are handed out by a central bank from its reserves.  The bank simply does that by expanding the size of its reserves which it can do because it is the central bank.  One is using the central bank's balance sheet elastically.  It changes the balance sheet of the pension fund, but as members will see at the bottom of the table, it also changes the balance sheet of a commercial bank, which is suddenly far more liquid with many more deposits and reserves.  It is this mechanism that the central bank wishes to exploit to increase inflation, which is crucial.<br/><br/>I turn to the idea of expectations.  Figure 2 shows the ten-year bond spreads for Germany and Ireland.  Germany is in blue and Ireland, predictably, is in green.  The ECB's QE was announced in late January.  As members will see, the market had already priced in the fact that QE was going to happen.  QE changes market expectations not only when it is going to be enacted but in terms of how much and when it is going to be turned off.  Again, my colleagues will speak to this.  It is about what the future might hold given that the markets are being deluged with this kind of liquidity for this long.  Figure 3 shows the ECB's measure of expected inflation.  After QE is announced, we see it dropping and then it comes back up after 21 January, so inflation expectations are increasing.  If members look at where they are right now, it is slightly below 1.6 or 1.7.  That is in five years' time.  If one is an investor, what one is telling the European Central Bank is that one thinks there will be inflation at or near 0% for the next three or four years.  What that tells one is that one can expect to see QE for a bit longer.<br/><br/>Finally, one of the other very large things that QE does is affect the exchange rate.  For a small, open economy like Ireland's, and we are one of the most open in the world, a weaker euro is better on every level for exports, tourism and everything else.  If one is Ireland, QE has been unambiguously good.  Given that all the other major central banks in Europe will be doing some kind of easing, including the Sweden's Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank, Norges Bank and others, the major players in the European system are easing their monetary policy.  The conditions are there for a reasonably large level of inflation.  For a small indebted nation like Ireland, positive inflation levels are brilliant for debt dynamics.  At this initial stage at least, QE has been a clear winner from the Irish perspective, particularly with respect to the interest rate.</p></speech>

I will not really be looking at Ireland but at the available evidence and the risks associated with it.</p> <p>  Does it really work?  As with many things in economics, it is often very difficult to get a consensus.  Certainly, there is not much of a consensus in the economics community on whether QE works.  There are many reasons for that.  One is that there is quite a small evidence base.  The first time it was really tried was only this century in Japan.  A second reason is that it has most frequently been tried in the post-2008 context when the world has changed and there is a very different environment.  It is very difficult to know what effect any policy instrument or lever is having in such changed times.  The most difficult aspect is disentangling the different things that happen in an economy.  In any day in the world economy, billions upon billions of transactions take place from people paying for taxis or buying loaves of bread to much bigger transactions.  There is a huge number of things going on and it is very difficult to disentangle how a button a policy-maker presses in one place will impact on the real economy.  In effect, we simply do not have petri dishes whereby we can do QE in one and not in the other and compare the two.  It is inherently difficult to say.</p> <p>  However, let us consider the IMF's economists' conclusions.  They attempted to assess the impacts of QE and their research, which comes from late in 2013, which is not even two years ago, illustrates very well just how difficult it is to evaluate.  When they looked at policies, mostly QE, that try to get beyond the problem of the zero lower band where one can bring interest rates no further, their conclusion was that such policies appeared to have boosted growth and prevented deflation although such effects were considered difficult to measure.  Another point they made was that the biggest obstacle to obtaining a clear view of the effects on growth and inflation was establishing the proper counterfactual, that is, the petri dish where one has not tried it.  It is difficult because we do not have the petri dishes.  Finally, they came to the general conclusion that they thought it had boosted growth and inflation.  Anyone who is being honest is going to say, however, that we just do not know.</p> <p>  Let us have a look at some of the evidence.  I go back to Japan.  Central bankers get very worried when they think prices are going to fall as there is an asymmetry.  If prices rise by 100%, which is to say that we get consumer price inflation of 100%, banks know they can increase interest rates to 110% or 120%.  They can go all the way to infinity.  They have always got some extra fire power if they want to dampen inflation where it spirals upwards and out of control.  If prices start falling and spiral downwards, what do they do after they cut interest rates to 0%?  As such, there is an asymmetry in the way central banks can deal with inflation and deflation.  They have much more power to deal with inflation than deflation.  That is why they start getting worried when prices go to zero or below.  They feel that if they let that out of control, they will not have the levers to do anything about it.</p><p>Let us consider what happened with Japan and its inflation rate, dating back to the time when it started dipping into deflation at the end of the 1990s.  During 2000 and 2001 those responsible saw that Japan had fallen into deflation and that the economy had been in a slump for ten years.  They decided they needed to act.  They had said they would never do quantitative easing, QE, but they decided to do it.  Between 2001 and 2006, the five years of QE, the measure was not very successful.  There is little of that period when inflation goes above 0%.  Prices in Japan over that first period of QE stayed flat or falling.  That example is not a strong case of where quantitative easing brought inflation back into the economy at a low level, as desired.</p><p> Let us move on to 2013, when Japan tried an even bigger bout of QE.  The slide shows that inflation spiked, but it has faded rather quickly.  Last October those responsible went even further, and it seems to be having the opposite effect.  Prices are falling even further.  Certainly in Japan, in terms of generating inflation, the record of QE has not been strong.</p><p> Let us move westward and look to the big three economies there, the United States, the eurozone and Britain.  What has happened there?  Let us consider growth because, ultimately, most of us are more concerned about growth than inflation.  Let us consider what has happened to growth in those three economies since 2008.  The picture for the US indicates a weak recovery, but we can see that the United States economy is approximately 8% bigger than it was before the crisis.  Although it has been a weak recovery, the shape of that recovery is normal.  There was a dip into recession and then it moved out of recession.  By contrast, the eurozone economy today is still smaller than it was seven years ago.  It is unprecedented in living memory to have a smaller economy more than seven years later.  Effectively, we have had no growth.  The trajectory on the slide indicates that since we bounced a little out of the depths of the recession in 2009, we have had a very weak period with no growth - a second recession.  As we know, the eurozone did not implement QE.  Let us consider the case of the United Kingdom.  It is not by any means conclusive that QE, which started in the depths of the recession, made a major impact on the recovery in the United Kingdom.  The recovery in the United Kingdom did not really gain traction until 2013, four years after QE began.</p><p> Therefore, although we can say that the US and the UK, which had QE, have had stronger recoveries, and the eurozone, which did not have QE, has had a weak recovery, correlation is not causation.  We cannot say definitively in any way that this means QE has been the cause of the difference in performance between the two economies - that is to say, the US and UK on the one hand and the eurozone on the other.  We see no real difference in the trend in inflation over the last four years between the eurozone, the UK and the US, despite the operation of QE in the UK and the US.</p><p> What are the risks and the downsides?  One of the major risks is taking QE away.  Do economies become dependent on it?  Do financial markets become dependent on it?  I understand Dr. Gurdgiev will deal with these questions.</p><p> Another question is hyper-inflation, and Dr. Kinsella has dealt with that.  There is a concern among some people to the effect that once that approach is taken, a central bank un-anchors inflation expectations.  The view is that everyone may believe inflation is going up, people may look for pay rises and it will get out of control.  Clearly, that has not happened, and, if anything, we are in a period of extreme low inflation, almost deflation.  The measure has not triggered that.</p><p> Another major factor, to which Dr. Kinsella has alluded, is asset price inflation.  One of the big things we learned from the crisis was that central banks spent too much time looking at consumer price inflation and forgot almost entirely about asset price inflation.  In fact, asset price inflation or an asset price bubble can be far worse than a period of high inflation for real economies.  An important question is whether we focus enough on asset prices.  One of the major criticisms is that QE will exacerbate bubbles in asset prices.</p><p> The current slide shows the euro stock market or an aggregate for stocks in the eurozone.  We can see clearly that from the beginning of this year, when eurozone QE started, there has been a sharp increase in stock prices.  It has come off a little since then for other reasons, perhaps, but there is a clear pushing up of asset prices, which is what the measure is designed to do, in one way, although that is not the ultimate aim.  This can have a number of effects, including the creation of new bubbles or spillover effects in other countries - for example, what is going on in China at the moment.  There is major panic in China and there has been a collapse in the Chinese stock market.  There are fears or some views that there has been some spillover from QE in the Western world to areas outside the Western world, including China.  There are also distributional effects, to which Dr. Kinsella has alluded as well.</p><p> I agree with Dr. Kinsella's points to the effect that QE has been good for Ireland, mostly through the exchange rate channel.  We do more trade with non-euro area countries than almost anyone else.  Clearly, a more moderately priced euro relative to our big trading partners, the UK and the US, is good for Irish exporters.  It has also had a clear effect on the Government's cost of borrowing and, for Ireland, as a highly indebted country, this has also been good.  At this point for Ireland and in the European context it appears that there have been benefits from QE.  Given the balance of risks on both sides, I am strongly of the view that QE was a risk well worth taking and one that should have been taken earlier.</p></speech>

I agree with most of what my predecessors have said.  The committee has my slides and members can look through them as we go along.  I do not intend to cover all of them.  I will move fairly quickly to cover as much of the ground as possible.<br/><br/>I want to touch on the background first, because this is important in the case of QE.  There are two sides to the background.  The first is the monetary side - in other words, the monetary environment to date.  This is quite abnormal, and complicates significantly our ability to analyse the effects of QE across the eurozone and in Ireland in particular.  The zero-bound policy rates, which have been mentioned previously, create a certain prevention and distortion in terms of analysing how quantitative easing transmits into the real economy.  In addition, we have severe market fragmentation.  This was caused partially by the previous quantitative easing programme deployed by the ECB, particularly the long-term refinancing operations, LTROs.  In part, this was what triggered the programme parallel to the current programme of quantitative easing - that is, the targeted long-term refinancing operations, TLTRO, programme.  We have unconventional monetary policies which are deployed by a number of the national central banks at the same time within the euro system.  A great example of this, which I imagine we will touch upon presently, is the emergency liquidity assistance in Greece, but it applies to other banks as well.  Another factor is unconventional European Central Bank policies, including those I have referred to, the LTRO and TLTRO programmes, as well as other asset purchases and so on.  Finally, we have the big-gun items on the monetary policy side, which complicate but in some ways support the quantitative easing effects as well.  Most notable among these are the outright monetary transactions, OMT, which amount to the whatever-it-takes so-called claim by Mr. Draghi in the past.<br/><br/>That is the monetary environment.  It is difficult to disentangle it from the direct effects of QE.  I will not discuss the real environment in depth but I would be happy to provide the committee with a link to a longer paper of mine on the matter.  We have an environment featuring what is known as secular stagnation.  This is affecting not only Ireland but the entire group of advanced economies from Japan all the way to the United States.  Basically, it is a premise that the demand for investment is going to be low.  It is low, and it does not matter what we do on the monetary side - in other words, it does not matter how much QE we generate - because borrowing and lending in the economy are going to be subdued none the less.  The reason is the direct effect on the lack of demand for new investment.  In other words, companies are simply not going for new credit and are not funding investment through credit.  There is a lack of new credit creation in the system as well.  This arises from a number of sources on the supply side, such as weaknesses in the banks' balance sheets and so on.  This relates to the severe debt overhang in the real economy.  We have external and domestic demand weaknesses.  Demand for exports and consumption is weak.  Finally, we also have increased risk aversion among investors.  This is not surprising in itself because companies have seen how they and their counterparts have been dealt with by the banks in a crisis environment and, simply and frankly, they have no wish to get more into debt unless it is really necessary.  Secular stagnation causes a significant drag on the potential effectiveness of quantitative easing in terms of real policy.<br/><br/>That said, quantitative easing has two channels through which it transmits into the real economy, at least in theory, and into the markets as well.  The first channel is the <i>ex-ante</i>channel.  This channel operates when the European Central Bank issues forward guidance about future policies.  In the case of quantitative easing, this can be traced back to April 2014.</p><p>That is an important date for us because that is where that effect starts.  It was amplified during the period from 21 January to 6 March.  The latter is the period between the official announcement of the quantitative easing, QE, programme by the ECB and the deployment of first purchases by the bank in the markets themselves.  That is the <i>ex ante</i>channel.<br/><br/>The second channel, which is equally important, is the <i>ex post </i>channel.  This channel relates to what happens in the economy once the ECB begins buying assets, as it did after 6 March this year.  It must be borne in mind that in conjunction with that, we have one targeted long-term refinancing operation, LTRO, programme, which attempts to address, in part, the fragmentation in the markets and which runs in parallel with QE.<br/><br/>I will start with the <i>ex-ante</i>transmission channel.  Here we can see some of the positive effects of QE.  These are very strong and some were mentioned by the previous speakers.  I will deal first with the effect on the yields in the eurozone government debt markets.  Between 21 January and 6 March of this year, there was a significant decline in yields across the eurozone, especially when account is taken of the adverse effects of the Greek crisis and others events in the news.  On average, yields declined between seven and 50 basis points during the period in question.  Maturity, bond quality and bond ratings come into play in this regard but this is a significant average over a short period.  There has been a high impact, as expected, at the longer duration of the yield curve.  In other words, 20 and 30-year securities and AAA-rated bonds have declined by 21 to 25 basis points on average and old bonds with 20 and 30-year maturities have declined by between 40 and 50 basis points on average.  This is a very significant effect.  Interestingly enough, the significance of effect rises in respect of lower quality bonds.  As a result, countries such as Ireland have benefited more than have countries such as Germany, France, etc.  Since April 2014, when the forward guidance period on QE started, through March of this year until purchases began to be made, there was an average of more than two percentage points decline on yields relating to eurozone bonds of upper maturity.<br/><br/>The immediate inflation effects are not yet apparent.  However, the five-year, five-year swap rate, in other words, the expected inflation by the markets from five years from today to five years thereafter, or a five-year to ten-year horizon, has dramatically increased.  This is the measure which the ECB monitors closely in terms of targeting inflation.  There has been very significant uplift in this area in recent months.  There has been some positive effect on inflation expectation, if not on inflation itself.<br/><br/>On <i>ex post </i>measures, this is, as already stated, the second channel.  Dr. Kinsella mentioned one of these measures, namely, the so-called portfolio effects, in other words, the changes that happen in the composition of portfolios by investors in the markets once the ECB starts purchasing bonds.  In addition to this, there are also supply and demand changes.  The ECB has taken very significant quantities of bonds out of the secondary markets.  These are not newly issued bonds.  The ECB does not buy them from governments but rather from investors directly.  It is expected that the ECB is going to take up to approximately 30% of all outstanding bonds of high-quality maturity in the German markets, over 20% in the Spanish markets and over 20% in the Italian markets, which will have a very significant impact.  That impact has been present in the markets since April.  The first impact of this activity is reduced liquidity in the markets.  We have seen the explosion, in terms of the spreads of quoted bonds, between the bid and ask prices being quoted in the markets.  That is not a good sign.  In effect, the ECB purchases are clearly priming the bubble in terms of bond prices in the markets themselves.  In other words, current yields do not correspond to the realities of the risk assessment.  If, for example, members look at the Euromoney Country Risk assessments of sovereigns such as Germany, Italy and France - the larger ones - and also of Ireland, they will see that the quality of sovereign risk has not been commensurate with the uplift in bond prices.  In other words, a bubble is developing there.  This is very much consistent with the evidence from the investment markets.<br/><br/>Euromoney Research Group's survey, which includes data collected up to April of this year, of 1,924 institutions and bond investors indicates that 80% of the latter are concerned about the development of price bubbles in the bond markets and 62% of them expect things to get even worse.  Another survey carried out on behalf of the <i>Financial Times</i>contains exactly the same findings.  The decline in the inventories of the market makers, namely, those who hold inventories of bonds they are ready to sell into the markets, has been approximately 80%.  This means that the surplus of bonds available for transactions has shrunk significantly.  This is causing major problems in the context of the front-running of bubbles in the markets themselves.  As a result, the average quality of the bonds outstanding in the markets is also slipping.  There has been a decline in quality and investors are now being incentivised, by the purchases being made by the ECB, to shift into lower quality bonds and assets.  This, in turn, bids up the valuations of stock markets and, for example, government related bonds, which are not eligible for purchasing under QE, so government agencies, companies, development banks and so on are benefiting from the uplift without a corresponding improvement in their risks.  What I am saying is that there is a mispricing of risk taking place in the market.<br/><br/>I will now deal with some of the Irish evidence relating to the real economy.  This is also an <i>ex post</i>channel.  In other words, it is a channel that is currently open as the ECB is buying those bonds.  First, let us consider the interbank markets premium.  The chart I have provided covers the difference between the 12-month EURIBOR rate - the interbank market rate - and the overnight Eonia rate, and members can see that we are currently at near historical lows.  On average, the current period is just about the second lowest ever.  As members can see, we are trending along those lows and slightly below the average for that period.  What does this mean?  It means that we still have more <i>ex ante</i>effects than <i>ex post</i>effects.  We are yet to see the full effect of QE on the interbank market but there has been a very strong response since the announcement of QE.  This means the markets are pricing in future QE but they are not yet pricing in actual QE.  The effect is reasonably pronounced and positive overall.  What do I mean by positive?  Basically, I mean that the markets are currently incentivising the banks to seek longer-term funding in the interbank market.  This is more stable, higher quality funding and it should translate into banks issuing longer term loans on more favourable terms to companies and households.  That should be the effect but if members look at the next slide, they will see that good news for banks does not equal good news for the real economy.  It is apparent from the data that in terms of the quantum of new loans issued, there has been a small, fragile uplift in terms of the number of loans to the corporate sector.  However, there has been absolutely no movement away from the downward trend in respect of the issuance of debt to the household sector.  The slide includes Central Bank data up to April but we do not yet have any for the subsequent months.<br/><br/>QE has had no effect on lending to households in Ireland but it has had a very strong effect in respect of the lending to corporates, a matter to which I will refer in a moment.  There are questionable terms of lending composition and evidence that the uplift is not down to SMEs obtaining new credit but rather to the larger corporates obtaining it.  The quality of that credit from the point of view of the borrower is not necessarily good and I will also discuss that matter further in a moment.  The slide shows that larger loans significantly dominate smaller ones.  The pre-crisis average of loans in excess of &euro;1 million was 75.3%, whereas the current rate in this regard stands at 96%.  The March-April average was 90.2%.  This is not exactly a good thing.  There has been nothing spectacular from QE on this front and a lot of questions are arising.  In the first instance, we do not know how much of that is down to QE as opposed to the other measures, including targeted LTROs, which have been introduced.  Second, we do not know how much of what is happening is due to the post-crisis bounce.  In other words, the fall was very significant and the recovery should also be significant.  The third aspect relates to how sustainable all of this is and whether it represents a new trend.<br/><br/>I am coming close to finalising my arguments in respect of all of these matters.  One way of examining the quality of lending is to consider for how long companies and households are being offered a fixed rate.  The ideal is to have the real economy operating on the basis of longer term as opposed to shorter term rates.  This is not happening.  Proportionately, we are closer to the shorter term rate at the back of the curve.  We are still at crisis levels in the context of short-term borrowings dominating long-term borrowings and this is a significant problem from the point of view of seeking to move forward.  The banks are being given incentives to lend long but they are lending short.  This is a major issue.  There are two big risks emerging as a result of QE and these are already in play.  The first of these relates to the debt overhang - the biggest problem for the Irish economy - which remains unaddressed as a result of QE.  In fact, it is potentially being made worse by QE.</p><p>What does that mean from the point of view of households and companies, the real economy?  It simply means that quantitative easing, QE, superficially reduces the rates of interest charged on the loans-----</p></speech>

I will come back to that point in a moment.</p> <p>  The problem with QE is that when it ends there will be a reset back to the average historical interest rates.  I have provided a comparison in the table in the presentation, which uses two different ways of treating the margin.  One of them is the lower margin, which is based on the lending and deposit margin spread, and the other is the upper margin, which is based on the short-term/long-term lending spread in the EURIBOR and Eonia markets.  If one takes the average of that, currently the interest rates for households' house purchases with a fixed rate for one year plus is about 2.86% lower than they will be once the QE is ended.  It will be a significant shock to those households when that happens.  As to when it will happen, we do not know.  We know how long QE will last, but we do not know how fast the rates will revert to historical averages.</p> <p>  With household consumer loans, there is slightly less adjustment - less than 1%.  That is because they are currently priced outrageously high.  Beyond that, the non-financial corporations will also suffer a 2.59% to 2.86% potential increase in future rates.  These are very significant rates and they call into the question two issues.  First, what will happen to the restructured mortgages and restructured corporate loans that are currently performing?  The second issue is how many of the currently performing and non-restructured loans will go into arrears under this scenario and how fast that will happen.  QE does not provide us with an answer to that and it does not help us to address that.</p> <p>  With regard to the Acting Chairman's question, the long-run effect of QE is that it reduces or adversely impacts the future profitably of the banks. This is a very significant issue because that in turn reduces the banks' ability to deal with non-performing loans.  In particular, QE eliminates what we call the interest carry trade.  In other words, it is a trade whereby the bank can borrow at low ECB rates and carry it into safe or relatively safe assets at high rates of return.  Because the high rates of return have been eliminated by QE in the safe assets, the carry trade is no longer available to the banks.  If the banks do not benefit from the carry trade, they have to extract their profit margins somewhere else.  Effectively, they will have to get blood out of a stone from the currently defaulting or weakly performing loans and, as a result of that, we are facing a problem there.  In the long run, what it means for us - this does not apply only to Ireland - is that, traditionally, QE carried out at the zero lower bound rates implies that the banks do not deal with non-performing loans; they have no incentive to do so, but they have an incentive to hold them as much as possible in order to extract a higher rate of return in the future.  That is a problem.  One eliminates the high-yielding, high-quality assets and one incentivises the banks to hold low-quality assets for longer in the hope of generating a high yield from them.  That means that household loans and company loans currently in arrears will not be restructured fast enough and loans not yet in arrears but at risk of being in arrears in both categories will not be addressed very aggressively by the banks.</p> <p>  To summarise, my view is simple.  QE has had a pronounced effect so far and, hopefully, it will continue to have a pronounced effect in terms of the monetary variables such as exchange rates, which have some transmission to the real economy, although I believe it was overstated here.  In addition to being a very open and exporting economy, we are a very open importing economy and if households are dependent on imports of food, as all of us are, they will suffer from the deterioration of exchange rates on the imports side.  In addition to that, it has had a significant impact by reducing, in the medium term, the cost of funding the Exchequer, which is good news for us, but in the long run it transmits that cost, probably through the banking channel, in terms of the cost of funding the economy, and there is the lack of a resolution of the problem of non-performing loans.  In real terms, QE has so far not had a significant impact, and most likely it will not have a very significant positive impact.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT provided a breakdown of inflation or the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, for the period from 2003 to 2014.  The figures show the rate of inflation in the European Union in general, the eurozone and individual member states.  I share Mr. O'Brien's view that the eurozone was a little late in adopting quantitative easing.  Why did it act at such a late stage, given that the Federal Reserve in the case of the dollar, the Bank of England in the case of sterling and the Bank of Japan in the case of the yen all engaged in quantitative easing much earlier than the European Central Bank?  Surely European competitiveness was eroded by the ECB's refusal to respond to other central banks.  Who decided not to engage in quantitative easing and why?</p></speech>

Some member states, specifically a large member state in the centre of Europe, take a strong view that central banks should do less rather than more.  This particular country was doing relatively well.  While it had not had a particularly good seven years, these years were better than in most of the other member states.  For that reason, it needed less in terms of a monetary fiscal stimulus.  The country in question also had a very large current account surplus, which means that it was selling much more to the rest of the world than it was buying.  This is a subject of controversy within the eurozone.  If the exchange rate had depreciated, it would have increased this surplus, which would have placed further pressure on the country in question.  There are a number of reasons one prominent, powerful country did not want to experiment.</p></speech>

This is a tragedy of the eurozone construct which brings together heterogenous economies with different needs.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned Germany.  We should not forget other core member states, including the interesting examples of Finland and the Netherlands.  In the period in which Germany was doing very well the Netherlands was experiencing a sustained recession which, in terms of duration, was officially longer than the recession in Ireland.  Despite this, it insisted on a tight monetary policy for a long period and was highly sceptical about unconventional monetary policies, particularly quantitative easing.</p> <p>  There are other effects, including the effect of one central bank trying to match monetary policy to a highly disparate set of countries with different objectives and requirements at different times.  That is what I describe as the ECB pooling effect, which is a tragedy of the euro construct.  In addition, there has been the effect of the European Central Bank's balance sheet which increased to approximately &euro;3 trillion at a certain point - 2011 if I remember correctly.  The reason for this increase was that the ECB had engaged in quantitative easing, albeit not through the traditional channel.  As I indicated, it had long-term refinancing operations and substantial emergency liquidity assistance exposures to a number of countries, including Ireland.  At that stage, Germany was looking at the large quantum floating through the ECB channel and concluded that it was effectively engaged in quantitative easing through the back door.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the quantitative easing that was taking place at that point, albeit in an alternative form, why did the ECB not do as the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve did if average inflation was so low?

The ECB is looking forward at inflation expectations.  I mentioned the quantitative measure for inflation is five years - five-year swaps - but this is just one year.  In ballpark terms, if the ECB is expecting the economy to lift in the future, it will adjust its inflation expectations towards high inflation and may not do anything.  Back in those days - the Acting Chairman referred to the years 2009 and 2011 - if one looks at one-year forward forecasts of economic growth, we even used to joke that the 3% growth rate was always forecast for the following year.</p><p>Every year, the ECB was predicting higher and higher rates of growth.

The ECB, because of its administrative structure, is sort of designed to under-react to everything, because it proceeds by negotiated consensus.  While it does seem as though there is parity between member states in terms of the voting structure, in practice, the larger nations hold more sway, simply because they have larger shares within the ECB.</p> <p>  What was required to be done, first, was to change the president of the ECB.  Second, the new president, after he was embedded, had to win an argument about the logic of introducing quantitative easing, and that all took time.  We must remember, too, exactly as Dr. Gurdgiev said, that there were many different balance sheet expansion exercises going on in 2009 and 2010.  In addition, there was no real certainty as to what the evidence was from the US case.  Moreover, as Mr. O'Brien pointed out, the Japanese case up to 2010 was not exactly a great success.  The logic of doing it, the evidence for doing it and the administrative structures to carry it out were just not there.  In other words, the buy-in was not there.</p> <p>  For policies to be successful, they must be administratively possible, technically feasible and politically saleable.  When it comes to considering the technical feasibility of quantitative easing in the eurozone, we must bear in mind that we are talking about a very fragmented capital market where everything basically works around the Italian bond market, which is used for everybody who has a liquidity hedge.  When we look at the administrative structure of actually running QE, we see it has to be run through national central banks, which means there must be certainty that all those banks know what they are doing and how to do it.  The institutional details really matter here.  I was at pains in my note to get across the message of why the technical exercise is important and how, when one stares at these things for long enough, one begins to see the political, technical and administrative feasibility aspects.</p> <p>  On the question of whether the European agencies could have reacted faster, the answer is "Yes".  Would it have made much of a difference if they had done so?  Not really.  The ECB spends most of its time telling us what it cannot do because of its legislative mandate.  It cannot do monetary financing because of Article 123 of the Maastricht treaty.  It cannot do this and it cannot do that.  However, one of the things it absolutely is tasked with doing is maintaining a forward inflation rate of at or near 2%.  Once that rate looked like it was dropping below 1%, the ECB had no choice but to act on its own forward guidance.</p></speech>

In the case of Ireland, it is just around &euro;14 billion, or &euro;14.4 billion.  It depends on the proportion of capital held by each central bank in the ECB.  About 70% of the ECB capital overall base is covered by the national central banks.  When one does the adjustment, the whole programme at current prices of the bonds is somewhere in the region of the &euro;14.4 billion.  However, it should be remembered that it is buying bonds in the markets, so it is paying market prices.  As the price of bonds rises, the quantum of actual purchase will decline.</p></speech>

That accounts for 70% of the total central bank capital itself.  The other 30% comes from other sources and not from national central banks.  One must re-weigh those capital key percentages in relation to the 70% total base and that gives that third column which is the capital share per country for the purposes of the quantitative easing, QE.  This can then be converted into euro.  This is making a lot of tall assumptions in terms of pricing of those bonds.  The other problem is crucial and this is just the price in one which is marginal.  Maybe it will be &euro;15 billion for Ireland or maybe &euro;12 billion.  The really big issue is what happens with the money when it leaves the ECB.  When the ECB takes on the bond and gives the money to the investor in the market, that investor does not have to be a European investor as such.  Therefore, the money can be carried out of the European economy and invested somewhere else.  It can be deposited in an ECB facility or in another central bank facility-----</p></speech>

The banks did pretty much the same except instead of using government bonds, they used the commercial assets which they deposited as collateral and they borrowed from the ECB.  In regard to the money they borrowed from the ECB, they either put in their national government bonds or they deposited the rest of it with the ECB.  That is the co-liquidity trap.  There is no real money going into the real economy.</p></speech>

The only way one can get it to work is if one does something like that but that fundamentally changes the nature of what most people consider money to do.  They regard it as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  If this thing is not a store of value any more, if things become negative and if when I put my pension into my bank account and I come out less, then one might actually get people to spend more but they certainly will not save more and that will create a problem with investment.  It will increase spending in the real economy but it will undermine the trust of the people in the currency and given the current situation, one does not want to do that.  The Deputy is entirely correct that the technicalities of it could work perfectly but, on balance, I would keep the trust of the people in the currency.</p></speech>

That is the negative rate.  The ECB is charging the banks to put the deposits with the ECB.  The reason they are doing it is with exactly the same logic.  The reason it is not working so far is because the bank has a choice between having a safe asset of a deposit with the ECB versus a safe asset of the German bonds.  The returns on German bonds are more negative than the ECB deposit rates.  Therefore, from the bank's point of view, if I have to put some money into the risk-free asset, I chose the lowest negative deposit rate possible in absolute value so that I minimise my losses and that is in the ECB.</p><p>In a way the ECB would have to go much more dramatically under-carded.  When it is under-carded, in effect, it introduces a distortion into all the safe assets markets.  There is no guarantee that the bond will not rise in price even more and the yields on bonds drop even more.  In other words, it is like chasing one's own tail in the relationship-----</p></speech>

The ECB has the deposit facility so that European banks can deposit money with the ECB - there is a deposit facility.  That is already at a negative rate.  In the markets, if a bank wants to buy German bonds, it is generating negative return.  That negative return is more negative than the ECB deposit facility.  If the deposit facility continues to reduce, it might also trigger a decline in bonds and they are, in a sense, chasing their own tails because the German economy is a proxy for safe assets in the European economy.</p></speech>

The country has recently experienced a deleveraging by the banks and by citizens, which has a counter-effect on the process.  The witnesses mentioned how cash and currency can be created.  We are seeing the opposite effect in the economy with regard to that.  I have a question on the Irish banks.  Are they soaking up this quantitative easing to improve their own balance sheets?  Are they also soaking up the interest rate?  One of the big controversies we have had here is obviously the representatives of the banks coming in and telling us about their interest rates.  They tell us that their interest rates are not fully reflective of the component with regard to the cheaper interest rates as a result of quantitative easing because that has been late in the timeline of the debt.</p></speech>

However, the overall cost of funding for the banks has declined dramatically and QE has a direct effect on that in terms of flattening the U-curve.  In other words, the cost of borrowing in the longer term and the shorter term has declined.  The banks are not passing that on to the borrowers at a retail level, that is, to companies and to households for consumer credit or any other credit.</p> <p>  We are at very strong margins.  In other words, the margin between what banks can effectively borrow money in interbank markets and what they charge for new loans is very significant.  This has nothing to do with the legacy loans.  It is only used by the banks to subsidise some loans, including tracker loans, etc.  However, this is a consistent policy we have pursued in repairing the banking sector.  In the regional 2010-2011 plans for reconstruction of the banking sector, the uplift in lending margin is the second pillar of the whole restructuring of the banking sector in this country.</p> <p>  My concern is that we are already in a fairly expensive environment of borrowing with historically low rates at the government level and at the policy level, and with near historically low rates in interbank markets.  These rates are not being passed through.  However, when these rates are rising the banks have not repaired themselves sufficiently to allow for that margin to shrink, so the margin will stay up as the base rates are rising and as a result the charge will rise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dan O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015070800002#M00700"><p>I might put that another way.  Banks pay out interest on the money they borrow and they take in interest on the money they lend out.  The money they take in in interest has been pushed down on average because of the tracker legacy, so the amount of money they are taking in is lower because of the tracker picture.  On the other side, the amount they are paying has two components.  One is the deposits, which is very low.  Therefore, they are making a profit on that side, which is good.</p> <p>  They are in trouble with those famous bank bonds.  As Irish banks were very risky, the interest rates they had to pay on those bonds was high and the money they were getting for all their loans was lower, so they were loss-making.  However, because of QE in general in other countries and specifically since it started here, interest rates on Irish Government bonds are now ridiculously low.  This means the average cost of interest the banks are paying out has fallen and if banks are put together in the aggregate, the domestic banks have come back to profitability.  Much of that relates to the compression of bond yields for banks.  Irish banks can now issue those bonds again at a very low rate of interest.  Therefore, QE has certainly affected the banking system here in helping to bring it back to profitability.  I hope that is reasonably clear.</p></speech>

This seems to be quite a blunt tool to a certain extent.  Would it not have been more useful and targeted for the EU, for example, to invest in a stimulus programme throughout Europe, increasing the capital infrastructure to improve efficiencies and competitiveness into the future and also put people back to work given the crisis in unemployment levels?  That would have had a similar effect to increasing aggregate demand which would also have addressed the inflation issue but would have been more targeted and would have left us with more as a society.</p></speech>

If large-scale infrastructural investment cannot be done now in a place like Germany where the roads are pitted with potholes - if one drives there, one will realise that they really need large-scale infrastructural investment which would do an enormous amount to help - and if we cannot build big airports, etc., now at historically low interest rates, we will never be able to do it.  Central banks never want to be the first to do it; their reaction function is incredibly low.</p> <p>  The economists Eric Lonergan and Mark Blythe came up with the suggestion that if we are crediting the bank accounts of commercial banks with reserves and deposits, why do we not just credit people?  Why not just have QE for the average person?  That would solve the balance sheet problem of the household and create a massive increase in spending.  Returning to the triptych I mentioned of politically feasible, administratively possible and technically correct, all three of these things are true, so why does it not happen?  It is because it is a new idea.  If the problem is that inflation is low, particularly HIPC inflation, giving real people access to money could even be time-dated as Deputy Fleming mentioned.  We could stipulate that &euro;500 would appear in an individual's bank account which if not spent within a month would disappear again.  It would be an interesting prospect, but central banks do not want to be that innovative.</p></speech>

I am one of the original signatories to the <i>Financial Times</i>letter on it.  I disagree with the notion of an expiry date or that it would need to be used for consumption purposes.  The balance sheet of the household is about debt and we can write it down.<br/><br/>The reason we cannot fund infrastructure out of monetary policy and cannot fund the reconstruction of the household balance sheets and instead are obsessed with governments' balance sheet and the banks' balance sheets is precisely the set-up of the euro.  The set-up of the euro prevents the use of the monetary policy tool for real economic stimulus.  This is why we have we only have an inflationary target and do not have pure Taylor rule targeting, such as unemployment or nominal or real GDP targeting or anything else.</p><p>Accordingly, if we want to have a stimulus programme, we have to find the source of the funding.  That funding in Europe is debt but we are not allowed to effectively monetise that debt like the Americans do.  The Federal Reserve System buys central government debt.  By the way, they also did that in Japan for large infrastructure projects.  In a way, Europe is hamstrung on both fronts in terms of repairing household budgets, corporate budgets and investment flows.  However, that goes back to the set-up of the euro.</p></speech>

The argument would be that the Juncker plan is doing that to some extent at an infrastructural investment level.  The idea is that &euro;315 billion over three years will provide some fiscal stimulus.</p> <p>  On the monetary side, the issue raised of quantitative easing, QE, for the people is a fascinating one.  Dr. Kinsella referred to there being no political obstacle.  I slightly disagree with that.  When one talks about issuing &euro;1,000 to every adult in the eurozone, those involved in central banking ask what political implications such an action would have.  Further down the line, do people think we can just conjure money out of thin air?  One can do that but one does not have to be an economist to know that a central bank giving people money is not how a country gets rich.  If that were the case, every country would be extremely prosperous.  We know this will not make countries rich but it could provide a kick-start for economies.  However, there is a political problem around that issue.  If one does it once, what happens in the future?</p></speech>

There is no effective limit to the amount involved.  They could do it for five more years.  They would signal well in advance as to how much they are going to taper or buy.  Say, at a given moment they are buying &euro;60 billion a month but will reduce it by &euro;5 billion over the next eight months and level it off, they will do that to increase the amount of forward guidance they give the markets about this.  In this realm, the guidance that is given about the future is as important as the spot market today.  They are very careful about how they message this stuff.  They will work very hard to keep that message.  The markets will price it in beforehand and we will start to see things trend up again.</p></speech>

Having listened to all the contributions, which were all very informative, one is left with the conclusion that what we are describing is the intractable contradiction that is now facing the European economy and arguably the entire global economy.  While quantitative easing was a sort of belated reaction to austerity and its failure, its impact, which may incidentally be somewhat beneficial for Ireland although we are not even sure of this because it is indirect, creates another problem on the other side, namely, the potential for asset bubbles.</p><p>Having gone through an austerity experiment which, frankly, was a disaster and has put the European economy on the floor, we are going back to what we did before but it is not even working.  We are trying to give money to exactly the same people who caused the crisis the last time around.  What we should be thinking about is how we got into this intractable contradiction and mess in the first place.  I will put the following narrative and ask the witnesses to comment on it.  The fundamental problem is the amount wages take as a share of the economy has dropped consistently since the Thatcher-Reagan period and the amount taken from the economy through profits has increased by more or less the same amount.  I have seen some figures which suggest it is approximately 10%.  When workers who have lower wages do not have the money to buy houses or goods, they must take out loans from the people who do have the money, who charge them interest.  We end up in this intractable contradiction.  The way to deal with this is to rebalance what was done over the past 30 years since the Thatcher-Reagan period and give more back to workers through higher wages and a higher proportion of the wealth our economy produces and take a correspondingly similar amount back-----</p></speech>

It has many definitions, but basically it means finance becomes more and more important to the arteries of the economy whereas before it was not that important.  Credit as a share of GDP explodes, wages as a share of GDP go down and profits go up.  I have finished a very large study comparing Iceland and Ireland in terms of financialisation.  The larger financial structures get, they become a death sentence for small open economies because the chances of a crisis happening are just so large that making them a bigger proportion of the economy relative to other things such as construction is a real problem.</p> <p>  Rebalancing these things is very interesting.  A hedge fund manager called Toby Nangle wrote a brilliant article on VOX in which he completely destroyed the secular stagnation argument, which is that falling worker productivity due to ageing and excessive indebtedness means we will have low growth and low inflation forever.  He stated the reason is labour's bargaining power has fallen, therefore wages have fallen, and because wages have fallen we will not see large increases in aggregate demand, consumption and investment.  It is a really intriguing argument, effectively a Marxist argument, made by a hard-core asset manager.  Is it more important to rebalance these things?  I absolutely believe so.  I am an advocate of large-scale taxes on profits.  If one is able to-----</p></speech>

We saw massive increases in productivity in the US in the 1940s and 1950s, when capital was taxed at 50%, 60% and 70% and sometimes 85%.  It is not true to say these things harm productivity.  We have tried the Thatcherite experiment and we know to where it leads.  Increasing people's wages overall is generally a good thing, especially as a proportion of GDP.</p></speech>

I believe the problem rests somewhere else.  I do not see it as debunking the secular stagnation thesis, which goes way beyond demographics and there is much more to it than this.  I sympathise with the problem as outlined, but I do not see Dr. Kinsella's suggestion as a solution.  It is not just about taxation itself or taxation of capital alone.  If we start with the 1940s and 1950s in the United States and Europe, the post-war capital base was effectively destroyed in Europe.  When we start from a low base and introduce new investment in physical capital, the rates of return to that investment are very high, but as we keep building better factories and better roads there is a marginal decline in returns and productivity.  In the 1980s and 1990s, when we began to experience this decline, we recognised it and continued to stimulate investment in physical and technological capital by lowering taxation rates.  At the same time, we effectively created the disparity with the rate of taxation on human capital, in other words labour and wages, by introducing higher and higher rates of taxation on them.  For me, the problem is not just about wages and capital taxation, but in the disparity between how government structures use taxation systems to incentivise the accumulation of physical and financial capital over and above human capital.  This problem is entirely different, as is the solution to it.  It is not about taxing capital more but about simultaneously reducing the gap between the taxation of labour and human capital, which are two different things although they are related, and physical and technological capital.  It is crucial to distinguish between them because-----</p></speech>

It is crucial to distinguish between these because human capital taxation relates more to the upper than lower margin of wages taxation, and labour taxation relates more to the lower than upper margin of taxation.</p></speech>

Let me start with some specific reactions and move out more generally.  Germany has seen wages fall as a percentage of GDP, therefore, the trend in Germany is similar but households have not become more indebted.  I am not sure there is a direct link between financialisation debt and the decline in wages.  Germany is different from most other countries.  That is just a country to refer to as an exception.</p> <p>  On the issue of what is happening to wage growth and why it is lower or lower in parts, the globalisation picture comes into it.  A lot of the lower skilled jobs have gone elsewhere.  Is that more an explanation of why wages as a percentage of GDP have gone down?  It is a possible explanation.  Another explanation relates to one&rsquo;s annual income  One puts 10% aside and save that every year.  One does that more and more every year.  The amount one has saved relative to one&rsquo;s income rises over time.  If one earns &euro;100 every year and one saves &euro;10, after ten years the amount one has saved is &euro;100 and one&rsquo;s income is &euro;100, which means the income one is getting back from the &euro;100 one has saved is a significant amount compared to one&rsquo;s wages.  Over time, as the stock of wealth rises, that is something else that has an impact on the percentage of income that comes from wages.  That is another factor going into the mix.</p> <p>  Finally, to come to the biggest picture of all, what is really going on, there has been an argument about sectoral stagnation.  The Toby Nagle argument has also come up.  Another even more depressing argument is that in fact we are at the end of growth.  Economic growth is over.  We had a great period of 150 years of economic growth and all the figures are showing productivity is declining and we are into a period of no economic growth.  There is a big debate about that.</p></speech>

I will start with a quick question for all three speakers.  What do they think is the key underlying factor in the decline in inflation rates and the near deflation that we have?  Oil prices are a temporary factor that has occurred more recently, but what is the underlying reason for the fall in inflation rates in Europe?</p></speech>

One cannot have a situation where there is inflation in a country like Greece with more than 50% youth unemployment.  There are just not enough people buying to have the average retailer jack up the price of anything.  They cannot do it.  They do not see the footfall.  One sees that in retail sales all the time.  It is a lack of demand, fundamentally.</p></speech>

I will elaborate a little bit.  One has the income declines on the household side, sometimes through the wages, sometimes through unemployment and sometimes the aggregate income has declined across the whole economy as well, and sometimes all three together.  One has precautionary savings motive, which is very strong in that people are saving anything that they can, even people with jobs are still saving.  In addition, one has the sectoral stagnation.  One has the demographic effect in addition to the other effects of the sectoral stagnation.</p> <p>  Ireland is a great example and laboratory of that.  We have in addition to it the wealth effect.  By destroying vast amounts of paper wealth, imaginary wealth we used to hold in our homes, we destroyed the security of the entire generation in terms of their pensions.  As a result of that, what does one expect them to go and buy?  They are going to save and they are going to try to find any outlet to safely save for the future.</p></speech>

If one looks at services and goods, we have had deflation in goods for a long time.  The price of clothing is now much less than it was 15 years ago, and a lot of that is because we have had more people participate in the global economy so there is a supply-side effect to that, but I would agree there is no doubt a lack of demand has definitely been a factor recently.</p></speech>

We see it in terms of the contradiction between the core and the periphery of the eurozone at the moment.</p> <p>  If a primary driver of deflation is wage depression, as well as other factors, how can increasing the money supply necessarily have a very significant impact on addressing those deflationary pressures?</p></speech>

If one wants to increase demand, one must find a way to do it without increasing future liabilities relating to that, in other words, the debt, because one would scare the daylights out of the households who are already indebted by hiking their debt on the side of the Government.  In a sense, we are back to the same conversation we had before about key relief for the people.  No monetary policy is going to generate any significant impact, unless one is injecting the money directly and the monetary policy goes to the heart of the problem, namely, two areas, the first of which is households and the other is companies, the latter for the purposes of investments and the former to shore up their finances and maybe for some consumption purposes.  One need only look at Japan.</p></speech>

That basically says the price level is related to the amount of money in the system and that is somehow related to the amount of GDP growth one will see.  They believe that holds true in the short term, medium term and long term.  I probably believe the long term, where that is 20 years, but I do not believe the short term at all.  I do not think the mechanisms are there.  To return to the question, the mechanisms have not been correctly identified and until they have, there is no point in talking about them.  That is an article of faith, that Europe&rsquo;s policy makers have but I do not think it is justified by the evidence.</p></speech>

That is the mechanism.  If it works and if quantitative easing, QE, boosts demand then that will feed into the labour market and then wages will be pushed up.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that the overwhelming effect of QE, let us say in the United States, which is the most recent example in a similar type economy, although obviously there are some differences, is an asset price bubble, and that very little of it trickled down?  Are there any examples where QE had a demonstrative, significant effect on inflation rates?</p> <p>  Is it not also the case that asset price bubbles lead to an increase in wealth inequality because it is the top 10% and top 1% who own shares, bonds and assets of all sorts and that has been the effect of QE in the United States in particular?</p></speech>

There has been a huge amount of research but the picture is too mixed.  Many people say QE disproportionately benefits the 1%, but many say the real beneficiaries of QE are pension funds.  That is why I use pension funds in my example.  In the case of the US in particular, because most people&rsquo;s pensions are invested in the stock markets, via something called the 401(k), by increasing returns to assets in those markets, one helps to shore up the pensions of individuals by helping the entire pension structure.  It really depends on which part of the story one wants to examine.  The elephant is too big to examine via one simple, nice story.</p></speech>

There are three points.  The question was asked whether there is any evidence that QE has led to inflation.  There is not.  It has not led to inflation going to 3%, 4% or 5%.  In the US, unemployment is close to 5% now, so one could argue that one of the best ways to help people is to get the unemployment rate down.</p><p>We are all agreed that there is a real risk of an asset price bubble, the biggest danger of which is a crash resulting in people losing their jobs and becoming dependant on the State.  It seems to me that the real concern around the creation of an asset bubble is that it will cause another recession.  Clearly, recessions hurt most the people who have least.</p></speech>

I did not read the entire paper but I am not sure it referred to "write-down".  Debt relief can come in many forms.  Write-down is to disappear the money, which means the lender will never get the money back.  As such, the debt is removed from the balance sheets of the lender and the receiver.  One can make debt sustainable in many ways.  If the Deputy were to lend me &euro;10 million, in respect of which I was not required to make any repayment for ten years and thereafter only needed only to repay &euro;1,000 per annum, I would be crazy not to accept that because effectively a large part of it would be free money.  Any amount of debt is sustainable.  What is at issue is the how the repayments are structured.</p> <p>  Greece, Ireland and Portugal have already had a series of debt relief changes, which have driven down the cost of servicing their debt.  For political reasons, in many of the creditor countries a write-off is not going to happen.  However, debt relief along the lines of what has happened, including lowering of the reservicing costs, stretching out of payments, in terms of having an effect on an economy can have just as good an effect.  It is possible to help a country by providing an interest rate holiday and not requiring any repayment until after five years when, hopefully, its GDP-income will have increased and everything will be much easier to deal with.</p></speech>

There is a need in the context of the debate on debt relief to talk about hair-cuts.  A lender might expect to be repaid 100 cents but instead gets only 80 cents.  hair-cut is a technical term.  It is a stupid term but none the less it means precisely what everybody here thinks it means, namely, that one expects a return of 100 cents on the dollar but instead gets only 80 cents on the dollar.  We basically meet in court to figure out the difference.  That is more or less how these things work.</p> <p>  I believe Greek debt is fundamentally unsustainable.  As a percentage of its GDP, it is too high.  If the context of the production structure of the Greek economy, it does not work.  Greece cannot do what Ireland did.  The structure of its economy is totally different.  Ireland is often touted as-----</p></speech>

I will give a good example.  Exports as a percentage of our GDP is well over 100%.  We can trade our way out of austerity.  We have the structures in this country to be able to do so.  Greece cannot do that.  The structure of its economy does not allow for it, unfortunately.  I am deeply concerned about this and have written a great deal about it.  Neither side is focused on what is really necessary, namely, a restructuring of the Greek economy and a permanent interest rate holiday.  Unfortunately, this is politically unpalatable.  In my view, there is a failure of leadership on both sides.</p></speech>

In other words there appears to be a continuous pull within the euro system.  I know it is taboo to discuss the issue but given it is unlikely that the European Union is going to accept a hair-cut would Greece not be better off outside of the euro?</p></speech>

To my mind, given what we have been told, namely, that the Greek debt is unsustainable and the people in Greece cannot take any more, the Greek side has made too many concessions.  The people cannot take any more but Europe is insisting that they do.  It seems to me, in so far as the Greek Government believes this debt is unsustainable and the ordinary people cannot take any more - I hope they stick to this line - that Greece is right and what we are seeing is political vindictiveness on the part of German Chancellor Merkel, the neo-liberal ideologues, big business and anybody else who stands to lose if we challenge the austerity agenda.  Is it not just politics at this point in terms of the opportunity being taken to punish these people to set an example for everybody else across Europe?</p></speech>

The idea that a good deal for the Greek people will be done is ruled out and so there are two options remaining, which is a bad deal that contains a commitment to discuss something in terms of debt but slightly further down the line and austerity measures.  If these are the two options open to Syriza and the Greek Government they would be better off exiting the euro.  I would like to discuss how that could be managed.  Greece had a trade surplus last year.  Figures for the last month available show a slight trade deficit.  There is no question but that what is open to Greece is that of a parallel currency and a period of turbulence in terms of its economy.  Given Greece has a primary balance, is no longer dependent on the ECB, which means it can burn bondholders left, right and centre and that ECB will not get a penny of its ELA back, and it can write off a huge portion of its national debt, which gives it &euro;20 billion to pay this year in terms of repayments and interest, is it not possible for the Greek Government to take steps over a period to stabilise the currency?  This would free up space for the Greek economy, thereby giving it a chance of recovery outside of the eurozone.</p></speech>

Perhaps he would expand on the reason Greece is in such a precarious position?</p><p>In addition, did Greece get a write-down, or was it the banks, to the tune of approximately &euro;100 billion in 2012?  Why has that not had the catapult effect of releasing some buoyancy in the economy as well?  I do not believe anyone, across any party, wishes to see the Greeks in this situation but ultimately, in the witnesses' individual opinions, will Greece leave the euro?  That is it for the present and I ask the witnesses to keep the answers brief.</p></speech>

Jean-Claude Juncker has stated people need to leave their egos at the door and stuff like that; I am not certain they have.  As to who loses, it is interesting.  The Deputy talked about a period of turbulence, which I believe is understating massively what would happen.  If one reads the sociological studies that have been done about Argentina in 2001, one basically has the destruction of a middle class and the destruction of an entrepreneurial class.  That effectively is what happened.  Interestingly, the economy rebounded since but that probably was on a commodity boom.  While it obviously depends on what is the deal being offered, one would take a lot of austerity before one would leave a currency union like this.  That said, it seems as though, at least from the referendum results, people actually might welcome that.  I am not sure but then it depends on who one is.  If a person's pension is paid by a bank and that bank was giving the pension to the person in euro but now is giving it in scrip, in drachmas or whatever, that would change many people's lives and would hamper the growth of a generation.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the primary balance, payments and some other areas but that is all gone, as many businesses have not being paying.  I make the point that what was fundamentally strong about the economy in January is not there any more.  That said, an extremely large write-down might help them because, exactly as Dr. Gurdgiev has noted, it would take them from a very low base.  As to whether Greece will leave the euro, I think it will, as I do not believe there is enough time to organise a reasonable deal.  As for who loses, the average Greek citizen will lose massively from that.  While I do not think we will be that badly affected, who knows?  Nobody knows what will happen.  Everybody thought Lehman Brothers was going to be fine.</p></speech>

I do not believe so much energy would have gone into five and a half years to keep the currency union together if there was not a willingness to go the extra mile.  Consequently, there is time and I do not believe it is inevitable at this stage.  I still believe there is time, although there is no doubt but that the politics of this mean the 18 want to have the other one move most of the way.  As to whether it is vindictiveness, no one comes out of this well but one must note that even before this Government came to power, the previous Administration had alienated everyone else, even their own cousins in Cyprus and even centre-left governments around Europe.  There simply was a sense - rightly or wrongly - I am not giving a view but simply am saying that rightly or wrongly, the things people were saying about Greece in different member states, whether they were on the centre-left or the centre-right, were extremely negative.  That is how people felt and as to whether they were justified in that regard, I simply am telling members what I heard.  I do not believe it is a vindictiveness but that relations soured to such an extent that there is a real frustration that this has dragged on for so long and so many hours of prime ministerial time and the time of finance ministers have gone on the whole thing.</p> <p>  On the costs, they are huge as for any country to leave a currency and establish a new one, there are massive balance sheet issues for the private sector and the government sector.  There are huge costs.  As for the benefits, were Greece to write off all its debts, every single cent, and not pay anything back, it would save about 4% of GDP in debt servicing costs.  Incidentally, 20 years ago it was paying 12%, or three times that.  It would not have any roll-over issues but the question then is: when its GDP collapses and its deficit balloons out again, how does it fund the deficit?  It is an austerity machine.  If one has seen austerity up to now in Greece, what would happen were they to leave would be infinitely worse.</p></speech>

If they are not, it causes serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  In this session we commence our pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft scheme of the Public Sector Standards Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to reform the current legislative framework governing the disclosure of interests and other ethical obligations for public officials.  I welcome from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary of the Government reform unit, Ms Evelyn O'Connor, principal officer, and Mr. Kieran Sheedy, assistant principal.  The discussion will begin with Mr. Beausang's opening statement, after which there will be a question and answer session.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the proposed public sector standards legislation.</p> <p>  As set out in the Minister's letter of 18 June 2015 to the Chairman of the committee, the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 included a commitment to publish legislation to consolidate local and national ethics requirements and to give effect to the recommendations of the tribunals.  At its meeting of 16 June 2015, the Government approved the drafting of the Public Sector Standards Bill on the basis of the general scheme of the Bill that has been circulated.  In addition to the general scheme, a policy assessment of the proposals has been published on the Department's website and has been provided to the committee.  It is intended to assist the committee in its scrutiny of the proposals contained in the general scheme.  It is also intended to act as a basis, under the open government partnership for public consultation with civil society and other bodies, in looking at the proposed reform legislative model for disclosure of interest and the management of actual and perceived conflicts of interest for public officials.</p> <p>  The context of the Bill is that an effective framework of standards for public officials is integral to the quality and efficacy of public governance.  Addressing corruption risks through an appropriate disclosure of interests regime and the regulation of conflicts of interests are critical to maintaining trust in, and the reputation of, public institutions.  International and national research highlights the important linkages between the quality of public institutions and long-term economic and social sustainability.  The committee will recall that the Mahon tribunal highlighted in 2012 the need for a far-reaching overhaul of Ireland's ethics regime.</p> <p>  Against this backdrop and in the context of the Department's review of the existing legislative framework, a number of areas for improvement were identified in the course of our work.  For example, the existing statutory provisions for ethics were developed piecemeal, over time, and set out different requirements at national and local level.  The current legislation does not set out a clear set of statutory principles to help underpin ethical conduct of public officials, such as the Nolan principles in the United Kingdom.  There is also a need for a more efficient and dynamic system of compliance and compliance monitoring.  Another issue is that responsibilities for the provision of advice and for the development of guidelines and codes of conduct are distributed among a number of different bodies, which can make it difficult across the public sector to ensure that a consistent approach applies.  Moreover, a strengthening in the level of knowledge and understanding of specific obligations among public officials would be desirable.  There is clear scope to enhance and strengthen the institutional framework for the overview and oversight of ethics requirements.</p> <p>  In light of these factors and the other issues identified in the Minister's policy assessment, the objectives of the Bill in overall terms are as follows: to modernise, simplify and streamline the current legislative framework; to put in place a consistent, coherent and proportionate framework for all public officials at both local and national level which is appropriately calibrated to conflict of interest and corruption risks; to introduce a model that corresponds to international best practice that is appropriately balanced with other important public policy objectives, including safeguarding the constitutional right to privacy that citizens enjoy and encouraging participation in public life; to ensure that the institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement of contraventions of the legislation is robust and effective; to respond to the Mahon tribunal recommendations and thereby strengthen public trust in public administration.</p> <p>  In common with other significant legislative initiatives brought forward by the Minister, such as the Regulation of Lobbying Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Protected Disclosures Act, there are some very substantial reforms included in these proposals.  It is proposed to replace the Standards in Public Office Commission with a single public sector standards commissioner.  In that regard, the commissioner will have increased powers and, supported by a deputy commissioner who will be independent in terms of their investigative functions, will implement what is intended to be a more streamlined and improved complaints and investigations procedure.</p><p>The commissioner will have stronger powers of sanction and enforcement when contraventions take place, as well as a broader role in the provision of advice and guidance.  As I have already stated, the proposed legislation sets out a series of overarching integrity principles, which will apply to all public officials, and provides a framework for the revision, updating and improvement of codes of standard and behaviour for different categories of public official.  <br/><br/>The proposed legislation strengthens the legal obligation for public officials to disclose, as a matter of routine, actual and potential conflicts of interest that arise in the context of the performance of their duties.  It also intends to establish a more effective, streamlined and efficient process for the submission of periodic statements of interests.  Importantly, it significantly extends the personal and material scope of disclosures for public officials in line with the Mahon recommendations, with uniform definitions applying at national and local level.  It adopts a graduated approach to disclosures, whereby declarations of interests of elected public officials and senior administrators are made to the commissioner and, in some instances, published, while private declarable interests such as liabilities over certain thresholds will be disclosed on a confidential basis and will not be published. <br/><br/>The proposed legislation seeks to impose statutory prohibitions on the use of insider information and on the seeking or acceptance by public officials of benefits to further their private interests.  It also proposes the establishment of a new statutory board to address potential conflicts of interest for public officials who take up roles in the private sector - the so-called revolving door issue - by merging the outside appointments boards, OABs, for the civil service and local authority systems.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the<b></b>opportunity to outline some of the main aspects of the proposed new legislative framework for public sector standards.  My colleagues and I are, of course, happy to answer any questions members may have about the proposed approach.  We have circulated copies of a presentation which provides more detail on some key aspects of the proposed approach.</p></speech>

It is long overdue, and Mr. Beausang alluded to some of the reasons for that in his presentation.  It is also very necessary.</p> <p>  Head 5, which deals with public declarable interests, states that "[p]ublic declarable interests are the following in any 3 consecutive 4-month periods" and goes on to set out different thresholds, such as "the source of income in excess of &euro;2,600 from any remunerated trade, profession, employment or other occupation."  Could Mr. Beausang explain the rationale by which that part has been structured?  Different financial thresholds are given, one of which I have just read out.  Why was that figure of &euro;2,600 chosen?</p> <p>  Head 5 also refers to "any estate or interest the public official has in land (other than a family home) in excess of &euro;10,000".  Why was that figure chosen?  How was the figure of &euro;13,000 reached in the next paragraph, which refers to "any beneficial or legal interest or holding in shares or bonds or debentures, or other like investments, in a particular company or other enterprise or undertaking (which does not relate to land or any business of dealing in or developing land) at any time during the appropriate period"?  I am curious to know how the officials settled on those benchmarks or limits.</p></speech>

The figures in the Schedule to the 1995 Act are in punts while the figures in the general scheme have been converted to euro.  They are actually representative of the same amounts.</p> <p>  I should also say that the definition in the general scheme of what needs to be declared is based on Schedule 2 to the 1995 Act.  We have also examined what is required at local authority level and are merging the two sets of requirements, so that the same standards apply for people at national and at local authority level.  It is structured as it is for the sake of simplification, through putting things together.  Some aspects, such as requiring the source of the income, came from the Mahon recommendations.</p></speech>

We felt that was a little bit excessive so, to go some way towards implementing the Mahon recommendations, we decided that three times a year should be sufficient.  A person would begin and would make a declaration.  Three months later he or she would have a look and see if there had been a significant change.  The person would only have to make a further statement in the case of a significant change.</p></speech>

If there is no change in their circumstances which is appropriate for reporting, there is no requirement for return.  If there is a change, that information is made available to the regulatory authority on a much more timely basis than heretofore.</p></speech>

Several votes were called in the earlier session and some of us have had to attend the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts in the meantime.  We are being caught all over the place, but I am concerned that the meeting would have to adjourn if the few of us who are here leave.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions, and I thank the witnesses for the ream of documentation sent last week.  I will put a straight question to them which they may not be able to answer if it is more to do with policy.  Much of this emanates from the Mahon tribunal.  In the Mahon report of 2012, serious conclusions were drawn regarding the mobile phone licence and donations to people who were members of the then Government, but since 2012 we have seen very little follow through on that.  We were promised that within six weeks of that report each Department would report back to the Taoiseach.  Approximately 160 weeks later, there is no sign of that.  Is the announcement of this legislation an attempt to cover the fact that nothing happened in the three and a half years since the Mahon report was published?  That might be an unfair question to put to the officials.</p></speech>

In a letter from the Minister to the newspaper, which was published on 24 June, he made the point that he thought the characterisation less than fair on the basis of the series of reforms that had been enacted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since its establishment.  In the area of Government reform, I mentioned in my opening statement the Protected Disclosures Act, the Regulation of Lobbying Act, the Freedom of Information Act, extending the scope of freedom of information, expanding the power of the Ombudsman and reforming the system of appointments to State boards.  A significant programme of reforms has been delivered.<br/><br/>In terms of the deadline Deputy Fleming mentioned, we recall, being a party to that process, that there was to be a report back to Government, but in terms of looking at it on the official level, it went into the revised programme for Government in July 2014.  We had been doing work prior to then, but it was officially endorsed as a Government priority at that time.  From an administrative perspective, bringing a general scheme to fruition with the policy paper and the agreement on accelerated drafting is a fast-track approach to getting legislation progressed.</p></speech>

This is to set out the categories of official and the bodies that will be covered by the obligations, and the sanctions in the draft scheme.  At head 4 we define the public bodies.  We start by outlining a number of them, such as the Civil Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the permanent Defence Force, local authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Central Bank of Ireland, an education and training board or a higher education institution in receipt of public funds.  We then have anybody established by or under an enactment other than the Companies Acts or under the Companies Acts in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment and financed wholly or partly by means of money provided or loans made or guaranteed by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made.  We go on to refer to a body that is wholly or partly funded directly or indirectly out of money provided by the Oireachtas or from the Central Fund or the growing produce of that fund and in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made.  We also have any subsidiary of or a company controlled within the meaning given by section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by a body to which paragraphs <i>(d)</i>, <i>(e)</i>, <i>(f)</i>, <i>(g)</i>, <i>(h)</i>, <i>(i)</i>or <i>(j)</i>relate and in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made.

It would look a bit odd to be excluding any public body from ethical requirements whereas one can justify, as the Minister has, excluding certain public bodies from the freedom of information regime.</p></speech>

On the section 39-type organisations, many other organisations get grants from the Government such as organisations in the voluntary sector.  I am sure an element of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's funding is State funding.  I pick it as an example of a big charity but there are many other charities, such as Rape Crisis Network Ireland which provides a national co-ordinating role.  It gets some element of its funding through Tusla but it would have a lot of private funding.  What of the local sports club which might get an operational grant?  Where do we draw the line given the partly funded concept extends to nearly everyone?</p></speech>

There is scope for the Minister to bring anyone in under the freedom of information regime.  Part of our work involves examining what criteria might guide that decision-making.  In the fullness of time, that same issue will need to be considered as we look at the definition in the legislation which allows the Minister, as Ms O'Connor has mentioned, to make an order bringing other bodies within the ambit of this legislation as is consistent with the principles of transparency and accountability.  That is a job of work down the road when the legislation is in place.  We will need to assess, as Deputy Fleming said, where is the proper or appropriate boundary between the public sector broadly defined and bodies which would not regard themselves as part of the public sector but benefit significantly from Exchequer funding and whether, in those circumstances, they should be subject to the ethical requirements proposed in this Bill, many of which are currently in force for public officials and elected representatives.</p></speech>

It is not so much the conflict of interest of the public official that is in issue but often it is the one concerned with family and connected persons.  Will Mr. Beausang talk us through that issue?  A public official could have a brother who happens to run a business and they might not talk at all or they might be the best of friends.  Will Mr. Beausang run through who would constitute a connected person?  Matters relating to our spouses are not included in some of our declarations but may be in other cases.  I forget exactly.  Will Mr. Beausang talk me through this issue because it is a thorny one?</p></speech>

It is central that this legislation extends significantly the material and the personal scope of disclosures that are required.  An important part of our work, when discussing it with the Minister in preparing these legislative proposals, was to determine the appropriate cut-off point for connected persons.  What degree of connectedness was appropriate for having a public representative or elected official make a disclosure?  The Minister and the Government ultimately came to a conclusion on that matter.  It is an issue which is probably quite central to the legislative approach and I am sure there will be further discussion on the Bill in the context of this committee's pre-legislative scrutiny and, indeed, once it is drafted and published.</p> <p>  We were always conscious, as was the Minister, of the balance to be struck between the need for reforming legislation which met the objectives of the Mahon tribunal and ensured constitutional protections of privacy were respected and producing legislation which was not an impediment to participation in public life.  As the Minister would have made clear to us and as we would see it ourselves, if public representatives or officials are subject to an excessive degree of scrutiny and disclosure, people will make their own decisions as to whether it is worthwhile notwithstanding their commitment to the public interest.

For other relatives, it would be a case of making ad hoc disclosures.  If an actual conflict arises in respect of a relation and the person has knowledge of it, an ad hoc disclosure would be made.  However, in the case of relatives, the disclosure would be a private declarable interest rather than being them made in the public domain.</p></speech>

We had this exact same debate during one of the last items of legislation the Minister, Deputy Howlin, brought through.  I recommend that principal officers across the public sector should be in category A.  Oireachtas Members are on principal officer level salaries.  Public officials on the same salary scale as Oireachtas Members should be in the same category.  We have pointed out that, when it comes to negotiations on issues in a Department, public bodies or at director of services level in the local authorities, sometimes a manager can be a little hands off and leaves it to his couple of directors and sometimes directors have phenomenal powers and influence, which is more than any Member of the Oireachtas who is not a Minister.  People at that salary grade of principal officer should be included in category A.  I know we did not bring it in - Mr. Beausang might help me on this point - on the last occasion.  I forget which one, there are so many.</p></speech>

I made this point about principal officers and directors of services.  They, in truth, have much more decision-making capacity.  They may have to clear it up the line but they are the people driving many decisions.  I therefore think they should be included on the same basis.  I made the same point the last time and I am delighted someone remembers what I said on that occasion.  It is the same point and Mr. Beausang will see there is a consistency in my approach.</p> <p>  The requirement to report three times a year is not proportionate.

Mr. Beausang will say there is the issue of the separation of powers but if judges want to feel they are above it, let them challenge the legislation.  That is my view.  We are talking about people in decision-making roles.</p><p>Think of the decision-making capacity of judges such as Mr. Justice Mahon, Mr. Justice Flood, Mr. Justice Moriarty.  The influence that they wield on public life and on setting the agenda for the Oireachtas, as they are doing now, is phenomenal.  I do not buy that they should be outside the remit of ethics legislation.  We can dance on the pin of separation of powers.  I do not ask for Oireachtas oversight.  They can have their own commission within the Courts Service or whatever.  I would not attempt to encroach on that but the same standards that apply to Oireachtas and other public officials should also apply to judges.  The Department has to work on a mechanism to make sure the Oireachtas is not encroaching on them.  They are subject to the same taxation laws as we are; they should be subject to the same ethics law-----</p></speech>

We cannot legislate for those bodies but in the scheme of things, it is a comprehensive coverage, as we have outlined when running through the relevant head.  I take the Deputy's point.  The Judiciary is excluded, as are the North-South bodies, but the policy intention, as I reflect on it, is not to exclude any other significant group.  We went through the head and it had a wide coverage.  If there are gaps in the coverage, the Minister would be keen to address them in the further development of the legislation.</p></speech>

Another issue I am interested in is the new statutory board to address potential conflicts of interest of public officials who take up roles in the private sector by merging with the outside appointments board.  What about people who leave the public service and move into areas where there is a potential conflict of interest?  I am probably unique in the Oireachtas in that I do not have the same problem with this as other Oireachtas Members who think it is fashionable to have the view that public servants should be subject to a quarantine period.  I can think of in the national interest senior officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the IDA or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine going to work for large Irish multinationals that export all over the world.  That would be good for Ireland and that is good for business and employment.  Somebody might say: "You worked in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; you should have nothing to do with our biggest agricultural exporter for a quarantine period."  There should be a mechanism to make a business case that would set aside a lazy quarantine period.  Some members of this committee think there should be a two-year quarantine but Ireland is losing valuable resources.  I favour secondment between the public and private sectors rather than continuing to draw demarcation lines.  The public sector is good and the private sector is bad and if people work in the public service, they should not contaminate themselves by going into the private sector for 12 months.  That is lazy thinking and Mr. Beausang can call me what he likes for having that view but a mechanism is needed whereby senior people who can help Irish business are not excluded from contributing just because they worked in the public service.</p></speech>

At present, there is a non-statutory board which assesses cases made by officials who are considering moving into the private sector as to whether an approval is needed for senior level staff.  The outside appointments board has not seen many cases over recent years but the intention is always to identify where there may be a conflict of interest and introduce a safeguard that addresses the conflict rather than a blanket prohibition on somebody taking up a role.  That approach is reflected in head 45, which refers to a scenario where somebody moves to a body with which they have had outside dealings or where there might be an unfair advantage conferred by the public servant moving there.  There is a requirement to inform the outside appointments board and the board can either consent unconditionally to the person moving or design conditions to address specific conflict of interest risks that might arise.  Countries that have tried to introduce blanket prohibitions found themselves having to pay gardening leave for a period because people have a constitutional right to work.  Our legal assessment and our understanding from the Office of the Attorney General is that we cannot say to people that there will be a one-year or a two-year prohibition.  It has to be proportionate and it has to be related to the risks.  If we try to introduce a prohibition, we will be into a situation where somebody will have to be sent on administrative leave until the conflict of interest risk has eroded.</p></speech>

In the presentation we circulated - the Deputy might have an opportunity to have a look at it at some stage - it looks a little complex on the face of it but it is reasonably straightforward.  Where there is a contravention of the legislation, the commissioner for public sector standards needs to make an assessment as to whether it is an offence and whether the official has broken the law in the context of possible criminality.  In those situations, he or she can refer to the DPP if it is an indictable offence or he or she can prosecute summarily and there is scope for less serious offences for the commissioner to consider issuing a fixed penalty notice.  We would expect that to arise in the case of inadvertent non-compliance.  When it is not an offence but it is not a minor breach, the innovation in the legislation is that the commissioner can issue civil penalties such as a censure or a warning to the person concerned or orders to rectify.  In significant cases, the commissioner can recommend a suspension.  In the case of the Oireachtas, that would need to be worked through the Houses of the Oireachtas's internal processes.  It is just a recommendation but in the case of a civil servant or a local authority official, a recommendation for a suspension goes back to the head of the office or the city or county manager for further processing.  Where there is a contravention but it is not an offence and it is considered a minor, technical breach, the commissioner can provide confidential advice or guidance or refer to the public body for further action.</p><p>There is a suite of menus there to strengthen the ability of the regulator to ensure compliance and conformity with the legal requirements in a proportionate way that supports the overall intention that the regulator would be constructive and that given the complexities of the issues the legislation relates to, allows the regulator to engage with people subject to the legislation, provide advice and guidance and assist people in complying with what are objectively quite extensive and, in some instances, stringent requirements.  </p></speech>

They might be self-employed.  I am thinking of senior counsel who probably work for the Director of Public Prosecutions for practically their entire career.  They work in different circuits.  Effectively, all of their income is paid out of the public purse.  GPs get a substantial amount of their income from the medical card fees but might have private practice.  There are different type of hospital consultant contracts.  Some consultants are fully contracted to the hospital and have no private work while many of the older consultants have private work.  Could Mr. Beausang talk me through the raft of people who earn a large proportion of their moneys working as front-line State officials?  Are all these people covered?</p></speech>

I would ask the Department to reconsider this issue.  Technically, a senior counsel who is prosecuting on behalf of the State every day of the week and earning all his money from State fees is a sole trader but he is very much in the public eye and part of the State mechanism.  It is the same with a GP.  Most of the income of GP practices comes from the State, particularly with the roll-out of the extra medical cards.  They are not included and I presume this means that the staff they employ in their health centres through State fees are not included.  The last example I gave was consultants.  The potential for conflict there is as real as it is in many of the other areas the Department has captured.  I know I am spreading it but I am talking about individuals, not companies that tender for work.  I said the section 39 people tender for work and the Department is trying to capture them.  If the Department is trying to capture section 39 organisations that are substantially funded through State funding and they are contractors rather than employees, I cannot understand why other people who are working on a contractual basis for the State like the three examples I have just given would not be captured.  I know everyone will say that they have their own way of doing things.  I ask the Department to rethink it.</p></speech>

I know that the Minister was very keen for us to make the point that the pre-legislative scrutiny of things like the protected disclosures legislation was very useful in helping to develop, refine and improve that legislation.  The only comment I will make about the specific issue is that part of the problem with the existing regime is the large number of individuals who are subject to the same requirement in a way that is not proportionate and graduated and does not relate to the conflict of interest risks that are there.  In looking at the international evidence and discussing it with the Minister, our assessment was that in a situation where everybody is subject to the same requirements, the ability of the regulatory system to focus on the risk areas and adopt a proportionate approach to where the risk of conflict of interest and corruption is greatest is diminished.   There is a balance to be struck in terms of the scope of legislation.  We have already referred to the fact that a graduated approach is adopted within the legislation itself.  The Deputy already made the point that he is concerned that where the Government has drawn the line is not right in respect of principal officers and other senior officials.  An approach has been taken here where there are three categories of public officials.  As the Deputy pointed out, those in category A are subject to the most stringent requirements.  Those in category B are subject to less stringent requirements, although they are still quite significant.  Category C encompasses the generality of public servants who will be subject to important requirements and codes of practice.  There is a balance in terms of ensuring that the regulator is not receiving a huge volume of returns and has a huge scope of responsibilities.  This means that the regulator cannot be efficient in the way it monitors and oversees the scheme.  That is just a general observation in respect of the point raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We are all aware that particular consultants who consulted for the Department of Finance in the old days before separation would have derived a significant portion of their income from advising </p><p>Departments.  I am sure there are plenty of other people in that category.  They may not be Government advisers <i>per se</i>but they are consultants to Government Departments and derive a substantial amount of money from being consultants to Government Departments.  This should be considered.</p><p>In respect of getting one's head around whether one is category A, B, or C, I used to dread having to make these declarations every year, not because I did not want to make them but because I was afraid that I would not declare something I should have declared.  Alternatively, it could relate to something one's child or spouse has.  People tend to declare all around them because they are afraid they might miss something.  One thing in Mr. Beausang's presentation I tried to get my head around is the difference between a category A, B and C declarant.  As Deputy Fleming pointed out, category A should possibly contain a category of official that is not included based on equivalence in respect of responsibility and ability to influence decisions.  My next question concerns category B officials and how this legislation might change the way people view public service.  I am putting this forward from the perspective of a devil's advocate.  Is there a danger that we can go so far in making everything so open and transparent that nobody actually wants to do the job?  Am I right in saying that it is only category A where individuals declare their private declarable interests, in other words, their shareholdings and the moneys they might have in land or buildings?  Am I right in saying that declaring those declarable interests only applies to those in category A?</p></speech>

Has the Department allowed for matters of privacy?  Where do we draw the line here?  I can see that category C officials are intended to be lower down the ladder and their interests relate to matters of integrity, impartiality, objective honesty and so forth.</p><p>Their declarations only relate to situations where there could be a perceived or actual conflict of interest and they must make their declarations in those circumstances.  However, in regard to category B, they must declare all public declarable interests as per category A.  In other words, they must declare any directorships or anything they might be engaged in that would bring about a conflict of interest.  I am not clear on exactly what category B includes.  Category B includes a substantial number of public officials, senior level officials, directors of public bodies and principal officers, the level Deputy Fleming wanted to include in category A, across the public sector.  Can I have a quick and succinct response to the question as to what category A and B are each obliged to declare?  We know category C officials are not obliged to declare much.</p></speech>

These interests are the same for categories A and B.  It is only the private declarable interests that category B officials do not have to declare.  The declaration of those interests applies purely to category A.  The private declarable interests are also outlined in head 5.  At head 5(3) we set out that the private declarable interests include interests such as the amount of income from each source declared, any individual asset in excess of &euro;50,000, any liability in excess of &euro;50,000 and any gift with a value exceeding &euro;200 given by a person who is not a relative of the public official and is not connected with the performance of his or her functions.  There are more interests included in that section.</p></speech>

A letter came back from the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement relating to the proposed joint meeting between the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There seems to be some confusion on the matter.  Members were present and it was never said that it would not be a joint meeting.  It was understood there would be a joint meeting.  We had a long discussion on who would be invited and agreed that we would all circulate it.  I have asked for the tapes, but there are no tapes.  I have also asked for detailed minutes, but there are no detailed minutes.  The request went from here to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to the effect that there would be a joint meeting.  That was my understanding, and I was at the meeting.  That is what was understood.  I realise it will not be held until September.  Anyway, it needs to be put forward again that there should be a joint meeting.</p></speech>

You can confirm it now because I spoke to the clerk of the other committee.  There are no accurate or detailed minutes.  The Chairman of that committee had briefing notes which he did not read out.  I was at the meeting.  The notes said there would only be a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  If they had been read out I would have objected, and I imagine I would have got the support of members from our committee to the effect that there should be a joint meeting.  Can this be put back to the other committee again?  I know there is a motion down to the effect that it should be a joint meeting because of the issues involved.</p></speech>

Presidential decree 83/2013 from September 2013 effectively means that he can be held indefinitely.  Chairman, will you write to Amnesty International to ask the organisation for clarification on the matter?

We have many issues to discuss, some of which were discussed at the recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  I am sure that they will play a central role in the meeting on 20 July.</p><p>As usual, the format of today's meeting will see us hearing an opening statement from the Minister followed by a question and answer session.  Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those seated in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even while on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee room.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>We will get on with our business.  I thank the Minister for appearing before us.  Perhaps he will deliver his opening statement to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070800002#B00500"><p>As always, I welcome this opportunity to address the committee on recent developments at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels and Luxembourg.  My statement will focus on meetings held in April, May and June, along with the joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council and Justice and Home Affairs Council, which was held in April.  As the Chairman said, I will look ahead to the Council meeting later this month.  During the period under review, a large number of issues have been addressed by the Council on which I will provide an update to the committee.  Following that, I would be more than anxious to address any issue the committee may wish to raise and to hear members' perspectives on foreign policy matters and the many challenges we face.</p> <p>  The first topic I wish to address is that of migration, which was discussed by the Council at the extraordinary joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council and Justice and Home Affairs Council in April.  The foreign policy aspects of the crisis were considered further at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings in May and June.  Members of the committee are all too aware of the migrant crisis that has been unfolding in the Mediterranean.  Instability and conflict across the Horn of Africa, north Africa and the Middle East have led to unprecedented numbers of people being displaced from their homes.  The chaotic situation in Libya since 2012 has led to that country becoming a point of departure for migrants from several countries seeking to enter Europe by sea, often with tragic results.  Almost 2,000 people have drowned so far this year attempting the crossing compared with fewer than 500 in the same period last year.  The number of arrivals has also increased significantly since last year.</p> <p>  In light of the tragic events in the Mediterranean over the weekend of 18 and 19 April that saw more than 700 migrants drown, the High Representative convened the extraordinary joint meeting on 20 April to consider the EU's response.  At that meeting, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I reiterated our horror at the recent events in the Mediterranean and our determination to find solutions jointly with our EU partners to address a crisis of such a large scale.</p> <p>  Discussions on migration continued at the May meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The crisis has also been discussed extensively in others formats, most notably the Justice and Home Affairs Council and meetings of the European Council on 23 April and on 25 and 26 June.</p> <p>  The EU recognises that the response to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean and to migration in general must be comprehensive.  This is the clear message that has emerged from the European Council.  In the immediate term, lives must be saved.  This is happening.  In the longer term, the root causes of irregular migration need to be addressed, particularly in partnership with countries of origin and transit.  These issues will be addressed comprehensively at a summit between the EU and the African Union that will take place in Malta next November.</p> <p>  An element of the EU's comprehensive response is the common security and defence policy mission in the southern central Mediterranean.  It was established at the May Foreign Affairs Council and subsequently launched at the June Foreign Affairs Council.  The aim of the mission is to disrupt the business model of people smugglers and traffickers and ultimately to contribute to saving lives at sea.  The mission will implement its mandate in phases.  The first phase will focus on the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling on the high seas in accordance with international law.  A second phase will involve the boarding, search, seizure and diversion of vessels suspected of being used for human smuggling or trafficking.  A third phase provides for taking measures against such vessels, including through their disposal or rendering them inoperable.</p> <p>  As a result of the decision by the Foreign Affairs Council in June, phase one of the mission can now commence.  The Council will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council resolution and the matter of consent by the coastal states concerned.  Ireland has continued to highlight the importance of UN Security Council resolution support for transition to later phases of the mission.</p> <p>  A separate discussion on Libya took place at the April Foreign Affairs Council and was given added priority by the role that instability in Libya is playing in the ongoing migration crisis.  Our discussions focused in particular on the political process within Libya.  While the failure to reach agreement by the June target date set by the UN is a matter of regret, the Council expressed its hope that further negotiations under the leadership of United Nations Special Representative, Mr. Bernardino Le&oacute;n, could lead to an  element of accommodation between the parties.</p> <p>  I will now briefly discuss Latin America and the Caribbean.  The April Foreign Affairs Council held, for the first time since 2009, a strategic discussion on relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p>The exchanges were timely in preparation for the EU-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, CELAC, summit which was held on 10 and 11 June.  The Council agreed that the Latin America and Caribbean region is a key like-minded partner for the EU.  Together, we hold almost one third of votes at the UN and we constitute almost half of the G20, as well as together representing the highest number of democracies in the world.  At the Council, I welcomed the discussion, stressing the importance of re-energising the relationship.  I welcomed the ongoing negotiations towards a political dialogue and co-operation agreement with Cuba and the fact that human rights were at the heart of these negotiations, as well as highlighting the importance of the re-engagement of the US with Cuba.  I also stressed the importance of the changing development co-operation relationship which must ensure that the new approaches to development meet the current needs of the Latin American communities, particularly with regard to the post-2015 development agenda.</p><p> I remain very concerned about the worsening situation and the escalating humanitarian crisis situation in Yemen, which was also discussed at the April Council meeting.  Since the beginning of the attempt to depose President Hadi, the humanitarian, political and security consequences have become draconian for the Yemeni people and threaten the stability of the Gulf region.  I call on all parties inside Yemen and regional stakeholders to support the UN-led efforts for agreement on the formation of a government of national unity and an end to the violence. </p><p> At the May Foreign Affairs Council, Ministers, accompanied by defence Ministers, adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on common security and defence policy,  CSDP in advance of the June European Council at which a discussion on CSDP was to take place.  The conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council were subsequently endorsed by EU Heads of State and Government at their meeting in June.   At the Foreign Affairs Council, ministers also reviewed progress to date in implementing the work programme emanating from the December 2013 European Council discussion on CSDP and identified areas where further work needs to be undertaken.  The conclusions highlight the fact that the EU and its member states, through CSDP and other policy instruments, have a strong role to play in preventing and managing conflicts and addressing their causes.  The aim is to enhance the effectiveness of the EU's contribution to international peace and security and ensure that the capabilities required for that purpose are provided.  Ireland is a strong supporter of CSDP and we believe that it has been strengthened in the past 18 months through the implementation of the work programme emanating from the December 2013 European Council.  We were satisfied with the outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council and the subsequent European Council discussions, which we believe renewed the commitment of member states to developing a more effective, visible and results-orientated CSDP.  At the May Foreign Affairs Council, ministers, in the presence of defence ministers, received a presentation from the High Representative on her proposal to develop a new European foreign policy and security strategy in consultation with member states.  Many member states, including Ireland, have in recent years conducted reviews of their own national foreign policy strategies and I believe it is timely that a similar exercise is conducted at EU level.  It will be important for this exercise to look at all areas of EU external action in a coherent and comprehensive manner.  We also wish to see the new foreign policy and security strategy continue to emphasise the global role of the EU and that the EU's values, such as human rights, continue to be strongly reflected in the external action of our Union.</p><p> Members will be aware of the concern I have been expressing over a long period of time that the Middle East peace political process has effectively been suspended since early last year.  The need to urgently address a succession of crises elsewhere in the region has undoubtedly reduced recent international attention on the Middle East peace process.  I have made clear my view that the deteriorating situation on the ground and the threats to the two-state solution require renewed attention and effort starting with the EU.  I believe that existing EU policies have not been sufficient to advance or even protect the two-state solution and we need to seriously re-examine our positions and actions.  I set out these views in detail to open a discussion on the Middle East peace process at the May Foreign Affairs Council, the first such discussion for some time on the overall issue rather than specific aspects like political talks or Gaza.  That discussion will be continued at future Councils, including the upcoming meeting in July.  I will not pretend that it will be an easy discussion.  Many partners are concerned about the viability of any initiatives in the current unstable environment in the Middle East but I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues and working to re-animate the peace process.</p><p> In June, the Foreign Affairs Council had a strategic debate on Asia focusing on promoting multilateral security structures, especially in the context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN; the strategic partnership with China; and better connectivity with Asia.  Ireland is supportive of stepping up engagement with multilateral Asia, particularly ASEAN.  On security, I said that it would make sense for the EU to continue to deepen its security co-operation with the countries of the region, encouraging reconciliation and the peaceful resolution of all territorial disputes in the region in accordance with international law.  The EU should also focus on clear and consistent advocacy in non-traditional security challenges such as climate, energy and migration.  On the EU-China relationship, I said that Ireland is supportive of regular review of priorities to ensure they take account of developments in China and its rapidly growing global profile.  Ireland supports exploring synergies between European networks policies and China's "One Belt, One Road" initiative, advancing our investment agreement and market access agenda and fostering convergence on views on global challenges as well as promoting human rights.  On connectivity, I emphasised that improvements in this are key to the next stage of development in the Asian region.  Infrastructure could be transformative for the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda as well as poverty reduction.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as well as ambitious ASEAN plans for improving regional connectivity could make a useful contribution in that regard.  The Council also adopted conclusions on the forthcoming elections in Myanmar-Burma and on EU-ASEAN relations, welcoming the new momentum in EU-ASEAN relations and underlining the EU's commitment to supporting ASEAN regional integration and to further deepening relations.</p><p> The June Council meeting also saw an exchange of views with UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon on EU-UN co-operation.  This year marks both the 60th anniversary of Ireland's membership of the UN and the 70th anniversary of the UN itself.  I was particularly pleased to welcome the Secretary-General to Ireland in May to celebrate these milestones with us and to reaffirm once more Ireland's commitment to a strong and effective United Nations.  At the Council, the UN Secretary-General spoke in very warm terms regarding the current level of EU-UN cooperation, highlighting in particular this year's financing for development post-2015 and climate change negotiations. </p><p> In June, the Council held a discussion with Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi focused on the EU's energy union and the increased inter-linkage between the EU's energy and foreign policies.  The overall objective of the discussion was to consider how foreign policy actions can support and advance EU energy priorities.  One example of this relates to the diversification of EU energy supplies which can be advanced through the development of strategic partnerships with key international partners.  I believe there is a compelling case for greater international co-operation to respond to the challenges associated with energy.  Global energy demand will continue to increase during the next decade and supply is likely to continue to be concentrated in regions afflicted by political instability and uncertainty. </p><p> The worrying situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in June.  The discussion continued the next day at the General Affairs Council, which adopted Council conclusions on the subject.  Along with our European partners, we have been concerned about the political instability in the country for some time.  We have consistently said that it the responsibility of both government and opposition to ensure that political debate takes place primarily in parliament and have called for a full investigation into allegations of wrongdoing.</p><p>We have called on the leaders of the political parties to work to find a resolution to the political crisis and we welcome all efforts, including those of Commissioner Hahn and a number of Members of the European Parliament, to redress the situation and restore stability in the country.  In this regard, we were pleased to see the agreement reached on 2 June, brokered by the EU.  We believe that this is a first step on the path to addressing the political crisis.</p><p> I wish to deal now with the upcoming July Council meeting, which, in addition the Middle East peace process, will discuss the post-2015 agenda, Iran and climate change.  The situation in Tunisia is also expected to be discussed.  The timing of the July Council is very opportune for a discussion on the post-2015 agenda, as the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is to be held in Addis Ababa and which will be the first of the three major interlinked processes that will define the new global development agenda for the next 15 years, will have just concluded.  Following the conference in Addis Ababa, the new sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda, will be agreed at the September summit in New York and a new agreement on climate will be concluded at Paris in December.  Success in Addis Ababa is critical to success in the other two processes.</p><p> As members are aware, Ireland was honoured to be appointed, along with Kenya, to co-lead the intergovernmental negotiating team on the SDGs at the UN.  Negotiations on financing for development and on the SDGs are ongoing and making progress.  We remain optimistic that there will be a successful outcome in the financing for development track, which aims to establish the means of implementation for the new sustainable development goals.  The contours of an agreement on the means of implementing the SDGs will need to be broad, going very significantly beyond official development assistance and focusing strongly on domestic resource mobilisation for development, improving tax-raising capacity, curbing illicit financial flows and tax evasion and the role of the private sector.  In advance of the Addis Ababa conference, Ireland has helped broker the agreement reached by EU Development Ministers at their May meeting to reconfirm the European Union's collective commitment to reaching the 0.7%  target within the timeframe of the post-2015 development agenda, that is, 2030, and on the need to direct more aid to the least developed countries, especially to the poorest African countries.  Agreement in Addis Ababa is very important in order to finalise the agreement on the SDGs.  We will then have to agree on how to fit the Addis Ababa agreement in with the agreement on post-2015 goals.  July will be a good opportunity to ensure the highest possible level of political participation by the European Union and its member states at the summit in September.  I am pleased that the Taoiseach will lead the Irish delegation and will deliver the national statement on the first day, 25 September next, and that President Higgins has agreed to participate in events on 26 and 27 September.</p><p> Preparations for the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties, or COP 21 - which will be taking place in Paris later this year and at which climate change will be discussed - will also be discussed at the forthcoming July Council.  This is the third element of the interlinked processes leading to a new global development agenda.  COP21 is charged with agreeing a "protocol, legally-binding agreement or other outcome with legal force, applicable to all Parties".  The European Union negotiates as a bloc in these discussions and Ireland inputs at EU level through a national delegation, which is led by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and which includes a range of Government Departments and agencies.  Ireland will play its role as part of the European Union contribution to the global effort.  The European Union has submitted a joint intended national determined  contributions, or INDC, for all 28 member states, which commits to a binding target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 - compared to 1990 - to be fulfilled jointly, as set out in the European Council conclusions of October 2014.  Ireland encourages all countries to submit ambitious INDCs as a crucial means of allowing all to see what is on the table before we go to Paris.  Support for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change continues to be a key issue in the negotiations.</p><p> In light of the recent tragic events in Tunisia and the appalling attack on tourists, which took the lives of three Irish holidaymakers, it is expected that at the forthcoming July Council meeting of Foreign Ministers will consider what actions the EU can take.  Tunisia has made real progress towards democracy since the overthrow of the Ben Ali regime in 2011.  ISIS is trying to undermine the emergence of a pluralistic society in Tunisia and, by killing tourists, to undermine the Tunisian economy in the hope of creating hardship and instability.  We need to strengthen Tunisia's democracy and security and ensure that the safety of our citizens is not at risk from further terrorism.  Our discussion will also clearly have to address how best the European Union can support the appropriate balance between the competing needs of security, and democracy and openness.</p><p> Finally,  the July Council is expected to reflect on the outcome of the Iranian nuclear negotiations, which we very much hope will be positive in nature.  As members are know, the deadline for the negotiations was extended for a week to yesterday, 7 July, and another very short extension has now been granted to next weekend.  As Secretary of State Kerry has said, the negotiations are clearly on a knife edge: very close to success but also teetering on failure if Iran cannot make the final steps to secure the agreement.  We all know the potential importance of this agreement for removing a source of serious danger and instability in the Middle East and we encourage all parties to persevere with a view towards succeeding.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their time and patience in allowing me to review what I think they will agree has been the very varied and diverse agenda with which the Foreign Affairs Council has dealt in recent months.  I would be happy to address any questions members may wish to pose and I look forward to hearing their views on the issues to which I have referred and any others they may wish to raise.  I reiterate the importance of the parliamentary tier in the context of foreign affairs policy and related issues.  I acknowledge the work the Chairman and members of the committee undertake on an ongoing in terms of their bilateral engagement with their counterparts in other states and in the context of their contribution regarding many of the important international challenges we face.  I also acknowledge the committee's contribution to seeking to alleviate hardship and difficulty in many of the crisis areas across the globe.</p></speech>

We look forward to his participation at the next meeting as well.  The Minister has outlined the huge challenges to be faced and there is no doubt that the past few months have been difficult.  Before handing over to members for questions, will the Minister update the committee on the Ibrahim Halawa case?  This is an issue which has been raised at the committee from time to time and all members are very interested in Ibrahim Halawa's welfare.  I am aware that the Minister and his Department have remained on top of this issue.  Perhaps the Minister will provide an update on the current situation and comment on reports in the national media this morning to the effect that the Government could make a formal request for Ibrahim Halawa's transfer to Ireland.  We do not know for sure but it appears that it might be possible to facilitate such a transfer under Egyptian law.  Would the Minister mind providing an update?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070800002#D00300"><p>As the Chairman is aware, this consular case is a matter that continues to be treated with the utmost priority by me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by officials in my Department.  As the committee will be aware, from previous briefings and recent correspondence, we have a very clear strategy in place which is focused on achieving a positive outcome within the earliest timeframe possible.  That strategy is based on two clear objectives: first, to see the release of Ibrahim Halawa by the Egyptian authorities in order that he can return home to his family and his studies in Ireland; and, second, to provide consular support and ensure his welfare while he remains in detention.  During the past 12 months I have intensively engaged with the Egyptian authorities, the European Union and international partners at a very high level in respect of this case.  We continue to review our approach in line with developments and we retain the flexibility to adjust our approach, as and when that may be required.</p><p><font color="#4F4F4F"> I am aware of various submissions that have been made to the Department and the Committee by NGOs and law firms advocating a more adversarial and legalistic approach.  My Department has always been cognisant of the international legal framework that may be relevant to this case but surely the key question is what stands the best chance of securing Ibrahim's release.  It is the Government's considered view, supported by decades of diplomatic experience in other consular cases and extensive consultation with states which have had citizens in similar circumstances, that the firm and measured diplomatic approach we are taking remains the best hope to secure the release of Ibrahim Halawa and his return to Ireland at the earliest possible date.  In this context, members will appreciate how important it is that we continue to maintain positive bilateral relations with Egypt.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> The Government has formally supported applications by Ibrahim Halawa&rsquo;s legal team for both release on bail and release under the presidential decree on foreign prisoners.  However, any decision to release Ibrahim Halawa or any other prisoner will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities.  Based on our consultations with other international partners, the available information suggests that it is unlikely there will any decision to release Ibrahim, either under the presidential decree or on bail, until after the trial process has concluded.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> There is a lot of public and media interest in this case but, as I hope the committee will appreciate, it is not always appropriate or helpful to play out in public everything that we are doing on any particular consular case.  Most of the work of my Department's consular team takes place away from the public glare and outside the media spotlight.  These officials frequently deal with citizens experiencing extraordinary difficulties.  They do so in a professional, compassionate and diligent manner, not only in this case but also in the recent handling of crises in Nepal, Berkeley in California and Sousse in Tunisia.  My consular officials in Dublin and embassy staff in Cairo are working in challenging circumstances and are dedicated to their work.  I am disappointed, therefore, by the personalised nature of some of the criticism of Department officials in regard to this case.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> My Department&rsquo;s consular resources are finite and they often have to operate on several fronts at once.  I ask for the committee's understanding for our efforts to ensure that limited resources are deployed primarily in protecting our citizens rather than explaining each course of action taken in individual cases on an individual day in an individual city.  Concerted and targeted work is ongoing behind the scenes with a view to ensuring that we are best placed to take advantage of any opportunity that arises to achieve progress towards a positive outcome for Ibrahim Halawa.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> I share the committee&rsquo;s concern about the length of time that Ibrahim Halawa has now spent in detention, and I have raised these concerns at the highest level with the Egyptian authorities and will continue to do so.  I am also concerned by reports about the prison conditions and, where allegations of mistreatment have been made, my Department has taken the appropriate action.  Since his arrest in Cairo in 2013, Ibrahim has been visited a total of 42 times by embassy officials.  This unprecedented level of consular visitation indicates clearly the priority we are placing on doing all that we can to carefully monitor his welfare in detention and to advocate strongly on his behalf to the Egyptian authorities.  In some very complex and challenging cases the considered view of the Department of what is in the best interests of the citizen does not always coincide with the immediate demands for action being made by the citizen or his family.  However, even in such difficult cases we endeavour to do all we can to engage with the family and to explain to them why we are pursuing a certain course of action in what we judge to be the best interest of their loved one.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> I think it is timely for us to remember that we are all on the same side here, seeking the best for an Irish citizen in difficult and challenging circumstances.  In recent weeks, officials in my Department's consular section have been publicly commended for their efforts to assist the Irish citizens and families caught up in the tragedies of Berkeley and Tunisia.  It is the same small number of officials who are working to assist Ibrahim Halawa and his family and they bring the same level of commitment and compassion to his case as they do to all cases within the Department's framework.  My officials are due to meet with the Halawa family once again tomorrow to discuss this case and I am happy to keep the committee fully informed of developments.  I will undertake a briefing session for spokespersons if that is deemed appropriate.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> I will address the specific question on the presidential decree.  Legal submissions and an article in </font><i><font color="#4F4F4F">The Irish Times</font></i><font color="#4F4F4F">this morning appear to be based on an incorrect belief that the Government has thus far not taken any action with regard to the presidential decree.  In fact, the Government has already formally supported the application that has been made for Ibrahim's return to Ireland under the presidential decree.  A number of other countries have had their convicted citizens returned to their country under the presidential decree.  We have followed the exact same procedures as those countries, with an application made by the lawyer and formally supported by the relevant Government.  Once the correct procedure was clarified to the embassy, officials made contact with the family's lawyer on 27 January 2015 relating to a request for Ibrahim's transfer to Ireland under the November 2014 presidential decree.  He stated that making such an application would require Ibrahim to give a power of attorney.  On 1 February 2015, on a consular visit to Ibrahim, consular officials were able to obtain an official document, signed by Ibrahim, giving power of attorney to the team of the lawyer for the Halawa family.  The embassy provided a letter to the lawyers to accompany the application, confirming Ibrahim's Irish citizenship and, with the assistance of the family, obtained an original of his birth certificate to accompany the application.  On 4 February embassy officials held a meeting with a member of the family via a phonelink with its lawyer to clarify the process.  The application was made by Ibrahim's lawyer on 7 February this year.  The Government's formal support for the application was recorded in a third party note from the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 10 February 2015.  What is being urged in the legal submission given to the newspapers and referred to in </font><i><font color="#4F4F4F">The Irish times</font></i><font color="#4F4F4F">today is nothing new.  It was done months ago.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> The submission also notes that the wording of the decree applies to both accused and convicted persons.  However, at a meeting specifically to discuss this key issue in February, the embassy was told by the former prosecutor general himself that this law would not be applied by his office where an individual was in the course of a trial process.  This tallies with what has happened in other cases where the decree is deemed to have been successfully applied.  Peter Gresty's initial trial had concluded and his retrial had not begun so, strictly speaking, he was not in the course of a trial process when he was returned.  In the case of the American citizen transferred, his initial trial had been concluded and, again, he was not in the course of a trial process.  Based on what we have been told, Ibrahim Halawa's citizenship status under Egyptian law may well be a further complicating factor.  This is an issue I discussed with the Chairman some months ago, though the issue is glossed over in the most recent legal submission.</font><br/><br/><font color="#4F4F4F"> Ultimately, while I have the greatest of sympathy with Ibrahim Halawa, his family and his friends, it is the Egyptians who will decide how the application of the presidential decree is worked.</font></p><p>We have followed the exact same procedure and I have spoken to representatives at the highest level in other jurisdictions where a similar set of circumstances seemed to apply.  Based on what we have been told by the Egyptian authorities and our international partners, we will await the conclusion of the trial.  The case has been adjourned yet again, a development which I very much regret.  It must be noted the recent adjournment was based on an application by the defence legal team.  It felt there were witnesses who were not available but whose evidence was important to the trial.  The judge acceded to this and he adjourned the case until 2 August.</p><p> I hope the case will be dealt with at that time.  In the meantime, the welfare and the prison conditions of Ibrahim Halawa are being monitored by visits of an unprecedented nature by our consular team.  I assure the committee that these visits will continue and we will continue to offer all the support available and possible between now and the trial.  It is our hope that the trial will be concluded and we will then move to the next stage of the procedure.</p></speech>

He has clarified many issues for me.  He has given the committee a clear understanding of where we stand and of the Government&rsquo;s commitment on this issue.  It is important to acknowledge the work done by David Cooney, Secretary General, and our consular teams, not just in this case but in dealing with the recent events in Berkeley and Tunisia.  On behalf of the committee, I commend our consular teams for their work abroad and the sensitive way in which they deal with such tragedies.</p> <p>  I know how passionate the Minister is about the Ibrahim Halawa case.  It was one of the first issues he dealt with when he became Minister.  All members will be happy with his comprehensive overview and report on this case.  I know he and his consular team will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1750" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070800002#F00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his detailed outline of his participation at the recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  The committee had an opportunity to express its outrage at the recent events in Tunisia and to pass on its sympathies to the families of the victims.  We witnessed the carnage and the appalling murders of innocent people by fundamentalists.  Europe and the civilised world need to deal collectively with the security issues arising from such terror.</p> <p>  I assume protocols and advice given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to Irish travellers are updated regularly, particularly advice for those travelling outside of the European Union.  The Department advises people to register with it if they go to countries or regions outside of Europe in which there are difficulties.  Do many people adhere to the particular advice?  Could this message be better got across to the public?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the drowning of 2,000 migrants in the Mediterranean so far this year.  It is an appalling loss of life of so many innocent people.  Is that figure accepted as an accurate estimate?  He referred to the forthcoming EU-African Union summit in November.  Will the main subject matter of that summit be the migration issue?  I know a summit cannot be arranged overnight.  However, the fact that this summit is not until November does not give the impression that much urgency is attached to this issue.  Is there expected to be a separate summit at which decisions will be made to deal with it?</p> <p>  In his statement the Minister outlined, &ldquo;The aim of the mission [EU NAVFOR MED] is to disrupt the business model of people smugglers and traffickers&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; is rather diplomatic.  I would hope the European Union, along with other members of the international community, will be aiming to smash, eliminate, minimise or end this horrible practice that imposes so much suffering on so many innocent and destitute people.  The Minister said he would like to see a UN Security Council Resolution that would pull together the different aspects of the means of achieving a worthwhile solution.  Has he any idea how soon such a resolution could be expected?</p> <p>  Today is the first anniversary of the Israeli military operation against Gaza, when we witnessed for 50 days devastation on the Gaza Strip.  Unfortunately, 1,400 Palestinian civilians were killed, as well as six Israeli civilians.  Subsequently, there was a pledging conference at which Europe again was the major contributor and donor.  I welcome the fact the Minister participated in it.  However, not a single destroyed house has been rebuilt in the meantime and up to 100,000 people still remain displaced.  The situation is deteriorating.  I welcome the fact that following discussions at the European Council meeting, the European Union agreed to step up its engagement.  Will the Minister take the opportunity at the forthcoming Council meeting to call on Israelis and Palestinians to fully comply with their obligations under international law?  This is a call that should go out from the European Union.</p> <p>  Relations between the European Union and Israel should be made conditional on progress towards adherence to international law.  The Minister, along with 15 other EU foreign Ministers, wrote to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the labelling of products from Israeli settlements in store chains throughout Europe.  Has there been any progress on this, as well as the implementation of a ban on trade and investment with Israeli settlements?</p> <p>  Recently, the plans to forcibly transfer the Palestinian inhabitants of the village of Susiya have been brought to the committee&rsquo;s attention.  The European Union should unanimously call for an immediate halt to those plans.  The forcible transfer of people and the destruction of private property must be in breach of the Geneva Convention.  I hope there would be a clear statement at the council meeting on the need to halt such plans.</p> <p>  With regard to the post-2015 development agenda, I welcome the senior political representation that will attend the forthcoming Addis Ababa conference.  Will the Minister take the opportunity at the conference, or will the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government and the State, to recommit to the 0.7% of gross national income target for overseas development aid?  Will particular steps be outlined as to how that target can be met?</p> <p>  During the recent visit by the UN Secretary General to Ireland and the European Union, did he give any indication that the UN is serious about modernising its structures?  The committee has often discussed this matter.  The UN&rsquo;s structures were put in place after the Second World War but the geopolitical scene across the world has changed dramatically in the meantime.  The composition of the Security Council needs to be revisited.</p><p>I hope a constant theme running through EU proposals tackling the multifaceted issues associated with climate change, and Irish proposals in particular, will be the need to promote and defend the sustainable food production systems that we have in Europe but which unfortunately do not exist elsewhere.  Our sustainable food production systems can contribute and are environmentally friendly.  It is very important that this theme be strongly carried through in all resolutions and policies.</p><p> I do not believe there was any reference in the Minister's report to EU-Russia relationships.  When sanctions are renewed, is it the Foreign Affairs Council or the Heads of State who renew them?  Although they might not be having a very direct impact on Irish exports, they are having an indirect impact because of the displacement of markets for other competitors.  Is there any improvement in relations with Russia?  Is the issue off the agenda or subject matter for discussion at the forthcoming Council meeting?</p></speech>

I compliment him and his consular staff and other officials, both here and abroad, for the great work they have done in engaging in the various life-threatening and other circumstances that have presented themselves over recent months.  This occasion should not pass without special mention of the demands that are being made and which we all have had to make recently because of circumstances in various trouble spots.  I do not propose to elaborate on these.  I would like the Minister to convey my remarks to his officials on behalf of the committee.</p> <p>  With regard to the rescue of the unfortunate people who are being transported and trafficked on the high seas at present, the important point we should try to recognise is the need for the European Union and United Nations to dovetail their work in so far as possible to try to ensure there is a broad policy to accommodate them.  I compliment the Irish Navy on its work in rescuing people over recent weeks, and particularly for rescuing a very large number of people who might otherwise be statistics only.</p> <p>  We welcome the development regarding Cuba and the United States.  This opens up new opportunities for the Cuban people and their interaction with other people globally.  We hope this theme can continue to their benefit.  I compliment all concerned.</p> <p>  The humanitarian situation in Yemen is a matter that the Minister might refer to.  I do not know the extent to which the humanitarian efforts are successful because it is not possible to determine.  There are so many developments and life-threatening challenges emerging daily that it is virtually impossible to monitor the conflict.  The United Nations, with its resources and personnel, is the most likely body to deal with the matter.  Is there anything more that could be done in this area?</p> <p>  The Chairman will be glad to know I will not go on indefinitely, other than to refer to the Middle East peace process.</p></speech>

Would it be possible to at least attempt to restore some kind of platform for discussion at the necessary level?  The vacuum that follows in the wake of a suspended peace process, no matter where it is, always leads to difficulty.</p> <p>  My last point is on climate change and the need for a Europe-wide policy thereon that is supported by all member states.  The Chairman will be glad to know I will not touch on the rest of the areas that I could comment on.  Again, I compliment the Minister on his comprehensive statement to the committee.</p></speech>

Members should confine their remarks to questions rather than statements.  Everyone wants to contribute.  If every member keeps his or her contribution short, we might be able to allow a second set of questions.  I am not referring to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan specifically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070800002#G01200"><p>I know.  We need more women on this committee because they are much more to the point.</p> <p>  I will start with Syria.  We know that Iran and Russia are key players and the nuclear talks with Iran are taking place.  All negotiations are about give and take.  Has there been any representation in the negotiations on ensuring there can be some give on Syria, particularly on barrel bombing?  There is targeting of children, hospitals and markets.</p> <p>  Ireland's record on taking refugees is not good.  After the Vietnam and Bosnian conflicts, we developed very strong Vietnamese and Bosnian communities in Ireland who are playing a real role in our society.  Why are we not doing the same for Syrian refugees?</p> <p>  On the Palestinian issue, I read the correspondence from the Israeli ambassador.  I agree with him on the points he is making about ISIS, its destabilising effect in the Middle East and the brutality of its activity.  However, I was struck by the irony of his concern for international law in regard to the issue of the village, yet international law has been broken so many times.  The UN Secretary General has said that what is happening in this regard is in breach of the fourth Geneva Convention.  What engagement will Ireland have on this issue?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to Addis Ababa.  Success in Addis Ababa is critical to success in the other two processes.  I cannot but be struck by the fact that the President and Taoiseach are going to New York.  While I very much support Minister of State Deputy Sean Sherlock, I believe he is at a totally different level going to the conference in Addis Ababa.  We all know that unless Addis Ababa gets it right, the next two conferences will not mean anything.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to illicit financial flows and tax corruption.  This has to be addressed.  What will Ireland's voice be in this regard?  Our tax policies must not infringe on the developing world in respect of tax.  Those in the developing world are losing more in tax avoidance and evasion than they are receiving in aid.  Will Ireland commit to the proposal by many NGOs for a UN intergovernmental body that would reflect all interests rather than the OECD's interest?</p> <p>  My next question is on Cuba and the blockade.  Human rights is part of the question but that works both ways.  Certainly, the human rights of Cuban people had been very much infringed upon as a result of the American blockade.  The people were deprived of medical supplies in particular and other items that they needed.  Having signed a memorandum of understanding, will we encourage or support a trade mission or the opening of an embassy in Cuba?</p> <p>  My last question is on the rate of 0.7%.  Do we have a timeline for meeting that by 2020?</p></speech>

It is 67 years since the United Nations recognised, by a substantial majority, the right of the state of Israel to exist.  There are still countries, many of which are neighbours of the European Union or close neighbours in the Middle East, that deny to this very day the right of Israel to exist or of the Jewish people to have a homeland.  Given the turmoil that is now in the region, the failure of successive attempts to broker a two-state deal acceptable to people living in the area and the ongoing hardship being caused, particularly to people living in Gaza, can a new initiative be launched by the European Union to deal in the first instance with those Arab states that refuse to recognise the State of Israel?  Their refusal is without precedent.</p><p>I can think of no other country that is denied recognition by the international community of its very existence.  Whatever about the boundaries or the borders, can an initiative be taken by the European Union with the intention of breaking the logjam, and it is clear there is a logjam, and asking those Arab states, first, to recognise the right of a state of Israel to exist and, second, to stop funding fundamentalist organisations that constantly attack the State of Israel in its current configuration from both southern Lebanon and Gaza?</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the case of Ibrahim Halawa, who is being held in prison in Egypt.  I understand what the Minister said, and I congratulate and thank the consular service for its hard work and diligence, not only in that case but in many other cases, and there are complications.  Is it intended in the forthcoming Council meeting to examine the situation generally in Egypt, and not just in this specific case?  On the size of the conference, has the Minister raised in the past or does he intend to raise with his counterparts the specific case of this Irish citizen?  That would be important to ensure all the other EU countries would be made aware of it, some of which may be able to give the extra support that is required.</p> <p>  With regard to Israel, and Palestine in particular, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad voted unanimously to recognise the state of Palestine.  Do we ever intend to act on those motions which were passed in the Seanad earlier?</p> <p>  Gaza was mentioned.  Another boat on its way to Gaza was intercepted recently in the Mediterranean.  My question relates to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, EUROMED, which ties in to the question of the refugees.  Are there plans to examine the EUROMED agreements and whether they have been delivering, and will deliver, for countries in Africa and the Middle East which have made agreements?  Some have broken them and flaunted them while others have not benefited from EU trade agreements.  I will leave the remainder of my questions until we resume.</p></speech>

I would like to regionalise the questions or address them under the various headings.  I thank Deputy Smith for his comments, especially  his comments on the recent atrocity in Tunisia, with particular reference to the work of our consular team.  It is an important issue and he raised specifically the matter of the travel advice.  The country-specific travel advice is updated and modified in accordance with the prevailing conditions in the country or the region on a very regular basis on the Department's website, with particular reference to emergency events that may adversely affect Irish citizens or tourists.  In the context of Tunisia and other areas where there have been instances of terrorist activity or where there are dangers, we encourage all citizens to register with the Department online.  Obviously we cannot make this a compulsory registration, but it is very helpful as it gives us knowledge of the number of Irish people present and it also means that we can make contact very quickly both with a citizen in the event of an emergency and with members of his or her family here.  We publicise the travel advice updates and we have social media updates and broadcasting updates.  The travel advice for Tunisia is that members of the public, would-be holidaymakers or tourists should exercise extreme caution, that they should register and that they should keep in close contact with their tour operators.  We are in contact with the tour operators as well.</p><p>Deputies Smith and Durkan mentioned Ireland's response to the migrant crisis.  I note that Deputy Smith rather euphemistically labelled the attempt on the part of the EU to disrupt the boats in the region, but Ireland continues to make a real contribution to addressing the root causes of the irregular migrant flows.  Often it is difficult to get precise figures in terms of numbers.  We know that the <i>LE Eithne </i>has already been directly involved in the rescue of between 3,000 and 3,500 people.  It is estimated that tens of thousands of people are attempting to cross the Mediterranean in very difficult circumstances.  We have the immediate problem of search and rescue and the longer-term problem of addressing the root causes through humanitarian assistance.  By the end of this year we will have provided &euro;41 million in assistance for the Syrian crisis.  We have provided &euro;36 million to Somalia since 2008 and, to date in 2015, &euro;1 million has been approved for the United Nations Common Humanitarian Fund in Somalia, with a further &euro;1.7 million to be provided to non-governmental organisation partners.  We are also contributing to the search and rescue.  Of the three phases, phase one has already been agreed and is under operation.  I would expect at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council that consideration will be given to further phases.  </p><p>The prospect of a UN Security Council resolution was mentioned by Deputy Smith and others, and I am hopeful that we can make progress on this issue.  From Ireland's perspective, we will only participate and act in these missions in certain circumstances, one of which is with the consent of the inviting state, which, in the case of Libya, is unlikely to be forthcoming in the immediate future because of the fact that the attempts to form a unity government have not been as successful as many of us would have wished.  However, in default of such consent, we will be we will be seeking a United Nations Security Council resolution.  Progress is being made on this issue on an ongoing basis, but I expect that we will have progress on it by the time of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, which is the week after next.</p><p>Deputy Smith mentioned the EU-Africa Summit and migration in November.  I accept what he said, namely, that November, in the context of an emergency, seems to be in the distant future.  That will take place in Malta and will focus on the migration crisis.  However, there will be an opportunity in Addis Ababa next week at the Financing for Development Conference to focus on these issues.  We will have an opportunity in that forum to hold bilateral and other meetings with African leaders.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will lead the delegation, and there will be opportunities to discuss the migration crisis.  I understand that high-level representatives from many of the African states will be present, and I would be happy to raise Deputy Smith's concern directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, in advance of his attendance.</p><p>Deputies Smith, Durkan and &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the current position regarding the Middle East peace process.  As I stated in my address, I am very anxious that this issue receives a greater level of attention and priority at EU level than has been the case in the past.  The talks broke down a year ago and there is no immediate prospect of resumption.  The basic problem is a lack of trust and absence of confidence among the parties with respect to each other's intentions, as well as a reluctance on the part of the Israelis to accept that the occupation must end and that peace, as we know from our experience on this island, will involve an element of compromise.  The EU continues to support the resumption of the talks because it is our belief that it is only through talks that negotiations can commence and it is only through negotiations that agreement can be reached.</p><p>I look forward to a greater level of discussion.  We had a discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council in May, and I am anxious that it would continue into July.  On the matter of the settlement goods and products, that is an issue on which, again, I would be anxious that we would have something of an advance at EU level.  It is important to remember that most of the settlements do not export anything.  In the context of what we are doing it is important that a focus on the settlement products is a relatively minor part of the overall issue.  The strongest measure against the settlement products is that they must pay high tariffs on entering the European Union while other suppliers enjoy a reduced rate.  The EU ruled in 2013 that no EU funding grants can be spent in the settlement areas and we, like other EU member states, published advice warning citizens against investing in the settlements.  I am anxious that we would start work on the guidelines for the labelling of settlement products.  We agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council in April that we would act on that.</p><p> I visited the West Bank at the beginning of the year and I saw the impact of settlements first hand.  I had the opportunity to raise the issue directly with Foreign Minister Lieberman and I continue to raise it at every opportunity.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is correct when he refers to the motions passed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad calling on the Government to recognise formally the state of Palestine.  Similar motions have been passed elsewhere.  I continue to give this matter active and careful consideration.  The timing is important in the context of ensuring that early recognition by Ireland would play a useful role rather than just acknowledging the motion and ticking the box.</p></speech>

He was not present when I referred to the matter earlier.  I spoke about my visit to the region, the current debate, and debates in the Oireachtas and at European Union level which are all factors to be taken into consideration.  I fully support, as previous Governments have, the full achievement of Palestinian statehood.  We believe that should happen soon but I would like that it would be achieved in reality and not just in theory or on paper.  I am anxious that, at bilateral level and through my colleagues in the European Union at plenary session of the Foreign Affairs Council, we could speak with one voice on the basis that a voice representing 28 states and in excess of 500 million people is of great influence and consequence.  I continue to keep the issue under review.</p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Smith said about the situation in Gaza, that the pace of reconstruction has been too slow.  On behalf of the Government I attended the Gaza reconstruction conference in Cairo at which we pledged the sum of &euro;2.5 million, much of which will go towards the reconstruction, and all of which will be applied to the alleviation of hardship, suffering and difficulty in the region.  I announced a further &euro;500,000 when I visited Gaza earlier this year.  I had an opportunity to attend meetings and I witnessed the fairly horrific experience being perpetrated on the vulnerable people of Gaza in particular, especially women and children.  It is important that the process of reconstruction would be allowed to commence.  I regard it as totally unacceptable that 100,000 people remain internally displaced and that 120,000 are still waiting to be reconnected to the city water supply.  I am anxious to continue to raise the matter directly with the authorities.  Last week the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution which was proposed by the Palestinians and supported by this country, wherein we reaffirmed our assurances that respect for international law would continue to be maintained at every level.  That is a core issue for this country.</p> <p>  In the context of prioritising the Middle East peace process at EU level, we will take into consideration the very valid points raised by Deputy Quinn in respect of ensuring the regional actors and the other Arab states in the region in particular are mindful of the need to ensure their participation is crucial to the achievement of an overall settlement.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that we will continue to keep matters under review and that I am fully supportive of the objective of achieving a two-state solution with a fully recognised Palestinian state.  Deputy Smith made particular reference in this context to the Bedouin communities and the Susiya village.  I am very concerned for the residents of that town.  Irish Aid has provided a practical level of support to threatened villages in the area south of the Hebron Hills, such as water filtration equipment.  Our representative in Ramallah has supported the position of the villagers.  I note the work of the committee in this regard.  You are indicating a vote, Chairman.</p></speech>

The first is the 0.7% of GDP commitment.  As the economic position permits, this is constantly under review, but the commitment stands that we will reach the target by 2030.  There is an ongoing debate in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy was anxious that the matter of tax be taken into consideration in the context of development.  This is exclusively a matter for the Minister for Finance, but the Government is aware of the importance of ensuring the involvement of the developing world in these processes.  The Minister previously publicly called on countries to undertake a spillover analysis of how their taxation regimes impacted on the developing world and I understand the results will be presented shortly.  I would be happy to engage with the Minister on behalf of the committee on the basis that the importance of taxation to development was also fully recognised by Irish Aid.  We provide financial support through many of our programmes for the African Tax Administration Forum, an important self-learning initiative, which allows African administrators to articulate their tax priorities and engage in capacity building in tax policy and administration.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the level of representation at the forthcoming Addis conference.  Ireland will be represented at the same level as virtually all other EU states.  Heads of delegation will, in general terms, be the Minister with responsibility for development, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.</p> <p>  I will come back to the situation in Cuba.</p></speech>

The Minister has mentioned how crucial the meeting in Addis will be to their successful conclusion.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach will attend the summit in New York, probably underlining how important it will be for the world for the next 15 years and beyond.  I have a concern - this issue was also raised with me - about the European response to the draft declaration by the United Nations which was watered down from its previous conclusions, leaving out a specific reference to the importance of sexual and reproductive health.  SDGs Nos. 3 and 5 deal with health and gender equality and are fundamental to achieving the other goals because impoverished women who have too many children whom they cannot feed perpetuate hunger, poverty and migration.  All of these issue are, therefore, very much related.</p><p>I ask the Minister to revert to me on that issue.  I understand the reference to sexual and reproductive health was left out on the insistence of Malta.  If the Minister has information on the issue, I ask him to indicate whether that is correct.  I am anxious to ensure the joint committee's statement is as strong as possible. </p><p> I am pleased that the European Union is at least beginning to take seriously the issue of migration.  Two weeks ago I visited the Turkish-Syrian border in my capacity as a member of the Council of Europe.  The only certainties are that migration from Syria into Turkey which already accommodates more than 2 million Syrian refugees will increase and that these refugees will not stay in Turkey but will seek to enter the European Union.  While I am in favour of Ireland taking as many refugees as possible and picking up refugees at sea, these measures will not solve the problem.  If a solution to the political chaos in Libya is found, it may cause a temporary halt to the flight of refugees, but the European Union will continue to have an enormous pull for poor Africans and refugees will continue to make the journey.  While tackling the smugglers' network will have some impact, in the light of our failure to have a significant impact on drug networks and smugglers, I am not hopeful in that regard.  It is welcome, however, that the European Union is beginning to wake up to the fact that this problem is not temporary and will grow.  I will be interested in learning what action will be taken on this matter at the next Council meeting. </p><p> It is unfortunate that the issue of Palestine arises at every meeting with the Minister.  The Palestinian problem has festered for years and simply gets worse as we move further from a solution.  Deputy Brendan Smith has referred to the residents of a village whose homes are being threatened with destruction, not for the first or second time.  The joint committee has received representations from both sides on the issue.  The Israelis maintain that this is simply a planning issue.  However, planning for the area in question is carried out by a military planning committee, the purpose of which is political.  While only a few hundred people are affected in this case, the decision is part of the larger picture in which the possibility of achieving a two-state solution is being destroyed.  I am pleased to note the Minister's strong statement of displeasure about the issue in which he expresses the view that current policies are not sufficient and that our position should be reviewed. </p><p> On a completely different but related issue, I was upset to learn that a radical political group, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, had taken action that resulted in the abandonment of plans to have the first Israeli feis.  I understand the use of intimidation and threatening remarks to those-----</p></speech>

I share the concerns expressed about the Bedouin village in the Occupied Territories.  I am pleased to have received a note on the issue from the Department.  When we discussed the matter in the Seanad, I emphasised that this was a classic example of the policy of eviction, dispossession and demolition that was being relentlessly pursued as part of the Israeli occupation.  In many cases, albeit not all, its purpose is to allow for the expansion of Israeli settlements.  I am glad that the Department has put this in writing.  We have tabled a motion asking the Minister to contact his Israeli counterpart about the issue and to write to the Israeli military's chief-of-staff to oppose the measure.  There is no point in the joint committee discussing the issue if we do not let the Israelis know what the Irish point of view is.  While our view may not be shared by the rest of the European Union, we should not to worry about it acting in unison as it takes some time for it to do anything in unison.</p><p>The Government has taken a very important case involving the United Kingdom's treatment of the so-called hooded men to the European court.  The Minister has spoken about this issue.  Will he outline the current position in the case and when he expects a determination to be made?  The case is about more than the 14 men involved.  In 1978 the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg overturned a previous decision in the men's case and this decision was interpreted aggressively by the former US President George Bush, to use his description.  As a result, countries that we consider to be democracies are using the 1978 ruling on the so-called five techniques - subjecting prisoners to noise, depriving them of sleep, food and fluid and using stress positions - as grounds for permitting torture.  It is incumbent on Ireland to ensure this decision is overturned.</p><p>Despite the significant improvement in relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom, the British Government has not handed over the files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I am not sure if the Government has formally requested the files.  The files on the Birmingham Six will remain sealed and unavailable to the general public until 2069.  What are the British authorities hiding in these files?  Anne Cadwallader's excellent book, <i>Lethal Allie</i>s, shows the collusion in which the British state engaged and the murder gangs it had in operation. </p><p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply on the case of Ibrahim Halawi.  Concerns have been raised about the torture of Mr. Halawi and the Irish ambassador to Egypt saw bruising on his back which had been caused in beatings received in prison.  Doughty Street Chambers and Amal Clooney which are involved in the case have written an opinion on the torture to which Mr. Halawi has been subjected.  Ms Clooney is also involved in the hooded men case which, in some senses, brings me full circle.  Reprieve, a human rights organisation, has also concluded that Mr. Halawi has been subject to torture and has listed some of the things done to him.  They include the use of whips, chains, blindfolds and electric shocks, the denial of medical treatment, psychological torture by prison guards, being held in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions and solitary confinement, the provision of inadequate food and the denial of access to a lawyer.  The Taoiseach recently stated in the D&aacute;il that Mr. Halawi was facing lesser charges.  Mr. Halawi's legal team has confirmed to me that he is still facing the death sentence and that the charges against him have not been reduced.  The Taoiseach's statement was tantamount to misleading the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Could we get some clarification on this, because it is an important issue?  If he faces lesser charges, the Egyptian court should have released him last February, because a person can only be held in detention for 18 months.  Therefore, we would be quite within our rights to ask for him to be released on bail.  However, if he still faces the death penalty, the more important issue of the presidential decree comes into play.</p> <p>  We had various briefings from the Department of Foreign Affairs about Peter Greste, and his case is the precedent we have focused on.  His trial had finished and he had been convicted and sentenced.  It was only when that initial judicial process had been concluded that the Egyptian authorities were in a position to release him, according to the briefing note we got from the Department.  That is technically misleading.  The Doughty Street Chambers' opinion, which has been received by the Department, states that when applied in practice, law 140 supports the conclusion that the final judgment is not required prior to transfer.  The Australian journalist Peter Greste, who for a time shared a cell with Ibrahim Halawa, was transferred to Australia pursuant to the decree.  He had been convicted in 2014 on charges of falsifying news reports.</p></speech>

Mr. Greste was in the same position as Ibrahim is today.  The conviction had been set aside and he was now awaiting a retrial.  Ibrahim Halawa is in the same position today.</p> <p>  There are many UN and international procedures we could pursue, such as the International Court of Justice in this case.  Are we going to pursue this issue through the UN conventions regarding a fair trial, the rights of the child and freedom from torture conventions Egypt is part of?  I believe we are all agreed that we want the same result.  I am concerned with what works.  I know that when the Prime Ministers of Australia and Canada became involved, that worked.  It is simple to see it worked, because we see that in the newspapers and their citizens are now on bail or have been transferred back to their home countries.</p> <p>  There are important issues in regard to the charges Ibrahim Halawa faces now and as to whether he is in the same position today as Peter Greste was when he benefited from the presidential decree.  There is significant information and misinformation out there.  We need to get the situation clarified because Ibrahim is now approaching his 700th day in prison.  This is unacceptable for an Irish citizen, who was a child of 17 when arrested.  We need to do all we can to get him released.  I appreciate the efforts made by the Minister to date to get him released.</p></speech>

I thank him in particular for the update on the Ibrahim Halawa case.  The Minister is aware that everybody on this committee wants the same result.  We want to see him back safely with his family and continuing his education as soon as possible.  However, we all appreciate this is a matter best left to the professionals.  I have every confidence that our professional diplomatic team, who have made 42 visits to him over the past year and a half, know what they are doing.  I know the Minister and his officials are pursuing every avenue.  Hopefully, we will soon have a satisfactory outcome and Ibrahim Halawa will be back in Dublin before too long.</p><p>In regard to the Mediterranean crisis and the rescue of the unfortunate people who are fleeing war-torn areas, a report on RTE a few evenings ago was highly critical of Ireland and the European Union generally.  It suggested we are not doing enough and have been slow to react to the crisis.  I pay tribute to the personnel on the<i>LE Eithne</i>who have done Trojan work in recent weeks in rescuing hundreds of refugees.  However, I am conscious of the criticisms made by the UN appointee on migrant issues, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  When will we know the numbers of refugees the Government plans to place in Ireland on resettlement programmes?  Has this issue been discussed yet by Cabinet?</p><p>I attended a very moving ceremony yesterday organised by the Bosnian people in Dublin to mark the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, which is something we hope we will not see a repeat of in our time.  However, in Syria, some 6,500 people have been killed in May alone.  The issue of barrel bombs was referred to earlier.  Has the issue of barrel bombs been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council and what action is proposed to deal with the situation?  Not alone are people being killed, maimed and starved, they now face these barrel bombs.  The Assad regime is the only power in a position to carry out these aerial bombardments.</p><p>A few weeks ago this committee held an informal meeting to discuss the freedom charter with some Syrian representatives of civil society organisations.  Has the freedom charter, which has the support of a significant number of political religious organisations and civil society organisations, been discussed or what status has it as far as the Minister and his colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council are concerned?</p><p>I compliment the Minister and his officials on the outstanding assistance they provided to the families of those who lost their lives in Berkeley, California and of those who were killed in Tunisia recently.  What is the up to date advice in regard to travel to Tunisia?</p></speech>

With regard to Ibrahim Halawa, I believe he was an innocent bystander who was caught up in a whirlwind of events.  The strongest possible representation should be made to the Egyptian Government, adhering in particular to the position that Ibrahim Halawa is an Irish citizen.</p><p>The Egyptians are resisting this and claiming him willy-nilly as an Egyptian citizen.  We should challenge that as hard as we can.</p><p> The Minister referred to how I was not present when he made certain statements.  I regret that, but I was in the Seanad taking a Commencement matter with Senator Leyden about the village of Susiya.</p><p> Regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state, I am not sure that Ireland is early.  Quite a number of European countries have already recognised Palestine.  It seems an appropriate measure.  The Palestinians have been there for a couple of thousand years, whereas the majority of Israeli citizens have only been there since 1948.</p><p> Regarding the situation in At-Tuwani, the village was demolished after being there for 200 years because it was supposedly on an archaeological site.  That did not present the Israelis from moving in and building a settlement on it.  That is an astonishing contradiction.</p><p> At the beginning of the Commencement debate, I made five points on, for example, co-ordinated diplomatic presence.  I welcome the Minister's statement that our representative in Ramallah has visited Susiya.  This is in the tradition of Ms Isolde Moylan in Ramallah.  We should co-ordinate this work and ensure a constant presence from among European and other donors.  We should ask that demolition orders and legal papers be deposited with the donors.  These should cite the legal reasons for the demolitions and these should be examined.  If necessary, we should challenge them and seek reparations.  How often are we to invest money only to have the Israelis destroy something?  They confiscated and destroyed emergency shelters.  They confiscated and destroyed a child's slide.  This is intimidation.  The Secretary General has indicated that two sections of the Geneva Convention have been violated.  What is happening with the EUROMED agreement?  What is the status of its human rights protocols?  We should insist that there be a Palestinian role in planning.  It is absurd for the military authorities to be given exclusive control of planning.</p><p> Regarding the Feis in Israel, I deprecate the suggestions that threats of any kind were made.  I challenge Deputy Mitchell to produce evidence of any threat.  Were people threatened with violence?  Were they threatened with being attacked?  They were requested to observe a cultural boycott.  I am against an academic boycott, but I am fully in favour of a cultural one.  Writing a letter asking that people observe a cultural boycott is not a threat.  Certainly, I have received much more threatening material than that in the post.</p></speech>

Senator Norris has left.  Reverting to the matter of Ibrahim Halawa, I apologise to the committee if it appears that I am taking an inordinate amount of time with this, but it is a serious issue.  It appears in the newspapers on a daily basis.  It is an issue to which much political consideration has been given in recent times.  Regarding Senator Daly's comments on the charges, there is no question of the Taoiseach having misled the D&aacute;il.  When reading reports or listening to comments from Members of these Houses, I resent that I must form the view that there may be an element of political partisanship.  I reiterate the fact that we are all working with the same objective, namely, seeking the return home of an Irish citizen.</p> <p>  To address the matter of the charges, during the trial hearing on 26 April, a lawyer acting on behalf of Ibrahim Halawa told our embassy officials that Mr. Halawa was facing different and lesser charges than other defendants in the case.  The Department wished to confirm this, given its importance.  A subsequent meeting was organised with Mr. Halawa's legal team for 20 May.  At that, it was confirmed to the embassy that the most serious charges applied to some members of the group were not applicable to Ibrahim Halawa.  This came from his lawyers.

They are the local legal advisers.  They are the closest to the proceedings.  They are involved on a daily basis in the subject matter of the detail of this case.  Notwithstanding that, we have been circumspect in public references to the charges, as this is a serious situation for all Irish citizens, particularly the one who is facing the charges.  This is not an issue that we have treated in anything less than the most serious way.  We want to make a positive progression leading to a positive outcome.</p> <p>  I will make a further brief point.  Senator Daly was incorrect to state that Peter Greste was in the same position as Ibrahim Halawa is today.  I have stated this on the record of the D&aacute;il and this committee.  Unfortunately, it does not suit some people to read the situation as is.  Regarding the presidential decree, Ibrahim Halawa is facing charges and is on trial, but the trial has not yet been concluded in the manner that we would all like.  He is in the process of a court case.  Peter Greste's initial trial had been completed, as admitted by Senator Daly, and his retrial had yet to start.  He was not in the course of court proceedings.  A conviction had been obtained by the court and a sentence had been handed down by it.  This fundamental difference is of importance in the context of what we are discussing.  The presidential decree and its terms will not be applied when an individual is in the course of a court process.  Through the Chair, I ask Senator Daly to retract his statement that the Department was misleading people.  It was not and it does not.  My officials have given a considerable level of commitment.  I resent having their professionalism called into question, given the fact that there have been 42 consular visits.  These will continue until this matter is disposed of, as we are anxious to ensure the welfare and return home of Ibrahim Halawa.</p> <p>  It has been claimed that this is a matter of lifting the telephone.  I have heard it stated that if certain senior politicians lifted the telephone, Ibrahim would be immediately sprung from prison.  That is an overly simplistic view of the process.  The Egyptian authorities will make the decision and we will work towards that.</p> <p>  I wish to address US-Cuba relations, as mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan.  Like all members of the committee, we welcome the historic decision by Presidents Obama and Castro on the restoration of diplomatic relations.  Ireland's long-standing concerns regarding the US embargo were set out at the UN last October when our support for the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly was manifest.</p><p>We are firmly of the view that lifting the embargo would facilitate Cuba's economy to the benefit of the people.  As in other areas of Latin America, we will continue to raise concerns regarding the governance and the human rights situation.</p><p> Senator Daly raised the matter of collusion.  In view of the time constraint on this meeting I will write to Senator Daly.  It is not an issue that involves the Foreign Affairs Council but I have been reasonably broad in my replies to questions on issues that are not strictly speaking matters for the Council.  Please forgive me if I do not open a debate on Northern Ireland because it is not possible within the time constraints.  I have raised some of Deputy Daly's concerns and I will continue to do so.</p><p> On the matter of migration as raised by Deputy Mitchell, I agree with her that this is an issue that needs a comprehensive response rather than an immediate response, although the immediate response in terms of search, rescue, resettlement and relocation, is important.  Ireland has received 124 Syrian refugees under the UN resettlement programme.  In recent times we had resettled 200 originally and we increased that number by a further 300 to a total of 520.  Some of these people are already in Ireland.  I wish to make it clear that we believe an approach based on solidarity and responsibility is essential.  I would expect that this issue will be the subject of further consideration at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the European Council.  We did have issues with any form of mandatory quota system but that is now off the table so we need to look at the type of consideration we can give by way of once-off and emergency measures and, over the coming weeks the final shape of the package and the level of participation will become clear.</p><p> Deputy Mitchell raised the matter of the millennium development goals with particular reference to women's health.  We would hope, notwithstanding the concern expressed by Deputy Mitchell, that we can reach a common EU position in that regard.  I am mindful of the point she makes.  Deputy Mitchell and Senator Norris have raised the issue of the feis.  I am deeply disappointed that the organisers of this cultural event felt compelled and under pressure to cancel it.  I condemn any form of intimidation.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that the organisers of this feis, a festival of what we do best, a festival of Irish culture and dance, felt intimidated at a very serious level.  In response to Senator Norris, I wish to inform him that our consulate in Chicago was contacted by one of the Irish dancing schools who had planned to take part in the feis but they had been subjected to very serious abuse themselves on social media.  The consulate duly contacted the school and made clear, as I reiterate this morning, that the Government does not support a cultural boycott of Israel.  Indeed, it is counter-productive and I believe that there is always a place for cultural engagement and in particular with regard to Irish dancing.  It is most disappointing that the organisers felt under threat of intimidation.  I would hope that it could be reviewed, if not this year, certainly on another occasion.</p></speech>

We are all working for the same objective.  I know we are focusing on the Peter Greste case to use as a mechanism but that original trial was set aside.  I would prefer if the Minister were representing Ibrahim Halawa by having a presence there.  Peter Greste's conviction was set aside and a retrial arranged while he was still in prison, therefore, he was in the same position as Ibrahim is today.  Of course, that is where lawyers come into play but my understanding is that it has been communicated that he is still facing the serious charges.</p></speech>

The petitioner is of the view that as a result of the current financial situation in the country, the Government should study the system adopted by Australia and implement the same system in Ireland.  Australia has enacted a law under which working visa holders, with children attending government funded primary schools, must pay an additional fee per child attending school. <b></b>We first considered this petition on 26 March 2014.  We wrote to the Minister for Finance as we considered it was a tax matter.  The reply from the Department of Finance states this proposal would be more appropriate to be administered via a charge similar to that imposed on third level students from outside the European Union.  The Department of Education and Skills has confirmed that it is not planning on introducing such a tax.  We forwarded the petition to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have considered it and received responses from the Departments concerned.  We have agreed to forward the departmental responses, the rationale for the viewpoint expressed and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>Petition No. P00024/2014 relates to social inclusion.  The petitioners believe the Government policy of tendering out the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, threatens to undermine community development projects and will result in a deterioration of services for the most disadvantaged.  They cite as the problem the enforcement of EU procurement Directive 2004/18/EC and advise that it has been superseded by EU Directive 2014/24/EU.  When it came before the committee on 11 December, it was agreed to invite the petitioners to address the committee on 28 January 2015.  We have deliberated on this issue.  I invite Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh to propose the recommendation.</p></speech>

Has the previous directive which was used for the tendering process earlier year lapsed and will the State have to pass into law the new directive by April 2016?  Given that the SICAP tendering process has to be repeated within a number of years, the Dublin Inner City Community Alliance believes some of the concerns it has raised may be addressed by EU Directive 2014/24/EU.  It believes that if it were in place, community organisations would not be forced to compete against each other in the tendering process, as was the case in this instance.  I also believe we should forward the response we received from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, together with the response from the chief procurement office, to the petitioners.  We should respond to the chief procurement officer again seeking clarification that EU Directive 2004/18/EC does not apply to certain services funded by way of grant aid.  We should also ask if the Teckal principle applies to the new directive.  There has been a loss of service in some areas as a result of the tendering process.  It is still a valid petition, given that the tendering process has been completed but still affects local areas.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>Petition No. P00027/14 on the abortion referendum is in the name of Mr. Alan Moran.  He is requesting the joint committee to call for a referendum on abortion.  This petition was brought before the consultative working group on 15 April for its consideration of its admissibility.  It was agreed not to deem the petition inadmissible but to bring it before the full joint committee for consideration.  It was also decided that calling for a referendum may not be something the committee should request, given the number of debates held on the abortion issue.  We also sought legal advice on the issue.  While we have agreed that the petition is admissible, there have been wide ranging debates in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The issue has had a considerable hearing in the Houses without us duplicating that work.  We will write to the petitioner, advising that we do not intend to take the matter further we will close it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The final petition is P000020/2015<b></b>on the affordability of domestic Irish Water charges is in the name of Mr. Ben Dalton.  He is requesting that legislation be introduced which would allow for a section to be set up within Irish Water to deal with customers not in a position to pay their water bills, that Irish Water agree to a payment plan with the customer and that in a situation where there was a default on this agreement, there should be the facility of an appeals process.  He also recommends that individuals be allowed to make an appeal to the Commission for Energy Regulation, should they not be happy with the appeals process.  Similar to the previous petition, this matter has received considerable attention through legislation dealt with in recent times.  We agree to refer the matter to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to see if it believes it needs further attention.  As always when we refer a petition to another committee, we will continue to monitor the position.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The petition will remain open and has been sent to another committee for its deliberation.</p></speech>

For the past ten years I have been volunteering with the Kilkenny and Carlow branch.  From an organisational perspective, I am a member of the board of trustees and the chairperson of Samaritans Ireland Nations Board.  I am one of more than 1,600 volunteers in the Republic who volunteer with Samaritans to provide emotional support for our callers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We are available weekdays, including bank holidays, morning, noon and night.  We are available when the statutory services have closed and strive to deliver a truly professional service on a voluntary basis.  While the emotional support we provide is typically provided over the telephone, we also provide support by e-mail and text message, in face to face contact and other outreach support services.  We provide confidential, non-judgmental emotional support through human contact.</p> <p>  The strategic partnership with the telecommunications industry last year enabled us to launch the free-to-caller 116 123 number and it has had a significant and very positive effect on our callers.  On every single duty, without fail, I see the benefit of the service in what our callers tell us and also our statistics.  There has been an increase of 50% in the number of calls to us since March last year, which is clear evidence that the cost of making a call to us was a barrier.  Before the free-to-caller service was launched, running out of credit, particularly a pay-as-you-go mobile phone, isolated a person in contacting us but that is no longer the case.</p><p>Before the free to caller service, itemised landline telephone bills would show that somebody contacted the Samaritans from the telephone line.  Since the free to caller service, that call is no longer on the bill, ensuring somebody who may be isolated in the home and under pressure from the bill payer does not have to explain both the cost and, more important, the contact.  This is no longer a problem.  These are two very simple examples of how a free to caller service can enable a door to be opened for somebody who is vulnerable, for somebody who needs the support of an established organisation who wants to be there for them 24 hours a day.  There are other barriers that our callers face that we continue to work on, such as the reduction of stigma and encouraging help seeking behaviour, but we know, week in and week out from listening to our callers, that the cost of that call was a barrier.  Through our partnerships with the Department of Health and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the Samaritans is the first place anybody who is struggling to cope seeks support and having this as a free to caller service is making a difference.</p></speech>

Within three months, we had reached the target both for the percentage of calls and the overall growth that we had set for the first year of our two year launch agreement. </p> <p>  We have invested in our technology and in our people in the period since March 2014 to allow us to meet the needs of our callers to the same high standard that our organisation has prided itself on for the past 62 years.  As Ms Leo mentioned, we have added a new location to our network of 12 branches in the Republic and volunteers in our east coast service in Arklow have answered more than 11,000 calls since they started operation last year.</p> <p>  We are investing heavily in our central telephony system, increasing our capacity from 30 to 50 simultaneous calls that can be received and moving our service to a resilient location.  We have plans in place to install high speed fibre broadbrand to each of our branches to future proof our network and ensure our ongoing quality and consistency of service.  As a result of the free to caller service 116123, we have been able to develop key partnerships, such as our work with the GAA and the HSE "LittleThings" campaign.  We are able to take transfers to support other helplines which do not operate a 24 hours a day service, such as the Carers Association of Ireland, LGBT, Aware, Cura and Shine.</p> <p>  In addition to developing and enhancing key partnerships and relationships, the organisation undertakes ongoing work to ensure our governance and compliance with legislation and regulations is carried out and reviewed on an ongoing basis, for example, data protection and Garda vetting.  The Samaritans has always operated to the highest standards of confidentiality and respect both for our callers and volunteers and we are proud that we have carried this level of quality in our service with us while hugely increasing the numbers of callers we can support across all the services provided by the Samaritans.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Pat Galvin, chair of the regulatory affairs working group of the Telecommunications and Internet Federation.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  As the committee will be aware, we have appeared before it previously, being the representative body for the telecommunications industry in Ireland.</p> <p>  Moving on through the slides. we have set out a sample of some of the industry's corporate social responsibility activities.  They are done on a bilateral company basis.  The substantive issue we are here to speak about is the partnership through the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, TIF, with the Samaritans.  By way of background, in March 2014, Samaritans Ireland launched 116123, the new free to call ComReg assigned European number for an emotional support helpline.  Through TIF, the telecommunications industry entered into a voluntary partnership with the Samaritans, first, to plan for the new number and, second, to fund incoming calls for a two year period, from March 2014.  The contribution in terms of revenue not collected by each operator depends on calls volume.  </p> <p>  The partnership involves BT, eircom/Meteor, Three, UPC and Vodafone.  Since it is a telecommunications provider, Sky Ireland has agreed in principle to join the partnership which is a positive development.  I will hand over to Mr. Pat Galvin who would like to add a few words.</p></speech>

The first point is that the alignment between our industry and the Samaritans and the synergy from this arrangement is clear.  Our technology is a critical enabler for the Samaritans to do its work as effectively as possible and reach out to as many people who need assistance as possible.  In that sense, it is a good strategic fit between the industry and a very worthy organisation.</p> <p>  The second point from an industry perspective is that it is a real example of a pan-European launch of something across the telecommunications industry.  The number 116 is an EU-wide anchor number which can be associated with this type of initiative and in that sense it is a practical example of the digital single market in play and working.</p> <p>  The third point in terms of the industry, which I represent as a director of eircom but I am representing all of the industry, is that our outcome estimates of the value of the sponsorship this year is about &euro;700,000.  As Mr. Denihan said, that depends very much on call volumes and, as has been said earlier, call volumes are growing.  We are happy with the progress of the initiative and have committed to a two year implementation period.  Quite frankly, it is an initiative with which the industry is proud to be associated.</p></speech>

As the representatives of TIF said, it has entered into a voluntary partnership for a two year period from 2014 to 2016.  What everybody wants to know is if that partnership will continue beyond 2016.  I presume that is the question that would give much relief to the Samaritans if it was answered this morning.</p></speech>

That is at the discretion of the various companies involved.  Clearly, that will be an individual decision, presented collectively by the sector.  What I would say is that we are absolutely committed to the current arrangement and we are committed to engaging with the Samaritans now rather than later.  The last thing the Samaritans needs is instability or uncertainty about this arrangement as we head towards next March.</p></speech>

That is what we are committing to.  We are extremely pleased with the impact our industry is making to make the Samaritans job easier and helping people who need assistance.  In that sense, it is very positive co-operation.</p></speech>

This is almost a first for this committee.  Normally witnesses appear before the committee after some service has ceased or threatens to cease, such as RTE's long wave service.  This initiative is positive.  It is clear from what the Samaritans said in its opening statements, and this would be reflected by each and every Oireachtas Member from visits to constituency offices, that there is a huge need for the service.  Words cannot describe sufficiently the amount of good work being done for every community by the Samaritans nationwide.</p><p>We often refer people to or seek help for them from out-of-hour services late in the evening.  In light of the coming together of the industry and the Samaritans, the former has obviously identified a need among people who do not have credit on their mobile telephones or funds available to conduct their business.  That is crucial.  It is important that we, as an Oireachtas committee, encourage industry-----</p></speech>

Was it mine?  Apologies.  In their engagement with industry, the Samaritans have identified that some people who must contact them do not have credit or money.  Our committee can applaud the industry for working with the Samaritans and encourage it to ensure that, when next March comes and whatever new Oireachtas committee on communications is sitting around this table, there is a serious engagement between the Samaritans and the industry with a view to continuing this service.  Under no circumstances can its discontinuation be countenanced.  It is an important service for vulnerable people who are constantly in need of help.  The Samaritans and the industry should continue engaging in meaningful negotiations so as to reach a successful conclusion.  A large amount of money is being invested by the industry in sponsorship, for want of a better word, but I applaud the Samaritans for what they are doing.  They should continue their good work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1892" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1185" speakername="Brian Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#F00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for their presentations.  I congratulate the Samaritans on their wonderful work and the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, TIF, on supporting that work.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the Chairman's question.  In light of the level of engagement and discussion with the six telecom providers that are offering this service heretofore, are the Samaritans concerned that the service might be discontinued next March?  I do not know whether the providers can answer my next question, but they mentioned a figure of &euro;700,000.  Is that the cost to them or is that the value of the calls that were made?  If the industry's net cost was not &euro;700,000, what was it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1893" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Galvin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#F00600"><p>I will address the cost issue.  If a corporation approached us to organise a freefone service for a promotion or a sales-type initiative and such a volume of calls was made, that amount is what we would be billing the corporate entity for the service.  It is the rate card for that volume of calls and represents the forgone revenue that the industry has agreed will not be billed back to the Samaritans.  The construction of that figure comprises a complex selection of internal transfer costs with, for example, us in eircom.  Without getting too technical, we manage the service.  A call may originate with Vodafone or another mobile operator and we pay that operator for taking the call across its network and terminating it in our network.  The billable figure based on those costs is &euro;700,000 per annum rather than for the two year period.  That is the current estimate.</p></speech>

It has allowed us to target the most vulnerable and reach many more people.  There is always a concern, but we have begun discussions with TIF on extending the agreement.  We hope to have a positive outcome.  We do not want volunteers who could be spending their time delivering this service to callers instead spending it shaking buckets and trying to raise the money necessary to deliver it.  It is a designated European number and 116 123 is here to stay.</p></speech>

I am aware of the extraordinarily good work that the Samaritans do in Ireland.  One of my siblings is a volunteer with them.  Lives can be turned around by the service that the Samaritans provide.  This is a power for good and society has a responsibility to ensure that those who need this service have an easy path to it.  That is the beauty of the good partnership between TIF and the Samaritans.  TIF might not get the public credit that it deserves for arrangements such as this.  It has a number of similar arrangements.  I am not sure that wider society knows of the good role that TIF is playing.  Perhaps it might consider this point in the discussions.</p> <p>  I agree that an organisation that is doing so much good for so many people should not have to be concerned about whether it will be able to provide the same level of service next year or in subsequent years.  It should be able to take that as a given.  The Samaritans should be having this discussion with TIF.  It is not so that our committee will feel good about it, but that the people accessing the Samaritans' services will know that those services continue to be available.</p> <p>  It is great when people appear before the committee before there is a problem and outline how they will work together to ensure that there never will be one.  The cost amounts to a great deal of money, but for the value of the work being done and the difference it makes to people's lives, it is small.  Well done to the Samaritans and TIF.  This is an example of good co-operation that makes a difference to people's lives.  Keep it up.</p></speech>

I know what it is like to fund-raise, having worked in the charity sector in Ireland and overseas for 30 years.  I continue to do so on a voluntary basis.  Our support comes from everyone from schoolchildren raising &euro;5 or &euro;10 each to the corporate sector.</p> <p>  What is the purpose of the groups' presentations?  To be honest, I am not sure.  I understand the corporate social responsibility of the providers that is met through TIF.</p><p>I can understand the 116 number.  That is necessary for the vulnerable people who can call for the support they need.  However, when there are other organisations such as Console, Aware, Childline and Focus Ireland which operate 1800 or 1850 numbers seeking support, I am trying to figure out what the purpose of coming here-----</p></speech>

This is a fantastic service provided by the Samaritans.  Corporations, like politicians, are criticised at times but it is important to highlight this contribution being made by the industry.  If it was coming up to next March and there was no certainty about it for the future, what we have learned this morning is that engagement and discussions are ongoing and, hopefully, there will be a successful conclusion.  It is sometimes good that committees can be proactive, rather than picking up the pieces afterwards where divisions or cutbacks have arisen.  That is the reason.  It was my initiative that this took place.  That is the explanation.</p></speech>

However, the other organisations I mentioned are in the same boat.  What I am trying to figure out from the presentation today is whose responsibility it is to provide the service.  Is it Samaritans and other organisations seeking sponsorship to help them cover the costs?  Is it a corporate responsibility of the service provider?  Is it the Government that should help to fund these things, or should it even come down to the public giving, perhaps, a quarter of a cent per call they make towards all of the organisations that need vital free telephone services?  That is what I am trying to figure out today.  I certainly applaud the work the Samaritans and other organisations are doing, but ultimately I wish to figure out how we can provide services into the future for all the organisations that will help to meet the requirements of the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1906" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Moore" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#G00600"><p>One of the reasons we were asked to appear again before the committee is that in 2010, when the 116123 number was being assigned to the Samaritans, this committee invited ourselves and representatives of a number of other groups to a meeting to discuss how we could make this work.  At that stage there was no relationship in place and there was no partnership.  In part, it was from those contacts that this relationship was put in place, so this is something of a report back to the committee.</p> <p>  Obviously, as Mr. Galvin said, there is a wide range of other organisations supported by the telecoms industry.  We would propose that the Samaritans is somewhat different, because of the nature of the 116123 number.  A very small number of such numbers are common across Europe.  As this was assigned to the Samaritans, it was a significant responsibility that we had to undertake, because it would be much higher profile than anything we had done previously.  Associated with that there were costs and other types of investments we had to make, so there is a qualitative difference between the delivery of the 116123 number and some of the other 1800 and other services.  That was facilitated by this committee in 2010.</p></speech>

It costs approximately &euro;450,000 for eircom alone.  Many of the other organisations are catered for through that direct sponsorship.  However, it is an interesting point.  There is huge demand for these services and the industry and sector we represent is doing everything we can, within reason and within all the other constraints we have, to make as good a contribution as we can.</p> <p>  As to the other point the Senator raised about the engagement, as I said earlier the engagement is entirely constructive and positive.  We understand the need for a decision sooner rather than later.  What we are committing to the Samaritans today is that the decision will be made in good time to allow the organisation to do its core business, which is helping the people who need assistance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#G00800"><p>I welcome the representatives and endorse everything that has been said about the wonderful work the Samaritans are doing.  Also, the corporate sector should be complimented.  It does not often receive kudos, but in this instance it has certainly risen to the challenge.  While I understand that decisions have yet to be taken, I am encouraged by the remarks that discussions are ongoing.  When this service was being funded by the corporate sector, inevitably it was not going to commit beyond a trial period so it could see how it would work.  However, as we have heard, it has not only worked but been overwhelmingly successful.  Without reading too much into what has been said so far, it appears that the ongoing funding will not be threatened.  This is an example of where the corporate sector has a moral responsibility in society and that is reflected very much in the continuing support it is giving.  When one considers the amount involved, approximately &euro;700,000 spread across some of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, it is a drop in the ocean financially so I hope there would not be any great difficulty in the continued funding of it.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that Sky Ireland has agreed to join in principle, because it is a major player.  The GAA and the HSE are also involved.  Perhaps the witnesses would explain the partnership in that regard.  When I saw the reference to the GAA it reminded me that my fellow county man, Colm Regan, is employed by the GAA to look after the area of mental health, wellness and healthy activity.  I am curious to hear more about the relationship.</p> <p>  In addition, a page at the end of the presentation relates to the network speed and service on completion.  The current speed is abysmally low at 2 mb when one looks at some of the broadband speeds experienced by some parts of the country which are up to 100 mb.  According to the advertisements, upc is selling up to 100 mb speeds.  Is that an inhibiting factor?  The upgraded speed in the proposed new circuits is still only 10 mb.  Is the organisation getting more queries using this type of medium rather than just the normal telephone call?  Given that this is included in the presentation I am curious to know its significance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1909" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Brogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#G00900"><p>I will speak on the partnerships issue, but before doing that I will respond to Senator Coghlan.  The 116123 is a designated European number so there was an assessment to see what organisation that provided emotional support could provide this service.  That is why it was bestowed on the Samaritans.  We look on it as a national asset.  It is a European number, but it is a national asset.  The Samaritans are holding that in stewardship, and it has proven itself to be extremely effective particularly to the target audiences we are trying to reach.</p> <p>  Regarding the GAA partnership, we launched that last year.  It is growing.  We became a charity partner initially.  Part and parcel of what Samaritans wanted to do was to keep this as a partnership so we could target the vulnerable and at-risk in one of our key areas, young men.</p><p>We have grown that partnership in the past 12 months, with volunteer liaison officers in Samaritans branches across the country linking up with well-being officers in local GAA clubs.  Information on this has gone out to all our branches.  Samaritans representatives engaged in awareness-raising activities at the Leinster and Ulster finals last year and the hurling semi-finals, from which we had a huge response.  It gave us an opportunity to hand out more than 15,000 wristbands and talk with people face to face during breaks in play.  In addition, we are working on developing a listening scheme with GAA club coaches, which will involve our people going into those clubs and signposting people to our services.</p><p> Another initiative in which we are involved is the HSE's #littlethings campaign, under which the first point of contact given is the 116123 number.  Again, the great benefit is that people do not incur a cost in contacting us, and details of the call will not appear on their bill.  Of particular benefit for people who are most vulnerable is that it is possible to call the number from a pay-as-you-go telephone even if one has no credit.  We are working in close partnership with the HSE on that campaign.</p><p> Key to Connecting for Life, the new national suicide prevention strategy, is the idea of everyone taking responsibility around suicide.  We all have our part in play and we all can make a difference.  The partnership we have with the telecommunications companies in the provision of the 116123 telephone service has proven the real value of effective partnership.  As I said, discussions are ongoing with the companies and we hope to have reached agreement by September on extending the arrangement.</p></speech>

We installed a national digital network in 2009 but, as in all such cases, it is now somewhat out of date in terms of the connection speeds for each of our 13 sites around the country.  One of the concerns we have around putting in place an extension on the agreement relates to the type of investment that is needed both to handle the increased number of voice calls and the services we deliver over e-mail and messaging services.  We have a digital plan to introduce other forms of communication.  To some extent, we are looking to invest in the network we have, but that is something we need to plan for over a three- to five-year timescale.  It is part of the discussions we are having with the telecommunications companies.  We have co-operated very strongly with them on the call charges and they have been very supportive around engineering issues and planning for this type of service.  We fund-raise to cover this element ourselves, but we cannot make those business decisions until we know where we are with the call charges.</p></speech>

After all, part of their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>is to improve broadband speeds.  One assumes, therefore, that it could all work in tandem.  Is Mr. Moore saying, however, that the Samaritans will have to put in a significant investment itself?</p></speech>

While there is an element of the cost associated with the service that is free to us, there is a significant ongoing telecommunications cost that the organisation covers itself via fund-raising by local branches.  It involves the cost of the rental on the lines and the equipment that is in place.</p></speech>

It is a significant investment for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-08a.1916" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070800002#H00700"><p>I am raising this issue because I was indirectly involved, some years ago, in efforts by a group to establish a similar helpline for missing persons.  That group had several meetings with the Department of Justice and Equality but the latter refused to give funding on the basis that it was too costly.  As I understand it, a missing persons helpline has still not been set up, primarily because of cost.  In that context, I say "Well done" to the Samaritans for securing the funding.</p></speech>

As we indicated, we are rolling out Eircom next-generation access networks, which are giving substantially higher speeds.  The situation will evolve over the coming years as Mr. Moore and his colleagues work out what they need.  We expect to be able to meet whatever demand they have.</p> <p>  The current sponsorship arrangement relates to the cost of calling the 116 number, but there are other associated costs, as Mr. Moore outlined, in regard to equipment and bandwidth rental.  All of that is separate.  As Mr. Moore said, the industry is co-operating fully in terms of where those lines will be located and which organisations will provide them.  That is all very much on the commercial side and we will be absolutely constructive in that regard.</p></speech>

Ms Brogan noted that we all have a part to play in preventing suicide.  We might all start by putting the 116 number into our telephones and making as many people as possible aware of it.  I commend the partnership between the voluntary and corporate sectors that we see in this instance.  Given that volunteers of all persuasions often do not get the recognition they deserve, I take this opportunity to compliment the delegates on the good work they are doing throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Their engagement with industry is a truly successful endeavour.  I understand Sky Ireland has agreed to get involved, which is commendable.  As a GAA member, I am aware of the work that organisation does in every single parish in the country, the vast majority of them in rural areas.  The partnership between the GAA and the Samaritans is proving to be a very successful one.</p> <p>  There is agreement to continue to provide the 116 service until the end of 2016.  I do not imagine anybody involved would want to abdicate from such a successful endeavour.  I commend all of those involved.  The emphasis here today is on reminding us we are all part of a team and all have a part to play in ensuring the most vulnerable people in the country are helped in whatever way possible.</p></speech>

We have learned that the partnership in which the Samaritans are involved in delivering the 116 service is working very well, the demand for the service is increasing and discussions on its continuation have begun.  This meeting has highlighted the need for that service to continue.  I wish the delegates the best of luck in their discussions and I hope there will be a continuing partnership.</p></speech>
