COM (2014) 180 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on organic production and labelling of organic products, amending regulations of the European Parliament.  It is proposed that the proposal warrants further scrutiny by way of a letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine requesting further information on exactly how Ireland's target of 5% of land converted to organic will be affected and precisely how Ireland's ability to reach that goal will be limited by the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2014) 195 is a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation No. 43/2014 as regards certain fishing opportunities.

As the Chairman said, I am responsible for land and property at Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am joined by my two colleagues, Mr. Pat Ring, head of property development, and Dr. Catherine Farrell, senior ecologist.</p><p>  As the Chairman and the committee will know, Bord na M&oacute;na is 95% owned by the State and was originally established in 1946 to develop some of Ireland's extensive peat resources, primarily at that time for fuel and energy.  Today, we are active in a number of industrial sectors, including conventional and renewable energy generation, commercial and domestic fuels, horticultural growing media, wastewater treatment and air pollution abatement, as well as a resource recovery facility in north Kildare. </p><p>  We employ a core workforce of approximately 1,800 people and a seasonable workforce of around 600 people during the summer months.  Last year our average employment numbers were just over 2,000 and the turnover made by the company was just over &euro;425 million.  Our head office is located in Newbridge and we have operations in Ireland, the UK and the US.  We sell our products into more than 20 countries.</p><p>  Today's meeting is related to maximising the usage and potential of land so we will focus primarily on our lands, in particular our views on potential uses for cutaway bogs.  Our lands extend in total to about 80,000 hectares throughout the country, mainly located in the midlands but in some other areas, particularly north-west Mayo.  This vast resource is characterised by fragmentation.  We have in excess of 130 individual bogs, many of which comprise numerous individual land parcels.  We have made a submission to the committee and, in addition, we have submitted two reports that we believe are relevant for the committee's consideration.  One is entitled the Strategic Framework for the Future Use of Peatlands and the second is our biodiversity action plan.  I will hand over to Mr. Ring who will expand further on our land bank and plans for future land use options.  He will be followed by Dr. Farrell who will provide more detail on our bog restoration projects and ecosystem services.  We will take any questions that arise during the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Ring" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300003#F00600"><p>I will provide further information to the committee on Bord na M&oacute;na's land bank.  I will also provide information on a framework that we have developed to help us examine potential future uses of peatlands, particularly peatlands at the cutaway stage.</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na owns approximately 80,000 hectares of land and it is important to say that this is predominantly peatlands.  In other words, it is quite different from mineral soil even when it reaches the cutaway stage.</p> <p>The land bank consists of 130 bogs units, mainly in the midlands with some on the west coast.  The bogs are large in scale and complexity and have the potential to revegetate.  The depth of peat that remains after production will vary considerably, and some bogs, particularly those in the Shannon catchment area, are under the water table so they are supported by bog pumping operations.</p><p> Slide No. 3 provides an outline of current land use in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It shows that three quarters of the land is involved in peat production activities and this supports our energy, fuels and horticultural businesses and factories.  One quarter of the land is either cutaway or will not be used for production in the future.  Current after-use options include wind energy, biodiversity, amenity uses and forestry.</p><p> It is useful to provide some background on how thinking has evolved in respect of peatlands and their use.  Originally, in the 19th century, peatlands were seen as wastelands with potential for agriculture if they could be drained.  In the 20th century, the value of peatlands for industrial development became obvious, and subsequently large areas were developed on an industrial scale.  With that, the question arose of what would become of the land when the peat production phase came to an end.  At the time, the view was that the use would be for agriculture and horticulture.  However, the reality proved to be more difficult and complex.  Extensive trials had been carried out over many decades by Bord na M&oacute;na working in collaboration with partners such as Coillte, COFORD and UCD.  For economic and technical reasons, the use for agriculture and horticulture is realistically unviable and the potential for forestry is limited.  More recently, there is huge growth in recognition of the biodiversity value of peatlands.  Cutaway bogs present a range of complex issues that require to be considered bog by bog.  To that end, we have carried out a body of work reviewing the work done over the decades and seeking to develop a framework to assist us in examining future land use options.</p><p> Slide No. 5 provides a broad outline and overview of what we refer to as a strategic framework for future land use.  Each of the 130 bog units will be assessed on the basis of eight key factors, which are shown in the diagram.  Number 1 refers to the physical nature of the bog, the second refers to its location in comparison with key infrastructure, which is critical, as is No. 3, the timeframe for peat extraction.  No. 4 refers to the economics of any after-use proposal and No. 5 refers to the national and regional needs.  Bord na M&oacute;na is of the view that our cutaway peatlands have an important role to play in meeting national requirements for renewable energy, water storage, amenities and biodiversity.  No. 6 refers to legislation and regulation, and any future development must comply with relevant legislation.  No. 7 relates to land use planning policies, and any future land use must conform with national, regional and local policies.  No. 8 is the local issues and local consideration, which are very important.  These include providing employment and places for amenities and recreation.  All these factors and the complex issue of projecting future land use is covered under the land use review system, which will be dynamic in nature and will allow for changes in regulation or land use policy in future years.</p><p> In terms of overall land use strategy, the object of Bord na M&oacute;na is to balance and optimise the commercial, social and environmental value of its resources.  Bord na M&oacute;na will actively pursue the full potential of its land bank for a variety of appropriate future land uses.  The land bank will be developed with regard to commercial benefits and the national interest.  Bord na M&oacute;na will interact with other policy-making bodies, such as regional and local authorities, to achieve it.  Cutaway bogs present a range of complex options that require to be considered bog by bog.</p><p> Biodiversity and ecosystem services comprise an important issue when considering future land use options.  Biodiversity provides a contribution to wealth and health through the ecosystem services and consequently has economic value.  Bord na M&oacute;na lands identified as having high biodiversity value or priority habitats will be reserved for that purpose as the principal future land use.  Some level of remediation, with consequent cost, is required for all future land use and many of the options we look at are compatible and can be co-located.  For example, biodiversity is compatible with and can be co-located with wind energy, and water storage options are compatible with amenities.</p><p> I will summarise with some of the key land use options under consideration.  Wind energy is a key land use option at present.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been active in wind energy projects for 20 years and we believe cutaway peatlands have significant potential to meet Ireland's renewable energy targets.  Cutaway peatlands typically have a good wind regime and they are remote, with no residences within the bog and, typically, a low number of residences on the periphery.  We also look at amenities and tourism as important options.  To date, we have focused our resources in developing the Lough Boora site in County Offaly.  It is a cutaway bog that has been developed for amenity and biodiversity purposes and it has cycleways, walking tracks, lakes and a sculpture park.  It is a fine local amenity and we are working to develop Lough Boora further for improved visitor facilities for local visitors and people from further afield.  High value biodiversity is a key consideration and my colleague Dr. Farrell will talk about that in more detail.  Industry and infrastructure have a place in the future land use of cutaway peatlands.  Some examples include Drehid Resource Recovery Park in County Kildare and a smaller development in Derryarkin Sand and Gravel Limited, a joint venture with Roadstone Holdings.</p><p> I also mentioned forestry, and significant areas of land have been leased to Coillte since the 1980s.  However, growing performance has been disappointing and while forestry considers to be considered, at this stage it seems unlikely it will present major opportunities in terms of after-use options.  My final slide seeks to paint a picture of what a future peatland landscape may look like, showing renewable energy being garnered from wind, wetland areas, and an area rich in biodiversity and amenities for local communities and employment creating opportunities.</p> <p>I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Catherine Farrell, who will talk about ecosystem services and bog restoration projects in Bord na M&oacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Farrell" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300005#H00200"><p>I will say a few words on the mapping system in terms of how we plan our land use and get to grips with what is out there across the full holdings of 80,000 hectares.  I will hint at some of the other ecosystem services benefits, such as biodiversity, carbon and then, of course, cultural landscape.</p><p>  What is a cutaway bog?  What sort of landscape does that present to us?  For the most part, that is what we are talking about today.  It is very different from a raised bog.  A lot of people might confuse cutaway bogs.  We cannot restore these bogs to active raised bogs.  For the greater part of it, one essentially has a new landscape.  Peat has been removed so what one has is a very different landscape which has varying depths of peat and varying drainage regimes and, as Mr. Ring hinted, significant areas moving towards wetlands into the future.</p><p>  When peat production stops in an area, generally, what one is left with is a bare landscape.  Within a couple of months of production stopping, we start to see natural colonisation happening across the peatland.  This gives rise over time to a range of different habitats, and at this time we are mapping the habitats emerging on the cutaway bogs with a view to determining how all of our bogs will develop in terms of whether they will be wetland or woodland habitat and how those habitats can contribute in lots of senses to carbon services and benefits into the future and also to biodiversity networks.  At this point in time, we are of the mind that roughly 30% of our lands would be going towards wetland and the remainder towards scrub-woodland type habitats.  The benefits to natural colonisation and, where necessary, targeted rehabilitation is that our lands will be environmentally stabilised and we will have this rich diverse landscape.  Also, that will have an impact on other services such as water quality into the future.</p><p>  I will show members an example of one of the sites we have.  Ballycon bog is adjacent to the Mount Lucas wind farm site, which some members may have been on.  It is roughly 200 hectares and has been out of peat production for more than ten years.  We have zoned this area as a biodiversity area.  In terms of how we map these areas, we have an extensive GIS database.  We have a layer which identifies the generic land use in the area.  This is a biodiversity area, with some Coillte plantation to the west of the site.  The map on the top right shows the current habitats on the site, so it is a mosaic of wetland and emerging scrub.  The map on the lower left is a lidar map that can inform us as to where wetlands will form.  The one on the lower right is basically the future of this particular site and how it will look.  We have a database and knowledge on more than 130 of our bog areas.  We have a lot of information as to how these sites will develop into the future.</p><p>  We talked about the cutaway bogs.  We also have in our land bank roughly 2,500 hectares of bog that was never brought fully into peat production.  We have identified those areas and have started a process of bog restoration on these sites.  The benefits in terms of restoring active raised bog habitat is that a lot of these sites have been incorporated into the national network of special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.  The other side of it is the potential to use these sites for carbon offset into the future.  The sites currently drained may continue to release carbon, but once one rewets these sites, one restores the carbon sequestration potential of the areas.</p><p>  In terms of the carbon issue, obviously we will leave a lot of peat in the ground on our cutaway sites.  We want to see what can happen when we rewet those areas.  Can we maintain the carbon on site and, where possible, can we start to return these areas to carbon sequestration sites?  We have invested in a number of greenhouse gas monitoring projects which link up with UCD and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Hopefully, they will inform our land use decisions into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300005#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I was under the impression 20 years ago that all of this land would be put to some commercial use, but what the witnesses seem to be indicating is that much of the land will return to some semi-natural state and that we will have wetlands, scrublands and so on.  Is it the intention to use these lands as environmental areas and areas which people will study - in other words, as a national resource without a particular crop?  I accept a certain amount of forestry is being done but I am talking about the areas that will be left in their natural states and that these will become an environmental resource.  What proportion of the total land do the witnesses see as winding up either as wetlands or as other kinds of environmental areas but not cropped in any way?</p><p>  Europe wants all these SACs and if so many people are so interested in preserving them, presumably people will be interested in looking at them, walking across them and studying them.  We can bring all sorts of universities in and do long course on the biodiversity of Irish bogs and raised bogs and so on.  I understand we will wind up with cutaway bog that will return to some kind of regenerative state.  Bog that was never cut is a very high quality SAC and well worth protecting because it is very scarce in the European context.  I mention all the things wetlands bring.</p><p>  I do not know if it is an appropriate question to ask witnesses but in view of the land bank left and the nature of that land bank, would I be right to think that only a large semi-State body like Bord na M&oacute;na could possibly handle this, in particular since it will not result in a very direct commercial benefit?  In other words, the benefit might be more a national pay-off rather than a pay-off for the company.  Would the witnesses comment on that issue that these lands will not give the company a direct pay-off but, of course, they will be of huge national importance if we are to have all of this biodiversity, carbon sinks and so on which are important nationally but will not necessarily pay the company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300005#H00400"><p>I thank the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na for their presentations.  I have two questions, one of which relates to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about the biodiversity element of future land use.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na obliged to commercialise that or how does it see that developing in the future?  It was said that ecosystem services have an economic value.  Where does it see that being achieved?</p><p>  I have a question on biomass production and I was surprised that was not in the presentations.  I would have thought Bord na M&oacute;na would be ideally placed to carve out a role for itself in terms of the delivery of biomass in the economy.  Renewable energy and renewables are something we need to look at for the future.  What consideration has been given to the production of biomass in Bord na M&oacute;na's future development plans?</p> <p>I acknowledge that the situation has improved greatly in recent years in terms of being able to use biomass in electricity generation.  I see potential for the economy to develop an industry to provide biomass for renewable energy production, particularly electricity production.  That would be a lot more productive than using the land for wind energy.  The use of land for wind energy and forestry is passive in the context of the role of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Finding some productive use for the land other than for wind energy would be more advantageous and beneficial to society.</p></speech>

The witnesses referred to lands being "environmentally stabilised".  Will they explain what that means?  When these lands are vacated, will they be wet or dry?  I have the mindset that one would normally try to dry out wet ground.  Diversity was also mentioned but is the idea of creating a national park just an easy way out?  Should we not be looking at the possibility of producing food?  Can animals graze some parts of this land?  Can we develop biomass crops?  If we do, have we any way of harvesting them if the ground is very wet?</p><p>  I am certainly in favour of wind energy but have the witnesses done any analysis of the impact of getting 400 kV of energy from those sites?  This is very topical at the moment with many people objecting to overground cables and pylons.  Has this been examined thoroughly in the context of the concerns of the public?  The picture on the presentation is lovely, with sailing boats, people strolling around and so forth, but realistically how much of the countryside do we need for boating and strolling around?  I do not do much boating.  Is there something sustainable here that will create wealth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300006#J00300"><p>On the question of carbon sequestration, have the witnesses quantified that or put a value on it?  If it was seen as a public good, in the context of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier about the value to the nation as opposed to Bord na M&oacute;na, what value would it have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Ryan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014051300006#J00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will deal with biomass first because it came up a number of times.  We have examined in considerable detail the possibility of using our land bank to produce or grow biomass.  Unfortunately, the efficiency of the crop which is produced relative to the input costs means it is not economically feasible.  We have tried on a number of occasions to produce reasonable quantities of a number of different biomass crops on our lands, including willow, alder and miscanthus, but it is not economically feasible to grow it on our land bank after peat production.  It would be fantastic for us if we could use the land for that purpose but it is not feasible to do so on an economic basis, unfortunately.  Having said that, Bord na M&oacute;na has been a champion of the use of biomass in the energy sector in Ireland.  In our Edenderry power station in county Offaly, more than 20% of the energy produced comes from biomass which is sourced almost entirely from within the Irish market.  We also have a programme to encourage farmers to grow biomass on our behalf for use in the power station in Edenderry.  That is on a small scale at the moment.  It would be very helpful if more supports were available from the State in the context of renewable energy in general.  Nevertheless, we have a programme up and running and a small number of farmers have undertaken to grow biomass on our behalf for use in the power station.  Unfortunately, using our own land for biomass production is not an economically feasible proposition.</p><p>  On wind energy, we have conducted a number of studies and developed two major wind energy farms in Mount Lucas and Bruckana in the midlands on our own lands, based on the normal planning regulations and permissions which apply.  They are nearing completion and are very successful.  Of course we do not envisage a situation where all the 80,000 hectares will be covered with wind farms, and the picture was certainly not meant to convey that.  The vast majority of our land will be wetland of the type described by Mr. Ring and Dr. Farrell, and I will ask them to comment on that aspect.</p></speech>

Our overall strategy is to seek to generate commercial, environmental and social value.  There is a clear focus on that in the sense that we are not just focused on amenity value and biodiversity.  We fully accept and understand that commercial value must also be created.  In our view, that would be driven by Bord na M&oacute;na and the value would accrue to the company.  However, we understand that value should also accrue to the State in the context of the national interest, and we would see that the cutaway peatlands would have a value in terms of providing biodiversity and carbon storage while also providing solutions in the context of green energy and possibly water storage.  The focus of Bord na M&oacute;na and this unit within the organisation is to look into the future at the emerging lands that will become available post peat production and to seek to generate value from them, whether commercial, environmental or social.  We feel that getting the balance right is very important.</p></speech>

We have a range of local community projects right across from Kildare to Galway and from Roscommon down to Tipperary.  It is a great opportunity for communities to take ownership of a piece of cutaway bog, to have a walkway and to use the area productively, through interaction with local schools and so forth.  The great thing about those sites is that rare species are coming in and using them and then people can get up close and personal with these species, which is very different from learning about them in a classroom.  There is great potential from that perspective.</p><p>  In terms of the national network of special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas, it is meant to be a robust network.  It is not meant to be a network of isolated units that are expected to survive on their own.  We are very aware of green infrastructure, connecting up the sites and trying to sustain the populations of these habitats and species into the future.  We are working with the National Parks and Wildlife Service on that aspect.</p><p>  In terms of putting a value on it, I take Deputy Barry's point.  As a company we have tried to look at the value in terms of carbon and biodiversity.  There are several international studies examining the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity, most notably the TEEB study led by Pavan Sukhdev.  We are trying to lead on that front in Ireland and recently organised a meeting on the topic of natural capital and how we can start to put a value on very intangible benefits such as well-being, using the wetlands for filtration to obtain clean water and so forth.  We do not have the accounting structure in place at this time to account for that.</p> <p>We are working on that with other people.  Carbon is a complex element, in particular in peatlands.  We know that peat is a high carbon value product.  When a peatlands is drained, there is carbon in the peat on site.  We have a range of studies.  In our study in County Mayo we are looking at what happens when we re-wet the cutaway bog.  The cutaway is unique because it is an acidic peat medium which lends itself to the regeneration of bog mosses and therefore one can restore functional aspects of peatlands.  The study has shown that we have returned the site in Mayo to a carbon sink.  That is a great result if we can roll it out across the 6,500 ha of our bogs.  We have shown that we can do it in core areas and we need to replicate that across the entirety of the site.  Some figures put together tentatively would suggest there is some economic value.  We work with the EPA on that.  Mr. Phillip O'Brien, who I understand has come before this committee, is the person we engage with on that front and look at it as a potential offset from a national perspective.<br />In the midlands sites we are looking at re-wetted cutaway, which is re-wetted fen peat.  In these cutaways the vegetation is typically sedge or reed.  We do not know the answer to that yet.  We will have data for two years in 2015.  Intuitively one would think that the peat is still in the ground, so that means it is held <i>in situ</i>carbon.  We have the reeds on top and that is accumulating biomass.  The question is whether that is creating another carbon sink.  We will know that in 2015, although with all these things, it is always a case that we need more studies to verify the data.  <br />The other site we set up with the EPA in 2013 was a restored peatlands site.  In the big picture, there will be a massive restoration programme in terms of the SSEs and NHAs,  Again we will have two years data in 2015.  I cannot answer the question, but we are building up the knowledge to feed into the answer.<br />Deputy Barry had a specific question on what we mean by the term &quot;environmentally stabilised&quot;.  When one has an active peat production unit, one essentially has bare peat fields.  The words &quot;environmentally stabilised&quot; is the term used in our IPC licensing.  Condition (10) of our IPC licence states that we need to have a rehabilitation plan for each of our bog units to ensure that the site is environmentally stabilised.  That is to assure the licensing authority - in this case it is the EPA - that Bord na M&oacute;na does not walk away and leave what can only be described as &quot;an open cast mine&quot;.  Stabilisation is to ensure the soil is stabilised and there is no potential run off in the future.</p></speech>

When I asked the question I was wondering if we could ever produce food in the cutaway.  Obviously this land has produced an economic return from the employment generated by turf cutting.  Other than using the cutaway for using up carbon, can we put sheep or other animals on it?  Other than stabilising the site, is there any possibility of commercial agricultural activity on any of the 80,000 ha?</p></speech>

In the 1970s, we recruited people specifically with agricultural qualifications and degrees to determine whether it would be possible to create an agricultural enterprise from cutaway peatlands.  We have a number of projects, not only the project close to Lough Boora which was formerly cutaway peatlands and is now agricultural grassland.  The simple fact is that the economics of creating an agricultural grassland from cutaway peatlands does not justify the investment that is required to transform the landscape into an agricultural landscape.  We would be delighted if the opposite was the case but unfortunately this is not our experience.  That experience has been hard fought by investment and by trials of different types of agriculture, not just animal husbandry but also crop production, such as cereal crops.  We have tried different things at different times since the 1970s and unfortunately none has proved to be economically viable.  There is no agricultural use in that sense.</p></speech>

Bioethanol is probably the most efficient way of doing it because one can have a crop that can be produced three, four or five times a year depending on the variety, but one needs a critical mass of 200 ha to 300 ha for production.  It is not something that one can bring the product very far to by use of anaerobic digesters.  I presume that will be dependent on the value refits that would be applied. which will determine the economic value.</p></speech>

Between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, there is more than 500,000 ha of land, there is in the order of 2 million ha in pasture production and whatever is in arable production.  Deputy Barry would probably have a better idea than I have about that.  It could be a couple of hundred thousand hectares.  There is a significant percentage of land that is in non-agricultural us and there is potential carbon storage sequestration that should be a mitigating factor for Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  The next presentation will be on the sustainable way of achieving that but the main purpose of our meeting is to produce an argument for Ireland's case.

Agriculture has probably never before faced so many potentially conflicting challenges at global and national scale.  We need to increase food production while reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and maintaining and in some cases improving the status of our natural resources.  I have tried to depict some of these challenges in the first slide.<br />From a national perspective, Food Harvest 2020 sets out a vision for smart and green growth in agricultural output in the case of the dairy sector, and value-added growth in the case of the beef and sheep sectors.  In terms of the green dimension, the document states:<blockquote>Ireland can become synonymous with the production of environmentally sustainable and welfare friendly products.  This should result in consumers in key markets recognising implicitly that, by buying Irish, they are choosing to value and respect the natural environment.</blockquote>Essentially, we need to achieve this to prove our green credentials.  When we discuss meeting our production targets, we naturally look to areas in which we have a competitive advantage to help achieve this.  I suggest that the exact same approach is required if we are to prove our green credentials.  We need to identify areas in which we have a natural competitive advantage and focus our marketing campaigns on them, to some degree at least.<br />Obviously, we cannot measure all components of biodiversity.  We have taken the approach of using semi-natural habitat cover as an indicator of wider biodiversity.  We know we have major issues and challenges surrounding much of the approximately 13% of terrestrial land that has been designated as a Natura 2000 site.  This has been reported to the EU Commission.  We will have to work very hard to comply with the requirements of the habitats directive in this respect.  I do not want to dwell on this today, however, as many of the species and habitats of concern will require detailed site and species conservation plans which will need to be developed and implemented on a case-by-case basis.  I will focus on habitats that are not afforded protection under the habitats directive. These occur on farms throughout the country.  While they might not be rare from a national or international perspective, their continued existence is fundamental to the provision of ecosystem services that underpin agricultural production systems.<br />Our research group has undertaken habitat surveys on approximately 170 grassland farms throughout the country to date.  During this work over 6,000 ha of land were mapped in terms of their habitat composition.  The results of this work revealed that, on average, approximately 14% of grassland farm area is under semi-natural habitat.  As members can see from the next slide, this level of semi-natural habitat cover varies by region and farming system.  However, the overall data show we have retained a good base of semi-natural habitat in our farmed landscape.  This gives us a competitive advantage over some other European countries, such as the Netherlands, France and Poland.  The Netherlands is estimated to have estimated to have 2.1% of farm area under semi-natural habitat cover.  The figure in France varies between 2% and 12% depending on the region.  The figure in Poland varies between 1% and 4%.  As these countries have a greater proportion of arable land, a direct comparison is impossible.<br />The challenge for us is to create a link between biodiversity and Irish produce in the minds of consumers.  Research we are undertaking along with our colleagues in Teagasc is focusing on the development of a user-friendly, non-specialist method of recording this diversity, such that a biodiversity index could be generated for farms.  This type of approach has a role to play in terms of providing justification to EU taxpayers for the continuation of CAP payments.  As the next slide illustrates, CAP expenditure as a proportion of the overall EU budget has decreased by approximately 30% over the last 25 years.  It is likely that there will be pressure to continue this downward trend in the coming years.  This is particularly relevant in an Irish context.  Results from the national farm survey suggest direct payments comprise an average of 81% of total farm income, with beef and sheep farms operating at a loss in the absence of these payments.  While the implications of greening have largely been limited to arable farms within this round of the CAP, it is quite conceivable that the requirement to retain ecological focus areas might be extended to grassland farms in the future.  I must also caution against complacency, however.  While the habitats are present at the moment, the ecological condition of some of them is dubious.  For example, approximately 50% of the field margins and field boundaries surveyed were in poor ecological condition.  Therefore, retention alone will not secure the long-term future of these habitats - the development of appropriate management regimes is also necessary.<br />The land sparing approach may seem like an attractive proposition as we seek to achieve the targets outlined in Food Harvest 2020.  This approach involves certain areas of the country being maximally intensified while other areas, which might be less amenable to intensification due to soil type, etc., are used to make up for the loss in habitats and associated biodiversity.  Ecosystem services take place at different scales.  We know that organic matter breakdown, nutrient cycling, etc., are necessary at the field scale.  Therefore, it follows that the biodiversity necessary to facilitate these processes must also be present at field scale.  While a degree of intensification and expansion will inevitably take place, it will be necessary to manage this process so that both production and biodiversity objectives can be met.  This is known as the land sharing approach.  In some cases - the dairy sector, for example - a degree of land use intensification and associated habitat removal relative to other sectors has already taken place.  The restoration of biodiversity may be important in these instances.<br />The next slide indicates that we have a good degree of knowledge about some techniques to restore at least some degree of biodiversity within these types of situations.  I refer, for example, to the use of sown field margins.  These techniques can be very effective because they take up a limited proportion of the farm area, and therefore have a minimal impact on productivity, while delivering on biodiversity.  It is important to point out that this knowledge has been gained over a series of postgraduate studies undertaken as part of a long-term experiment that was initially established in 2002.  I refer to this to make the point that research in agro-ecology is a slow process.</p> <p>While results of experimental work are generated in a three or four year PhD, it is longer-term research which provides much more reliable information in terms of persistence of treatment effects.  This is particularly important when we consider the development of measures for inclusion within agri-environment schemes.</p><p> I will now address the issue of resource use efficiency.  Much of the grassland research which has been undertaken in the past 50 years or thereabouts has largely focused on varieties of a couple of species, with perennial ryegrass receiving by far the most attention.  While perennial ryegrass varieties show many desirable agronomic traits, this is a highly nitrophilous species.  Singular reliance on high input grass monocultures is becoming less economically viable and socially acceptable.  The ability to produce high yields of good quality forage, at minimal cost to farmers and with minimal impact on natural resources, is fundamental to the sustainability of future growth in Irish grass-based farming systems.  As the next slide shows, recent research has found that the production potential of multi-species grasslands, which may require comparatively lower levels of nutrient inputs, appears to have been greatly underestimated. </p><p> Our research groups is investigating the yields, quality of forage, biodiversity support value and ensiling value of multi-species versus monoculture swards through a Department funded project known as SmartGrass.  I must stress that the results presented in this slide are extremely preliminary, as they are based on dry matter yields from the first harvest taken from plots in April this year.  However, members will note that the multi-species sward yields are showing potential at this stage.  We will continue to monitor the plots over the next three years to get a handle on how persistent this effect is.  Dr. Murphy will continue the presentation. </p></speech>

Picking up where Dr. Sheridan left off, I will focus more on water quality and, to a lesser extent, greenhouse gases, with more of a focus on more intensive systems in the agricultural sector, in particular, the dairy sector.  As one of the key targets of the Food Harvest 2020 report is a 50% increase in output from this sector and with the milk quota system ending in 2015, the dairy sector deserves particular attention.</p><p>  As the previous contributions from Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency have covered many of the salient points, I will not recap these.  Instead, I will highlight some of the research in which I and my colleagues have been involved that may contribute to the work of the joint committee.</p><p>  I will first introduce a widely used indicator of the environmental performance of a farming system, namely, the nutrient surplus.  If we take the example of nitrogen, this surplus is equal to the import of nitrogen on to the farm in fertilisers and feed, for example, minus the nitrogen export off the farm in, for example, milk, animals and crops.  The remaining nitrogen is the surplus and this will be either stored in the system or lost from the system to the environment.  In the case of nitrogen, most of the surplus can be expected to be lost to the environment.  This loss can have impacts on water quality through eutrophication and on greenhouse gas emissions when it is emitted as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.  Therefore, a lower nitrogen surplus for a farm indicates a lower pressure on the environment and a more sustainable system of production.  There is a double dividend here in that lower surpluses also indicate more efficient use of nitrogen and a potentially more profitable system as nitrogen inputs in feed and fertiliser are one of the main variable input costs on any farm.</p><p>  As part of the INTERREG funded Dairyman project, we examined nitrogen surpluses on 21 intensive Irish dairy farms and compared them to other published work internationally.  The first slide shows this comparison across a number of countries.  The reference to this work is provided at the bottom of the slide.  It is clear that Irish dairy farms - shown on the left of the slide - have relatively low nitrogen surpluses by international standards.  The first bar shown is from some further work I was involved in using data from 195 Irish dairy farms in the national farm survey.  It shows the average surplus for Irish dairy farms at 143 kg of nitrogen per hectare, N/ha.  The results of studies in other countries are also shown.  The figure for Ireland is largely due to the relatively low input systems of dairy production that operate here, which are based mostly on grazed grass.  This low nitrogen surplus is also associated with the relatively low carbon footprint of Irish milk production that was pointed out in a previous submission to the committee by Teagasc.  Lower inputs and more efficient use of nitrogen fertilisers lead to lower surpluses and losses to the environment as the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide or to ground and surface water systems. </p><p>  As I stated, we also studied nitrogen surpluses on a nationally representative sample of 195 Irish dairy farms.  The reference to this work is provided at the bottom of the second slide.  In this figure, we plot milk production per hectare on the horizontal axis against nitrogen surplus on the vertical axis.  Members should bear in mind the average surplus of 143 kg N/ha we saw in the previous slide.  We can see that this average value hides a range extending from less than 50 kg N/ha to more than 400 kg N/ha.  I will highlight a few key points from this figure.  First, if we look at a production level of 10,000 litres of milk per hectare, l/ha, as represented on the blue line on the slide, there is a range from farms operating a surplus of less than 50 kg N/ha to farms operating a surplus of almost 300 kg N/ha.  This gives an idea of the range of variability in our production systems.</p><p>  Second, this also indicates the potential room for improvement within our systems.  What is the farmer with a nitrogen surplus of 50 kg N/ha doing that the farmer with a surplus of 300 kg N/ha is not doing?  Many factors determine the surplus, some of which are beyond the direct control of the farmer.  However, the management of the system is clearly a critical factor.  In that case, what better management practices could be implemented to bring farmer A's nitrogen surplus closer to farmer B's surplus?  Our research needs to identify these  better management practices, our education and advisory services need to disseminate them and our policy framework needs to encourage them and give credit for them in areas such as greenhouse gas inventories, water quality programmes and even product labelling and marketing.</p><p>  Third, in the context of the ending of quotas in 2015 and the Food Harvest 2020 targets for increased dairy production, if we consider a farmer who is currently producing at 5,000 litres of milk per hectare and plans to increase production to 10,000 litres of milk per hectare, we could consider, within the range of observable outcomes for Irish dairy farms, three different scenarios for achieving this increased output.  The first of these, as shown on the second slide, would result in an increased nitrogen surplus.  The second would result in no change in nitrogen surplus, while the third would result in a decrease in nitrogen surplus.  Obviously, the third scenario is the optimal one in terms of the sustainability of the system and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and water quality.  Again, many factors influence the efficiency of nitrogen use and the resulting nitrogen surplus on a farm, some of which are beyond the control of the farmer.  However, a large part of this is down to management.</p><p>  I suggest that metrics such as nitrogen surplus could act as an indicator of the performance of a farm and could be used as management targets for farmers to try to achieve and to compare themselves to the top performers in their sector.  This could be done in the context of farmer discussion groups, for example, in a similar way to the agronomic indicators such as herd economic breeding indexes, EBI, are done at the moment.</p> <p>This approach was indicated in the previous Teagasc submission to this committee.  Metrics such as this also have potential to be incorporated into more integrated measures of sustainability that could form the basis of some certification and product labelling that could allow Ireland to capitalise on the relatively low environmental footprint of its dairy production system.</p><p> The third slide deals with the fate of nitrogen and phosphorous on farms.  Whether these result in greenhouse gas emissions or losses to water is dependent not just on management but on biophysical conditions.  To illustrate this, I will show some results from the agricultural catchments programme.  The reference to this work is provided at the bottom of the slide.  This was a research programme in which I was involved and which was based primarily at Teagasc and funded by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In this case, we compared two catchments dominated by arable farming.  The catchments are instrumented to monitor nutrient loss in the stream draining the catchment.  Under the nitrate regulations, soil phosphorous concentrations are divided into four indices.</p><p> As can be seen on the slide, index 4 is considered excessive and a potential risk for phosphorous loss to water.  The two catchments have similar proportions of soils in index 4, indicating a similar level of pressure for phosphorous loss to water, from soils at least.  We might expect in that case that they might have a similar outcome in terms of phosphorous loss to water.  However, the result is that over the period monitored, the losses from one catchment were much higher than the other, roughly three times higher.  What we found was that the principal apparent reason for this difference was that one catchment had predominantly well-drained soils while the other had predominantly poorly drained soils.  The pie chart displays this result and indicates the area distribution of the different soil types and their drainage characteristics.</p><p> The catchment with the more poorly drained soils is more prone to generating overland flow run-off and this makes it more vulnerable to phosphorous loss, particularly during heavy rain events.  This illustrates, and this is the reason I am showing this, the fact that biophysical conditions need to be accounted for and that one size does not fit all in terms of identifying better management practices to reduce emissions to air or water.  The suite of better management practices that might be most effective may vary depending on factors such as soil type, climate and topography.</p><p> On the pressing question of whether the Food Harvest 2020 targets as well as Ireland's commitments on greenhouse gas emissions and water quality can be met, I would suggest that, in principle, they can.  However, I would emphasise that this is only in principle.  These targets pose a significant challenge to agriculture and other sectors of the economy and I would not under-emphasise these challenges.  I would argue that management will be key to determining whether these targets can be achieved.  In this, I refer to both the optimisation of land use at the catchment or landscape scale and also soil and nutrient management, which occurs more at farm level.  The correct better management practices need to be identified and implemented.  Ultimately, management on the farm determines the fate of nutrients, whether they are taken up in crops and animals or lost to the environment with a resultant impact.</p><p> Effective policy, therefore, needs to encourage better management practices that are effective at this scale.  Already, the national action programme and the nitrates regulations target nutrient losses to water from farms, but there may be further scope for development of more integrated catchment or landscape management approaches addressing the full range of ecosystem services, land uses and stakeholders.  I would argue that advisory, education and knowledge transfer will also be critical.  Initiatives such as the Teagasc Better Farms, discussion groups and the SmartFarm programme point at innovative ways to encourage adoption of better management practices.</p><p> It is important that Ireland and the agricultural sector are able to get credit for improvements that are made - in greenhouse gas inventories and product labelling, for example.  Emissions estimates, whether for greenhouse gases or emissions to water based on simple measures of intensity, can be misleading.  Further work is required in this area.  In terms of identifying suitable best management practices for different production systems and biophysical conditions, one size does not fit all.  Future policies may need to be more flexible in this regard.</p></speech>

We should give more recognition to what is going on in the universities.  I have been arguing for some time that as part of our new REPS, GLAS and GLAS+, we should have a greenhouse gas emissions inventory.  We should be measuring the greenhouse gas footprint of farms now.  I would like to have a copy of the slides describing best management practices, if possible.  They show how farmers can get increased yields without necessarily increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to start somewhere.  If each farm has a management programme, this will help farmers get in the right frame of mind on this.  Fertilisers have become incredibly expensive.  We must try to persuade the Minister to look at this and to give farmers the extra moneys GLAS+ will bring for doing something which will have major benefits down the road for the reasons the witnesses have given.</p><p>  In regard to phosphorous, I was always of the opinion that it was reasonably immobile in soil.  Is Dr. Murphy suggesting that when a farmer spreads phosphorous, it is washed on and pellets go into the stream?  The problem we have with phosphorous when spreading it is that it binds up and we find it difficult to get it into the plants.  Now we are using a chemical called phosphite to try to promote root growth in the autumn.  Has Dr. Murphy any recommendations in that regard?  Often when we put in our P and K in the autumn if it is dry, we are afraid it might get bound up in soil.  When Dr. Murphy spoke about poorly drained soils was he talking about clay soils?  Most tillage is on reasonably good ground.  Will he elaborate a little on this?</p></speech>

I was just being flippant.  In regard to the chart showing this April's yields, is there a question in regard to sustainability?  Rye grasses are known to be fairly resilient generally, but one of the rye grasses is described as having a yield of 90,000 per hectare.  This is quite low.  I presume the reference is to chemical fertiliser rather than organic.  In general, the yields are significantly better.  I presume there are some timing issues with regard to when the grass becomes available in the grazing season and the length of it.  If the figures given transpire to be true, this will obviously have a huge impact on us meeting our targets in regard to the nitrates directive.  Also, do the other mixtures incorporate other species, such as red clover?  What are the simple and complex mixtures normally - the six species and the nine species?  Dr. Murphy may now give Deputy Barry the advice he wants.</p></speech>

Phosphorus is strongly bound in soils and for decades it was considered that phosphorus was not lost to water.  The issue with phosphorus and water quality arises because although the quantities of phosphorus lost in the run-off of a field are rather small relative to the total amount of phosphorus the farmer is applying, the receiving water systems are very sensitive to even small concentrations.  This is why when the farmer applies phosphorus it can and will get bound in the soil.</p><p>  Let us consider the loss rates in the graph before the committee.  The rates in kilogrammes per hectare are all well below 1 kg per hectare whereas a farmer could be applying 14 kg or 15 kg of phosphorus per hectare per year.  Agronomically, it is not a loss to the farmer and he will not notice it but the impact is material.  Surface water systems in particular are rather sensitive to phosphorus loss.  That is the reason for it.</p><p>  The classification of soils into poorly-drained and well-drained soils is sometimes related to clay content.  The heavy clay-rich soils in some parts of the country mean that these soils are predominately poorly drained.  However, it can be due more to the landscape position and whether the water table is close to the surface as well.  It is not the case that only heavy clay soils are poorly drained.  It can also be the landscape position.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

That is referred to at least three times.  This goes back to what Dr. Sheridan said earlier about biodiversity.  Apart from anything else we have a higher percentage if we simply ensure it happens.</p><p>  Dr. Sheridan made an interesting point about some of the existing hedgerows being in poor repair.  After four rural environment protection schemes and two agri-environment options schemes and all the resulting hedgerows that were built I am surprised at that.  Perhaps Dr. Sheridan can offer an observation.</p></speech>

We chose three functional groups of species with similar traits: three grass species, namely, perennial ryegrass, cocksfoot and Timothy; three leguminous species, namely, white clover, red clover and birdsfoot trefoil; and three herb species in the maximally diverse or nine species group, namely, ribwort plantain, chicory and yarrow.  We do not know a great deal about grass availability during the year but we chose each of these species and we had three varieties of each species included in the mix, where possible.  We have tried to get as broad a spectrum as possible with these varieties in terms of early, mid and late season yielding varieties.  Time will tell.  One of the main issues for us is the need to examine the digestibility and nutritional value of this forage for animals and that is something we will be examining.  It is not enough to produce more, it must be of a suitable quality.</p></speech>

In the ecologically focused areas we have many hedgerows but they are more the butt of a ditch than anything else.  At the moment we are not allowed to do much to poorly formed hedgerows containing only a few alders.  These are not even hedgerows and they do not block cattle and so on.  Is Dr. Sheridan suggesting we should go back and try to renew them by planting whitethorns and blackthorns and make them functioning ditches?  Would that increase their biodiversity or make them more valuable?</p></speech>

They have been in place and they have done a good deal.  However, participation in the schemes was not mandatory; farmers did not have to go into them.  The work we undertook was across the board and not necessarily on farms involved in agri-environment schemes.</p><p>  Reference was made to the quality of the hedgerows.  If we are going to extend their lifespan then we have to intervene because hedgerows have a limited lifespan if we do not intervene.  This may involved coppicing, implanting etc.  The decision will be on whether we do that or whether we base a marketing campaign around having all of these habitats in place.  If we do that, then we must ensure the habitats included in any marketing campaign are of good ecological quality and not simply dying-out gappy hedgerows.</p></speech>

The boundary ditch could have been in a terrible mess and good farming practice would suggest striping it down and plant a proper hedge in its place which could be managed subsequently.  Many boundary hedges are simply scrub, weeds and bushes but not proper hedges.  However, if a farmer touched his boundary fence he would have been prosecuted under the REPS.  I always took the view that we should have examined this.  Generally, farmers can see the practicality of having a proper hedge which increases biodiversity and so on.  Anyway, we need to examine it more closely.</p></speech>

It was because they were too wide and not really functioning.  Let us reflect on the two presentations.  There is some ongoing work in the trialling but by 2015 or 2016 we will have a better idea.  The same applies in the Bord na M&oacute;na case with regard to the ecological reinstatement and its value from the point of view of carbon sequestration.  The company is unsure whether it can reinstate it.  We are in the same position with the long-term efficiency of grass and amending or changing the traditional method of grass production.</p><p>  I thank both deputations for coming in.  It is clear that there is a good deal of work under way and many areas of expertise from organisations.  We are trying to bring a central focus to it in order that we can present something to the Commission.  The idea is to present Ireland's case and have it bound up, pulling together all the research and trialling that is under way and to put all the arguments together.  The research service in the House has been helping us.  This has been very useful.  There are three farmers left in the meeting and therefore it has probably been more technical in nature than many of our presentations.  The two Senators who are farmers were unable to remain but that is not to say we are not interested.  This is most useful.  The final slide, which is still before the committee, is the case for the defence.  In a way it summarises how this is manageable and how we can make the case.  It is important that we try to hone in on the principles in that summary slide as the backbone and what we are trying to build around it.  For that, I thank you.</p></speech>

COM (2014) 186 is a proposal for a regulation on personal protective equipment.  The proposal will replace existing law and align it with the new legislative framework.  The Department is in favour of the proposal which will assist operators and ensure consistency in standards for products across the European Union.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2014) 212 is a proposal for a directive on single member private limited liability companies.  The proposal will replace existing EU legislation.  It seeks to address problems that European SMEs face in accessing the Single Market by making it easier and less costly for them to establish subsidiaries in other member states by adopting a common template for rules across the European Union to be adopted within a member state's national law.</p><p>  COM (2014) 213 is connected with COM (2014) 212.  It is a proposal for a directive amending existing law in the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement and certain elements of the corporate governance statement.  It will amend the shareholders rights directive and aims to enhance corporate governance in listed European companies with new transparency obligations and by increasing shareholder engagement in governance issues.</p><p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation welcomes the intention of these proposals and has no objections on the grounds of subsidiarity.  As it has yet to form definitive views on the proposals and will engage in public consultation to inform its negotiating position, it is proposed that they warrant further scrutiny by the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2014) 221 is a proposal to establish a European platform to enhance co-operation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work.  The draft decision will provide a formal mechanism at EU level to strengthen cross-border co-operation on undeclared work.  The proposed EU platform has the objectives of improving co-operation, strengthening technical capacity and encouraging member states to address the issue of undeclared work.  It is agreed that the proposal warrants further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I wish to speak to the proposal which I believe infringes on the area of subsidiarity.  It could allow the European Union to stray into areas such as social welfare and taxation which are competencies we need to maintain here.  The issue of undeclared work is very important.  However, it is probably best dealt with on a national basis, unless there are data and evidence that show there is a transnational element to it.  Without that information which we do not yet have, we should engage in further scrutiny.  Perhaps we might invite the Department in to explain its position.</p></speech>

ISME is the independent body that represents small and medium enterprises throughout Ireland.  As members know, it is not funded by banks either through membership or sponsorship, which is an important fact when one talks to representative bodies  Compared with larger companies which have options, small and medium businesses have always faced great difficulties in accessing credit on a non-punitive basis.  Even the Governor of the Central Bank has made the same point a number of times recently.  It is clear that banks are primarily interested in lending to safe SMEs, whereas the real difficulties in the current environment are faced by SMEs that are not what we would call safe in the eyes of banks.  There is strong evidence that the number of refusals is higher in Ireland than in other eurozone countries.  I would like to address in the short time allotted to me a number of issues relating to refusal rates on the part of banks, late payments in commercial transactions which create a need to go to banks to raise funding, the training of small and medium business owners, personal guarantees and the conditionality of loans, alternative sources of finance, peer to peer lending, asset bank lending, private investment and a third banking force.</p><p>  I will commence by nailing down the fact that access to finance has been difficult, despite what members will have heard from different people.  The most up-to-date Central Bank statistics for money and banking, dated March 2014, indicate that lending to Irish non-financial corporations showed a year to year decline of 6.1% in March, following an annual decrease of 5.8% in February.  All categories of loans recorded a decline over the year.  This represents the 16th consecutive monthly decline in lending.  Also, the headline from the CSO's access to finance survey that compared the 2007 figures with those for 2010 reads, "Successful loan applications dropped from 90% in 2007 to 50% in 2010".</p> <p>The ISME Bank Watch survey figures confirm higher refusal rates than the banks admit to.  The figures are at variance in a number of areas.  ISME has been carrying out periodic Bank Watch surveys since 1993.  Never, even in the heady and crazy days of 2004 to 2008, did we see a success rate of more than 82%.  The average refusal rate throughout the 1990s and up to May 2008 was 20%, a figure never disputed by the banks in those days.  In November 2008, the refusal rate jumped to 57% and has fluctuated around the 50% since then. Currently, the refusal rate is at 54%.  Much is made of the banks' assertions of 90% of credit applications being granted - by definition, a refusal rate of 10%.  We need to know what constitutes a credit refusal.  To an owner-manager, a refusal is very plain in that they do not get the credit requested.  From the bank&rsquo;s perspective, they talk about sanctions and agreement to give credit, whether it is accepted or not.  Initially, the banks count fully completed formal applications.  Being discouraged over the phone or at a meeting is not counted by the bank but is counted by the SME.  A collateral request or any other requirement that the SME cannot fulfil, such as deposits to be placed with the bank, is not counted, but the SME sees it as a refusal.  Where a customer requests &euro;50,000 and the bank offers &euro;20,000, which is useless and which the customer does not take, the bank counts it as a success but the SME sees it as a refusal.  <br />We hear the banks talking about success rate figures of 85% for Bank of Ireland, 92% for AIB and 94% for Ulster Bank.  I quote from a response from AIB to the Securities and Exchange Commission on 31 October 2012.  The Securities and Exchange Commission asked AIB about the 90% credit sanctions, and the response stated:<blockquote>AIB sanctioned 90% of formal credit applications (note: only formal applications captured).  This measurement does not take into account any informal discussions between AIB and SME customers that did not result in formal applications.</blockquote>By its own admission to the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is not counting informal applications.  The first Mazars report on SME lending finds that the banks failed to adequately record the level of SME lending and that they also failed to adequately record all business inquiries for finance.  They could not differentiate between new and existing customer loan applications and between requests for overdrafts and requests for term loans.  When those representing the bailed-out banks talk about figures of 84%, 93% and 92%, they are counting fully completed formal applications.  They are not counting all applications.  They are guilty of what Churchill called terminological inexactitude.<br />ISME carries out the Bank Watch survey every quarter; the latest was carried out at the end of February.  I will not go through all the figures.  The response rate was 9.5%, with 924 owner-managers responding.  Fifty-four percent of SMEs that had applied for funding from banks in the three months to the end of February were refused credit by the banks, a deterioration from the 50% refusal rate in the previous quarter.  We hear from the banks that demand for credit has decreased, but in that quarter, 39% of respondents had requested additional or new bank funding, an increase from 37% in the previous quarter.  The requests have increased rather than decreased.  A reduction in overdraft was demanded of 35% of SMEs.  This is an increase from 28% in the previous quarter.  Not only are the banks refusing requests, they are demanding reductions in existing overdraft facilities.  Seventy-eight percent of owner-managers were in favour of an alternative strategic investment bank.  Of course they would be if they are being refused at a rate of 54%.<br />Late payments in commercial transactions is a major issue for small businesses.  Some small businesses act as banks by extending trade credit to companies turned down by banks.  That leads me to the issue of late payments, which has a bearing on access to finance.  If businesses were paid on time, their need for finance would reduce dramatically.  I will not dwell on the topic but I ask the committee, which is very busy, to examine the situation in which small and medium-sized enterprises are waiting an average of 60 days to be paid, despite prompt payment legislation introduced in 2002.  The legislation has not worked.  I will leave that matter to the committee.  If we are waiting an average of 60 days beyond the credit period, it means we must go to our banks to get funding.<br />With regard to training, I listen to the banks and some of their cheerleaders in other organisations talking about the lack of expertise of SMEs when it comes to the presentation of a case for credit.  Time and again, the lack of expertise in putting a plan together is used as an excuse by the banks.  I am the first to promote and advocate for management training for SME owners, which is important, but it is much too easy to blame the shortcomings of an SME because it lets the banks off the hook.  I have been working with SMEs since the 1970s and have been assisting them with loan and credit applications for 40 years.  In the 70s, 80s and 90s, small business owners were successfully getting credit from banks at a rate of eight loan applications out of ten.  How is it that, in the six years since 2008, the calibre and abilities of these same SME owners have deteriorated so drastically?  Have we suddenly come across a generation of people who cannot count?  The truth is that it is not so much the ability of the SME that has deteriorated but the calibre of yellow-pack relationship managers in banks who, between them, cannot read a set of figures, are frightened by the word &quot;risk&quot; and are scared to make a lending decision for fear of career reprisal.  In addition, their ability to act as advocates for SMEs when decisions are pushed upstairs is abysmal due to a combination of ignorance, fear and career protection.  In 2009 we pointed out the lack of expertise in the banking sector, to be met with the usual denials from the banks.  Now we hear they are training their staff - better late than never.  The Skillnets ManagementWorks initiative is currently advertising a training programme entitled &quot;Building Financial Capabilities of SMEs&quot; to upskill owner managers in basic finance.  ISME recommends this initiative as part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to get credit moving.  While it is not the be-all and end-all, it is an important initiative and we commend it.<br />The conditionality surrounding the securing of loans is a cause for concern.  Since 2003, the incidence of demands for personal guarantees against loans has increased from 51% to 72%.  Many of these personal guarantees and conditions are worth twice the amount of the loan.  This negates the banks&rsquo; argument that high rates are derived from the risk involved.  Another major issue is the discussion about the family home being used as collateral.  Recent surveys show the family home was brought into discussions in 15% of cases, while banks asked for the family home as collateral in 11% of cases.  That is another worrying trend, and there also a growth in the retention of personal guarantees and collateral deeds by banks after the loans have been finally paid.<br />Alternative sources of finance to traditional bank lending for SMEs have increased in importance in Ireland and across Europe since the economic crisis began.</p> <p>This increase in importance was not a natural progression; rather, it has arisen out of necessity, as bank loans became more difficult to acquire due to the unwillingness of banks to lend.  Start-ups are finding it especially difficult to obtain traditional bank lending as they lack the essential criteria such as cashflow, history and collateral.  </p><p> In the alternative area I see the Government playing a part.  It has introduced a range of measures which are intended to correct market shortcomings.  The microenterprise loan fund and the credit guarantee scheme have yet to prove themselves, while the Credit Review Office, after a shaky start, is having some effect, but needs more promotion.  The tax incentives of employment incentive and investment scheme and the seed capital scheme are not working sufficiently due to red tape and major constraints.  In fact, the seed capital scheme has been availed of by fewer than 66 businesses in the past year, which is disastrous.  The development capital scheme, Innovation Fund Ireland and the National Pension Reserve Fund all are aimed at the medium and large business sector and are having an effect but, again, at the higher end. </p><p> Alternative financing activities such as crowd-funding, peer-to-peer lending and invoice trading have emerged as a significant funding mechanism and source of capital, especially in the UK in recent years.  Meeting the capital needs of both individuals and businesses and facilitating fundraising activities for civic projects and social causes, alternative finance intermediaries have become online marketplaces where individuals, rather than institutions, work collaboratively to form capital.  It is having an effect.  However, little information is available regarding the overall size of the finance market.  While there has been some industry reporting by for-profit organisations on crowd-funding, there is very little independent, reliable, academic research.  We see that as a way of getting funding into SMEs and we would certainly promote it.  The initial success of linked finance bodes well for peer-to-peer lending initiatives in Ireland.  The boost that the UK Government gave to the sector by investing directly into it is encouraging.  We would recommend similar investment in the Irish sector.</p><p> The arrival and revival of some finance houses in the asset-backed arena is encouraging.  Old fashioned leasing and hire-purchase finance together with invoice discounting and factoring have begun to gain a foothold in the finance space.  Again, this is badly needed, and we have a long way to go.  </p><p> The success of the SSIA scheme shows how Irish people can be incentivised to save or invest their money in certain ways.  Currently there is more than &euro;90 billion in personal savings lying in deposit accounts earning negligible returns.  If just a small proportion of this total were invested into Irish SMEs, the results could be transformative in terms of jobs and wealth creation as well as in the overall economy.  If savers were allowed to invest in an account which would be lent to or invested in SMEs and get tax relief for it in the way that EIIS investors do, this could divert billions of euro in funding into the sector at effectively no direct cost to the State.  Alternatively, tax relief could be allowed on the interest earned up to a maximum of, say, &euro;10,000.  This is open for discussion and everybody would win under such a scheme.  Savers would potentially get a far better return, SMEs would benefit through a new line of funding, the need for bank lending would be reduced at a time when they are deleveraging and the country would benefit through job creation and an overall boost to the economy.  Obviously, savers would have to understand that there would always be a risk associated with this, but they would at least have the cushion of the tax relief to mitigate that.  With certain constraints similar to those already in play in peer-to-peer lending, such as maximum loans and maximum individual lending, it should be a quick due diligence procedure to establish that the proposal is reasonably sound and that the facts contained in the documentation are correct.  This could be administered through a third banking force or a banking fund.  On that issue, we propose the establishment of a State-sponsored SME development fund or third bank to support the recovery of the economy by providing the funding and finance services needed by businesses, particularly Irish-owned SMEs.  Specifically, the fund could focus on providing loans and trade finances to Irish businesses to meet the gaps in the banking market, support the development of SMEs, support exports, support the many IBRC and Danske Bank customers in refinancing their loans, and support growth sectors using a system of funding based more on future cashflow than the quality of the promoter.  This is preferable to being over-reliant on property and collateral. </p><p> Irish small and medium-sized businesses are significantly more reliant on bank overdrafts and short-term debt - in the region of 60% - than their counterparts in the 28 EU states, where the rate is approximately 39%.  This reliance has led to financial fragility, especially when the banking system has let us down and the length of debtor days is extended.  It is, therefore, important that alternative sources of finance and alternative methods of financing are encouraged.  In essence, as well as right-sizing their businesses, small and medium-size businesses have to begin to right-size their finances.  In the short to medium term, Irish small and medium-sized businesses are stuck with a small number of banks, and the responsibility falls on Government, through the Central Bank, to oversee and regulate the bailed out banks that remain.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  Our association will co-operate with the committee in whatever way it decides to advance the solutions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Fielding for all his work in this area.  In recent years there have been quite divergent messages from various groups regarding the experience on the ground among SMEs as they try to access credit.  As elected representatives, we hear a message very similar to that heard by the witness, but obviously a large array of organisations are trying to give us a far different message.  Access to credit and loans is an important issue at this juncture.  What is the witness's experience of debt distress among his members?  How much of a dampening effect is it having on the economy in general?  What is the personal experience of those people who experience that debt distress?  The representatives of some of the banks that appeared before the committee said they were trying to nurse some of those in debt distress back to health by separating out their toxic loans from their functioning businesses.  What is the experience of the witness in that area?</p><p>  I commend the Government on its efforts to create other strands of credit.  In the main, these have not been functioning successfully.  Mr. Fielding mentioned the Credit Review Office and its dodgy start and the fact that the numbers seeking credit through the microfinance credit guarantee are low.  Why are these not being used?  He also referred to the red tape around seed capital.  Perhaps he would say a little more about that issue.  Is the cost of credit having an effect on his membership?  Perhaps I can pose a few other questions later.</p></speech>

In regard to small and medium-sized businesses being in distress, speaking in Tralee last year, Ms Malone from the Central Bank mentioned SME lending of &euro;57 billion, while the word "distress" was used in the same sentence.  Of the &euro;57 billion loaned to SMEs, about &euro;32 billion is construction and development related and about &euro;25 billion is normal SME lending, for want of a better expression.</p> <p>We all know the difficulties in the construction and development sector, but let us consider the &euro;25 billion figure associated with it.  I imagine the norm for distressed figures is somewhere in the region of 30%.  I am referring to what the banks would regard as in being distress, in other words, beyond 90 days due.</p><p> Reference was made to the banks working with SMEs.  There was a major issue when this problem arose initially in late 2008 in the case of small businesses which were keen to be sorted out, having overextended during the heady days of 2004, when credit was being thrown at them like snuff at a wake.  They could not find people within the banks to talk to them because the expertise was not available.  We took numerous calls on the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association's helpline from people involved in SMEs who expressed frustration and asked where they could get someone to talk to them at that level.  That persisted for a long time.  Certainly the banks have now started to do far more and there is less of the pretend-and-extend than in the past.  In fact, it was mainly pretending, rather than extending.  We have found that, in the main, the banks are grappling well with the debt overhang.  The difficulty was in trying to separate the non-core assets on the balance sheet of a business from the others.  They were non-core, but they were non-performing aksi.  The difficulty was in finding a way to deal with the core business that was, perhaps, employing 15 or 20 people and that was feasible, albeit vulnerable for several reasons.  One of the reasons was the over-extension on borrowings, but such businesses were also vulnerable because of the economic situation in which we ended up.  It was something of a struggle to get the banks to get their heads around the fact that the lending was not part of the core business, as such, and that a given portion would have to be warehoused or have something else done with it.  That is happening, although I cannot honestly tell the Deputy how fast it is going.  I must accept what the banks state about the number of people they have put into that area.  Initially it was slow, but they are certainly working on it.</p><p> Reference was made to Government initiatives and the Credit Review Office, in particular, but the figures are rather small.  The Deputy is correct to suggest it is difficult to get businesses to bring their cases to the CRO.  There is a certain fatigue also in that a person running a firm may go to a bank and eventually receive a refusal.  I say "eventually" because I have seen the list of excuses used by the banks about which we have heard from our members.  One of the major excuses is constructive refusal in the sense that the banks simply drag out the decision until the need for the funding is nearly gone.  That is taking place with the internal appeals procedures in the banks and then firms come back and start again and have to go through another appeals procedure.  All of this is rather difficult for small and medium businesses.</p><p> The credit guarantee scheme was simply not being mentioned by the banks in many cases.  The idea was that the bank would bring a firm to the credit guarantee scheme; it was not for the SME to ask for this.  If a business was refused on the grounds of collateral, the bank was supposed to follow that route.  We found that many of the banks did not do so because it involved increasing their exposure to the SME in question.  That was another difficulty.</p><p> Recently, we made a submission to the Department of Finance on the employment investment incentive and seed capital schemes in an attempt to make them far more user-friendly, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.  A large business can use the seed capital scheme easily, but smaller businesses have been finding it rather difficult to do so.</p><p> Reference was made to the cost of credit.  I will be shot for saying this, but it is not a big issue.  The reason it is not a big issue is that many SMEs remember a time when the cost of credit was 19% or 20% and they were still able to get by because that is what a business does.  It is simply another cost.  Having said that, let us compare the cost of credit in Ireland for SMEs as against that for large businesses.  The gap is expanding year on year.  Each year we see the gap in the cost of credit to a large business as against a small business extending.  Let us consider the cost of credit in Ireland for SMEs as against the cost of credit for SMEs throughout Europe.  Again, the gap is increasing all the time.  That remains an issue for us.  Another problem is that there are so few banks which meant that there is not as much competition as we would like because of the exit of many banks.</p></speech>

I am keen for him to tell us something about the State-sponsored development fund or SME bank.  How does he see it coming about?  What will happen to it and how will it work?</p><p>  I have a certain amount of sympathy for banks which turn people down.  Because we own the banks we must ensure they stay in business and do not end up losing it.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for someone who wishes to ensure the banks pay for themselves, especially since we own them; therefore, we should ensure they stay in business.  My experience has been that many of the applications made by smaller businesses were less than professional.  I am pleased to hear from Mr. Fielding that ISME is now holding their hands, teaching them and showing them how to handle the matter.  I was jolted by the figure provided by him.  He said the refusal rate used to be between 18% and 20% but that it had jumped to 54%.  What is the reason for this?  Can the banks give ISME any reason for it?</p><p>  Has there been any success with crowd funding?  The committee was visited by LinkedFinance, an organisation with which I am involved to a small extent.  I have been impressed by the whole concept of crowd funding elsewhere.

We know that one of the main objectives of the Government is to secure a financial system for deposits and the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.  The Irish banking system, as it stands in early 2014, is not fit for purpose.  There is a need for a new and active relevant actor in the business credit area.  We have a proposal on the establishment of a State-sponsored SME development fund to support the recovery of the economy.  This would work by providing the funding firms are not obtaining in the quantities they require from the existing actors, that is, the two pillar banks and Ulster Bank.  At issue are proposals for future development rather than rescue funds or bailing out firms.  These are proposals for future-proofing many small businesses.  We hope the fund will focus on providing loans and trade finance for Irish businesses.</p> <p>This would serve to meet the gaps in the market, support the development of SMEs, support export growth and look after the many business owners, including IBRC and Danske customers, who are obliged to refinance their loans.</p><p> The main objective of such a fund would be to create Irish wealth which would ultimately create jobs.  To that end, it would restrict its activities to the SME wealth creating sector.  Subject to the approval of the Department of Finance, we estimate that the fund would initially require in the region of &euro;500 million.  As I mentioned, we are finding that many SMEs depend too much on short-term funding.  The development fund, on the other hand, would concentrate on repayment periods of up to 20 years, with the possibility of securing fixed interest rates.  It would be an instrument of economic policy, majority-owned by the Government and controlled by it.  It would offer something similar to what ICC Bank did in the past.  Unfortunately, that level of expertise is not as prevalent in the existing banks as it should be, as we keep hearing from entrepreneurs who are talking to their lenders.</p><p> In terms of having sympathy for the banks, I, too, have sympathy for them.  However, in the surveys we conducted people whose loan applications had been refused gave examples of lenders making the conditions for lending unjustifiably hard such as seeking guarantees of &euro;800,000 for a &euro;60,000 loan or not accepting a &euro;550,000 security against a &euro;100,000 loan.  There were instances of repayment capacity being calculated on previous years' cash flow, even though the loan was being sought to purchase stock to fill new orders which would double previous years' turnover.  I have more than 100 examples of where the banks did not have the ability to read the proposals put to them.</p><p> I accept the point that some SME owners - I would not say the majority - have not done themselves any favour by going in with half-baked proposals.  However, I have been dealing with people involved in the sector since the early 1970s and they have not suddenly become numerically illiterate.  That argument is being used as an excuse for not giving loans to small businesses.  The vast majority of SME owners will have asked their accountant to go over the figures before approaching the bank.  There has been no dramatic increase in the numbers going in unprepared and I refuse to accept the banks banging on all the time about SME owners needing to be trained, offering a day-long course to bring them up to the level of an accountant and so on.  That is not required.  A small business owner running a retail outlet does not need to be an accountant.  He or she needs to understand figures, of course, and, in reality, the vast majority of SME owner-managers understand their business and from their till roll and cheque book how the business is doing.</p><p> The difficulty at this time is that there is not the same capacity for engagement when small business owners approach their bank manager.  There was a time when the bank manager put one through one's paces.  He or she was able to read the figures, tell the business owner how good or bad the proposal was and, if necessary, send the applicant off with a flea in the ear and an instruction to return when the proposal was drawn up properly.  Now owners go in and meet a blank face, a person who would not know a balance sheet or a profit and loss account from a kick up the transom.  The business person is simply told the proposal will be sent upstairs and examined.  In the past, by contrast, SME owners, even those who were not using financial advisers and accountants, were still able to get some leverage with the banks because the expertise was available.  The expertise is not available as much as it should be.</p><p> On crowd funding, we certainly are more than supportive of peer-to-peer lending and Linked Finance.  We understand another organisation is just about to come on board, to which we say the more the merrier.  In the United Kingdom in 2011 &pound;26.7 million was made available through alternative finance and peer-to-peer lending.  Last year that figure had risen to &pound;332 million, an increase of 254%.  Just over 5,000 SMEs have raised funding through peer-to-peer lending in the United Kingdom in the past three years, with the total jumping from 550 in 2011 to 3,706 last year.  That large jump between 2011 and 2013 was facilitated by the decision by the UK Government to encourage and support peer-to-peer lending.  It gave an immediate boost in confidence to people lending into the market.</p></speech>

Representatives of the various banks have appeared before the joint committee in recent weeks to discuss this topic.  In moving back and forth between the banks and the ISME on the figures for lending rates and refusals, I asked the bank representatives whether there was a need for independent verification of the data.  What is Mr. Fielding's view in this regard?  Is there a standard methodology that could be put in place?  I am not in any way casting doubt on his data, but a figure of 924 responses from SME owner-mangers equates to a response rate of 9.5%.  Is he concerned about the low response rate in reference to the accuracy of the statistics?  Is there a need to take account of the possibility that those who are annoyed with their bank because their loan application was refused are more likely to respond to such surveys than they would be if everything was wonderful?</p><p>  Is Mr. Fielding satisfied with the resources available to the Credit Review Office in the context of the work it has to do?  He has mentioned that 65% of SME owners have heard of the office.  When this issue was raised with the delegates from the banks, they observed that a significant proportion of the businesses in respect of which loan refusals had been overturned by the CRO failed within a period of time.  Their view was that they were doing everything right and proper in this regard.</p><p>  Mr. Fielding referred to increased competition and his experience of the banking sector from the 1970s through the 1990s.  Is it his view that there was a more intimate relationship between bank managers and their clients in the past and that such engagements have become more impersonal as the country grows?  He referred to the importance of managers having a feel for the likely success or otherwise of a new business.  Is he saying a decline in that type of expertise might account for some of the increase in the number of refusals?</p></speech>

It would be easier for us to stand over what Mr. Fielding is saying versus what the banks are stating if there were more data available in this regard.  I am conscious that if an SME owner is not hopeful of securing a credit line, he or she will probably not bother to apply for it.  However, it would help us to get a better picture of what is happening if the numbers submitting a formal application were higher.  That would assist us in putting all of the figures presented, whether by banks or any other business group, to the test.</p></speech>

They either were or they were not - it was a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer.  We also inquired of those who were in the market, whether they applied.  Again, the answer was a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer.  The final question we asked of those who applied related to whether they were successful.  I cannot make it any clearer than that.<br />The response rate of 9.5% or whatever is actually very good when one considers it.  We agree that there is a bias in our statistics.  That bias has been present since 1993.  The banks never queried the refusal rate right up to 2008, when it stood at something in the region of 20%.  There was a bias in that regard as well because someone who had been refused was more likely to complete a questionnaire.  The same bias exists at present.  However, the fact that the refusal rate increased from 20% to 57% was not suddenly down to there being more SMEs.  From that point of view, I would be extremely careful but, while admitting that there is a certain amount of bias, we will certainly stand over our figures.  When the CSO compared the position for 2007 to that for 2011, it discovered that the figure dropped from 90% to 50%.  In the context of the refusal rate, therefore, the answer the banks give depends on who is asking the question.  I think the SEC frightened the living daylights out of them when it requested a breakdown in respect of the 90% figure.  In that context, I quote from my submission, which states &quot;AIB sanctioned 90% of formal credit applications (note: only formal applications captured).&quot;  AIB is actually stating here that it has not been counting.<br />For the past three or four years we have encouraged ISME members to make formal applications.  Before I came here today, I received a phone call from one of our members who informed me - again, this would be fairly common - that his bank had refused to accept a formal application.  He was told that he should put something down on paper and then informed not to do so.  That is happening time and again.  The person to whom I spoke represents a good number of businesses.  The banks are increasingly refusing to accept formal applications because if they do, their figures will be shown up.<br />The Credit Review Office, CRO, overturns just over 50% of decisions in favour of SMEs.  We would expect that to happen.  One of the banks has been banging on about 30% of the businesses in respect of which decisions were overturned subsequently failing.  I go with Mr. John Trethowan on this one, namely, that 70% of businesses were successful.  There is always going to be some sort of attrition.  This is not the playground; we are talking here about the business arena and there will be failures and successes.  If the CRO had not stepped in, the failure rate would have been much higher because the businesses involved would not have obtained the money they required.<br />I agree with the Deputy that competition is required.  However, I cannot see many foreign-owned banks arriving in Ireland in the near future.  They may be some room in this regard for the establishment of a development fund or something of that nature.<br />The Deputy inquired as to whether there were more intimate relationships between business owner-managers and bank managers in the 1970s and 1980s.  The answer in that regard is &quot;Yes&quot; but such relationships do not exist now.  There was a flight of expertise out of the banks and the relevant staff were replaced with those I term &quot;yellow packs&quot;, that is, people who just do not know either their business or their customers.  I will not bore the committee by recounting a long story but I will provide an example.  Those involved in precision engineering use lathes to cut metal.  One of our members was brought before a branch manager and informed that the bank in question - I will not say where it is located - would &quot;not be providing funding for the company's latte this year&quot;.  That is a measure of the type of expertise that is currently available.  The staff in question do not go beyond examining the figures.  I am aware of instances where banks will not actually discuss matters with SMEs and are refusing - left, right and centre - to visit their premises in order to gain some knowledge of what their proposals involve.  Perhaps there is a need to accept that the relationships which existed in the past were reminiscent of something from <i>Pollyanna</i>and that there is no way they could obtain in the current climate.  However, one would expect a little more expertise to be available and more face to face engagement to occur.  In one of the local bank branches in Carrick-on-Shannon, two of the tellers have been replaced by plants.  There are difficulties and these have been caused by the fact that the banks have been deleveraging and cutting back on staff numbers.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is ideally placed and I am of the view that it should have responsibility in this regard.  It is, however, difficult to count the number of informal applications made.  If I approach my branch manager at the local GAA club or contact him or her by phone in order to seek a loan and if he or she says "No, don't come near me for the moment", in my view that is a refusal.  This reflects the reality for SMEs at present.  I will be shot for saying so but I have sympathy for the banks because they find it difficult to count instances such as those to which I refer as refusals.  However, they are refusals and they reflect the reality that exists.</p></speech>

The vast majority of our members are SMEs.  To reflect the distinct interests of all our members, we have 60 business associations in IBEC.  Our overall ambition is to work with the Government to help put more people back to work and make Ireland the best country in the world in which to do business.  The IBEC 2014 policy priorities document, Ireland that Works, states our belief that the economy, underpinned and driven by a strong SME community, can grow by an average of 3% to 4% annually during the next 20 years or so.  Access to finance for SMEs in a timely manner is a critical component of achieving that goal.  At the broadest level, SMEs require finance for investment and-or working capital.  The needs of SMEs are far from homogenous and depend on their size, market, product portfolio and, most importantly, stage of development.  It goes without saying the recent economic climate has had a negative impact on many of them.</p><p>  Evidence suggests lending to enterprise has dropped, in part due to Irish banks engaging in the repair of their balance sheets but also due in part to a lack of demand from enterprises as consumer demand fell.  As the economy recovers, so will consumer demand; consequently, the demand from business for working capital to finance expansion of their operations will increase.  A functioning competitive banking model is, therefore, crucial.  However, our reliance on traditional banking is too high by international standards.  We need to provide more options and improve credit flow to business by enhancing tax-based investment schemes, State-backed capital funds and the venture capital environment.  We also need to communicate coherently the finance options open to companies and, very importantly, SMEs need to develop their management and finance skills.</p><p>  I will outline our findings and proposals in more detail before I pass over briefly to my colleagues in the four sectors who will describe their members first-hand experiences.  </p><p>  Irish companies continue to pay relatively high interest rates on bank loans.  In January 2014 non-financial corporations in Ireland had to pay an interest rate on loans up to and including &euro;1 million of 4.8%, one percentage point higher than the eurozone average.  We expect that as the banking sector continues to recover and an improvement in economic conditions reduces the risk associated with business lending, these rates will converge to the eurozone average.</p><p>  Credit conditions for financial enterprises and businesses remain tight.  The Central Bank's lending survey conducted in quarter one of 2014 suggests respondent banks did not lower their credit standards for loans to SMEs.  This means that while some or all of the credit sought by firms may have been obtained, the conditions attached to that credit remain strict.</p><p>  Bank sector knowledge is improving and we welcome the advances made by banks in upskilling their teams to understand the different sector business models.  This needs to continue and intensify.  We believe the banks also have opportunities to develop services to deal with sectoral needs, for example, there is an opportunity for domestic banks to provide much needed funding for their technology clients, secured against the future receipts of research and development tax credits, while access to funding and grants, as is the case in Scotland, would help distilleries in their early years.</p><p>  IBEC has previously identified that a State-backed enterprise or investment bank could usefully fill the gap in the market in financing growth-oriented smaller enterprises and start-up companies.  An enterprise investment bank would provide the certainty of source needed to fund growing and high potential businesses and act as a catalyst to leverage funding from other equity and debt sources.  Investments should be made efficiently without major friction costs by using information already available from existing State agencies and the banking network.  The model of a State-backed enterprise or investment bank is established and used in Canada, the United States and Germany, to mention a few examples.</p><p>  IBEC believes an improved employment, investment and incentive scheme, EIIS, could play a key role in encouraging the development of an alternative funding or investment culture among SMEs and the public.  Budget Statement 2014 began addressing the issue, as the EIIS was removed from the high earner's restriction for a period of three years.  IBEC recommends the following number of additional measures: the EIIS, as currently branded, does not seem to have a clear purpose.  It is IBEC's continuing position that the scheme should be rebranded to make its purpose clear, that is, investing in Irish SMEs.  We need to drop the employment or research and development restrictions under the EIIS.  The purpose of the scheme has been confused by the inclusion of the employment growth and research and development spend restriction.  IBEC recommends that the restriction be lifted, with a 30% upfront payment and an 11% payment over a three year period, regardless of how the funding is allocated.  We also need to target non-traditional investors.  The rebranded scheme would benefit from greater marketing and promotion to help smaller investors to become aware of the opportunities involved and allow them to easily find enterprises in which to invest.  We need to reduce overall risk.  Non-traditional investors have a different risk profile from the typical cohort or seasoned BES-EIIS investors and are currently not sufficiently encouraged to make investments in SMEs owing to relatively low value returns and a relatively high investment risk.  In other European countries a number of methods, including guarantees against a proportion of losses, have been successfully used to promote investment schemes similar to the EIIS.</p><p>  The take-up of the seed capital scheme has fallen in value terms in recent years.  The scheme is likely to expand in size as the economy recovers, but growth will be limited unless a number of issues are addressed.  Information on entitlements under the scheme is not reaching individuals starting a new company and should be prioritised through the new LEO system.  The shareholding period for which the shares must be held, currently three years, is excessively long, given the high risk of company failure in the early years.  A number of key venture and seed capital funds are running out of funds, with no new supply in place, leading to serious interregnums in funding flow.  In order to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery, the Government decided to reorient the National Pensions Reserve Fund from a long-term pension fund to an investment fund focused on domestic investment on commercial terms that would support economic activity and employment.  The new fund, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to be established under legislation, must be prioritised and passed before the summer recess, as otherwise there are unlikely to be ISIF investments until the end of the year which, at best, will cause problems.</p><p>  The capital gains taxation system in Ireland is no longer supportive of productive investment by domestic, indigenous entrepreneurs and should be reformed.  We need meaningful incentives in the capital gains tax regime for reinvestment in order that entrepreneurs will invest in Ireland.  It is much more attractive from a capital taxes perspective for someone to invest in Newry rather than in Dublin.  The UK experience in providing targeted capital gains tax relief for trading enterprises should guide a fundamental reform.</p><p>  Early stage companies require support to improve their commercial skills to make them investor ready and in preparing and presenting for follow-on funding.  Supports from the Government via the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and online portals are very important. </p><p>  It goes without saying the leadership and management of SMEs place a strong onus on themselves to upskill and source appropriate skills needed as they develop.  Representative bodies such as IBEC have an important role to play to support that flow.  I will ask each of our sector representatives to speak about the needs of their specific industry and access to finance and give context to our submission.  The points they will make individually are, in many cases, relevant across sectors.  Mr. Chamney, director of Walsh Whiskey and a founding member of the Irish Whiskey Association, will make the next presentation.</p></speech>

In response, 13 small Irish SMEs are planning new distillery projects in Carlow, Mayo, Galway, Cork and Dublin, with a total industry planned capital investment of &euro;1 billion.  The working capital required for distilling and maturing ranges from &euro;15 million to &euro;30 million per project, making it a significant barrier to entry and survival.  Companies must wait at least four years for a financial return.<br />The current Government assistance makes no allowance for the special funding needs of the whiskey industry, as standard grant assistance of &euro;20,000 per job generated or approximately 6% of capital requirements is provided.  This compares very unfavourably with the assistance available to our Scottish rivals, for whom in 2013 capital grants per job were more than &euro;160,000 and represented between 16% and 40% of capital needs, depending on location.  In Scotland SME distilleries are eligible for <i>ex gratia </i>funding of &euro;300,000 which is allowed every three years under EU state aid rules, plus up to 40% of capital investment, 50% of a graduate's salary, a figure of 40% in building a website and 50% in the case of new product development.</p> <p>While the UK Government is retrenching aid generally, financial support to its all-important Scottish whisky industry - amounting to 25% of Scottish exports - is being given a high priority.  If we want to grow successful indigenous Irish companies, we must follow this lead by establishing meaningful whiskey-specific funding programmes that will help drive the industry to a second golden age. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Dea" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014051300010#M00200"><p>The medical technology industry is built on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Ireland&rsquo;s medical technology industry is now a recognised global medtech cluster comprising approximately 250 medtech companies.  Of these, some 80% are SMEs.  In fact, the majority of these companies are small and micro-sized, employing fewer than 50 people.</p><p>  Global offerings across competing jurisdictions are threatening Ireland&rsquo;s hard-gained leadership position and strong reputation, not only in Europe but also globally.  It is important for the Government to support the pivotal role SMEs and entrepreneurs play in the medtech ecosystem and Irish economy.</p><p>  One reason SMEs are so important to medical technology is the particular nature of research and development within the industry.  Innovation often emerges from intimate collaborations between health professionals, academia and manufacturers - an approach to which small businesses are particularly suited.  Developments often arise in direct response to particular needs, and result in the rapid innovation that characterises the industry.</p><p>  Securing early-stage investment in these medium to high risk SMEs is critical to their very survival and to bring the technology to exit or to market.  The introduction of a State-backed enterprise or investment bank could usefully fill the gap in the market that exists in financing growth-oriented smaller enterprises and start-up companies, the lifeblood of the medical technology ecosystem.</p><p>  The medical technology sector is characterised by serial entrepreneurs.  We need to take advantage of the potential a reformed capital gains tax regime for reinvestment will bring to the Irish economy and ensure we do not lose out to international competition as a location for investment.  Capital gains taxation in Ireland is no longer supportive of productive investments by domestic indigenous entrepreneurs.  For example, the levels of capital gains tax for entrepreneurs engaged in high-technology start-ups in Ireland are over three times higher than those in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Further measures to support investment need to be addressed, for example, simplification of the rules related to the EII and SCR schemes, and founder pension-funded investments.</p></speech>

The number of Irish-owned technology companies continues to grow and now stands at over 700, accounting for a total revenue of approximately &euro;1.8 billion.  According to a recent survey, nearly 75% of these companies plan to increase their workforce.</p><p>  While the ICT sector as a whole has weathered the storm or even prospered relative to other sectors in the Irish economy, the indigenous digital technology and software sector has not achieved its full potential, with very few companies scaling beyond 100 employees and &euro;10 million in turnover.  Two main factors are at play here: talent and finance. </p><p>  With regard to finance, Enterprise Ireland has played a key role in nurturing and developing start-ups and early-stage enterprises with a variety of grants and acting as a catalyst for a range of private equity seed and venture capital funds.  Two new development capital funds are now in place for expansion-stage companies.  However, the availability of finance, particularly debt finance, is proving challenging for growth-stage companies that have achieved sustainable revenues and profits.  Factors at play include the fact that traditional forms of security for debt are not typically available from technology companies.  Second, there is limited understanding of the technology sector among the banking sector, although I note AIB has this year produced a report specific to the technology sector, which we welcome.  This is but the first stage.  Third, we experienced demand for personal guarantees from the banks.  The fourth factor is the long "No".  Ongoing demand for information and long delays in processing the applications, followed by onerous terms and a reduced offer, can mean that the requested debt facility is frequently not pursued or taken up.  The final factor is poor awareness among technology companies of the range of financing options and the particular options that are appropriate given the stage of development of the company and risk involved.</p><p>  We can see from the Central Bank quarterly numbers that the level of credit outstanding to the technology sector has remained largely unchanged for the past two years despite the growth in the sector.  Therefore, innovative and targeted products are needed for the growing number of companies which have achieved critical mass and have the potential to scale up.  We need ways to provide security to the banks such as leveraging the research and development tax credits, extending State guarantees and other mechanisms.</p><p>  Venture debt products appropriate to the Irish market conditions need to be developed where pure debt products are not appropriate to the level of risk involved.  These products can provide a more acceptable risk-reward model to the financial institutions.  The reward for Ireland, where we can address the shortcomings in the financing system for growth and expansion-stage companies, far exceeds the perceived costs or burden that may be placed on the State. </p></speech>

Sales have fallen by a quarter, tens of thousands of jobs have been lost and vacancy rates are up.  Margins have been cut to the bone, if they exist at all.  Flat is the new growth and those retailers who have survived the recession are on the edge.  This is particularly true of SME retailers, who make up 77% of retail enterprises in this country.  However, we are not without hope.  Retail Ireland forecasts that sales will rise this year for the first time since the crash.  Even more important, we believe the sector has the potential to create 40,000 new jobs by 2020 if we can record a sales rise of 3% to 4% from the middle of this decade.  However, this can only be achieved if retailers can grow.  To grow, they need finance.  While large retailers can often use their size to avail of credit, and very small retail businesses can use micro-finance schemes to get funding, there is a huge problem for those retail businesses that may have two or three small stores, or forecourt fuel stations.  They are caught in the middle and are unable to grow with high rents that they are struggling to pay.  These are usually independent retailers, even if they are part of a symbol group or a franchisee with a recognisable national or international brand name over their shop door.  These small retailers have significant potential, and a huge footprint.  Retail is one of very few industries that can boast a presence in every town and village in Ireland.  Some 75% of retail businesses are located outside Dublin.  Retail is a vital link in the supply chain for indigenous manufacturers and suppliers, especially in the food and drink sector.  Unlocking finance for retailers therefore means job creation everywhere and for everyone in the country.</p></speech>

I agree on the technology and whiskey sectors, which present great opportunities.  It sometimes seems that the banking industry is behind the curve with regard to emerging opportunities.  Sometimes the banks say those looking for loans are not skilled enough with finance to be able to apply correctly.  What have the delegates been doing to pass those skills on to individuals so they can apply correctly?  Has the organisation been involved in trying to upskill the banks&rsquo; staff with regard to the emerging trends in the economy?  Have the delegates seen the Government doing anything to upskill the bankers themselves in regard to how they should respond to the whiskey and technology sectors?</p><p>  With regard to capital gains tax, I agree it is ridiculous having different rates in Newry and Navan.  I would like to see the same rates in those locations.</p><p>  The delegates referred to a lack of demand and quoted reports in doing so.  We have been hearing that there are many cash flow problems in businesses at present.  Will the delegates talk us through them?</p> <p>I agree that retailers seem to be the poor relation in terms of Government policy in the past.  One of the questions I have been putting to all the organisations is the dampening effect debt distress is having on the economy in general.  Are the banks making an effort to nurse business out of debt distress, by separating toxic assets from the rest of the business?  Will they comment on the cost of loans?

Obviously more can be done.  I think the local enterprise office, LEO system, will have our wholehearted support in trying to ensure that our members really understand the role of LEOs.</p><p>  In response to the Deputy's question on engaging with the banks, we have had quite significant engagement with the banks in terms of upskilling by individual sectoral levels.  Individual sectors will meet the bank and talk about the particular situations that the industry is up against and look at products that might be helpful for them.  This is a great opportunity to put that together on one submission, which we do at all times. </p></speech>

That has not reached ground level in all cases at this point.  Different things are happening.  Obviously the historic lending was asset based but the banks are moving to different models of lending and that requires a new expertise in the banks.  We have seen progress but much remains to be done.  Let me give an example, and I will call on Mr. Chamney to elaborate on the whiskey industry.</p></speech>

We decided that we wanted to progress to the next phase, which is to produce whiskey.  We had a long-term contract with an Irish supplier.  In the first instance, we set up a joint venture with an Italian company who has route to market throughout the world.  In the first phase we needed to lay down the stills and the still house, which is about one third if not more of the total investment.  The second tranche is laying down the whiskey.  We went to Irish banks and they did not know the language we were talking, they had no notion of the industry.  Luckily we were skilled enough to find a British bank which was quite happy to commit to funding our development of laying down the whiskey.</p></speech>

We have worked recently with AIB on its outlook report.  We helped them to understand the structure of the sector itself, the scale and the type of products needed.  That information will be used by AIB to create products tailored for the market at branch level, so that they themselves are trying to gear themselves up to work with the technology sector, which is a major sector in Ireland.  There are specific things going on, but I do not see that it is systematic across all the banks.</p></speech>

When I deal with independent retailers in the market, the exiting banks are willing to do deals but they cannot fund it through the Irish indigenous banks.  That is the fundamental problem.  There may well be some toxic loans or restructuring needed but they cannot get the restructuring done because the Irish banks have not got down to dealing with the small and medium sized enterprises yet.  The banks are dealing with the larger companies.  We need to have the issues addressed.  There are many viable businesses, retailers have reset the bar in terms of running the business but the refinancing is critical.  That is the fundamental point.  When I talk to all independent retailers they spell out the difficulty in refinancing their business for medium to long term, given that the Irish banks are not interested in their business at this time.</p></speech>

This is having an impact.  There must be a demand and a competitive market environment but it would be our assumption that we will begin to see a reduction in the bank rate as the economic environment begins to start moving back into play.  It has a major impact on companies that the rate is higher.</p></speech>

We have a blanket capital gains tax which is at a very high rate.  One only has to look at the situation across the Border to see how entrepreneurs are achieving a much more attractive capital gains rate.  It is not just about the opportunity cost and losing tax revenue from CGT, this could be a selling feature to entrepreneurs.  We attract a great many multinationals because of our attractive corporate taxation rate.  There is no reason that we could not do the same in terms of attracting entrepreneurs to come to Ireland, if it was a low CGT location.  When looking at CGT, we have to delineate between selling a piece of land and a house versus entering a high risk business that one will be in for seven or eight years.  Perhaps there is a way we could carve out certain types of technology industries that are very high risk ventures and we should be looking at a very keen capital gains tax rate versus what might be considered a more passive type of investment, such as to salt away money for 20 years or whatever.  Members might look at an approach to give technology entrepreneurs an incentive to take a punt.</p></speech>

I am happy to say the Department is looking into the question and some other items which we do not have time now to discuss.  There is genuine engagement taking place.</p><p>  Certainly the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond taken up the banner for Scottish whisky, and well done.  We would be saying that there is a very good opportunity to do the same in Ireland.</p></speech>

There is a problem developing in that companies that are looking to be bought out or are trying to sell up are actively relocating their enterprises into the United Kingdom.  They may have made an acquisition in the UK and then they relocate the company to avail of the preferential CGT treatment in the United Kingdom.  This is an issue for Ireland.  I have seen it in a couple of companies in the technology sector.</p> <p>On the issue of CGT, an effort was made in the last budget to introduce roll-over relief.  Something needs to be done to clean that up and make it simpler.  If people roll over their gains from a company they have sold, it should be just a straight roll-over, instead of having to claim it back.  The chance of having two successful tech start-ups in a row are reasonably low, so why not just offer the relief there and then instead of having to claim it back five or six years later?</p></speech>

Despite the number of witnesses who have addressed this committee, this is the first time we have got a definite figure regarding the cost of borrowings being 1.4% higher than across the rest of Europe.  It was important we heard that today.  It was also important for us to hear a number of witnesses speak about the need for a State-backed bank.  Some of us were in Europe after Christmas and the European concept seems to be to look at what is going on in America and at funding being sourced elsewhere.</p><p>  I suppose we have a State-backed bank in AIB, but I assume the witnesses are looking for something else.  Obviously, we need to be looking at alternative sources of finance, rather than at the normal banking sector.  Mention was made of microfinance loans, which are for small loans, but we need some source of funding for medium sized companies that want to expand, particularly those in the retail sector which we hope will develop and grow over the next couple of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Dea" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014051300012#O00300"><p>Mr. Flannery put it well when he spoke about the need for a debt product that recognises the higher risk - high coupon debt.  The venture debt products that exist generally require an equity injection of two-thirds, but if one is looking for debt, one is not looking for two-thirds equity at the same time.  Otherwise, a business would just do an equity raise.</p><p>  We must recognise that it is riskier to lend into some of these technology companies that do not necessarily have assets, other than intellectual property.  However, there is a clear need for something above pure debt and below the kind of swing for the fences type investment that venture capital firms will make.  Many companies are not going for billion dollar markets.  If we could build a bunch of companies employing 40 or 50 people with a revenue of &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million, this would be fantastic for the economy, but this is not the type of company a venture capital firm is set up to invest in.  Equally, venture capital firms generally have seven-year funding cycles, but it takes a lot longer than seven years to build a company of substance.  Therefore, I feel strongly there is need for something like the old ACC Bank or a bank that is a little more investment oriented where the coupon is correspondingly high.  Many companies would be willing to take on that debt.</p></speech>

I was in Taiwan approximately 18 months ago and was very surprised to see the low penetration of any Irish whiskey to Taiwan, given it is a country half the size of Ireland, but with six times the population.  It has a growing middle class, but we were not on the shelves at all.  Scotland was winning out there.  We could point fingers as to whose fault this is, but I was surprised that while we like to champion our products, Irish whiskies were not on the shelves.  Has Mr. Chamney any comment to make on that?</p></speech>

The rest of the world is open to us.</p></speech>

The Government works through China by way of the one-China policy.  However, I felt there was a market in Taiwan that Irish companies, particularly in the whiskey sector, should consider.  Perhaps this has been considered, but I was surprised by the lack of penetration.</p></speech>

If the Deputy went to Rio de Janeiro he would find the same issue.  To be positive about this, we need to train young Irish graduates to learn languages that will help them market our products.  It is relatively easy to deal with Portuguese and Spanish markets, but more difficult when we go to the East, which is where the market is and will be in the next 30 years.  We need a graduate programme to prepare for this.  We had such a programme in the past, sponsored by IBEC for Europe.  I remember employing a young man and telling him to go and learn Polish.  We need to do the same in regard to Korea and elsewhere.</p></speech>

Not enough businesses know about all the schemes or which scheme would suit them.  The lack of communication on schemes always seems to be a problem whether we are talking about business or anything else.  The Government needs to get a one-stop shop on line so that businesses can access information on all of the services they can avail of.  I believe this is coming soon.  How do business representative groups like those here fare in regard to getting information out to the various businesses, particularly information on crowd funding or linked finance?  These non-traditional types of funding are taking off in other countries and are beginning to sow seeds here.</p></speech>

We engage with the Government in terms of the portals being developed and have access to these to make them appropriate for industry.  Where we can, we engage on these.  We must also ensure the schemes are appropriate and where we need change, we engage in a communications process to achieve that.  We do this through the various trade associations.  I think we can do more of this to get the message across as coherently as we can.</p></speech>

In the technology sector for example, we run a lot of events where we bring in specialists from the US or UK on private equity funds.  We recognise the issue that the founders of the tech companies tend to come from an engineering or science background, not from a finance or accounting background.  Therefore, we look at how we can use that funding to put together courses that are tailored for the tech sector founders.</p></speech>

Ireland has 200,000 businesses, of which 98% are small.  Some 93% are micro-business with ten employees or fewer.  They provide 50% of private employment, employing 655,000 people.  Each year, in the region of 12,000 new businesses start up.  We are a nation of entrepreneurs.<br />I have never known a business, big or small, to be successful without a bank supporting it.  The business community is wide and varied.  Its constituent businesses have one thing in common: they need an active banking market.  Companies vary in size in the SME sector from tiny to large.  Their banking needs vary from their being self-sufficient, in which case they can self-finance projects, to requiring an overdraft simply to exist from week to week, as in the case of some small businesses.  Obviously, managing that cross-section of needs brings its own set of challenges for banks.<br />The SFA&rsquo;s most recent business sentiment survey<b></b>shows that small business sentiment continues to improve, with four out of ten companies predicting their business to be good or very good over the next three months.  The survey indicates that the economy has stabilised, business performance is encouraging and companies are looking to the future with an increasing sense of optimism.  However, the latest SAFE survey on access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro area shows that credit advanced to SMEs remains on a low level.  This is both a supply issue and a demand issue.  For Irish SMEs, supply of finance is second only to finding more customers as the most pressing issue.  Irish interest rates are well above those in competitor economies, such as Germany, and this dampens our members&rsquo; international competitiveness.<br />The SFA itself has recently conducted a business banking survey among a number of member companies, to which 855 member companies responded out of a sample of 3,000.  Fifty-five percent of respondents use commercial banks for their working capital requirements, while 40% rely on them for their investment capital needs.  Retained profit is the second greatest source of funds in a business, with 49% using that for working capital and 43% for investment capital.  This is followed by shareholder investment and loans from family and friends.  Just 1% of respondents use venture capital and business angels.<br />On the availability of finance from commercial banks, 38% of respondents stated they do not need investment capital at present, and 28% do not need working capital.  Some 12% of companies stated that the availability of investment capital had decreased over the past year, with 19% reporting a decrease in the availability of working capital.  Just 8% reported an increase in the availability of investment capital while 7% reported an increase in availability of working capital. <br />The cost of finance is increasing, with 29% reporting an increased cost for working capital over the past year and 25% for investment capital, compared with 4% experiencing a decrease.  Thirty-one percent of respondents stated that their relationship with their business bank had disimproved over the past year, with 41% stating it had stayed the same and 10% stating it had improved.  Eighteen percent did not respond.<br />The great majority feel that the idea of &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; is missing from &ldquo;relationship manager&rdquo;.  They want a dedicated person to contact who understands their business, communicates effectively and responds quickly.  The biggest issues identified are increased collateral required to secure finance and delays in securing credit and investment finance.<br />On the small business side, we recognise the imperative to up-skill business owners in management capabilities, particularly on the financial information they need to supply to the bank.  We run training courses to promote programmes, such as ManagementWorks&rsquo;s Building Financial Capability in SMEs, for all our members on a frequent basis.  However, for those already in difficulty who cannot afford professional financial advice, we believe the MABS remit should be expanded to help.  This would help business owners to resolve their business issues, including by means of advice and advocacy on dealing with legal, accounting and financial issues concerning business restructuring, including negotiating with creditors and banks.  This can be justified as it would save more businesses and the jobs of the people they employ.<br />The SAFE also shows that nearly 40% of all Irish SMEs do not feel confident in talking to banks and obtaining a bank loan.  In other European countries, such as Germany and Belgium, confidence is much higher, at approximately 80% and 70%, respectively.  Trust has been broken in dealing with commercial banks, hence the difficulties with small businesses gaining access to EU financial instruments, as these must be channelled through intermediaries, which are the commercial banks in Ireland.  We have called time and again for the introduction of a State investment bank that would have as its remit job creation and infrastructure provision.  We would welcome new overseas banks in the market to give businesses a choice and enhance competitiveness.<br />Banking in Ireland has changed dramatically over the past six years.  Since the crash, the banking sector has moved from being proactive to being reactive.  The next step has to be for banking to move to being active.  The challenge as the economy begins to grow in a meaningful way will involve the banking sector being ready and willing to support potential growth.<br />The banking sector has lost an enormous amount of human resources - bankers who possessed enormous knowledge built up over many years.  This is by no means easy to replace.  Banks&rsquo; credit departments operate in an environment where risk is feared.  Bank branch managers and employees need to become active members of their communities once more, attending local business functions and offering their support in rebuilding our towns and rural areas.  Traditionally, they have been leading lights of the business community around the country, and we believe they should start again.<br />SFA members have increasingly been raising the issue of the lack of competition in the banking sector, and increased charges and extra conditions are becoming greater barriers even for growth-oriented small businesses.  Why are banking approvals so high, yet draw-downs are running at 60%?  Some of the main reasons are confidence and the terms and conditions attached to loan offers.  A period of three months is not enough to adhere to a deal.  Other factors are the prohibitive cost of funds, the offering of life assurance for astronomical sums, personal guarantees, and general legal operations being onerous and slow.  The level of equity in some cases can be impossible to achieve.<br />What can the banks do to address this?  First, a decision must be taken by a bank to lend.  Then, when it decides to take on a business or a project, it must be priced at a level at which the promoter is seen to be wealthier at the end of the project than at the beginning.  The terms and conditions are really where problems are arising.  How can decisions be made based on a three-month offer letter?  Are personal guarantees for the entire sum of a project absolutely necessary?  The same applies to life assurance for the entire sum.  That is before we move on to the legal aspects.  Are the hoops being put in front of the business community on the basis that approval figures can be shown to be high and in the belief that there is really never any danger that the funding will be drawn down?  This is completely unsatisfactory.  There is a need for increased transparency on banking products and greater competition in the marketplace.  The SFA has called on the National Consumer Agency to undertake and publish a price survey on the range of business banking products to improve price transparency for small businesses on an ongoing basis, and this should now be done.</p> <p> Irish SMEs rely heavily on banks as a source of external finance, which makes them vulnerable to developments in the banking sector.  Greater diversity in funding is necessary, including Government funding, peer to peer lending platforms, business angels and venture capital.</p><p> The Government has a role to play in the relationship between banks and business.  Only a small percentage of Irish SMEs make use of Government-related funding sources.  One of the reasons for this is a lack of knowledge of existing finance schemes.  For example, just 23% of respondents to the most recent Department of Finance-commissioned Red C survey stated they had good knowledge of State-funded supports, with only 25% aware of the microfinance loan fund scheme and 51% aware of the credit guarantee scheme.  Let us look at the latter two schemes which were launched with great fanfare but which have been singularly unsuccessful.  In relation to Microfinance Ireland, it is essential that it adapt its strategy to communicate directly with potential start-ups through social welfare offices and community enterprise centres, as well as LEOs.  Applications should be allowed to be made directly to Microfinance Ireland, rather than having to go through banks and be turned down, and LEOs.  The process should be as straightforward and speedy as possible.  The levels of risk taken should reflect the additional price being paid for access to this form of finance and, consequently, the risk of higher failure rates should be tolerated.</p><p> The credit loan guarantee scheme has been designed in such a way that it cannot be used effectively.  Our understanding from the recent meeting of the SFA national council with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is that it will take primary legislative change to make it work properly.  We ask committee members to use their influence to ensure this is fast-tracked into the Oireachtas legislative programme.  This is the key scheme for our members as, if we can get it right, it will allow business to grow and flourish.  It will give the banks the necessary comfort to lend to worthwhile projects that lack equity or have had their balance sheets wiped in the past six years, or that are in innovative sectors in which banks do not have the necessary expertise to understand.  For the Government, it will allow new companies access to finance which they are being denied.  They will generate revenue from it and it will allow companies under pressure to survive.  These are the ideals that were espoused on its inception but which have not managed to come to the fore.  For the record, there will be failures, but the success rate will more than make up for this.  Fanfare is one thing; real action is another.</p><p> The SFA continues to press the Government on the EIIS and has made a submission in the Department of Finance&rsquo;s consultation process.  It was formerly known as the BES and provided much needed equity.  In 2007 &euro;120 million was provided, which figure last year was down to &euro;12 million.</p><p> Our recommendations include the following: a return to the BES as the scheme name, as it would be more recognisable.  No one understands what the EIIS is - one always has to say it was formerly the BES.  There is a need for enhanced publicity around the availability of the scheme.  The only media reporting on the scheme tends to have a negative tilt from the perspective of tax write-offs versus recognising the importance of facilitating equity investment in what are viewed as relatively high risk schemes.  In particular, there is a need to promote the family and friends and private placement options, as well as funds option, and to make it easy for companies to use the scheme without having to pay for expensive professional advice.</p><p> The scheme's rules should be changed, as follows: there should be a return to a five year, rather than a three year, investment term in order that businesses would have the necessary time to grow sufficiently to be capable of repaying investors.  There is a need to remove employment and research and development criteria which complicate the scheme unnecessarily.  By definition, if a business grows, these will occur, but it poses unnecessary risk up-front to the investor.  There is a need to evaluate the cost-benefits of extending the scheme to other sectors and to examine UK and international models with a view to implementing government risk-sharing models with private investors in similar schemes.  This is important to attract non-traditional BES-type investors and, specifically, other small business owners who might be interested in investing in other businesses.  An enhanced EIIS is essential to allow business balance sheets to recover and give the equity piece that banks need to make a project work on their side of the equation.</p><p> The regulatory environment underpinning peer to peer lending platforms needs to be clarified and developed by the Financial Regulator.  Also, the marketplace for crowd funding, business angels and venture capital needs to be improved, with enhanced Government funding acting as a catalyst for private sector investment.</p><p> The SFA welcomes the committee&rsquo;s review of this important topic for small businesses.  We hope the outcome will be recommendations for the Government, the banks and the SME sector to deliver an enhanced finance system that will work for all small businesses and the economy in general.</p><p> We welcome questions members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

I do not think the Small Firms Association will find a solution by asking the Government to put its hands in its pocket to do anything.  I was delighted to hear some of the things Mr. Noonan said, but when he refers to enhanced Government funding, I do not think it will happen.  If we have entrepreneurs in Ireland, all we need to do is to find some way or other to give them their head and remove boundaries that may restrict them.  One proposal - the Government has taken the first small step towards it - is that people should be able to release their cash from their pensions which they could spend on improvements to their houses or shops.  Asking the Government to do something is not going to solve the problem, apart from asking it to remove restrictive barriers.  If these are the words Mr. Noonan has been using, it seems that it is likely to happen on that basis.  </p><p>  Why have relationships with the banks deteriorated?  Can anything be done to encourage the banks to change and do something about this?   Mr. Noonan spoke about optimism and confidence on the horizon, which sounds as if they should give the banks the ability to change.  I can understand why they have cut back on their costs, but we practically own some of them.  We want to ensure they succeed but not by asking them to release all control.  The SFA has the necessary ability if more money was available in the economy.</p></speech>

Noonan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014051300014#Q00400"><p>Absolutely.  The relationship issue with banks is down to the human resource factor.  A lot of bankers - relatively young men and women - have taken packages.  They could not afford to stay for many reasons.  A new generation is now coming through in the domestic banks and I have met a number of them both in my business and in my SFA role.  That position will improve in the coming years.  The banks are finding their feet, although I am not an apologist for them; therefore, members should not get me wrong.  I am just suggesting they have been through a very tough time also.  The fear that persists is felt in credit departments.  A lot of front-line managers and others dealing with businesses are much more proactive and want to do deals.  However, issues start to arise when matters go back to the banks' credit departments.</p><p>  I agree completely with Senator Feargal Quinn in the sense that if the Government can give us a chance, we will certainly deliver jobs.  As the Senator rightly said, we have done this before.  However, there is an equity piece of roughly 30% missing.  Some companies the balance sheets of which have been destroyed in recent years have to rebuild them.  The Government should allow the tax system to work through the EIIS, reduced capital gains tax or roll-over relief.  It should give people a break to allow them to invest in relations or businesses.  We do not want any money from it and do not think we are going to get any because it does not have any.  However, we want the tax system to be facilitated to allow people to grow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014051300014#Q00500"><p>I want to add one point on the enhanced Government funding angle.  It goes back to the issue of competitiveness between companies here and those in the North and Britain.  The UK Government has demonstrated that where it becomes a partner to an investment decision, it is much more successful.  On crowd funding, for example, the Crowdcube model has been phenomenally successful, with the government underwriting 20% of an investment.  It instils an air of confidence to generate a lot of private sector money.  That is how the traditional venture capital, VC, model works, with the government putting in X amount and attracting matching funding.  Hundreds of millions has been allocated to schemes such as credit guarantee and microfinance, but we cannot spend the money because these schemes are not working.  We need to find a scheme that will deliver.  In particular, the equity piece has to come into play because banks keep telling us they cannot go beyond the figure of 70%.</p> <p>Our members tell us that in the 1980s that was done through grants because State aid rules were not there.  We come up against State aid rules all the time now so we must be more creative.  We can learn much from the UK model in respect of that.</p></speech>

I note the very high response rate.  A total of 855 member companies out of a sample of 3,000 responded, which is excellent.  In its presentation, the SFA mentioned that 40% of businesses do not feel confident talking to their banks.  What is the reason for that?  Has the SFA monitored change over the past number of years?  Mr. Noonan made an interesting point about approval rates.  We have had this debate previously in that the banks are saying they are lending to all and sundry and others, including ISME, are obviously disputing that.  Mr. Noonan made an interesting point that banks are making people jump through hoops to the extent that they will just not draw down the loan even though there is approval.  This is a very interesting point that I would not have noticed before.</p><p>  What is the uptake in respect of training and upskilling?  Mr. Noonan mentioned relationship managers.  I will repeat the question I put to representatives from ISME.  Does Mr. Noonan think there was a better relationship between bank managers and customers back in the 1980s and 1990s and that they knew, regardless of whether they were in small towns, their customers, their history, their families and the risk involved better than they do now?</p></speech>

The issue of approval rates is a subtle one because banks can say they have approved so many billions but the Deputy is right in that the terms and conditions attached to those approval rates are structured in such a way that banks can justify the rates but there is no danger of those loans ever being drawn down.  Personal guarantees are one of the biggest factors because people are fearful of them.  Overcoming that is very difficult because banks are fearful.  I go back to the point I made to Senator Quinn, which relates to the fear within credit departments, how to get over that fear and what security and equity one can give.  The more equity one can put into a deal, the less fear they have, which goes back to what Ms Callan was saying.  It is a difficult one to manage.<br />The relationship manager issue is improving.  In the 1970s and 1980s the branch manager had enormous power, which brought with it enormous responsibility.  The banks decided, in their wisdom - we would not agree with it - to centralise lending, so one has bureaucrats sitting in some lending unit saying they do not like a particular project, knowing nothing about the people or promoters.  This can lead to projects that are really weak getting funded because they look so good on paper, whereas the manager in the branch in Galway or Mayo could turn around and say &quot;Your man's not hectic.  It doesn't matter how good the figures are,&quot; and <i>vice versa</i>.  I might let Ms Callan deal with upskilling and peer-to-peer lending.</p></speech>

Rather, it is an EU survey that showed benchmarks across all of the eurozone figures.  That is why it is so interesting.  It is saying that 40% of people here do not have confidence going in to make bank applications.  That is really where we come back to the concept of the State investment bank.  The Deputy is right when he says we own AIB and that we only have two banks, but those brands have a lot of work to do to rebuild themselves in terms of confidence.  There are many companies which simply do not want to go through the doors of the three main banks because they have had a bad experience and they would love something new.  When the European Commission rolls into town and runs its access to finance seminars, loads of people ring me up asking about how to get hold of this money, but in Ireland, that comes through the three mainstream banks, so one just goes in and makes a normal application.  One might get some of the money, but there is no clarity there.  They are fully aware that they are trying to rebuild it over time, but that is why many people would welcome something fresh and new to which they can go.  It might just be cosmetic, but that is what is needed to give the lift in terms of improving demand rates.  Again, one of Microfinance Ireland's biggest downfalls was the fact that one had to go to one of the banks and get rejected.  I know that has been amended, but someone should just be able to make an application directly.  That is what people want to do.</p><p>  In respect of training and upskilling, we have worked with Skillnets in Avena in respect of the programme called ManagementWorks.  The Building Financial Capability in SMEs programme is excellent and we strongly advertise and endorse it.  In respect of management upskilling for small companies - there are many reports on this - it is really hard to get companies to take time out and pay money to train and upskill themselves.  That is a communications and messaging issue.  One just needs to keep coming at people from all avenues.  I would not accept unilaterally that most small businesses are not professional.  They are professional.  Certainly we have no fears around this in respect of our members.  We are really just trying to hone and improve their skills.  However, there is a class of small businesspeople outside of organisations such as those represented today who are struggling.  This is why we suggested the MABS route for people who are essentially desperate and cannot afford to come to professional organisations or even accountants for help because they will ask to be paid up-front.  If we want to save those companies and jobs, we need to look at a different proposition.  </p><p>  There is a phenomenal opportunity in respect of peer-to-peer lending.  The biggest thing we need to decide is whether we need to have a regulated structure.  Linked Finance certainly worked.  It probably took it about three or four years to ultimately get up and running without going through a Central Bank regime, which is fine.  I know this is becoming a discussion across the EU, but if one looks at the US one can see that they have been doing it for years.  They are already there, are competing and have a competitive advantage.  A similar situation pertains in the UK.  It takes us so long to catch up and get any of these things across the board.  There are four models of peer-to-peer lending.  Two of them are specific to business.  One is the lending product through Linked Finance, but the other is just allowing people to buy products, similar to Kickstarter in the US.  Some companies here have used that very successfully.  If we could get there quicker, it would be hugely desirable and would really kick-start companies and give a good bounce in general.  However, we need to decide quite quickly whether we are going to go for a regulated type of platform.  If not, they need to say "No" and advise people how we can implement these schemes.  The most successful one in the UK involves the government underwriting the actual funds, which are then invested in businesses.  That has been hugely successful.</p></speech>

When Linked Finance appeared before us, I am almost sure that the message I received, although I stand to be corrected, was that it was very much open for business and had a lot to give but that the amount of applications could be even better because there was money to give.  One of the big issues is communication around it and that fear of going to the non-traditional lender.  There is something we are missing out on - and by "we", I mean the royal we, everybody here.  Not enough people even apply for that.  I am a big fan of that type of funding.</p></speech>

One could go into social welfare offices, persuade more people to take the self-employment route and tell them about funding.</p> <p>In circumstances where a bank issues a rejection letter, it is stated that the applicant can go to the Credit Review Office.  Why is it not possible for the office to be made aware of the fact that the application has been rejected in order that it might contact that applicant directly and have him or her send on the application to it?

This has been a fascinating discussion.  I have in front of me the papers submitted by the banks and it has been extremely interesting to listen to what employers have to say on the various matters to which they relate.</p><p>  The cost of loans is a major issue.  Said cost is probably scaring people off in the context of drawing down loans.  The difference between the cost of loans here and that which obtains in the UK is striking.  The representatives from InterTradeIreland made a valid point with regard to loans when they came before us.  Loans are being approved and drawn down but the issue which arises relates to the type of companies by which they are being drawn down.  I am of the view that, in the context of the financial crisis, the pendulum has swung all the way to the opposite side and that there is a need for it to come back to the centre.  The key issue in that regard relates to the quality of the staff available to analyse loan applications.  However, applicants also have a responsibility in the context of outlining their position accurately.  InterTradeIreland clearly stated that up to 90% of people who made proper applications received loan approval.</p></speech>

It also comes back to the issue of diverging viewpoints.  It is interesting that SMEs are repaying loans and that the level of lending is being outstripped as a result.  The focus of SMEs is to consolidate their businesses before they begin to expand.  This is reflected in the overall economy at present.  The banking sector is also shrinking.  There must be some encouragement from Government and it must inform businesses that they have paid back enough and that if they expand their operations, they will repay their outstanding balances more quickly.</p></speech>

We may have moved beyond the need to establish such a bank at this stage.</p><p>  The BES was a good initiative and it should have been brought to a close when expansion began.  In addition, the section 23 reliefs should have been stopped when the property market took off.  Those reliefs were only put in place to kick-start activity.  Similarly, the BES was designed to kick-start activity in the business arena.  It should have been brought to a close when activity commenced in earnest because its continued operation led to subsequent inflation.</p><p>  I have taken on board the real and valid points made by our guests.  MABS is struggling to deal with the sheer volume of people seeking its services.  Perhaps the SFA and IBEC could come together to establish an organisation similar to MABS to assist those in business who are in difficulty.  </p></speech>

At an earlier meeting we considered the place of history in the junior cycle.  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to brief the committee on the status of the implementation of the JCSA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014051300003#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to come before the committee and update members on the progress made to date on the implementation of the JCSA.  I spoke to both Houses on these reforms shortly after the framework was launched in October 2012.  I was very pleased that both Houses unanimously endorsed them.  I also explained why I was making changes to junior cycle.  Research, and particularly that of the ESRI, underlines the reasons change is necessary.</p><p>  Under the current model a significant number of first-year students do not make progress, particularly in English and mathematics.  A significant number of students in second year become disengaged from the learning process.  Sadly, many of them drop out after or even before they reach the junior certificate.  These students have, as I have said before, already entered the departure lounge from education.</p><p>  The evidence also shows that choices made as early as first year of junior cycle, for example to take ordinary level rather than higher level, are almost impossible to reverse.  These choices can limit the options open to young people for the leaving certificate for the rest of their lives.  This is a particularly important issue for students in lower stream classes and those in disadvantaged areas.  In third year the junior certificate examination dominates the experiences of students.  The focus of learning narrows and the emphasis is on rote learning specifically for the examinations.  By that I mean learning off prepared answers to anticipated questions, not acquiring a knowledge of times tables.  For many students the examination does not lead to positive learning experiences and outcomes.  Assessment practice at the end of junior cycle in Ireland is out of line with best practice in many countries with high-performing educational systems.  In those countries, high-stakes public examinations are confined to the end of the senior cycle while school-based assessment is emphasised throughout the lower secondary cycle.</p><p>  At the recent teacher conferences, I spoke about how we need to move away from judging students to giving them structured feedback on their own learning.  This is known as &ldquo;assessment for learning&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;assessment of learning&rdquo;.  We also need to move away from judging teachers based solely on how well their students jump the hurdle of a high stakes examination.  Regrettably, the ASTI and the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, have both voted in favour of industrial action in opposition to school-based assessment.  This action involves non-co-operation with continuing professional development, CPD, and other junior cycle reform planning.  Over 90% of all English teachers and nearly 1,200 school leaders have already attended the planned CPD for this school year.  The position of the teacher unions will create difficulties and pressures for schools and their students.  We are working to resolve the outstanding issues, and to move forward positively.  I welcome the positive and constructive engagement of school management bodies, parents and school leaders.  They have acknowledged the need for this change, and worked to identify the steps and support necessary to implement it.</p><p>  There is no need for an examination such as the junior certificate that is so important because it is not a terminal examination for people leaving school at the age of 15.  As we do not want people to leave school at 15, it does not have to have the status of the leaving certificate.  Over 90% of those who do the junior cycle examination go on to senior cycle and sit the leaving certificate, which is a high-stakes examination.  The evidence shows the high-stakes examination is warping the learning experience of junior cycle students.  It causes significant stress for students and has a negative effect on the quality of teaching and learning.  By way of example of what our teachers can do, I point to the increased take-up of the optional Irish oral exam at junior certificate level.  This involves teachers assessing their own students for State certification, and it is already working.  While I understand teachers are nervous of change, I have a great belief in their capacity to deliver this change.</p><p>  Concerns have been raised about maintaining standards in the new system.  High-stakes examinations are not the only way to measure or establish standards.  There are already safeguards for standards in the existing proposals.  For example, for each subject the State Examination Commission, SEC, will set terminal examinations and provide a strict marking scheme.  There will be CPD to provide teachers with the confidence to undertake new approaches to assessment.  Teacher unions believe the current safeguards are inadequate.  I have listened to their concerns and offered to discuss external supports for moderating student work.</p><p>  In response to concerns from stakeholders, in January of this year I announced a number of changes to the implementation of the JCSA.  I also established a national working group, and a number of associated sub-groups, which continue to work with the partners.  I have slowed the pace of the proposed roll-out of the new JCSA.  The full roll-out of all 21 subjects will not be completed until September 2019.  It will be June 2022 before students will finish an entire cycle of the new programme.  From the point of view of politicians, it is two general elections away.  English is the only subject which will change this September.  Short courses will be introduced from September only in schools which want to introduce them; they will not be compulsory.  All other subjects remain the same as in the current junior cycle.</p><p>  We recently issued a circular to schools outlining the limited changes which will occur in September.  A full timetable for implementation up to 2019 is included in that circular, a copy of which has been provided to committee members.</p> <p> In January I also announced additional continuing professional development, in line with requests received from education partners.  English teachers will now receive an extra 1.5 days of CPD, which means English teachers will have a minimum of 4.5 days CPD.  All other subject teachers will receive a minimum of four days CPD for each subject.  On top of that, all schools will have one full day of CPD annually for each year of the roll-out of the JCSA.  Schools can close to facilitate this CPD for all teaching staff.  This measure has been welcomed by everyone involved in the process.  In total, every single teacher of two subjects will now receive a minimum of 16 days of CPD during the roll-out of the JCSA, which represents a very significant investment in teacher education.</p><p> I am fully committed to resourcing the new JCSA appropriately.  I have ring-fenced &euro;4.8 million in budget 2014 for implementation.  This will increase as more subjects are phased in.  At the moment, I believe the concentration of new resources should be directed towards continuing professional development.</p><p> The subgroups of the national working group are focusing on issues such as the resources that will be needed for assessment, as well as looking at external supports for moderation.  I welcome the comprehensive submission that this group has received from school management bodies.  I again urge teacher unions to submit a written statement on what resources they think are needed.  I think it is a lost opportunity for teachers if their representatives do not put in a comprehensive written statement of what resources teachers believe are necessary.</p><p> I again emphasise that these changes are based on the evidence available to us, evidence that tells us the lived experiences of our students.  We have a responsibility to act on that evidence.  There has been ongoing dialogue on the need to reform junior cycle.  Before the reform was introduced, there was particular discussion through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Understandably some time was lost along the way as a result of the unions&rsquo; consideration of the Haddington Road agreement, which had nothing to do with education and was about a public sector pay readjustment.  However, I believe we have plenty of time left to resolve the outstanding issues.</p><p> I look forward to discussing these issues further with this committee and also with all the stakeholders in the education sector.</p></speech>

My party supports junior cycle reform, and the previous Government established the NCCA working group which made the proposals the Minister has developed from there.  However, although we strongly support this much-needed project, I take issue with how it has been handled in recent years.  It is very unfortunate that the introduction of such an important reform to our second level education system is starting in a mess, with some of the partners necessary to implement it not on board.  As the Minister mentioned, both second level teaching unions have voted not to co-operate and have voted for industrial action.</p><p>  One of the key concerns expressed by teachers and parents relates to the issue of independent assessment.  I have also engaged at every opportunity I have with students in classrooms to gauge their opinions.  The Minister is changing from the NCCA working group recommendation regarding the 60% exam element of the new JCSA no longer being independently assessed.  There is grave concern over why he is going down that route.  It is positive that the junior certificate student award is lower stakes and will not dominate the first half of the student's second level education, which I support.  However, I believe we can make that exam lower stakes without removing independent assessment.</p><p>  There is considerable support among teachers, parents and students that if a student does an exam in my old school, Carndonagh community school, we should be able to have the faith that that mark is consistent with and of a similar standard to the mark of a student who does an exam in a Kerry or Dublin school.  We are fortunate that at the moment there is good faith in the junior certificate even though it needs to be reformed.</p><p>  However, in my view and that of many others, it is not good to have the teachers the final arbiters of that 60% exam part of the new junior certificate.  The teachers also become the final arbiters of their own work because the assessment of the students' work is also a reflection on the teacher.  With human nature being human nature, there is always an incentive when marking to give students the benefit of the doubt.  If a teacher is not performing, there is an incentive for him or her to avoid having his or her class shown up with a poor set of results.  I ask the Minister to outline why he has gone down that route.  Will he agree to reconsider it and continue with independent assessment?</p><p>  I wish to touch on a few other issues.</p></speech>

I have not heard the Minister explain why he chose not to adhere to those NCCA recommendations.  I ask him to outline the rationale for that decision as a starting point.</p><p>  I have a question on the ongoing assessment in terms of portfolios.  I presume this will require some changes to school infrastructure in terms of security to store portfolios over a three year period.  What resources will be allocated to enable schools to carry out that task?</p><p>  I have a question about priority learning units, PLUs, the learning units for children with special needs.  How many does the Minister envisage having?  How will a student be assessed as having a need?  Will schools share PLUs?  How will they operate?  What funding is being allocated to them?</p><p>  The three points are: the reasons the Department did not go with the initial NCCA; the changes schools will need to undertake in terms of storing and security of portfolios; and the question on the PAUs.</p></speech>

It shows the value of the junior certificate can be overegged.</p><p>  The principle is very welcome and I do not have a difficulty with how it will be corrected, as it happens at third level where the stakes are a lot higher.  Teachers at third level do not have an issue with subjectivity.  Notwithstanding this, and if teachers still have difficulty, has the option of peer correcting been explored whereby a teacher from one town can correct the work of a teacher in another town?  It would be a bit like what is done with the pre-leaving certificate and pre-junior certificate.  This might be an option to be explored with the unions.</p></speech>

It was the only A I ever got, so I thought I would throw it out there as my biggest achievement in life.  To echo what has been said already, people always state they want change and reform, but when it comes, they can be uncomfortable with it.  I very much welcome the changes.  The main concern is coming from those we hope to empower to implement this change, who are the teachers.  Their main question mark is over the balance between being adjudicators and advocates for their students and how this balance might be shifted.  I accept the point that we ask teachers to assess their own students in first year, second year and fifth year, and now we hope to do it in third year and we do not want 15 year olds to go into the workplace.  How do we strike the balance between advocacy and assessment?</p><p>  I assume that over the course of time we want to change the leaving certificate.  A problem at junior certificate is that 54,000 students do history at junior certificate level but only 11,000 do it at leaving certificate level whereas 54,000 students do honours geography at junior certificate level and 23,000 do it at leaving certificate level.  There is a problem with students not continuing with certain subjects to leaving certificate.  Is there a learning curve in this implementation as to how we might address the problem of the leaving certificate in the long term?</p></speech>

As a former teacher, as many of us are, I cannot but welcome the changes which will be initiated from September.  I understand much of the concern raised by the unions.  We all received letters from the ASTI prior to this meeting raising concerns.  The Minister has addressed some of them.  One of the big issues is uncertainty about the change.  We are a nation which can be slow to adapt to change.  Much fear among teachers is that the change will undermine existing education standards.  People need to be assured this will not be the case and they will certainly not be undermined.  We must ensure the junior cycle student award will be of the same standard and standing as what we have at present when moving away from the national examination.</p><p>  I have taught in vocational and secondary schools.  In the vocational school I examined my own junior certificate students in 1994 and did not come up against any problem.  However, I understand the concerns some teachers have.  It has been suggested the exams should be given to other schools in the town to be corrected, but I see a huge issue with this because there is so much competition between schools within a town for numbers.  This would be a huge problem.</p><p>  I welcome that more time will be allocated for continuing professional development.  Will much time be given prior to September as CPD should be given before the start of the new year and we are coming dangerously close to the end of the year?  We need to raise teacher confidence as much as possible.</p></speech>

I do not believe rote learning and memorisation warps education or progress in education.  I am in favour of it and I am in favour of the formalised mind.  Once one's mind is formalised, one can be as creative as one wants.  I wish to ask more general questions.  I have absolute respect for the Minister and his office.  Does he believe teachers are experts?  Does he believe the Department of Education and Skills is more of an expert?  What steps has he taken to resolve the outstanding differences with the teachers which continue to be evident?  The Department has sent out assessment criteria for English but the teachers still state they will not do it.  People always speak about change as though they are speaking about progress, but change does not always mean progress.  There is a big impasse as 64% of the TUI rejected it and 45% of the ASTI rejected it.  It was a 55% vote in all which is a big vote considering the Seanad was retained on 41%.  How have these outstanding differences been resolved?  Has there been contact?  Does the Minister believe he has trust in them and they have trust in him?</p></speech>

I do not believe we have plenty of time left.  We are in a political stalemate.  The unions have turned their backs on the Minister.  We are in an information vacuum which is making the situation worse.  I do not often say this but my PhD was in the area of instruction, curriculum and assessment.  All of the models I examined believed in the integrity of the professional and the teacher.  This follows what Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell stated, that we must have trust in their professionalism.  However, in all of the assessment models I examined there was a recommendation for an element of external assessment.  Will the Minister confirm he will examine an element of external moderation to ensure trust, confidence and, most especially, consistency of standard?  My recommendation is that 80% of scripts would be marked by the school while 20% would be marked externally, State-led, to ensure consistency of standard.</p> <p>Will the Minister confirm whether his Department is open to discussing the proposals for a robust and rigorous external assessment?  Will he commit to engaging with the partners to break the current stalemate?  Will posts be created to co-ordinate schools' internal assessments?  There has been no word on this matter yet, but the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recommended it.  Such a measure could overcome the impasse.  A co-ordinator of assessment post could be as important as a school's principalship.  I do not agree with the Minister that there is plenty of time.  He is embedding the problem by not moving.</p><p> The unions' banning of short courses is regrettable.  I was involved in designing the curriculum for the short course on Chinese language and culture.  I am appalled that the Minister is not providing teachers to roll out this course.  Will he elaborate?  What good is a curriculum without competent teachers?  In Galway, 23 schools are teaching Chinese language and culture through a unique, voluntary initiative that involves intern teachers from China working alongside Irish teachers.  There is an inequity.  One of the aspects the Minister used to sell this reform of short courses was the introduction of, for example, subjects like coding and Chinese language and culture, but we must provide the right teaching competence.</p><p> Some 90% of children take the leaving certificate exam.  The Minister has supported me in respect of early school leavers.  It is not fair to the 10% of children - sometimes up to 16% - who drop out early that they will not have taken a State exam.  It is a clear inequity.  We should not turn our backs on them.  They are the most disadvantaged children.  There are links between dropping out and crime and other social ills.</p></speech>

Students are stuck in the middle.  I understand that the teacher unions and the teachers themselves are nervous about change.  Change in education can be exciting and important, but it should also be treated carefully.  Each set of students only gets one run at first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth years.  A great deal of research has strongly and uncontentiously made the case that we need to change the junior certificate.  We have a serious problem with the grinds-focused leaving certificate.  From the first year of the junior cycle, children focus on getting enough points, picking their subjects and making decisions on their third level courses.  This will not change unless we are willing to examine the junior cycle.  I support the idea of having fewer third level courses and shaking up the CAO system, but as long as there is a State exam for 15 year olds, 12 year olds will be thinking about it.  That is wrong.</p><p>  There must be a compromise.  This is not neurosurgery.  I am surprised that the process has fallen down on the issue of assessment.  The real issue is resourcing.  The Joint Managerial Body hit on this in its submission.  The school managers have been discussing it as well.  I am concerned about it.  Will all schools have the resources to teach short courses?  Will it be equitable?  Will there be enough training?  The Minister mentioned 16 days, but will that be 16 days over the entire period to 2022?  Technology is another issue.  All of these questions are more important than assessments.  As Deputy Daly stated, the stakes in third level are much higher, in that one leaves with the degree that will determines one's job, yet exams there are marked by one's own lecturers.</p></speech>

I do not know why schools cannot swap exam papers.  They can be numbered, which is what is done in college.  Sometimes, one is taking a small course and one wonders whether, despite the anonymous number, the lecturer will still have a good idea as to whose paper he or she is marking.  There is external spot checking of papers to ensure there are no issues and standards are upheld.</p><p>  There must be a way to break through the impasse.  Third level has appeal systems and this is how it is done in other countries.  This situation has grown ridiculous and students are getting caught in the middle.  They do not know where they stand.  They are hearing that their English course is being changed, but that their English teachers will not co-operate with that change.  This is frightening for the young people to whom I have spoken.</p><p>  I urge the Minister to listen to people's concerns.  I call on the teacher unions to make a submission on the real issue, namely, resources.  We all need to know where we stand.  The next stage for our committee may be to hold a debate on the matter with the various partners.  Let us invite the unions to tease out the issue of resources and ask them to make a presentation, just as the management bodies have.</p><p>  Given the politics, it may be unusual for me to say I agree with the Minister, but I also agreed with and supported this reform when it was raised in the Seanad three years ago and I will not change my mind just because we are in a stand-off with the trade unions.  Our children matter.  They should be everyone's priority in this debate.</p></speech>

Many of my concerns have been raised, so I will await the replies.  Most of those present are former teachers and I will bow to their knowledge and experience, but I am a parent and I know what children go through when facing exams.  My son, who did 11 years in medical school between college and general practitioner, GP, training college, always says that the hardest exam he ever took was the leaving certificate.</p><p>  Children get sick, their nerves can take over or they can just have a bad day at the office when they take their exams, but at least the continuous assessment element would give them a chance to catch up.  It is vital for them to have that chance.</p><p>  I apologise for arriving late and my questions might already have been asked.  Students can change teachers a number of times during the three year period in question.  Will their final exams be set by different teachers or by the initial teachers?  It may sound simplistic, but the main concern parents have raised with me is the possibility that a teacher might not like a student.  It is a major issue.  It happens; there is no point in pretending it does not.  Sometimes, a teacher believes that a child who is too cocky needs to be put back in his or her place.  Perhaps the child has been disrespectful to the teacher.  There may be a conflict between a teacher and a child.  I presume an appeals system will be in place for those who believe that a child has been victimised, for want of a better word, by a teacher.  Teachers are professionals and I hope they are above such conduct.</p><p>  As has been stated, teachers already assess their own students at the highest level, that being, third level.  That system has never failed.  This reform will be successful if we can overcome the impasse.  Some people embrace change while others reject it.  In the heel of the hunt, the students will suffer if we do not get this issue sorted soon.</p></speech>

There will be a little bit of repetition.</p><p>  I will provide some facts first.  The change to the junior cycle has been on the cards for the past 25 years.</p> <p>The attempt to get the intermediate and group certificate merged into a new junior certificate was supposed to come with a change in the way the assessment would take place, but that did not happen, and the junior certificate basically became the new intermediate certificate.  The original National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, advice was rejected by both the teacher unions and they did not support the idea in principle.  They have been against the idea of a change in this system, which involves a change in the examination system, and they were opposed to the proposed changes in the curriculum.  I recognise the debate we had before and the broad support in both Houses of the Oireachtas for the principle of moving on.  Much of what has been said now was stated before.</p><p> Deputy McConalogue stated he is concerned for teachers, parents and pupils with regard to the independence of assessment, verification, certification and quality assurance.  I am prepared to discuss all of that.  Third level colleges have external examiners who provide quality assurance at the high, middle and low levels, and I have been involved with that with the school of architecture in UCD.  There are multiple models around the world we can consider.  This is what happens in different types of institutions at third level where there is continuous learning, and we are open to all such processes.  I have been confronted by two unions which have stated they will not take part in the process, and they have been saying that for 25 years.  It is a principle that they would not be judges of their own students but this is happening at the primary level, in so far as there is assessment at that level, and at third level, as we have heard.</p><p> On the specific question of history, we should nail a particular canard which, despite my frequent attempts, has not yet been dealt with.  There is one subject which the Department of Education and Skills has stated is mandatory, which is Gaeilge.  English and mathematics are required but not mandatory.  There are approximately 730 post-primary schools, including those which emerged from the free voluntary sector made up of religious teaching orders, brothers and sisters etc., which made it mandatory for their students to do history and geography at junior level.  They account for approximately 55% of the total number as there are approximately 400 of those schools.  The reality is that 90% of students take history at junior level.  I have not stopped history from being compulsory but if we start to make subjects mandatory, where would we stop?  We would like students, teachers and schools to exercise choice, and despite what has been stated by numerous people, I have not made history non-compulsory.  Anybody who knows me can see I take a particular interest in history anyway.  We want students and teachers to follow whatever subjects they consider of interest.</p><p> We will return to the issue of resources but I will first deal with the short courses.  We have introduced four voluntary short courses.  These were to be compulsory, and in deference to the concerns expressed by teacher unions and school management bodies, they are now voluntary.  We would like to get to the point where they can be available but we are not saying they are compulsory.</p><p> Deputy O'Brien raised some points regarding assessment.  In June 2017, when the first year students starting secondary school next September sit the English exam, the paper will have been set by the State Examinations Commission, and 60% of total marks will come from that paper, which will be marked by the State Examinations Commission in the normal way.  We can examine ways in which the process can be maintained to ensure a satisfactory transition.  There are issues around assessment of portfolios and storage and we would like to discuss them, but it is very difficult to do that with people who argue they are opposed to the issue in principle and will not speak to it.  Teacher representatives have come to meetings but unlike management bodies and others, they have not put in writing what they would like in terms of extra resources or different methods of assessment.</p><p> I am not sure of the precise nature of the question regarding special needs children for the priority learning units, PLUs.  The PLUs focus on developing social, pre-vocational and life skills of students.  There are five PLUs, which are communication and literacy, numeracy, personal care, living in a community and preparing for work.  I will revert with further information on that.</p><p> Deputy Daly asked how third level examinations are assessed by lecturers and teachers, and there are issues of quality assurance, anonymity and ensuring all the vulnerabilities arising from liking or disliking students can be addressed.  We can borrow from international experience in that regard and see what is happening in our own post-leaving certificate courses and elsewhere.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about teachers wanting to be advocates and not judges.  The language is strange as our children are not in a court of law or charged with anything.  They are not being judged and they do not need advocates.  They are getting very good teachers.  Senator Power referred to some of the research on which the issue is based.  These 12 year old students may come to a secondary school from different backgrounds, and the idea that they immediately have to get ready for the junior certificate in third year is distorting.  We have evidence from the Economic and Social Research Institute to suggest it is distorting a student's behaviour, how he or she will act and the interaction with education.  I have already addressed the issue of history and geography.</p><p> Senator Moran spoke about her response to the professionalism of teachers and the issue of communication from the two unions.  I carefully wrote down what the Senator said, with teachers indicating this process would undermine the education standards existing at present.</p></speech>

I will outline one of the reasons we are changing, using as an example the area we are talking about, secondary school teachers.  It is a highly unsatisfactory situation when a bright boy or girl, the star pupil - I am thinking of schools right across the country - leaves secondary school, goes to university, comes back after a three- or four-year degree, gets probated as a teacher in the same school, qualities in that school, joins the staff of that school and stays there throughout his or her career, without any other experience.  What I would like to see, and it will be a matter for discussion with the educational partners, is that somebody who wants to become a fully qualified secondary teacher, which is different from a primary school teacher for various reasons, will have experience of a wide range of schools before he or she is made full-time.  I think that we need that kind of experience.  We are also addressing the issue of employment conditions, which are outrageous at the moment.</p><p>  Senator O'Donnell asked whether I regard teachers as experts.  Yes, I do, but the level of expertise depends very much on the pedagogical skills that they have acquired along the way, which varies.  It varies much more in the secondary or post-primary space than it does with primary school teachers, because a primary school teacher, generally, has wanted to be a teacher from day one.  Not every post-primary teacher wanted to be a teacher on day one of his or her university education.  Some of them ended up teaching - and have become very good teachers - but there is a difference.  </p><p>  Senator Healy Eames talked about a number of things.  I know she has expertise in this area and it was her PhD topic.  So much is based on experience and best practice around the world.  All of which has been tapped into and is available to us.  We do this in order to avail of what lessons have been learned and what mistakes have been made so that we do not repeat the mistakes of others.  We are quite prepared to engage in all of that and to adopt an attitude of willingness to try something a particular way and if it does not work, as we anticipated, to be open to changes and modify things as we go along.  </p><p>  The Senator suggested a ratio of 20:80 for external moderation.  These are the kinds of thing we could discuss.  We could look at how it might be done regarding all of these issues.  However, I am confronted with the representatives of the two teachers' unions who simply said: "No.  We are opposed to this in principle and therefore we are not going to discuss the details."</p></speech>

It was felt that this was too much to ask at the present time, so we have made it voluntary, through nobody's fault.  The Haddington Road agreement concerned public sector pay, in the main, and had nothing as such to do with education.  One particular union found itself in a position in which it was reconsidering its attitude to the agreement, which put everything else on hold.  Therefore, time was lost in that regard.</p><p>  Senator Power talked about the very slow implementation of what we are doing.  I will not repeat the other concerns she expressed.  The Senator has consistently indicated her support for the steps we are taking.</p><p>  It seems to me - this would be true for a number of people - that there are concerns around two issues: first, the system of assessment and its validation and objectivity; and second, catching something over three years of a child's education, from 12 to 16 years of age, as distinct from the once-off leaving certificate examination, as Senator Moloney mentioned, and at the same time being objective in how we do so.  It is happening all around the world and it is happening in many other parts of our education system.  There is enough for us to learn from and take the best practice.  We will engage with the teachers' unions if they wish to get involved with us, and I hope they will consider doing so. </p><p>   Senator Moloney made an observation about her son, who has spent 11 years in the education system studying medicine.  On reflection, she thought the leaving certificate was the hardest exam of them all.  There are issues, which Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in talked about.  There will be knock-on changes to the leaving certificate as a result of two pressures.  The first is changes that we have asked for regarding the universities.  The CAO system will now have ten points of gradation instead of 14.  Also, the marking system, whereby one can be 2.5 percentage points away from going up or down by 5 points, will change.  We also hope that the third level institutions will reduce their bewildering number of level 8 courses.  There are now more than 1,100 such courses on offer, which is bewildering.  Ten years ago there were fewer than 500.</p><p>  We commissioned research from the Oxford University research centre regarding the unacceptable predictability of certain questions in exams, which turned out to be less of a problem than we had originally thought.  Oxford University is a near neighbour of ours and is on the other island, but it could not get over the amount of media coverage that surrounds the leaving certificate examination and the junior certificate examination, and the consequent pressure that puts on families.  As many as 60,000 young people sit the leaving certificate examination, but about 0.5 million people sit the exam in this country when we include their brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, etc.</p></speech>

Trust is terribly important, as he will know, particularly trust between him and the teachers and between the teachers and him.  Third-level education is one of the best examples of a situation in which people get educated in an organisation, qualify in an organisation, go back into the organisation and stay in it for the rest of their lives.  That happens constantly in third level, where postgraduates end up teaching and never move, so second level is not a good example.</p><p>  I want the Minister to talk to me about the trust idea.  Trust is very important and it is something that has been mentioned in the media.</p></speech>

As regards a formal exchange of views, the answer is &quot;No,&quot; because the union representatives have not been empowered by their members to engage <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I hope I will say this accurately, because there are representatives present from the two unions involved.  My understanding is that the unions are still at the point - members have seen the letter that was sent to every member of the Oireachtas - at which they are opposed to this suggestion in principle and, therefore, are not going to discuss any aspect of the detail.  I would like that to change.  I am open to hearing their legitimate concerns.  At the end of the day, they are expert in teaching and we are experts in politics in this room and this House.</p></speech>

The Department is open to and aware of all of these possibilities.  If we get engagement, we will be prepared to explore ways in which we can address teachers' concerns.  I recognise that people have legitimate concerns which are genuinely held.  It is not some kind of negotiating position.  These are legitimate and genuine concerns for many teachers.  They are afraid of coming under parental pressure and school pressure from principals who want to maintain standards in schools and examination results.  I have heard those things expressed to me by individual teachers from my own party and from other parties.  I recognise that these are real pressures and, therefore, real fears.  We are prepared to work to see how we can minimise them, if not eliminate them.</p></speech>

At the moment it will be a school certificate, similar to first year exam results or the report at the end of first, second or fifth year.  Transition year does not have an exam in the same way.  Many people have raised the concern that different certificates would not have the same standing - in other words, that one school in a town would have a better reputation or a stronger perception of academic excellence than another school, for example.</p> <p>Given that we do not want people to leave school at 15 years of age, we do not envisage the certificate being of that significance for people going for a job.  However, the concern has been expressed consistently by many people and I am open to discussing it.  </p></speech>

Now, I am an absolute advocate of the reforms, as proposed, to move away from the State exam.  The more I thought about it and the more I read about it, the more in favour of it I became.  My daughter is nine years of age and will be ten in the summer.  I do not want her to have to be under the kind of pressure that goes with a State exam when she is 15 years old.  I do not see the need for it and I do not understand why there needs to be that high-stakes exam at that stage.  If there was to be a compromise, could it be the Finnish model?  In that case, there is an external evaluation on a rolling basis, with samples that are moved through different subjects and different geographical areas.</p><p>  Many voices in favour of it are not being heard, even among teachers.  Schools involved in the pilot schemes, those involved in the process of planning for this and the consultation process organised by the NCCA and pupils are among those in favour of it.  That side of the argument is not getting enough publicity.</p><p>  I read a discussion document dealing with the transition from second to third level.  &Aacute;ine Hyland was the chair of the body involved.  I was one of the people who found it very difficult to get used to the change when I went to third level.  I struggled with third level although I came out of it okay and got my degree.  When I look back, I realise retrospectively that the problem was the change from rote learning into the environment in third level.  I felt I was thrown to the wolves and left to my own devices.  I managed to deal with it but that is an awful lot to expect when there is such a structured approach at second level.  The discussion document concerning transitions from second to third level said the reforms introduced in the junior certificate did not go far enough.  Teachers involved in the system reverted to type.  If we do not get rid of the State exam and really reform the system, everything will revert to type.</p></speech>

Can the Minister regain the trust and the communicative trust in the 55% of teachers in the ASTI and the TUI?  Maybe he does not want to regain the trust.  There is an impasse.  What moves has the Minister put in place to bring about that regaining of trust since the conference?  That is the reality and is locked into the timeline we have been speaking about.</p></speech>

I say this respectfully as a matter of record rather than opinion.  The two secondary school or post-primary teaching unions have been opposed in principle to any change in this area for the past 25 years.  The other stakeholders in this narrow space have engaged and have welcomed it in varying forms and sought clarification.  I agree with the point made by Senator Power about getting resources into it.  Resources will be needed to move to the system and it will be a challenge to get them.  We are talking about over 350,000 young people in the junior or senior cycles.  If we can engage in the detail of its implementation, I am open and flexible about the best way to implement it.  It is difficult to deal with people who say they are opposed to this in principle and will not engage.  When we look for participating schools through the NCCA to act as explorers of how it would be implemented, we sought 40 schools and got offers from 120 of the 730 schools in the system.  Different management bodies and different groups expressed interest, along with concerns about how it might work, what is needed and the implications.  These are all normal things and questions will continue to arise on matters we have not fully anticipated, coming from this starting point.  We will engage, as is the normal way of doing business.  Unfortunately, we are not in that place where we could start to explore those points.  I slowed down the implementation because of the concerns about resources. </p><p> Senator Healy Eames referred to concerns about short courses.  There are problems about that and we have made them non-compulsory.  Given everything else that was happening, it was an additional burden and concern for management bodies and representative school leaders.</p></speech>

Around the table, we acknowledge that resources are an issue.  Will the Minister appoint the co-ordinators of assessments for different schools?  When will the announcement be made?</p><p>  How good is the JCSA to the 10% of students who drop out before leaving certificate?  They are the most disadvantaged of the lot.  The Minister has a duty to ensure there is a State component to the exam so that it stands up internationally.  Our population is very mobile.</p></speech>

That was a political announcement and I took responsibility for it.  I said it at the ASTI conference last and, in so far as I was heard, at the conference this year I am open to discuss in detail the speed at which we travel, the best way to get there and the rest of it as long as no one has a veto on the destination.</p><p>  With regard to the figure of 10%, I commend the committee on examining the comprehensive five-year further education strategy programme launched by SOLAS.  For the first time in history of the State, we have an integrated and joined up further education system.  It is arguable that, in many cases, the 10% who drop out of the school system do not necessarily get the junior certificate examination result in the first instance.  There would possibly more appropriately move at 14 or 15 years of age into a vocational type combination of apprenticeship, on-the-job training and learning and off the job education, as is done in middle Europe and Austria.  The German Minister for Education at federal level has said that Germany will not move to the European target of 60% having graduated from universities because it has an alternative parallel system that works much better.  Youth unemployment and industrial output results in those countries are much better.  What we launched yesterday in the Chester Beatty Library is a properly linked up system.</p> <p>It will address the kinds of concerns many people - professional teachers in the area - have that the overtly academic approach to education, which is characteristic of the junior certificate in its present form, simply does not suit the interests and the attributes of those young people.</p></speech>

They were registered for the first time, following legislation passed in 2006.  We do not do education reform on the trot, or very quickly, in this country.  We do not sprint it.  If a teacher is not registered with the Teaching Council, he or she cannot be paid from taxpayers' money.  There were probably fewer than 1,500 delegates at the three conferences and of that 1,500, 1% to 3% caught the media in terms of response.  I do not regard that behaviour or that manifestation of aggression towards me as representative.  Every Minister for Education of whom I can think over the past ten to 15 years got not dissimilar treatment.  It is a matter for the unions-----</p></speech>

The two teachers' unions have a mandate from their members not to engage.  I think some may have suspected that I was going to make some kind of concession at the conferences.  We have established a working group, which the teachers' unions attend.  They are engaged but are not engaged adequately.  I have asked them to specifically state in writing what additional resources they would like, what changes they would like, etc.  I respect they are representing a wide spectrum of members.</p><p>  However, the other education partners have engaged.  I have received documentation back from the joint management bodies, the leaders of the principals and deputy principals and others.  I am prepared to address all of their concerns as best I can, provided we maintain the momentum of the reform of the junior cycle, as set out.</p></speech>

I asked a question about more CPD and what will be in place before September?  That was not addressed.  The headline in an NAPD press statement issued in 2012 read: "Let us be more courageous in our moves to reform Junior Cert".  It is talking about teaching students to learn rather than teaching students to pass examinations and that needs to be the new focus of the junior certification.  It is there in black and white.</p></speech>

What we need is critical thinking rather than rote learning, which was going on in my house last night.  I listened to French conversations being learned off because it is presumed they will be asked.  It is the same with Irish where there are so many picture stories, one of which will definitely come up in the examination.</p><p>  What is talked about is the feedback.  Marking copies or writing comments such as "work harder", "very good" or whatever are not sufficient.  We need to make more comments and give a better assessment.</p></speech>

The format in which it was delivered to English teachers in this instance, because that is the cohort group about whom we are talking, was that a year before the process started, they got one day, based on the likely changes, and then one day on a yearly basis, as they needed it, for the following three years, because it is first year, second year and third year.  It is tailored to the form in which they have received CPD in the past and it is, in total, four and a half days, which is spread out.  If that is not sufficient and they can demonstrate that to me and if I can persuade the Minister, Deputy Howlin, or if we can look for resources within the rest of the budget, we can be open to that.  If a convincing argument is made, I am open to it.  I do not have the resources currently to do it.  We have already made resources available.  As I said in my prepared remarks, it is &euro;4.6 million.</p></speech>

He made the point that day that assessment was not one of the strongest points in regard to the set of skills teachers currently have.  That was something he particularly referred to in his report.  Will he elaborate on that?  Does he have any thoughts in regard to where that leaves us with the current proposals for the new junior certificate?</p><p>  I mention the &euro;4.5 million the Minister has set aside for next year.  Will he give us a breakdown as to where that &euro;4.5 million will go?  The Minister mentioned that he is willing to talk to and work with others as long as it does not affect the momentum and that he can retain momentum.  The problem is that there has not been momentum because it has not been moving smoothly.  The Minister has been moving on but he has not been taking people with him.</p><p>  Is the Minister committed to discussing with teachers compromising on the issue of the independent assessment?  The concerns are very much about the maintenance of quality and standards in regard to the correction of the 60% element of the examination part of the new junior certificate.  Is the Minster sending that message to teachers that he is willing to compromise and talk about that?  That has not been forthcoming from the Minister.  He said he has said that to teachers but neither I, nor I think teachers, have heard that before.</p><p>  Like Senator Moran, I think a number of teachers at the ASTI conference let their colleagues down.  I do not think it was really education politics but wider politics outside the issues which were being discussed.  Unfortunately, they did a great disservice to other teachers at that conference by taking the focus off the important issues.  </p><p>  At the previous year's ASTI conference, the Minister described junior certificate reform as a personal political project.</p> <p>I remember the Minister saying at that conference that the destination was not up for discussion but that he would discuss what was happening along the way.  Unfortunately teachers believe that the Minister has been too authoritarian and dictatorial in his handling of this and that he has not been listening.  It is important that such listening now happens so that everybody can get back on board.  </p><p> I ask the Minister to clarify whether he is now willing to compromise on that point so that we can put a system in place which ensures consistent standards in terms of the marking of the new junior certificate student award.</p></speech>

Will there be some form of appeal or recheck mechanism in place for students who feel aggrieved?  That could potentially defuse a lot of the difficulties and could take a lot of pressure off teachers subsequent to issuing results.  There is a rechecking mechanism in place for the leaving certificate although there are problems with it, particularly in the context of timing.</p><p>  The primary certificate was discontinued long before my time and now what we will have, potentially, is a system where the first standardised marking of a student's work will take place after 14 years of formal education.  I have spoken to many people in the education system who believe that we should go back to having a standardised assessment after the first eight years of formal education, rather than after 11 or 14 years.  Can we put some checks and balances in place because after 14 years, it is too late.  If there is a glaring lack of performance by a student or number of students in a particular school, after 14 years it is too late for many of them to try to tackle that problem.  How does the Minister envisage addressing that issue?</p></speech>

We are all trying to achieve the same thing.  Change is always difficult, particularly when we have gotten used to doing things in a particular way.   In response to Deputy Griffin, there is constant assessment going on in our education system.  Kids are assessed in terms of literacy and numeracy at different stages right through primary school and now will be assessed at age 14 in post-primary school.  Many parents are aware of these assessments because they receive report cards every year.</p><p>  I signed off on a document today, which is the education passport which will have four sheets of paper in it.  I can provide copies to the committee members.  It is for youngsters leaving primary school to go on to post-primary school when they have been accepted by that school.  It has been refined to the point where the school will say "This is the level of young Brendan or young Rory", parents will be able to fill in a form outlining what they think are the strengths and attributes of the child and in addition, the 11 or 12 year olds can also fill in what they believe are their particular strengths.  There is regular assessing and testing and I do not think one can be a teacher without doing that all of the time, to ensure that what one is trying to convey is being received at the other side.  That is not the same as doing a formal examination which is marked.  Every education system needs a form of assessment and a final examination.  I am not entirely sure if Deputy Griffin is talking about an alternative to the current junior certificate examination.  Am I correct in saying that the Deputy was a teacher?</p></speech>

The question is whether one turns the assessment into a judgment that is used for third-party purposes by a student.  There is deep concern about that issue.  It is not the case that we do not have assessment until the leaving certificate at the end of 14 years.  Assessments for 14 year olds will now be part and parcel of the process and it will be conveyed to parents how their children are doing in English, maths and science.</p><p>  Regarding what Senator Healy Eames has said, I have said publicly on many occasions what I have said to this committee today.  I am not saying anything new here today that I have not said already.  I have simply said it repeatedly in response to different questions.  I am more than happy to sit down and talk to representatives of the trade unions along with the other stakeholders to see how we can advance the project.  Up until now, however, the union representatives have not engaged because they are opposed to this in principle.  It is very hard to get into committee stage of any type of discussion if there is opposition in principle but I have heard the concerns expressed by the teachers.  </p><p>  After 25 years of trying to get a new junior cycle, I do not think it is presumptuous or precipitous to suggest that there should be agreement in principle.  Deputy McConalogue attended the conferences where I said that I am prepared to negotiate how best to get there, at what speed, the navigation and so forth but the destination is replacing the current junior certificate State examination with a different kind of examination, which is set out in all of the documentation with which committee members are familiar.  We can do it in such a way so that it is monitored as it proceeds.  I have already slowed down the implementation of the process.  As I have said, there will be two more general elections before this process is finally completed.  In that context, I can hardly be accused of rushing it.  </p><p>  Finally, I would say to Deputy McConalogue - who is a member of Fianna F&aacute;il - that I do not recall former Deputy Donogh O'Malley engaging in extensive consultation and negotiation before announcing free education.</p></speech>

My daughter will do her junior certificate in a couple of weeks and another daughter will enter post-primary education in September and will be one of the first students who will experience the changes.</p><p>  I have spoken to parents who hold views at both ends of the spectrum.  There are concerns which members recognise.  The crux is that parents have respect for the teaching profession.  Parents have great trust in what a teacher tells them about their child's capabilities, their academic ability.  We go to the parent-teacher meetings.  We get the results of the Christmas and Easter exams.  We have faith and trust in what the teacher says, and rightly so, in my opinion.</p><p>  The parents at the school gate are listening to this debate.  Perhaps they do not get the nitty-gritty details of why the system is changing and the advantages of it, but they hear what the teachers say on the issues around the assessment and the lack of a State examination.  The Department holds the opposite view, that the abolition of the junior certificate is in the best interests of educational outcomes and children.  They are listening to two different messages.  There is a danger that unless there is complete confidence in the new assessment procedures which are being proposed, eventually over time one will undermine the confidence in a school certificate or the changes the Minister is proposing.  That could be detrimental in the longer term.  There is a great deal of work to be done, not just between teaching unions and the Department but also convincing students and their parents that what the Minister is proposing is in the best interests of their children in the longer term.</p><p>  If a teacher is saying that what is being proposed in terms of taking away the State examination element is not the way forward, there is a danger that it could undermine what the Minister is proposing.  There is a job of work to be done.  We have a role to play but I do not know how we will do it.  The Minister has stated he is willing to engage with the unions, subject to the fact that it will not block the momentum.  Speaking as a parent, I am not sure if that is the right course of action.  It is almost setting a precondition to any negotiations.  The Minister is saying that in terms of what is coming in and the timeframe for it, that it is happening in September 2014, he is willing to discuss resources and the concerns of teachers, but the Department is not changing its mind on what is being rolled out in September.  I do not know if that is the right course of action.  If everybody is going into negotiations and saying this is what we want to achieve, it may not be achieved by September.  What really frustrated me and one of the real frustrations for me as a parent in setting up the consultation that did not take place in January was that we were told by the Department that we could not set up the consultation groups on the roll-out and implementation of junior cycle reform because the unions were still balloting on the Haddington Road agreement.  I can understand the political context for that but parents at a school gate do not care if a union is involved in negotiations on the Haddington Road agreement, nor do they think it is right that the Department would not discuss the roll-out of junior cycle reform until a union signs up to it.  I think that was the wrong thing to do.</p><p>  Parents have significant concerns and I would not underestimate the potential of this concern to undermine everything the Minister is trying to achieve.  Teachers are highly respected and valued members of the wider community.  As one parent said to me: "I would trust what the teacher is telling me quicker than I will trust what a politician is telling me."  That is the reality.</p></speech>

I asked at the previous meeting if I could raise an issue today.  The Minister does not have to give me an answer today, but perhaps he will give a commitment to come back and discuss it.  It came as a great shock to all members of the committee when the Minister announced at the INTO conference that it would be a requirement for a student to have honours maths to do teacher training.  This is not on the agenda, but I ask the Minister to explain his thinking.  If he does not wish to address it today, will he give a commitment to come back in the very near future to discuss it in more detail?</p></speech>

Perhaps we can play a role as a committee in helping to end this impasse.</p></speech>

I said at the meeting last week that the Minister and his officials should come before the committee once every three months.  I know the Minister would be open to that suggestion, given his time schedule.  The committee should consider inviting the Minister to discuss educational policy and have a question and answer session.  Sometimes in the committee we do not get down to the policy issues, which we should be discussing.  I commend that and I ask the Minister to fit it into his schedule once every three or four months when we can have an open question session.</p></speech>

I am more than happy because I am learning all the time from what is being said.  I am at the disposal of the committee and it is up to the Chair to decide.  There is no reluctance on my part in that regard, as members will have seen over the past couple of years.<br />I have heard very clearly what Deputy O'Brien has said and I recognise that he is reporting accurately what he has heard.  I respect that.  One of the great strengths of our education system is the level of engagement that parents have directly with schools and with the teachers in those schools and the sense of trust that teachers have in parents and <i>vice versa</i>.  I would be loth to put this at risk and therefore I am concerned.<br />Unfortunately, the fact that the Haddington Road agreement was a public sector pay deal for 300,000 public sector workers, including Deputies and Senators, got in the way of an attempt to get these things going.  If we had attempted to keep talking, we would have run into a serious problem with the teaching profession or one of the unions in the teaching profession specifically because the other union in the post-primary sector had made a decision in relation to the Haddington Road agreement.<br />From the point of view of the parents, every subject the young person who takes first year classes next September does for the junior certificate in three years time will be the same with one exception, namely, English.  The curriculum for English by and large is a bit more specific than it is currently but it is essentially the same.  The exam they will sit in June 2017 will be set by the State Examinations Commissions and will be corrected and marked by the commission.  The maximum marks they can get from that will be 60%.</p> <p>Where we do not have agreement is on how the project work that makes up the assessment will be done.  All of us make presentations - we do it as politicians.  In any working environment there are presentations and collaboration.  Any of our children could be great at group working, and researching for and making a presentation of a project.  None of those attributes, which are essential for a maturing young person, are captured by our present examination system.  We are trying to find a system that will do that.  I will explore it with people.  There are professional educators on either side of me here who know far more than I will ever know about these things.  We are open to trying to capture what the modern 21st century young person's set of skill requirements is and how we assess that.</p><p> There is a proposal with the Teaching Council.  We require our primary schoolteachers to have a higher-level qualification in Gaeilge but not in mathematics.  The statistics from the State Examinations Commission that I was quoting show that 14 and 15-year old girls do higher level maths for the junior certificate examinations and then drop down to ordinary-level maths for the leaving certificate if they intend going to teacher training college because that is all that is required.  Young people are very smart at navigating the mountain that is the leaving certificate.  They will take the softest route.  That is one of the reasons that agricultural science, for example, is a very popular subject in the midst of urban areas where nobody has ever been on a farm.  It is because it is an easy subject to get high marks in the leaving certificate.</p><p> I was making the point that girls who have demonstrated the ability that they are well capable of doing higher-level maths and do it in the junior certificate, wanting to become schoolteachers decide to maximise their points - that may change with the with the incentivised extra 25 points now-----</p></speech>

It is essential that teachers leaving our teacher training colleges at the end of their initial teacher education have a high standard of maths.  I believe the Minister is coming at it from the wrong direction by changing the entry requirement from leaving certificate level.  I know there are initiatives in Marino and elsewhere to try to get more disadvantaged young people involved in education because we need them as role models in our communities.  However, some schools do not offer honours maths and that is an issue.  Equally we could lose good young people who could be passionate and brilliant teachers by requiring honours maths.  The best approach is through project maths and so that people are no longer petrified of honours maths and run screaming a million miles from it, leading to a problem with maths.  However, we need to deal with the problem with maths separately and we need to ensure that teachers leaving the colleges have adequate maths.</p></speech>

There is evidence in our inspections of teachers performing assessments, particularly the standardised tests.  The standardised tests that one of the other members mentioned have been introduced at second, fourth and sixth class levels in literacy and maths.</p><p>  As part of the junior cycle reforms they are also intended to be introduced at the post primary level in the year prior to doing the junior certificate examination - at the end of second year.  We will include standardised assessment in science as well as in literacy and numeracy, and also Irish in Irish-medium schools.  Based on the assessment information that comes out of standardised tests and other assessments, teachers have a poor ability to use that to plan the next stages of children's learning.  In the chief inspector's report we pointed out that if this was to be an area of CPD and teachers' professional development, it is an area that should be given priority.</p><p>  Within the junior cycle framework it is obviously necessary that much of the CPD will focus on assessment.  Most of the content of the teacher training programme for junior cycle for the year when the students are in the first, second and third years of the programme will be about assessment.  That is not just assessment in a terminal sense, but assessment as it goes along to support the learning of students.  That will for a very important part of the CPD programme.  The initial inputs for teacher CPD, such as what took place in this school year for English, had to concentrate on the changes to the syllabus - the content of the programme.</p></speech>

If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I advise delegates that the opening statements and any other documentation submitted to the committee may be published on its website at the conclusion of business.<br />The business of the meeting is to examine the general scheme of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill 2014.  We have invited a wide range of delegates to discuss the proposed legislation and the implications for the Dublin docklands and the communities living and businesses operating in the area.  This is very important legislation for them and we are very interested in hearing their views.  The legislation is important for the future development and sustainability of the Dublin docklands.  I invite the representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

I was appointed to my position on 27 March on secondment from Dublin City Council.  I am accompanied by Mr. John Crawley, financial adviser to the authority.  We will address the committee on the general scheme of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill 2014 which the authority welcomes.  Last week we submitted to the committee our opening statement to which I will make a very brief reference.  </p><p>  On 31 May 2012, when the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, announced the Government's intention to dissolve the authority, he envisaged that it would remain in place for a transitional period in order to wind up its existing operations, prepare the transition to new arrangements and make recommendations to him on appropriate structures for the future.  My remit as acting chief executive officer is to complete the winding up and transition process.  As outlined in the written submission, matters in this regard are well advanced and on track.  Issues are being addressed prior to finalisation of the winding up of the authority.  They include completion of a small number of remaining asset sales, including interest in subsidiaries and joint ventures; discharging the authority's remaining liabilities; dealing with and resolving, where possible, current litigation matters involving the authority; the formal transfer of infrastructure and certain assets to Dublin City Council; completion of final statutory accounts and the transfer of books and records intrastate.  I am satisfied that substantial progress has been made in all of the areas listed and that the remaining issues can be addressed in the coming weeks.</p><p>  As part of its remit, the authority has made recommendations to the Minister regarding the creation of a strategic development zone, SDZ, by Dublin City Council and this matter is awaiting a determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The authority also mandated the Docklands Council to consider an appropriate consultative structure to be formed following the dissolution of the authority.  The council's recommended structure for such a consultative framework is supported by the authority.  This structure is proposed in head 6 of the draft Bill.</p><p>  The Docklands Council also submitted a report to Dublin City Council in October 2013, outlining its priorities from the authority's 2008 master plan which the city council might consider for inclusion in any future policy framework for the wider 520 ha docklands area.  The authority understands Dublin City Council is proceeding to prepare a separate dedicated chapter in the current city development plan specifically centred on the docklands area.</p><p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the general scheme of the Bill.  Mr. Crawley and I will be happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Philip Maguire, deputy city manager, and Mr. Jim Keogan, executive manager in the planning department.</p><p>  In mid-2012 the Government announced its intention to wind up the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and replace the section 25 fast-track planning process with a section 34 strategic development zone, SDZ, planning scheme, with Dublin City Council as the nominated development agency.  Dublin City Council responded with alacrity, mobilising an intensive public consultation process involving the local community, local businesses, local landowners and relevant State agencies.  Following public display of a number of interactions on the draft SDZ plan, the city council adopted a final amended plan in November 2013.  The draft SDZ plan was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An oral hearing was held in March 2014 and a decision is expected shortly.</p><p>  The publication of the general scheme of the Bill is timely and welcome.  The Bill covers the essential matters of the winding up of the DDDA and transferring its powers, functions, assets and liabilities to Dublin City Council.  It also makes necessary provision for the city council to operate the SDZ and a transition between the section 25 planning arrangements and the new section 34 SDZ planning scheme.</p><p>  Dublin City Council is committed to ensuring the continued success of the social, economic, physical and environmental regeneration of the docklands and will work with relevant local and State parties to achieve this outcome.  The provisions included in the Bill for establishing a formal docklands forum as a committee of Dublin City Council representing all local interests, will, no doubt, streamline and facilitate this primary objective.  We thoroughly welcome the contents of the Bill and support its speedy enactment.</p></speech>

I presume Dublin City Council has had discussions with the Department.  How will head 6 be implemented?  Is there a need for more clarity regarding the establishment of the forum?</p></speech>

A number of options were considered by the DDDA and its council.  The employment of a mix of people representing the residents, those engaged in economic activity, education, statutory bodies, the city council and its officials was recommended and submitted, with the agreement of the council, to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This is set out in the Bill exactly as it was submitted.  Dublin City Council will have to make arrangements for nominations and the selection of individuals-----</p></speech>

For example, with regard to the appointment of members of fora, there are two distinct area committees in the docklands.  I do not want to put words in his mouth, but is it Mr. Maguire's interpretation that the two area committees will be the primary initiators of nominations?</p></speech>

For example, somebody in Ballymun would not have detailed knowledge of who was involved in the docklands.  If it is referred to a full city council meeting, it may not result in a true representation of the north-south dockland areas.</p> <p>I am sure the delegates have studied these proposals at length and in detail.  I simply want to ensure their interpretation is the same as mine in regard to the establishment of the community forum, namely, that it would go to the area committees for consideration first, before subsequently being confirmed by the city council.</p></speech>

It is also likely, because it is a planning issue, that the planning and economic development strategic policy committee, SPC, would wish to examine it.</p></speech>

Before that, it would be up to the council to draw up a set of criteria for selection.  A sub-group would then be established to go through the applications, and we might wish to meet applicants to see what they have to say.  We would then draft a provisional recommendation to be considered by the area committees and the SPC, with the proposal finally going to city council for decision.  As it would be a committee of the city council, the function of appointing its members is a reserved function of the council.</p></speech>

Off the top of my head, there seems to be quite an equal spread between north side and south side.  The comparative populations of the two areas is an issue we might consider in order to ensure we are being even-handed.  The forum will comprise community representatives, four councillors and representatives of five nominated organisations engaged in business and economic activity.  We have to devise a scheme that will ensure there is objective selection not just in respect of the community representatives, but all the other members as well.</p></speech>

Head 13 of the general scheme deals with the transfer of the authority's pension liabilities on its dissolution.  What are those pension liabilities and to whom will they transfer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Crawley" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014051300004#E01000"><p>The pension liabilities of the authority relate predominantly to the deferred pensions for past service of the 60 or so people who worked there over the course of its life.  They are a relatively young population and the liability is therefore deferred.  At the time of last valuation, the liability was somewhere between &euro;7.5 million and &euro;8 million.  That is the amount the State will need to pay out over a period of time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014051300004#E01300"><p>Would there not be a sum remaining, however, if the liabilities were transferred to the Department or the city council?  Specifically, would the authority not be left with a net sum of some &euro;5 million if it were not taking on the pension liabilities?  Most of the staff concerned have been on secondment from different agencies.</p></speech>

At this point in time, the administration and funding arrangements in regard to the deferred pensions have not been decided.  That is an issue for the Department to address.  From the State's point of view, these are people who have built up credits, and so a liability arises.  In round numbers, we are looking at &euro;7.5 million.  There are moving parts in our numbers at this time, but we expect that the authority as a stand-alone entity will have some &euro;5 million available to distribute to its shareholder, that is, the Department.  The Department has already assumed responsibility for the &euro;7.5 million liability, but in net terms that liability will be &euro;2.5 million.  There is a practical process issue as to how that liability will be funded into the future, which rests with the Department.</p></speech>

There have been some very good outcomes in the docklands in terms of social housing programmes and the educational programmes that were run through the schools.  However, to operate a proper social regeneration programmes requires cash.  My question is whether there might be a surplus following the wind-up of the authority which could be ring-fenced for this purpose were the pension liabilities not to fall to the authority itself.  I assume most of the liability relates to younger people, as Mr. Crawley suggested, which means it will probably fall in ten years time or so.</p></speech>

Some &euro;2.5 million of the total arises in the next ten calendar years.</p></speech>

The legislation in regard to SDZs allows only for capital investment and much of the funding going into communities on both the north and south sides of the docklands relates to educational programmes, youth programmes and employment and training initiatives, which does not fall down.  I am wondering whether there is some wriggle room there.</p><p>  NAMA is a substantial property holder in the docklands area.  I am sure it would be interested in participating in what might be called Rolls Royce developments to show what can be done to kick-start development in the area.  Have Mr. Crawley and his colleagues had any discussions with NAMA on the possibly making a sum of money available that could be ring-fenced for social regeneration, in order to give the indigenous community a dividend from the development happening in the area through the various programmes?</p></speech>

We have a liability to NAMA in respect of some old debts from previous years.  We are at an early stage of discussing the resolution of those debts with the authority.  Taking all of the moving parts together, the thing does not quite balance at the moment.  To say that we have talked to NAMA about putting a badge on it is not true at this point in time.</p> <p>We have just considered the totality of our liabilities.  In that context, there are liabilities both inside and outside of NAMA.  We have opened discussions with NAMA in order to discover whether anything can be done about the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014051300005#F00200"><p>The two liabilities that were discharged against the interests of communities were the site for the school on the north side and plot 8 on the south side.  These were supposed to be part of the social dividend for the communities in question.  There is a very strong case for NAMA to step up to the mark in this matter.  As far as I am concerned, the sites in question, which had already been allocated when all of this began, were taken away from the communities.  I ask that before we conclude the process relating to the proposed legislation before us, Mr. Crawley should correspond further with the clerk to the committee to explore whether some wriggle room exists with regard to the pension fund issue.  In the context of the site for the school and plot 8, I am sure those involved would like to kick-start development.  Given that is already a trust within the docklands area which operates very successfully, I am of the view that, particularly as there is no money available, we should consider establishing a trust model in this instance.</p><p>  I do not intend to embarrass Mr. Clegg, the acting CEO, but will Mr. Keegan indicate whether he will hold a position such as assistant city manager when the DDDA is subsumed into Dublin City Council?  If the docklands area falls down the pecking order and if whomever has responsibility for it does not have sufficient authority, the drive that is required for progress to be made will not be forthcoming.  What position will the person responsible for managing the docklands area hold within the city council?</p></speech>

The Dublin Docklands Development Authority is being abolished and Dublin City Council will be assuming its responsibilities.  Overall, I will be the manager with responsibility for the docklands.  It will be within the existing management structure of the city council.  I will be allocating staff to it.  As an interim arrangement, we have assigned an executive manager and other professional and administrative staff will be allocated.  There will not be a distinct and separate entity within the city council with responsibility for the docklands, just as there are no longer such entities for Ballymun or Temple Bar.  It will be part of the city council.</p></speech>

In my opinion, the docklands area is probably going to drive development within the city during the next five years.  There must be a structure put in place to deal with the part of the area on the north side and those on the south side.  The current structure involves two distinct area committees.  What structure does the city council intend to put in place?  Will it be a one-stop-shop?  There is going to be a strategic development zone, SDZ, in respect of the docklands area and this will straddle the River Liffey.  How will this fit into the structures of the city council?  There is a great deal of money to be invested in infrastructure within the docklands and there will be levies.  Will the money obtained via those levies disappear into Dublin City Council's general pot?  I am not stating that the docklands should gain at the expense of the remainder of the city.  At present, however, FDI companies are looking to establish operations in that area.  I am seeking from Mr. Keegan some form of reassurance to the effect that Dublin City Council has the drive and ambition necessary in respect of the docklands in the context of FDI companies and local communities.  I am of the view that social generation, in the true sense, must happen within the city.  I would be worried if the docklands area is just going to be treated in the same way as Temple Bar and other areas.</p></speech>

There will be a dedicated unit which will be responsible for the docklands.  We would need this in any event as a development agency under the SDZ and in terms of the wider docklands agenda we want to advance.  Staff have already been appointed to the unit and more will be allocated.  There will not be a chief executive, as such, but somebody will be placed in charge of the unit.  I have not made a decision yet as to the nature of the grade that the individual will hold.  For the moment we have assigned an executive manager to handle the transition.  That person is likely to remain in place for the next six to 12 months.  At that point, I will be obliged to take a view on the matter.  I will ask Mr. Maguire to comment on levies.</p></speech>

If one takes it that Irish Water will finance the investment it needs to make and that the NTA will pay for things such as bridges and other items of infrastructure, then the actual spend required in respect of flood prevent measures, the public realm, parks, etc., is &euro;55 million.  This means there is a net deficit of &euro;10 million between what is required to be spent and what will be yielded up from levies.  Obviously, that money will be collected over a period.  However, the intention is that much of the infrastructural spending required would be front-loaded.  In other words, it would have to be done early in order to facilitate the roll-out of the agreement.  Rather than the docklands subsidising the remainder of the city, it will - at least in the short term - be obliged to subsidise the docklands.</p></speech>

The docklands is a prime area of Dublin and we must ensure that its potential is exploited for the benefit of the entire city.  It is taking quite some time to dissolve the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Its dissolution was first mooted in 2012 and I would have thought that it would have been signed, sealed and delivered by this point.  There are probably good reasons that this has not proven to be the case but will our guests indicate whether there are any barriers to dissolution?  I thought that when Professor Niamh Brennan took over, the authority would be wound up quite quickly.</p><p>  I am of the view that great potential exists with regard to joined-up thinking involving local enterprise offices, LEOs, and Dublin City Council in respect of the docklands, particularly in the context of enterprise, the residential side and inward investment.  Will Mr. Keegan comment on how he sees the link between the LEOs and the council developing?</p><p>  The proposed Bill will ensure that ordinary people will be represented on the community forum.  This must be set in stone in order that members of local communities will be able to attend meetings of the forum, as of right.  Community representatives must be made aware of when meetings will be held, the structures that will be put in place and so on.  How much progress has been made in respect of this matter to date?</p><p>  Obviously, some of the assets have already been realised.  Deputy Kevin Humphreys inquired about those which have yet to be realised and also about development levies.  I was a member of South Dublin County Council for almost 20 years and I am aware that it is extremely difficult to ring-fence development levies in respect of a particular area.</p><p>  The docklands area is hopefully going to be the jewel in the city's crown in the coming years.  It was the subject of a great deal of bad news as well as good in the past and, of course, a great deal of money was wasted there.</p> <p>We do not want to see anything like that happen again.  Hopefully, it is now under the control of the city council.  I know where Deputy Humphreys is coming from when he asked who will be in charge and where will the buck stop.  It will be an arm of Dublin City Council.  I do not see there being a role for another semi-authority.  This Bill is about dissolving an authority and we do not want to set up anything like another authority.  It must be all-arching and pull the strands together, but there must be somebody who is responsible.  I know the city manager is very busy and the buck will stop with him but there must be a person responsible, whatever title they hold and it will not be that of a CEO.  We do not want an agency or furniture, so to speak; we want people who are responsible, in a named manner, in respect of whom we can say the buck stops with them.  That relates to some of the questions Deputy Humphreys asked.  <br />Regarding the progress update given in the report, I welcome  that the strategic development zones, SDZs, have worked well.  The first one I worked on was the SDZ in Lucan with South Dublin County Council.  It was a fantastic opportunity to work on that and to see how it could operate, and it worked very well.  I am not sure if it was the first one in Ireland but it was one of the best.  That should work very well. <br />I would like to see a print-out from the council, similar to what we got from Irish Water today, detailing the projects, what it has in line and its assets and liabilities - a balance sheet as it were.  It has given us the report but I would like to have more detail so that if one were to walk around the docklands site, one would be able to know from a report which building is which -  what is being proposed for one building or that a building is going to be sold through NAMA and all of that.  It is not my area, although in the Seanad all of Ireland is my area, but not having served on Dublin City Council, I would not be as <i>au fait</i>with the buildings on the site and what is proposed for where as Deputy Humphreys would be.  I wish the council well.  I hope it is in operation very soon and I wish it good luck with it all.</p></speech>

I will answer the Deputy's final point first.  Neither Dublin City Council nor the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has landholdings in the area.  Private individuals own lands and NAMA owns the loans on certain lands which are subject to receivership and, obviously with regard to the law of receivership, it has to maximise the value.  That deals with that point.</p><p>  We, as either a city council or an SDZ agency, will not be developing office blocks.  We will market, provide infrastructure and work with other State agencies to facilitate that.</p></speech>

The council is the planning agent for the area.  Projects should be planning-led, not developer-led, as the latter is what caused us to go down the Swanee previously.  In that context, I am not saying it applies to us or even to the council, but throughout Ireland we saw many developer-led projects.  This must be project-led and that is what the council is there for.</p></speech>

There is a most comprehensive document in this respect.  I will answer this point in context of the comment the Senator made about the delay.  It was just before Christmas 2012 that we got the actual direction from Government to proceed with the SDZ.  We had jumped the gun in anticipation of that and for the previous three or four months we had been engaged in public consultation, particularly with the communities, the business people and the State agencies and that process has been running and that continued.  We had the first iteration of the SDZ plan on public display in March and it went through public consultation.  We got submissions and they were circulated with the manager's report.  All that happened.  There were motions in from the council and the plan we put on display was changed as a result of those motions.  It went out, I think in June or July, for further public consultation.  It went around the mulberry bush again and we adopted the plan at the end of November 2013.  The best estimate most planning consultants had put on it was that it would be the end of this year before we could possibly have a plan ready for adoption.  We were more than pleased to get it done so rigorously and yet so efficiently.  It is in no small measure due to Dick Gleeson, John O'Hara and the chief planners and their team.</p></speech>

The question I asked related to the dissolution of the authority.  There is still an interim authority there holding the hand of Dublin City Council.  Every SDZ goes through, and that one would have gone through without a board because it is statutorily laid down how the SDZs are done and that procedure would have been followed.

The DDDA has no function in regard to the SDZ.  What is happening is that the Bill will do two things, and the Senator is correct in that respect.  First, as it says on the lid, it will wind up the DDDA.  Second, it will establish the final pieces of the SDZ for Dublin City Council.  It is a matter for Government and for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will appear before the committee to deal with the legislation.  We processed the SDZ in as tight a frame as was possible and An Bord Plean&aacute;la responded and held its oral hearing in March.  It was seven days of an oral hearing and all the people here got a chance to go in and say what they had to say to the inspector.  Our understanding is that he has completed his report and submitted it to the board.  It is now a matter for the board and consequently I will say no more about the SDZ because it is <i>sub judice</i>.  The processing of the legislation is a matter for Government and for the Oireachtas to proceed with.  We have gone through the detail of the legislation on a number of occasions and it covers all the bases as far as we are concerned.  We would be happy to see it enacted as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The authority has substantially resolved all significant litigation.  It had a very significant piece of litigation running for a number of years, taken by one of the joint venture partners, Bernard McNamara, who was involved in the Irish Glass Bottle site development.  That litigation was successfully concluded in early 2013.  It was a cashless win unfortunately for the State, because although we successfully concluded the case and were awarded costs, unfortunately, the joint venture partner is bankrupt.  Therefore, the State will not have an opportunity to recover those costs.</p><p>  At any point in time there will be a number of litigation or threatened litigation cases against anybody and the docklands authority is no different.  We have provided against all of those in our accounts to the extent that we consider that it is reasonable to assume that liability will arise.  We have not made any class of a significant provision in relation to those cases.</p> <p>We have a number of disputes with various people which are ongoing because of projects in which we were previously involved.  We believe they will be successfully resolved.  There will be a number of cases that will remain outstanding on the wind-up of the authority, if we assume it is wound up in the foreseeable future.  We are working with the law department of Dublin City Council, DCC, and with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to assess those cases to make sure that Dublin City Council is the logical place to transfer those cases, to the extent that they relate to local authority-type issues.  We also wish to ensure there is sufficient briefing in place and sufficient funding in the event that a liability will arise.  As we speak &ndash; touch wood &ndash; we are in reasonable shape in terms of outstanding liabilities.</p></speech>

I do not see those difficulties arising again.  We have been through a very difficult period.  We met all our liabilities.  As a city council we have not had to be rescued or bailed out by anybody.  We bought a lot of land for social housing purposes and had to fund it.  Those schemes are not going ahead.  We have some major capital projects with which some members will be familiar that have not been realised but we have managed to do that without any recourse to external support.  I am very confident that we can look forward to our stewardship of the docklands area with the same prudent management approach, with no risk to outside parties.</p></speech>

The Dublin Docklands Authority, DDA, came up with the 20% social and affordable housing from the community forum.  There was a housing strategy in the master plan.  Dublin City Council&rsquo;s housing strategy was not that successful, in that it took off-site provision, where on-site provision was made in the docklands area and we were able to keep communities intact.  Could Mr. Maguire outline his intention on the housing strategy in terms of 20% social and affordable housing?</p></speech>

It is not possible through either planning legislation or SDZ legislation to amend a Part 5 scheme.  It is a reserved function of the city council.  In the next couple of weeks we will have a new council.  My understanding is that the city council intends to review existing Part 5 schemes.  At the moment we have a single Part 5 scheme.  That is the only scheme we can operate throughout the city.</p></speech>

Has the council considered a reserve of local employment?  There was a 20% clause originally in the DDA plan.  I would like to see long-term job guarantees.  Mr. Maguire said a community liaison officer has been appointed.  It is one thing to talk to communities but delivering for them is another matter.  Employment and housing are two areas that are badly needed in the north docks and south docks area for the indigenous communities.</p></speech>

As we own little or no land in the area we will not develop projects and we will not be the employing contractor.  We are not able to affect contracts as we cannot put into planning permissions anything other than planning conditions.  However, we recognise that while we will deliver for the area some 25,000 jobs it is important for the local community that there is education and training and that we work with contractors to facilitate the delivery of benefits to the communities.  As the agency responsible, when developments are being carried out it is our intention to work with developers and contractors to try to maximise local employment.</p></speech>

Reference was also made to a very complicated clawback scheme.  Does he have suggestions on how we could tidy that up through legislation or would he enter into discussions with the Department to develop recommendations on the matter?</p></speech>

In terms of the context, the docklands area has an affordable housing scheme under the legislation governing it.  A number of people have bought affordable homes, some of whom have clawback arrangements as part of their purchase.  The clawback arrangements arose because people bought properties at discounts.  The objective of the scheme in the first place was to discourage people from flipping properties and to benefit people who were long-stay in the area, which is why the clawback reduces over a 20-year period to encourage locals.</p><p>  When the scheme was developed, in truth, nobody thought of a scenario where house prices would fall, more importantly, they thought they would continue to rise.  Therefore, an issue arises where property values have fallen, although interestingly in the docklands area we are seeing them rise back up again, and we are not seeing as much pressure from people in affordable schemes.  None the less, a situation can arise where the properties can fall in value and there could be a clawback that has still to come back to the authority.  That is a legal requirement.  It gets the authority into difficulty to try to forgive that although we have put in place arrangements to allow people to rent their properties in the event that the situation arises.</p><p>  The scheme is at variance with the rest of the affordable housing elsewhere in the country.  We have brought that to the attention of the Department.  It is not currently dealt with in the heads of the Bill.  It is probably something one would need to raise with the Department when the officials are before the committee next week.  We have identified the issues.  We have identified some cases where it manifests itself in a financial difficulty, slightly less so now because the market has moved on but at the same time it also recognises that people have entered into legal agreements.  To be fair to other people who live in the same accommodation and possibly did not buy at affordable prices we cannot seem to benefit one buyer over the other but it is a bit of a minefield area and we have given a full brief to the Department.  Deputy Humphreys could possibly take up the matter with the Department next week.</p></speech>

It is a complicated issue.  The vast majority of residents in affordable housing have no intention of flipping, as Mr. Crawley put it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as time passes families grow and marriages break down.  A small number of people are in great difficulty because of the particular model.  Nobody expected that property prices would drop to such an extent, and renting is a short-term, not a long-term, option.  I know a family on the north side with three children who are living in a one-bedroom apartment and cannot move because of the clawback arrangement.</p></speech>

I certainly know the representatives from the Dublin Port Company.  I also welcome Mr. John Treacy, Mr. Ciaran Flanagan, Mr. Nicholas Cloake and Mr. Alan Robinson who are representing the Docklands Business Forum.  The meeting is informal and there will be no interrogation as the delegates are not appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts or anything like it.  Their attendance is welcome.  They have a keen interest in the docklands area in which their businesses are located and they work strongly with the community.  Certainly, the festival initiated in the docklands by the Docklands Business Forum has been highly successful and gone from strength to strength.<br />I draw attention the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.</p> <p>If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that the opening statements and any other documentation submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website on the conclusion of this afternoon's business.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The witnesses may wish to make a submission.</p></speech>

At that time, one will see hundreds of young, well qualified, well paid workers stepping out of the Google offices, getting into taxis and paying for their fares, getting onto the DART and paying for their fares, going to local apartments which they are renting or on which they are paying a mortgage, or going to the local shops and buying produce.  It is a real microcosm of what is happening all over the docklands with these companies having arrived.  Beyond that, there are hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises that have set up because of the existence of these companies and they are supplying the companies with products and services.  Docklands is an important place, particularly from a commercial point of view.</p><p>  We are a voluntary association of business people.  We have neither an office nor an executive, but we do have a great deal of passion about the docklands and what it can achieve.  We promote enterprise positively and all the positive things that enterprise can do with our docklands business awards.  We also have created a list of the 500 plus businesses that exist within the docklands.  Believe it or not, before we started there was no such list.  We thank the Dublin City Enterprise Board for supporting us on that.</p><p>  We also promote the docklands as a place to visit and enjoy.  It is an oft ignored area of the city.  Many who have been resident in the city for decades are not familiar with what the docklands has and can offer.  We have taken over from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, in terms of those promotions.  The authority asked us to do it.</p><p>  Now we have two festivals.  The first is title-sponsored by Waterways Ireland and at our third event last year, there were more than 80,000 in attendance.  The second, title-sponsored by the Dublin Port Company, is the Dublin Port Riverfest.  Last year, we held our first event on a derelict area of North Wall Quay at which there were 38,500 in attendance.  That gives an idea of the remarkable things that can be done in docklands with the existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

As we sit here, the next Twitter, Google or Facebook is in Dublin docklands trying to grow and, from our perspective and our experience from chatting to our members, we could be doing so much more to help that.</p><p>  According to our research and analysis, the docklands can hold another 25,000 to 35,000 jobs.  While it will do that, the question is whether that will be in two years or 20 years time.  This employment will add millions of euro in PAYE, PRSI, rates, VAT and corporation tax and that all will help speed up national recovery.  From our perspective, however, we need to be doing so much more.</p><p>  There are incredible incubators and accelerators, such as Wayra, Dogpatch and HealthXL, and we have star companies crying out to grow, such as Realex Payments, Ancestry.com, Ultimate Rugby, Nurse Buddy and Logentries, but we are just missing some of the old resources that were there previously.  The DDDA, which, as we all will be aware, made some mistakes, in fairness, had fantastic resources to be that catalyst in the docklands to join small companies with big companies, connect supply and demand, and facilitate growth.</p><p>  From the dissolution Bill, the consultative forum will need more specific powers and more specific budget influence, and it needs to be representative of large companies, small companies, traditional industry, the Internet companies but also these start-up hubs.  We would welcome the committee's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

It has provided many jobs over the past number of years and generates significant revenues for the State.</p><p>  We estimate that there are over 500 business, from Fortune 500 companies to small SMEs, many employees of which work, live and socialise in the area.  As Mr. Treacy stated, it recently has become synonymous with technology start-ups and the phrase "Silicon Docks" has been coined and has been discussed at many meetings I have held on commercial projects in the past year.</p><p>  In reality, what we have in the docklands is a business brand.  It is a brand that requires nurturing, promoting and managing and we see ourselves as managers, custodians and promoters of this docklands brand.  We believe that we hold the position of being the voice of business within Dublin's docklands and we have been doing that successfully for five years.</p></speech>

It has developed engagement with the docklands for employees and corporations, and represents a bridge between the local population and the business community in many different ways.</p><p>  We have the willingness, the intention and the enthusiasm to continue to build, not only bridges but project successes.  We are engaging with Dublin Port, Waterways Ireland, Dublin City Council and various Departments to activate many significant projects.</p><p>  One of those projects, for example, is the opening of the Camden Lock, which has been closed for generations but which, if opened, will allow large vessels and yachts to enter the basin.  This, in turn, allow more wealthy international visitors and tourist opportunities.  We believe this will attract an additional 150,000 visitors from overseas into the basin each year and additional revenue of at least &euro;12 million per annum.  This is merely one of a wide number of projects which we have discussed, are progressing and are committed to, but all of this work is being done on a voluntary basis.  Support for a full-time office would mean a stronger business, Government and local relationship, and a fast-track for important job creation projects.</p></speech>

As the cornerstone of our master plan, we focus on integration with the city.  We have had an involvement with the DDDA.  We have had two members from Dublin Port Company sitting on the board and the chief executive sat on the council.  From Dublin Port's perspective, that level of interaction, engagement and consultation is critically important in future.</p></speech>

The new representative structure is being renewed.  While there will be more representatives from business and employers, we are a little worried about how this will feed into Dublin City Council representation regarding the north side and south side.  It is still a little unclear, so we would like to have a greater understanding.  With regard to powers, the influence on the budget and the mix of expenditure across the areas of jobs, education and culture must be borne in mind.</p></speech>

With regard to the strategic development zone, its capital funding and infrastructure, there is no clarity at this stage.  I would welcome the delegation's views on this.  The authority has been very much involved in the social regeneration of the docklands, as it has shown in its slides.  This requires funding.  Mr. Treacy referred to a specific office, but this requires funding also.  Have the delegates views on how that funding would be put in place?</p></speech>

There are development levies and a number of ways by which the old authority used to raise funds for all the projects.  I would imagine that the most effective funding mechanisms could be explored by the new entity.</p></speech>

Is this still regarded as a viable option for the area?</p></speech>

There is a funding model in Dublin city centre that seems to work.  Currently, our preference is to examine that.  Through our research, we are so deeply immersed in determining what activities help to promote networking, job creation and micro-economy business that it is probably the better way for us to go.  It is a question of scaling up what we have before considering a bids system.</p></speech>

The docklands does not face those challenges.  I refer to the level of antisocial behaviour, for instance, and the amount of graffiti that featured in the city centre.</p><p>  The other model to be borne in mind - that of promoting Temple Bar as a cultural centre - does not exactly fit with the docklands.  What we are trying to do is to come up with our own organically grown system that is most effective in responding to the challenges faced by the docklands.</p></speech>

There is flexibility within the bid system in that one can design one's own bid with the local community.  It boils down to what would be covered; it involves a very detailed contract with the local authority, the city council.  There is no grey area.  I am sure the delegates examined the contract that was signed by the city centre businesses and the city council.  It is so detailed that it refers to how often road signs should be washed.  One would not get into this level of detail regarding the docklands.  A different model for investment within the community might be involved.</p></speech>

I refer to employers that have very significant corporate social responsibility objectives, strategies and budgets.  A unique entity is required to build the necessary relationships and think about bite-sized projects that will work for both the brand and the local area.  This is a unique opportunity and challenge but it would be fantastic for the docklands to be at a stage at which the entity could get to the office-and-staff stage and approach the interested parties on a more systematic basis.</p></speech>

One of the things that worked very well in the docklands development was the social regeneration package, which resulted in community gain.  It fast-tracked the emphasis on planning and getting things moving very sensibly and quickly within the docklands.</p><p>  The master plan is still in place.  I have not tried to delve into the question of powers, but I cannot ascertain what real powers the committee will have as a sub-committee of Dublin City Council; it may have no powers at all.  It may be that we will just talk, on foot of which some advice may be taken on board.  I am not too sure.  To me, it has no powers as it stands.  However, the docklands council had power in that it passed and agreed a master plan for how the whole area would grow.</p><p>  The other problem I have with the committee in question is that its term does not seem to be defined.  It is not stated that I should serve for five years or ten years.  I could be a member for the rest of my life, for all I know.  Since the master plan represents a good concept, why not keep it in place?  Why not have a master plan for the area that could be endorsed by the committee and reviewed every five years?  This would allow for renewal of the committee every five years.  Continuity could be ensured by having some members stay on, while others would step down.</p><p>  The master plan was a good concept and worked well for the area, especially in the area of social regeneration.  We were told at the very beginning that businesses would not move into the area if we were too prescriptive in imposing levies on businesses.  We could not stop people from moving in; people wanted to develop.  While developers have a bad name at present, the point is that the developer-driven economy grew the local economy at the time.  However, we need to examine a new concept for developers coming in and whether there is a development levy that will assist in the development of the social infrastructure.  The committee should have power regarding the master plan and its enforcement over the five-year period.  Since the master plan concept is in place, let us keep it.</p></speech>

Any committee that will be set up by the council will, therefore, have a lifespan of only five years. This period is tied to the period between local elections.</p></speech>

A committee established by a local authority falls at the same time as the local authority itself.  Even the councillors on the former docklands council had a term of five years.  The appointments made by the city council last only for the lifetime of that council.  The membership is reformulated after every five-year period.  I would imagine this would be in the detail of the Bill.</p><p>  With regard to the Dublin Port aspect, an interesting additional submission might require a policy statement every five years by the new council, which statement would serve as a guiding influence over the five-year term.  Bearing in mind both community and business interests, it would be expected that the council would adhere as closely as possible to the policy statement over the five-year term.  Perhaps it could be provided for in the legislation.</p></speech>

It is in effect the same thing, as the people are the same.  In our opening statement, we suggested a term limit for individuals of five to ten years to ensure that we keep renewing a level of energy, enthusiasm and ideas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014051300012#N00200"><p>From experience, I expect the detail of the legislation to include a provision for five years.  That is what ties in with the local authority.  Normally, a local authority is not allowed to appoint a person who exceeds its term of office.  The new council will have a life of five years and the next council has the right to appoint.  The structure of appointments will involve the same mechanism.  The same people may very well be appointed, or the same groups will be the source of appointments while the individuals change.  It is a good thing to bring in new blood every five years, but not a total change.  There should be some continuity, especially on a body that will last for ten, 15 or 20 years.  It will be a matter for the nominating groups to provide for that continuity rather than the local authority.</p></speech>

It is very vague.  It is important that some guidance be given to Dublin City Council in a number of areas.  The Bill sets out that the four councillors to be appointed must be from wards within the docklands area in full or in part.  It does not make the same stipulation for residents' groups and business people.  It does not make the stipulation that a residents' group must be located in or have an interest in the docklands.  It does not state that a business person must have a location or interest in the docklands.  In consequence, the default box-ticking stakeholders will come in who are appointed from national or even city-wide groups and associations.  As a result, while a senior person will attend the first meeting, a junior person will attend every meeting after that.  Business representatives from certain organisations will just sit there with little knowledge of what is going on and what the interactions are about.  It will be the same with residents' groups where they do not have a local interest.  It is very important that a little more effort, thought and reflection goes into where these people are going to be coming from.</p></speech>

They can then form part of the information and evidence we provide to the Department.  I was on the docklands council and had the experience that while there were some very good business people who were very involved and proactive, there were also passive members.  Speaking as a docklander who grew up in Ringsend, we want people who have a keen interest.  It is important to have people who are really interested in the development of the docklands community as an entity and in ensuring the vibrancy is retained.  That vibrancy involves both the business and residential communities.</p><p>  On future development, it has been as if someone pressed pause for the last two or three years.  I am on Barrow Street most days of the week, where one can see the vibrancy that is happening in Grand Canal Dock.  From a business perspective, how does one get that same vibrancy back into the indigenous community?  Mr. Robinson's group has already played a very substantial role in that.  How does the forum think that can be done better, and can the legislation be transformative in making sure there is a better, proactive contribution from the business community to the indigenous community?</p></speech>

It is a mixture of employees and local residents and it is about getting the economy moving.  The calendar was owned and delivered by the DDDA back in the day when it had the resources.  We have seen that decrease every year, but people have stepped in and done that.  If we could get steady, safe and certain resources, we could do four if not five times as much.  That is how it starts.  It is small coffee events with big-budget executives and small start-up companies.  It is ideas for creative training which takes place in big companies and with the NCI.  It is those events where these things happen, at which smart people speak to smart people.  It is about entrepreneurs taking risks and community gain.</p><p>  We have had some people come to us with suggestions for community gain, but there is no specific mechanism there.  It is very hard for volunteers who have their own businesses and staff and rents to pay.  We have to carve out time to go and do this but we believe in it and see the growth that results.  More of those events are necessary.  If there was four or five times what used to be there, it would be fantastic.</p></speech>

However, there are huge possibilities and opportunities for the docklands.  One project involves Grand Canal Basin and the graving docks at its eastern end.  The basin and the docks were built in 1796 and they are magnificent elements of Dublin's Georgian heritage.  If one walks by Grand Canal Basin on an average day or even at the weekend, it is empty.  If one sold that for &euro;100 million to a private contractor, one might think it was worth it, but I guarantee that next summer they would have yachts pouring into the place.  I do not suggesting privatising it and selling it off.  I am suggesting, however, that we wake up to this remarkable infrastructure.</p><p>  The European Commission has identified marine tourism as one of the significant growth areas for the European Union over the next ten years.  We have an unused basin that was built for 600 ships under sail.  We have fantastic Georgian graving docks.  While they are smaller than the ones in Belfast, they are ours and they can be used for all sorts of things.  One can be used as a graving dock again, as there is none in Leinster, according to the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  Another can be used as a swimming pool and the other as an outdoor music venue.  A park can go around it.  If one got 100 ships in, the average spend, according to a recent Dutch survey, would be &euro;1,000 per ship.  That is investment that could go into the docklands every day which would facilitate the creation of small and medium enterprises in the area, create a great many jobs and make the docklands an even more attractive location for international businesses as a place full of life and vibrancy.  That is just one possibility.  Imagine if a city did not have the basin and the graving docks.  How much would it spend to get them?  It is madness that they are not used.</p></speech>

Waterways Ireland has known it, as has Dublin Port.  There are other areas on the Liffey where there has been discussion of trying to bring yachts and pontoons onto the river.  These are things that are difficult for organisations to do alone.  Businesses are flexible and can join up the nesting between one group and another, garner support on the ground and create a positive movement through connecting locals and all the bits that are difficult to do from a political and structural point of view within organisations.  That is where an organisation like ours plays a key part.  We can sew that together.  We are the friendly guys who can talk to communities and between authorities to make this happen.  We can attract capital from private enterprise if that is needed.  However, we are also small business owners with our own jobs.  This is where some type of ongoing entity we can nurture and manage for the State comes in to help us make amazing things happen in the docklands.</p></speech>

It opened up employment and many training programmes so that idea has always been there pre-DDDA and pre-1997.  Things were pushed through there and I know the Irish Nautical Trust is still trying to push things through there.  </p><p> Looking to the future and the new Bill, I know Dublin Port Company, Waterways Ireland, whatever the new entity will be if it is introduced and Dublin City Council want to work together in the regeneration and re-animation of the basin and river.  What one cannot forget is that many of the local communities have got involved in this as well, are passionate about what is there and have a lot of expertise and knowledge that we need to tap into.  We have got involved in it.  I do not know if we know a lot but the resources that the DDDA had were huge and could do a lot of good things.  If I was to go back, I would probably be banging the table looking for a lot more from that than I did at the time but let us not be greedy about it.  Everyone talks about the strategic development zone, SDZ, which is a way of fast tracking planning but there is an area that was ring fenced around docklands in which people are trying to pinpoint the resources.  There are a number of organisations in the area - Waterways Ireland, Dublin City Council, ourselves and others.  </p></speech>

When the legislation was first introduced, everyone was taken aback by the idea of social regeneration being first.  It even went against the alphabet.  The social regeneration was there.  Dublin Port Company is fully behind that type of concept and has a policy within its master plan, as Mr. Ward said, and its strategic plan.  We review that strategic plan every five years.  The master plan is a 30-year programme.  We are willing to work with all bodies around it.  The new entity needs to have some teeth and needs to be able to make decisions for the area.  Let us ring fence that area and pinpoint what it is.  At the moment, we are being drawn to different places.  It could be here today and somewhere else tomorrow.</p><p>  People talk about an independent share.  Who is that independent share and where does he or she come from?  What is the relationship?  There are many things to be looked at.  We should look back at the master plan and the legislation that went through the DDDA at the time and not take all of it away.  Perhaps some of it has to go but a lot of it was good.  </p></speech>

The hinterland was an interesting concept within that.  There are two conversations from today's hearings.  One related to Dublin City Council talking about the SDZ and the boundaries there while the other involved the group here talking about the docklands.  We should be talking more about the docklands than purely a simple SDZ boundary.</p></speech>

That is all it is.  The docklands as a community both north and south is totally different.  There were section 25 planning areas within the docklands but the money that came from those areas is spread right through.  The same concept can be dealt with.</p></speech>

It involves external, global and credit risks; trying to get financing; and HR risk.  One thing we can control is the pace of clarifying what is going to be done in this local area.  There are so many unknowns at the moment and we need to speed that up.  We had a deadline of November for the dissolution which has now passed.  Our members are asking the following questions.  Could someone specify what is going to happen?  What is our relationship going to be?  What is that area?  How will Dublin City Council, the new entity and the new councillors interact?  The more quickly this is resolved, the more quickly we can get people to volunteer for this consultative forum and get some good people in there.  We can control the speed.</p></speech>

We need a specific raison d'&ecirc;tre for the committee because this area is nationally important and can provide huge job potential for the area.  It is important that the committee and the business and community representatives on it contribute in a proper way.  It is a wake-up call.  Realex Payments is an indigenous Irish company located on Sir John Rogerson's Quay that is taking on PayPal.  It is doing remarkable things and moving a chunk of its operations to London.  It is doing that because its legal fees are &euro;70,000 while in London, it is said that the company will not need anything more than &euro;5,000.  Realex gets a lease this size from NAMA - I am not joking - while the lease in London is a few pages.  That is one of the reasons why we need effective, real businesspeople on this committee and not the usual stakeholder brigade because it is only real businesspeople who might tell one that one does not want to hear.  If a situation arises in the docklands where one, two or three of these medium-sized companies pull out, one is then talking about a game changer in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

All the people and organisations that are attending this committee deserve to be here.  The committee could ask itself how many multinational corporations it will hear from.  How many of the innovators will it hear from?  These are the young boys and girls who get up at six in the morning to create the next Google or Twitter?  What about the tens of thousands of people who have moved into the docklands over the past ten or 15 years?  How many of these voices will the committee hear?  I do not wish to cause controversy or exclude anybody but a more inclusive process involving other voices could make a real and meaningful contribution to the committee's consultation process.</p></speech>

The internet clusters around Grand Canal Dock are a fantastic international success.  We all know North Lotts will be fantastic.  It is just a question of when this will happen.  We need to speed it up and get going.  We know from our experience that it needs some central catalyst - resources and people - to own that and make it happen in two years rather than 20.</p></speech>

In 2013, 100 cruise ships came into Dublin Port Company.  This generates revenue for the local economy.

I found them very interesting.  I am from the docklands, have served on the docklands council and am quite aware of some of the problems and the many successes.</p> <p>While Irish people are often very good at looking back and looking at mistakes, when one displays the slides, one can see the many successes.  The energy within the area is fantastic and one only needs to visit Barrow Street to see this.  While previously it was dead, it now has nearly 3,000 employees working on it, all of whom pay tax.  The docklands area will be a driver for both the city and the country and one will see the effect spread from it.  It is important to get it right and this process will help in doing so, although it is very much just the first step.  We must push off from there and there must be respect for the indigenous community.  One must ensure they are involved and have opportunities, in addition to the opportunity to attract further direct investment into the area.  I live within the community and one can clearly see that people now live, work and play within the docklands area, which is the way it was many ways ago.  It is great to see such vibrancy and essential to keep that correct balance.  I am delighted by the role the Docklands Business Forum has played in the past five years and certainly look forward to working with it to expand on it.  I thank the forum, while also acknowledging the role Dublin Port has played for many decades.</p></speech>

Malta, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Cyprus were the other member states cited for disenfranchising voters who had decided to exercise the right to free movement.  Previously, we have heard the views of a number of member states and we have also heard from political parties within the State.  At today's meeting, we will hear two distinct views.  The first contribution will be from Dr. Adrian Kavanagh of NUI Maynooth.  Dr. Kavanagh is a leading expert on political geography.  We will also hear from Ms Jennie McShannon, CEO of Irish in Britain, an organisation which looks after the needs of the Irish diaspora in the UK and which was formerly called the Federation of Irish Societies.  The Irish in Britain organisation has been assisting in the campaign for the right of Irish citizens living outside the island of Ireland to vote in general elections.<br />Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular issue and continues to do so, he or she is only entitled thereafter to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of today's proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />We had a brief discussion before the meeting commenced and agreed that the order of presentations would be Dr. Kavanagh followed by Ms McShannon.</p></speech>

This is becoming more of an issue with what people refer to as "the diaspora turn" in public policy.  In recent decades, there have been growing levels of engagement between governments and diaspora populations.  This cuts across a number of different dimensions including economic development, philanthropy and tourism promotion, as we saw recently with The Gathering.  There is a growing sense that states are becoming increasingly aware of their diaspora populations and of the policy issues.</p><p>  The way states relate to diasporas is changing.  One way this has happened in more recent decades has been by way of the extension of voting rights to diaspora populations.  As we all know, however, external voting rights have not been established by all states.  Many academic writers see this process as similar to the extension of voting rights to other groups in the past, including the extension of voting rights to women at the start of the last century, to minority groups and to younger adults.  Of course, there are differences.  There are a number of arguments for and against the policy.  Some of the arguments against it are based on the suggestion that political rights should be linked to the extent of taxation liabilities.  Others refer to the danger of extending voting rights to emigrants in terms of extending rights to people who will be making decisions on what happens in the home state and to home populations.</p><p>  The academic literature contains a number of arguments in favour of the extension of voting rights.  One of the more interesting arguments relates to a report by the Hansard Society in the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom extends voting rights to British expatriates and the report considered the problem of increasing the level of voting by expatriates.  The basic argument was that by encouraging expatriates to vote, they would act as lobbies on behalf of their home countries.  It was suggested to encourage expatriates to take a more active interest in the political and current affairs of Britain and pass this interest to future generations.  Another interesting argument was to the effect that expatriates could bring an important international perspective to a national general election contest.  In other arguments it is noted that the right to vote in national elections is a constitutional and human right.  Leaving aside the taxation issue, diaspora members have suggested that economic remittances represent a significant contribution to the present and future well being of countries.  It has also been suggested that economic circumstances were what forced people to emigrate.  Other arguments relate to the emotional, cultural and patrimonial bonds that continue to exist between migrants and their native lands.</p><p>  The academic literature is interesting in suggesting that what really drives decisions on the extension of voting rights is the politics of the home state rather than the extent of advocacy on behalf of different migrant groups.  Much of the literature suggests it has to do with the political context or the political make-up of the state at certain times.  It discusses opportunity spaces that exist at certain periods when the politics of a state might make it more open to decisions on the extension of voting rights.  Often this can be down to perceptions as to the impact of extending the right to vote to diaspora populations on election results.</p><p>  Ireland is an interesting case but first I note some interesting election findings from other countries.  It has been suggested that migrant voters may vote in a more nationalistic way.  The evidence suggests that has been the case in some instances, but not in others.  There is no cast-iron proof that migrant voters vote in a certain way.  I looked at Croatia.  The Croat diaspora tends to vote for the more nationalistic HDZ party instead of the other parties in the state.  Italy is one of the countries which gives significant voting rights and electoral power to its diaspora.  Looking at the last Italian elections, we see that the centre left party, which provides the leadership of the current Government, took many more votes and seats than were given to the Berlusconi coalition.  There is no strong evidence that diaspora voters will bring about particular election results.</p><p>  Another interesting element of extending diaspora voting rights relates to turnout levels.</p> <p>I looked at three countries.  If one looks at the evidence from the UK, estimates suggest that 3 million British people might be living abroad who have the right to vote but that only a couple of thousand registered to vote in the UK.  According to the last estimate from December 2011 carried out by the Hansard Society, only 23,366 people registered out of what the society suggested was an estimated three million people.  </p></speech>

It might have been higher.  It might have been the case that it is annual registration.  This would have been after the British general election with the expectation that another election would not come up for another four years.  The society knows that 40,000 registration forms were downloaded during the election year, which was the year before, so I suspect it might be higher in election years in the UK but that is still a very small percentage registering to vote let alone deciding to turn out to vote.</p><p>  In the case of Italy, 3.5 million Italian expatriates were registered to vote in the last election but roughly one-third voted.  It was estimated that just over one million voted in elections to the Chamber of Deputies and under 1 million voted in the contest for the Senate so we are looking at a turnout rate of roughly 30% in Italy. </p><p>  Croatia is an interesting example.  It is one country where one finds divergences or variances in voting rights, which the EU is concerned about.  Croats living in Bosnia-Herzegovina have the right to vote in two national elections.  They can vote in the Bosnian national elections but they can also vote in the Croatian elections.  This, of course, taps into what is the big issue for the EU, namely, the fact that there are different voting rights for different Europeans.  Irish people living in other EU countries do not have the right to vote in general elections.  Obviously, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not in the EU but a Bosnian Croat can vote in an election in Croatia which is now in the EU.  If one is a Bosnian Croat, one can vote in two general elections.  It is these differences that seem to go against the principle of what it means to be part of the EU.  A 22% turnout was estimated for the diaspora population of Croatia in the 2007 election.  In the last parliamentary election in Croatia, the turnout was as low as 5%.  </p><p>  If one is trying to consider what impact diaspora voters might have in elections, one element to take account of is the likely turnout level.  Ireland is an interesting case because of our electoral system.  If one decides to extend voting rights to the diaspora, there are different ways one can decide to do it.  Does it extend to the Irish diaspora living in other European countries or to all countries across the world?  One could do what Croatia and Italy have done and have a separate constituency electing a number of seats.  Obviously, in the case of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that could have an impact because as we know from the past, most Governments, excluding the current one and the 1992-1994 one, enjoy very narrow majorities.  There might be the fear that if results turn out a certain way in the emigrant or diaspora constituency, it would dictate who forms the next Government.  </p><p>  The other way of extending voting rights is the model used in the UK.  This involves allowing voters to vote in the constituency they come from or where their parents came from in the case of the UK.  We have high levels of marginality when it comes to Irish elections because of our electoral system.  As members know, a couple of hundred votes can determine the last seats in a number of constituencies.  </p><p>  I did a quick number crunch to examine the impact of extending voting rights to the Irish diaspora at the last general election on general election constituencies in 2011.  I took the same scenario that pertains in Canada or Australia - a scenario preferred by many in the academic literature.  It involves extending voting rights to diaspora populations for five or six years and after that, the right to vote in national elections is taken over by the country in which they reside.  I used the population estimates published by the census last year and applied them to likely turnout levels.  Emigrant populations tend to be younger than the average population and younger populations tend to be less likely to vote.  Looking at the number of people who left Ireland in the five years prior to the general election and making allowances for the fact that a significant number of people might have left in 2006 and 2007 and might have returned by 2009 or 2010, I produced an estimate of likely turnout again making allowances for the fact that based on the CSO's figures, a very high percentage of emigrants tend to be in the younger age cohorts and younger people are less likely to vote.  I estimated that there might have been a total valid vote of just over 32,000 among the diaspora population at the last election assuming the turnout levels for that group were the same as those for the population at home, which is a big assumption.  One could ask what would have happened if it was 30%, as is the case in Italy, or 5%.  Even with these figures, when one looks at the last election and divides that potential voting population of 32,000 across what were then 43 constituencies in the State-----</p></speech>

The idea is that the right to vote would be in one's home constituency.  Unfortunately, there is no real geography of emigration at the moment, which is probably understandable, so I could not work out whether certain constituencies are more affected and just did a very straightforward division of that 32,000 based on the population of those constituencies.  Laois-Offaly was the biggest constituency in the last general election and accounted for 3.3% of the total population at that election based on the 2011 constituency so I allocated Laois-Offaly 3.3% of that total voting population.  Dublin North Central was the smallest with about 1.6% so it was allocated 1.6% of the total voting population.  Based on those figures, I estimated that, assuming turnout levels were the same as for the rest of the population living in the State, there would have been a range of voters.  The maximum number of voters would have been an estimated 1,069 in Laois-Offaly while the minimum number would have been an estimated 521 in Dublin North Central so in most cases, one would be talking about a couple of hundred voters.</p><p>  If one relates that to marginality levels at the last election, one can see that in the majority of cases, that diaspora voting population would have been smaller than the marginality level - the difference between the person who took the last seat and the person who missed out.  If one looks at the extreme case of Roscommon-South Leitrim, one can see that there were 5,088 votes between the last elected candidate and the candidate who missed out.  I am estimating 500.  Roughly, in two-thirds of cases, this estimated number of diaspora votes would have been smaller than than the marginality level.  </p><p>  In cases where this estimated diaspora voting number would have been higher than the constituency marginality level, in a good number of cases such as Cavan-Monaghan, one would have had to assume that possibly 70% or 80% of those voters would have voted in a certain way.  In the case of Cavan-Monaghan, if 85% of voters in the diaspora population had voted Sinn F&eacute;in, Senator Reilly might be in the D&aacute;il rather than the Seanad.  </p><p>  In other constituencies, the numbers were small enough but we are looking at differences between two people from the same party.  I am looking at cases like Laois-Offaly, Wexford and Cork North Central.  There are three constituencies where the diaspora vote could have changed the seats in party terms at the last election, one of which would have been D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  </p> <p>I do not refer to the final count but the second last count.  There were 147 votes between Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and Senator Ivana Bacik.  I estimated that there were approximately 735 diaspora votes.  Had a significant number of those 735 voted Labour it could have changed the result.  The last two candidates and in Wicklow were separated by 112 votes and in Galway West only 17 votes.</p><p> The 2011 figures seem to suggest that the extension of diaspora voting rights would have had an impact only in a handful of constituencies.  That is only one example and one could consider other examples, such as the 2002 general election where there were many more close calls.  I suggest perhaps the extension of voting rights to the Irish diaspora, or the Irish diaspora living in EU countries, which seems to be the issue here, would have less impact on election results than measures to increase voter turnout levels among low-turnout groups in Irish society.  Implementing more voter mobilisation efforts to increase voter turnout among working-class communities or people in the 18 to 35 age group would have more impact than the extension of voting rights to the diaspora.</p><p> Notwithstanding that the EU has no rules on it, some academic political scientists suggest this will happen and it is a matter of when, not if, the EU will make a ruling on it.  As the members know, the EU still regards this as a matter of national competence.  The sense in some of the literature is that a case may eventually be taken to the European Court of Justice, after which states will be forced to do something.  It is better to act before that than after.  If and when voting rights are extended to the Irish diaspora, the evidence I cited from the UK, Italy and Croatia suggests that countries need to do it properly.  We do not want a situation where we extend the right to vote to Irish emigrants abroad but only 5% are voting.  The next step is to consider the infrastructure required.  The obvious method would be to do it under the aegis of an electoral commission, which is a different discussion.</p></speech>

Irish in Britain is 40 years old, was founded by the Irish community for the Irish community in 1973 and was originally called the Federation of Irish Societies.  It comprises almost 100 organisations across Britain, primarily in England but also Scotland and Wales, which provide social care and welfare, cultural hubs, community centres and Irish clubs to the community and, increasingly, some of the new Irish who tend to form new organisations around the work they do in their area, such as the lawyers' associations and business networks.  As a membership organisation we are the only national representative and do much work representing issues pertaining to the Irish community, as fed to us, to the British and Irish Governments.</p><p>  Our involvement in this issue began when the Constitutional Convention was announced.  Our membership was very keen for us to take up the issue of voting in the presidential elections.  The initial mandate was on votes for the Irish abroad, as per the Constitutional Convention discussions.  We pursued a campaign of engaging the community on the issue and finding out how people felt across the very diverse elements in the community, as they engaged with us through our membership organisations or through our wider reach.  We called the project "diaspora voice", and it was a listening initiative and engaged with the Constitutional Convention.  We held a number of listening events with many different groups at national meetings, through our informal network sessions and through online polling and promotion of the issues.</p><p>  Initially we had a very varied response.  Among the older Irish there was overwhelming support for votes in the presidential elections.  People who had been living in Britain for as many as 50 years still talked about "our President" and were excited about the opportunity to be involved in the presidential elections.  On the wider engagement in the legislative assemblies there was some concern about what it might mean for Irish people's ability to vote in British elections.  The Irish community is very active in local politics in many of the major cities and urban areas throughout Britain.  Is was an important opportunity for us to feed back what happens in other countries, as described by Dr. Kavanagh.</p><p>  The response of the new or younger Irish was very different.  While they felt the Irish presidential elections were very important, they felt it did not go far enough and that they had a significant investment in what happens in Irish public life.  Many of them talked about returning to Ireland, and we know that many will while others will not.  Many of them had come to Britain in order to sustain mortgages in Ireland and are considering the care and support of elderly parents.  Some are living in Britain while their immediate families and children remain in Ireland.  Through that we began to form our position as a representative organisation and made a submission on the issue to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>  We believe Irish citizens have a major contribution to make to public life.  We talked about diaspora engagement in terms of remittances in the past, and in the future they may support Ireland through investment.  There are "transnationalists": people who live in Britain but still feel very much that they have a life back in Ireland.  We made four main proposals for action, namely, to end the disenfranchisement of recent migrants, facilitate some kind of diaspora vote in the presidential elections, provide for diaspora representation in the Oireachtas, and possibly appoint a Minister for diaspora engagement.</p><p>  We began by picking up on the some of the President's statements, asking whether we are really Irish and part of the nation and whether we would pervert the national vote.  President Higgins expressed his very visionary form of Irishness, saying that the Irishness he believes is emerging, even if not yet fully realised, is one that will be informed by the experience of the Irish abroad as much as, or even to a greater extent than, it will be informed by those of us who live in Ireland.  This was a very significant statement around the role of the diaspora in Irish life.  We welcomed the European Commissioner's advice on our participation in national elections and whether it is binding in EU law - which the committee is examining - that the citizens' right to vote is fundamental to any democracy.  The authority is not just for membership of the EU but is also set out in the UN and Council of Europe human rights treaties.</p><p>  There is national consensus that the Irish diaspora is a vast human resource with economic, political and social opportunities and a contribution to make.</p> <p>Diaspora leaders both in civil society and business believe we should be promoting active participation.  For our own position, we encourage the Irish community to vote as much as possible and to participate in the British elections because they have a vote in that country and they should make their vote count.  We pursued such a campaign in the last British election.  They should also participate as much as possible in Ireland, particularly those who have such concrete and tangible reasons to be involved.  Exercising the right to vote is a very powerful way to engage and involve the diaspora.  Removing barriers to voting is in the interests of the citizens overseas, but also in the interests of citizens living in Ireland.<br />We know there are many objections, as Dr. Kavanagh has mentioned, including that the overseas voters will not know the issues.  We point to things such as data indicating that a large amount of the readership of <i>The Irish Times</i>online comes from the diaspora, particularly in Britain.  I do not have the exact percentage so I do not want to fire it out there, but I was quite taken aback by that figure.  There are many discussions about anything that is going in Ireland and people are still very involved and knowledgeable.  In the light of the revolution in global communications and social media, it is much easier to stay involved and engaged in the issues.<br />Taxation and representation is another issue that has been raised.  Noreen Bowden, who is in America and has used social media a lot to put forward a similar campaign supporting the votes, pointed out that no representation without taxation would have implications for Irish living in Ireland - for those who are not paying tax or not employed and are not able to contribute to the taxation system.  They do not lose their vote as a result of that and nor should the Irish abroad.  The income of EU citizens is taxed primarily in the state of residence so they are contributing in terms of the EU.  The Irish overseas transfer money home and are liable to many forms of taxation through property tax and different services.<br />The fear of swamping is something that in our community among the Irish diaspora in Britain they worried about in itself and that is something they wanted to consider.  There have been estimates of the diaspora being 70 million and concern that the votes overseas would distort results.  We considered the international experience before we made our submission to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and talked about it with our members.  We concluded that those fears were relatively unfounded.  We believe the biggest challenge for diaspora leaders would be persuading citizens to vote.  Just because it would be an uphill struggle to get people to vote is not sufficient reason not to actively give people the right to vote.  They are two very different and distinct things.<br />We have a few things to say about the fear of swamping.  The number of those of Irish descent and heritage obviously vastly exceeds the current passport holders who might be entitled to vote.  That is estimated at about 3 million - exact figures are not available.  Of those who may be entitled to vote, only a small proportion would be likely to register and request a voting ballot.  International comparisons based on our figures - Dr. Kavanagh's are probably more accurate than ours - would suggest a figure of more like 300,000.  In the UK with an overseas population of 27 million, citizens are entitled to vote for up to 15 years after leaving their constituencies and yet only 23,000 register to vote.  The issues are similar.  Even those on the register must be committed to casting their vote in any given election.  Among US registered overseas voters, the turnout is 6.8% and if that were to be replicated, numbers could be as low as 20,000.<br />In terms of no voting without representation, the parliamentary institutions and the government that we felt should represent the Irish at home and abroad, the residency requirement should be removed.  It would not necessarily require a constitutional change as we understand it, but we are not experts in constitutional issues.<br />Votes in national elections could be counted in the constitution of origin or it could be voting for representatives in a dedicated five-seat diaspora constituency.  A new Seanad diaspora panel was obviously also a possibility.  Procedures would obviously need to be put in place to accommodate that.  The Irish in Britain who have talked to us about this are aware of the seismic changes in terms of procedures and processes.  However, they are very keen on the commitment and principle.<br />In terms of the electoral roll and overseas vote, there is an urgent need for reviewing the method of updating and maintaining the electoral roll and postal and in-line facilities.  The community felt that there were great opportunities there.  Perhaps the inclusion of overseas voters should be subject to application and regular renewal as opposed to languishing on an electoral roll.<br />There is a need for review of voting and counting procedures from paper to electronic and online voting to guard against digital exclusion overseas.  Obviously, in terms of the presidential election, many of the older Irish are not digitally included and that is an issue.  Among the new Irish, it felt like a much more surmountable change to make.  Among the older Irish, it was a bigger issue because they would not be as active digitally.  There is the importance of training young voters, administrators and candidates on the issues and the ways that those living in Britain would want to engage.<br />I want to talk about time limits.  Germany has a time limit of 25 years and the UK has 15 years.  Irish citizens lose the vote instantly unless they can demonstrate an intention to return within 18 months, but that benchmark is very difficult to ascertain especially for those who are coming and going - coming home for a summer or a spell and then going back or possibly moving on.  We believe there is a positive requirement to renew electoral registration.  That would be a better mechanism.  EU citizens should have equal entitlement to vote in national elections throughout the EU.  I know Dr. Kavanagh has referred to some places that are not within the EU, but there should be some comparability across EU countries and there should not be a different standard.<br />Those were the things that came up in our discussions.  The Irish in Britain are unique in a way because we are the only members of the diaspora in a country that automatically gives us the right to vote immediately on arrival in Britain.  There was a thing about people feeling they could be engaged in two political jurisdictions.  They would have an interest in local elections in Britain because it affects their children going to school and the health care they are receiving.  Their interest in the Irish system is still very much alive.  In seeking the support of the Irish diaspora, they were seeking the support in return on that.</p></speech>

On logistics, it has been suggested that if we extended voting rights to our citizens in the United Kingdom and did not make it possible to vote online or electronically, we could end up with people queuing for miles at our embassy at Grosvenor Square or wherever.  How would voting work in practice?  How would people living in Manchester, Liverpool or Birmingham, where many members of the diaspora live, get to vote?  Has Ms McShannon given any thought to the mechanisms and logistics behind that?</p><p>  Regarding dual-voting rights, if I was living in the UK, does Ms McShannon believe I should have a vote in Irish general elections and in UK general elections or should I have the right to choose between D&aacute;il elections and Westminster elections?  Particularly if I were living in Newry, should I have the right to vote in both?</p><p>  Where would the diaspora's votes go?</p> <p>Would they be for constituencies in Ireland or separate constituencies?</p><p> My next question is probably more for Dr. Kavanagh.  We have heard of turnout rates among diasporas as low as 5%.  France and Portugal have overseas constituencies.  The French have five and the Portuguese have a European constituency.  We were hoping to hear from some of their representatives, but I do not believe that will be possible in the time we have left for this work.  Does Dr. Kavanagh know what the turnout is for the constituencies in question?  If we were to have specific constituencies for the diaspora, we would have a very low turnout.  A very small number of people would be deciding on the Deputies to be elected in their constituency.  A North American constituency could have 100,000 people - the equivalent of a three-seat constituency.  With a turnout of only 3% or 4%, only 1,000 people might vote for each Member, as supposed to ten times that number in this country.  Have the delegates given any thought to whether this would be fair or whether we would be better off linking foreign constituents' votes with Irish constituencies?</p></speech>

I have two questions, in particular.  Dr. Adrian Kavanagh referred to a figure of 1% and the consequences of this rate for elections in Ireland.  Much of this is hypothetical, based on the potential of so many people to vote.  Has there been an assessment of potential voting patterns among the Irish, particularly in Britain?  Perhaps this question is relevant to both delegates.  I am aware that the turnout is very small in the case of other countries.  If voting rights were given in some form, what would the potential take-up be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014051300007#F00300"><p>I thank both delegates.  We must go back to the fundamentals and I am asking them for their opinions.  What do we mean when we speak about the Irish diaspora?  Does it amount to 30 million or 40 million people?  Is it 3 million in England?  I am looking for guidance on the foundations of this debate.  Whom do the delegates believe should be allocated the right to vote and what criteria should be used?  Should Irish passports issued in the past five or ten years be used?  What would the criteria be in establishing the electoral base?</p><p>  I would like to know the delegates' thinking on what exactly the electorate would actually vote for.  It is a mystery.  There are different electoral systems throughout the world, as the delegates know.  The list system is the most simple and straightforward for a diaspora.  Where there is a multi-seat, multi-party constituency, how should eligible voters cast their votes?  Should they vote for a party or candidates attached to parties?  I have not got my head around what kind of ballot paper voters should receive in their embassy's polling station.  One could hardly be given a ballot paper for one's original constituency.</p><p>  The European Union is talking about participation in general elections.  We have dealt with the Constitutional Convention issue that addressed the right to vote in the presidential election.  Are the delegates in a position to advise us on whether we could have an incremental process involving our finding out who the electorate were?  Should we start with the presidential election as the basis, although it would not conform with European requests?  The delegates know that our electoral register is completed every year.  When we decide who should comprise the electorate, what will be the basis on which they might be allowed to participate?  Considering that Irish citizens must register every year to ensure they remain on the register, should members of the diaspora register every year in order to be eligible?  There are many complications.  However, as we must produce a report, I would be very interested in the delegation's explanation of how it believes we should proceed.</p><p>  My final point concerns the key difficulty - Northern Ireland.  In the North there is a divided community where some claim to be republican Nationalists and carry Irish passports, while others claim to be Unionists and carry UK passports.  In debating the allocation of voting rights to the diaspora, should we logically carry through in respect of the rights of Nationalists in Northern Ireland, or even Unionists who may opt to carry an Irish passport?</p><p>  We do not have an electoral commission, but I presume the system would have to be managed by embassies.  Could we work on this issue incrementally, given that it is a European debate?  Could we start with the 28 EU countries where, I presume, we at least have the ambassadorial infrastructure required?  Would this create second-class citizens in America?  While we are not going to write the manifesto now, I would be interested in knowing how the delegates believe we can overcome these preliminary issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-13a.488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennie McShannon" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014051300007#F00400"><p>I will answer a few questions.  As Dr. Kavanagh is in a better position to respond to others, I will leave them to him.</p><p>  On voting mechanisms, Irish communities are mainly in conurbations in Britain, including Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and, increasingly, the surrounding areas as the Irish community spreads outwards.  There are not consulates in all of these areas.  The number of consulates and embassies has diminished, but there are very active and engaged Irish centres that could work effectively as polling stations.  There is also the online facility.  Obviously, there are ways of promoting this.</p><p>  With regard to those who are not digitally engaged, there are Irish centres, including the Irish World Heritage Centre.  I do not know whether there is a possibility of using such centres.  It would have staffing implications, as they would have to be managed in the way polling stations are managed here.  However, there would be a facility through using both online and off-line opportunities.  There is a significant Irish centre infrastructure across Britain.</p><p>  On dual elections, if a person from Britain comes to live in Ireland, he or she receives the vote, but he or she also retains his or her vote in Britain; he or she does not have to make a choice.  That is what we would envisage for Irish citizens living in Britain.  When the Irish go to Britain, they receive a vote, but they do not have an entitlement to vote here.  Therefore, there is already a disparity.  We cannot see any reason the British system could not be operated here.</p><p>  Mr. Mark Scully has talked about transnationals, or those who have a sense of home in two places because they move so much between Britain and Ireland.  I refer to the Ryanair generation.  People are as much involved in what is happening here as what is happening in Britain.  This presents a great opportunity in making a contribution to the Irish economy.  What I describe has not been a massive issue for the British electoral system.</p> <p> Asking who is the diaspora is like asking how long is a piece of string.  With regard to who should be allocated the right to vote, our view has been that a distinction can be made with regard to those who are Irish born.  In Australia or New Zealand one can be a citizen whether one was born there or not, in the same way as we have Irish citizens who were not born here, but only citizens born in the country can vote.  There is a realm of possibilities.  This would probably narrow things down a lot with regard to those who are second or third generation and the fear of swamping, as they can be Irish citizens but would not necessarily have the right to vote.</p><p> With regard to what people vote for, through digital communication they can see what candidates and parties state.  Who the diaspora would vote for would depend on whether the diaspora would have a reserved constituency.  An issue has been raised with regard to whether being a diaspora candidate would depend on having the money to canvass.  This is a genuine issue.  Would those without the financial backing to meet the diaspora to generate a vote be excluded?  If there was not a diaspora constituency but people had a right to vote in their home constituencies, such as Meath or Dublin, would they be able to engage and understand what the candidates from each party offer as opposed to having a general sweep of the parties?</p><p> A campaign in countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand, which have a large number of Irish emigrants, could be very difficult.  One might have a much bigger campaign from emigrants living there if those living in Europe were given a vote.</p></speech>

It would mean a significant change and rethink.  If one were then to state there were further degrees of citizenship, it would create real rot.</p><p>  I am not mandated with regard to Northern Ireland because we are engaged with the Irish in Britain so I will not comment on this matter.  If citizens had to register every year, we have already stated we believe it would be important that people here would follow a similar reregistration process.  It is a way to get people engaged and involved.  We encouraged people to vote and make their vote count in the British elections, but the first step was to ensure they registered in time for the elections.  This started people thinking about the next step after registration.  Registering is a way to get people involved and interested and we do not believe it should be any different here if people abroad have to register annually.</p></speech>

The question on the constituency issue was a good one.  Would a low turnout for the diaspora population mean people would be elected with very small numbers?  The example of Croatia suggests this would be the case.  Some people were elected with 1,000 votes.  It would be an issue.  If and when we go down the line of extending voting rights to the diaspora, it might be an issue.  On the other hand, one could argue there would not be an issue if it were done right.  I suggest a body, preferably an electoral commission, should be in charge which would be mandated to organise it and ensure as many members of the Irish diaspora as possible are registered and have the potential to get as much information about the elections as possible, and this body would also facilitate the voting process.</p><p>  How to facilitate it is a very interesting question.  Unsurprisingly, geography comes into it.  I believe Maltese people who are overseas and allowed to vote fly back to Malta and part of their expenses is paid.  Obviously this is not something we want to do.  Another issue is whether people would only be allowed to vote at the embassy.  This would be another geographical issue.  One would probably find more Irish people living in and near London would vote than Irish people living in and near Glasgow.  This needs to be thought out.  There are also issues with postal voting which would need to be considered.  Estonia is working on e-voting.  The suggestion from the literature is that e-voting has potential but may need a few more years of development.  Potentially it could be the way to do it.</p></speech>

It has interesting potential.  I suspect if and when we decide to extend voting rights, it will be a few years down the line, by which stage technology may have developed in such a way that e-voting is the more logical way of managing it, particularly for younger voters who are comfortable with it, and then postal voting or consulate voting for others could be considered.  I do not want to say this would be for older people, because many older people are much better with technology than I am, but those who are not comfortable with technology would have a fallback position.</p><p>  With regard to the question of who is the Irish diaspora, everyone in the room will have a different opinion.  Who the Irish diaspora should be with regard to voting rights is interesting.  Political philosophy suggests people should be allowed to vote in one national election and, ideally, once they become settled, they should vote in their country of residence.  The suggestion in academic literature, which is why I took this five year window, is that emigrants should have voting rights for five or six years, by which stage they should be established in their new country of residence.  This would mean we would not have a situation whereby people would vote in general elections in two countries as happens with regard to Croatia, which is a member of the EU.  The Bosnian Croats can vote in Croatia and also vote in Bosnia.  It is a tricky question.</p></speech>

I thank our guests and congratulate them on their presentations.</p> <p>I tend to get uneasy when I hear too many emerging technicalities, particularly in terms of e-voting.  I have often expressed my views on this matter.  Our voting system does not lend itself readily to e-voting.  Indeed, that was a conclusion from our foray into that area.  This situation will not change.  Nor should we change our system to accommodate e-voting.  I am one of those who believe that voting is an essential part of democracy and should be treated as such.  It should not be easy or simple to do, for example, while one is walking a dog and accessing the Internet.  It needs careful consideration and democracy will suffer unless we ensure that the system on which it is based continues to be revered.  If it is treated in an off-handed or contemptuous fashion, there will be serious problems.</p><p> Dr. Kavanagh referred to how particular issues in a constituency or home country might affect the outcome elsewhere.  One of my colleagues was famously in a Mexican stand-off with an opponent after an election, in that five or seven votes were at issue.  I am not opposed to the concept of representation from abroad, but there must be some control over it.  There must be some contact with the home country.  The constitutionality of any proposal needs to be proofed.  Obviously, a proposal will be challenged at some stage if a group has entitlement by virtue of taxation, legislation and so on while others do not.</p><p> To what extent will it be possible to present to the diaspora the prevalent situation in the country of origin?  At what stage will this approach be possible, for example, after five or ten years since leaving the homeland?  Should it be left open forever?  Flying home could become an expensive prospect.  Failure to give the same access to the system enjoyed by the national population will lead to a constitutional challenge by someone aggrieved after an election.</p><p> Many issues arise.  Some recognition of the diaspora is necessary, but it must be handled carefully and in a way that will not skew the result in a region because of the prevailing issues.</p></speech>

I take Deputy Durkan's point, in that voting should not be too easy, but voters also need to be facilitated.  It is better to have as many people voting as possible instead of assuming that certain groups are better able to vote than others, and if the others do not make the extra effort to vote, hard luck.  I disagree with that assumption.  The more people voting, the stronger the democracy.  I do not want to make voting too easy, but the more ways we can, within reason, help to facilitate voters, be they in our home country or among the diaspora, the better it will be not just for them, but for democracy at large.  I have a different take from the Deputy.</p><p>  My last point was on the Irish diaspora.  Some of the academic literature suggests a cut-off of five to six years, by which time voting rights in national elections should be limited to the country of residence.  It is an interesting suggestion and will be debated further as time passes.  Nearly every European country has a different model.  An approach has already been adopted by the EU in terms of environmental legislation.  As the idea of creating equal conditions across the EU starts to weigh more on the issue of voting, I suspect that we might see a greater push from the Union for a homogenisation of the voting practices applied to overseas populations.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked for whom the electorate should vote.  This is where the problems lie.  There would be the same type of electoral system that Ireland has.  In a diaspora constituency of three seats, there would be a ballot paper showing Fianna F&aacute;il candidate X, Fine Gael candidate Y, Labour candidate Z and possibly others.  Unless we change the electoral system, this approach could raise constitutional issues and require another referendum, which is a route we do not want to take too often.  That scenario is the probable one, although I am not a legal expert.</p></speech>

That is why we would need an electoral commission.  Such a commission is necessary for other aspects of the process, but extra support and infrastructure would definitely be necessary to move this process along.</p><p>  An interesting question was asked on whether the Presidential election should be the first step.  I was surprised that the Constitutional Convention was asked to focus on Presidential elections.  In terms of voting rights, the most restrictive voting processes in Ireland are referenda and Presidential elections.  Focusing on the latter was putting the cart before the horse.  I would have preferred it had the Constitutional Convention been allowed last year to discuss general elections as well as Presidential ones.  It was a missed opportunity.</p><p>  On the other hand, I see a great deal of logic in applying this to Presidential elections.  They do not have the same impact, although I am not using that word correctly.  To all intents and purposes, the Presidency is a symbolic office.  It is an interesting suggestion.  I am not fully agreed on either position and can see the logic in both.</p><p>  As to whether the diaspora should be required to register every year, it is important to ask members of the diaspora about their continuing interest in their home country and its policies.  The same rules must apply.  One must be able to facilitate registration, though.  For example, there should be a form of online or postal registration.  However, people should also be expected to register each year.</p></speech>

I gather it is the same in the UK's case.  It makes sense.  The literature suggests there should be an ongoing interest in the home country's political affairs.  An obvious way to show such interest may be through registering annually.  If one stops registering, there might be a pair of suspensions.  First, the home country needs to consider whether the process is too difficult.</p> <p>The other suspicion is that people have lost interest at this point and maybe they do not want the right to vote.</p></speech>

There are many people still on the electoral register who fit that category in Ireland.  The Northern Ireland case is interesting and it relates to the low turnout issue.  If voting rights are extended to the Irish diaspora, they must also be extended to people in Northern Ireland.  That may sort out the problem of low turnout in elections in that case.  My answer is "Yes," and these are same rules which would apply to Irish citizens in Estonia.  It is one issue on which I will give a strong "Yes".</p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked another interesting question on whether we should do this incrementally if we go down this route.  I suspect legal perspectives may be required.  If Ireland decides to respond to the European Union, or if, as I suspect, the EU forces the issue five or ten years down the line, would it be okay to start by just extending voting rights to Irish citizens in Europe?  It is an interesting point and I do not really have the legal expertise required to answer.  My personal view is that if and when voting rights are extended, it should be done for Irish citizens outside the European Union in the interest of fairness.  That applies whether the citizens live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Australia or the United States of America.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Kavanagh for explaining the impact that would have been felt if the system had been place for the last election and answering our questions so thoroughly.  This is the last meeting we will have on this subject and the next step is for the committee to draft a report.  That will take in all the issues raised not just today but at previous hearings as well.  It will be circulated to members prior to discussion and I hope we can have it this side of the recess.
