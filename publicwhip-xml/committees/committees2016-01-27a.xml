I welcome our guest and I will read him our rules on privilege.  I draw his attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind everybody that mobile phones should be turned off completely or put on safe or flight mode, depending on the device.</p><p>As part of the programme for Government, before the chair of a State body is formally appointed he or she gets a chance to engage with an Oireachtas committee.  It gives us an opportunity to talk about the role of the chairman and the person's experience and plans for the future.  </p><p>The role of the Pensions Authority is to regulate and influence policy so that workers in the State are confident they are making adequate provision for their old age and that their pensions expectations will be met.  Its activities include promoting and ensuring, as far as possible, compliance with the Pensions Act, good governance of occupational pensions schemes and the provision of advice.  The committee has a substantial interest in the area of pensions and has debated recent legislation.  Recently, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, announced that Mr. David Begg will be appointed as chairperson of the Pensions Authority for a five-year term.  In line with our procedures, the committee now has an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Begg the work of the Pensions Authority and his approach to the role of chairman.  I welcome Mr. Begg and ask him to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Begg" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#F00200"><p>In the considerable public discourse which has attended my appointment as chair of the Pensions Authority, little or nothing was said about the challenges to public policy posed by the requirement to ensure that the pensions regime is sustainable into the future.  For that reason, I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and set out my views.</p> <p>  I will begin by saying a few words about the Pensions Authority.  The authority supervises compliance with the Pensions Act by scheme trustees, PRSA providers, registered administrators and employees representing 150,000 schemes with 730,000 active members holding more than &euro;80 billion in investment assets and more than 226,000 individual PRSA contracts with &euro;4.6 billion in investment assets.  The authority is responsible for setting and implementing the funding standard for defined benefit pensions.  It can initiate legal action against trustees who are in breach of provisions of the Pensions Act.  It monitors compliance by trustees of occupational pension schemes and, as an alternative to prosecution in the courts, can impose on-the-spot fines on trustees who do not conform with the various requirements of the Pensions Act.  The authority has had a continuing policy of seeking compliance through co-operation with trustees rather than by recourse to legal action, although such action is taken where necessary.</p> <p>  The principal objective of the authority is to support a sustainable pensions environment that will provide adequate and reliable pensions for retired and older people and that achieves wide coverage.  The authority aims to achieve this by supporting the interests of members of occupational pension schemes and personal retirement savings account holders through effective regulation by supervising the operation of pension schemes and PRSAs, by providing relevant information and guidelines to the public and those involved with pensions and by providing advice and technical support to the Department of Social Protection.  The authority is wholly funded by fees levied on occupational pension schemes and PRSA providers.  The authority comprises an independent chairperson appointed by the Minister for Social Protection and two ordinary members, appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>  I will talk now about the evolution of pensions policy over the past 20 years or so, in which I have to some extent been involved.  In the 1990s, the principal objective of pensions policy was to extend coverage of occupational pension schemes.  Occupational pension schemes, where they existed, performed fairly well from a return-on-investment standpoint.  In some cases, employers were able to take a contribution holiday in defined benefit schemes.  However, with the collapse of the dot.com bubble in 2001-2002 market conditions began to change radically.  Equity values fell sharply affecting return on investment.  This coincided with evidence of increasing longevity affecting annuity costs.  It was evident to me at the time that this was a critical juncture with major implications for pensions policy.  In my capacity as general secretary of congress, I initiated discussions with the Department of Finance in 2003 with a view to prompting an appropriate public policy response.  Initially this was not forthcoming but persistent representations led to the establishment of a pensions review body in 2005 and ultimately a Green Paper in 2007 intended to identify the choices available to Government.  It included some discussion on the possibility of a mandatory second-tier pension to complement the State pension but this was not pursued at the time.</p> <p>  The strains on defined benefit schemes were exacerbated by industrial restructuring and by changes in the accounting standards, particularly the introduction of what is known as FRSI7, which required pension liabilities to be stated on the balance sheet of a company.  The result was that shareholder pressure pushed companies in the direction of defined contribution schemes because they did not see any reason they should have this liability on the balance sheet.</p> <p>  The main difference between a defined benefit and defined contributions scheme is that the former requires an employer to fund a specific pension promise to an employee, usually to fund up to half pay, less social welfare benefits, on retirement.  The latter involves no specific employer commitment and a person&rsquo;s pension depends on the amount of pension the money his or her pension pot can buy on retirement.  In effect, changing from defined benefit to defined contribution changes the risk from employer to employee and, ultimately, to the State because no developed country can allow its elderly population to fall into poverty and indignity in their final years.</p> <p>  As already mentioned, these trends were identified by me in their embryonic state in 2003.  Unfortunately, they accelerated in the intervening years resulting in large scale abandonment or closure of defined benefit schemes to new entrants.  Given the importance of the issues for employees, this development led to major industrial disputes involving, among others, the banks, ESB, RTE, Aer Lingus, Dublin Airport Authority and Waterford Glass.  I was involved in the resolution of many of these disputes.</p> <p>  The Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme will illustrate the complexity of what was involved.  The scheme was a joint one involving four employers and six trade unions.  There were several classes of beneficiaries, including retired staff, deferred staff, serving staff and staff who had resigned and were re-employed.  There was a deficit of &euro;720 million in the fund.  The ultimate resolution also involved the trustees, the Pension Authority and the High Court.  It required a complete restructuring of the scheme and an injection of &euro;200 million in new funds.  My involvement was quite complex because I was general secretary of congress and a director of Aer Lingus at the same time.  I had to craft a solution that, at least to some degree, satisfied shareholders, serving staff and deferred pensioners.  It took three years to work all of that out.</p> <p>  A great deal of what was said in the D&aacute;il on this case was a travesty of the truth.  I am willing to discuss my involvement in finding solutions to a range of pension problems over the past few years for as long, and in as much detail, as the committee wishes.  I hope the committee will accept that, contrary to what has been asserted, I have at least some knowledge of pensions.  </p> <p>  I will turn now to the strategic challenges for achieving sustainability of pensions for the future.  The most important concern is that half the population has no pension coverage other than the State old age pension.  Approximately 90% of people in the public service have a pension and yet only 41% of people in the private sector have one.</p><p>The concept of a mandatory second tier pension, as mentioned in the Green Paper, is now under active consideration but there are many issues to be resolved.  Experience in other countries suggests that it is difficult to make this work effectively for lower paid workers or people in precarious employment.  Moreover, it may be hard to get contributions up to an adequate level to provide sufficient income replacement in retirement.</p><p> The alternative approach would be to significantly improve universal provisions via the existing State structure.  This implies a major diversion from tax expenditure in the form of incentives for personal provision into direct State expenditure.  This, of course, would have implications for the viability of existing occupational schemes.  What I am saying, therefore, is that there is an element of path dependency in all of this.  We cannot take a blank sheet of paper and reconstruct a new situation.  It is a question of making the transition from an unsustainable position to a more sustainable one.  Occupational pensions coverage varies from around 90% in the public sector to 41% in the private sector, with overall coverage amounting to 51%.</p><p> Ireland is unique in having a very large number of pension schemes, some 50,000.  Of all pension schemes in Europe, half are in Ireland.  The Netherlands, for example, has 400 schemes.  Pension funds of &euro;90 billion equate to approximately half of Ireland's GDP and are the third highest in Europe after the Netherlands and UK.</p><p> At the beginning of 2011, there were 1,103 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  By the end of September 2015, this number had reduced to 725.  Of this number, 59% meet the funding standard.  Almost all of the 725 defined benefit schemes remaining are closed to new entrants and a significant minority are closed to the further accrual of benefits.  The continuing decline of defined benefit schemes accelerated during the financial crisis.  However, a recovery in investment markets helped nearly half of the defined benefit schemes to meet the minimum funding standard in 2013 and most of the others to submit a recovery plan to the Pensions Authority.  However, recent stock market volatility and the uncertain future for the Chinese economy are a cause for concern.</p><p> The problem with defined contribution schemes is that risk resides with the employee and contributions tend to be much lower than for defined benefit schemes, with the attendant risk of pension inadequacy in retirement.  On average, defined contributions are approximately 11.1% while defined benefit contributions are approximately 20%.  Even if people retire with a decent defined contribution fund, they are confronted with very difficult choices.  They can buy an annuity to secure a guaranteed income or take the chance that they will not live long enough to exhaust the fund at the chosen draw down rate.  Unfortunately, annuities are now very expensive.  The typical cost of buying an annuity at 65 years of age with no provision for future increases was &euro;241,000 per &euro;10,000 of annual income in August 2015, representing a 40% cost increase over the past five years.</p><p> Defined contribution pension schemes and PRSAs are highly vulnerable to poor investment decisions.  In many cases, individuals and trustees are poorly equipped to make these decisions or, in the case of trustees, to advise on them.  Clearly, this is compounded by the exceptionally large number of schemes.  It militates against any possibility of ensuring that trustees acquire the skills to advise members on investment decisions ranging up to 40 years ahead.  These decisions are difficult to make.</p><p> Risk and uncertainty cannot be removed from pension planning.  Apart from investment decisions, account must be taken of demographic factors, including population levels, migration flows, changes in the age profile and longevity.  Migration flows are one of the key variables showing most volatility.  Current assumptions about births, deaths and migration flows suggest that in 2046, 25% of the population will be aged under 20, 51% aged between 20 and 64, and 24% aged 65 or over.  However, this could be wrong and future planning for uncertain outcomes requires the development of policy options which allow for flexibility to accommodate widely varying outcomes.</p><p> The current pensions landscape in Ireland presents a picture which is not sustainable and considerable reform will be necessary to make it so, not least in regard to the number of occupational and private pension schemes in respect of which Ireland is an outlier in Europe.  The first pillar mandatory social insurance pension, the State pension, will remain central because of its role in preventing poverty in retirement.  Approximately 90% of elderly people receive a social welfare pension and these pensions account for 62.7% of their retirement income.  Social transfers reduce the "at risk of poverty" rate for those over 65 from 88.3% to 12.2%.</p><p> I will now consider the European dimension.  There are considerable variations between welfare state models in Europe.  Mostly, they were designed after the war to cater for social risks that have since changed quite dramatically.  The most obvious change relates to demographics and the evolution from a male breadwinner related risk profile to the feminisation of the labour market and the caring issues that arise therefrom.  High lifetime labour force participation at high levels of productivity is the single most important macro-economic prerequisite for maintaining living standards while sustaining inclusive welfare states and thereby citizen well-being.</p><p> For this reason, the functioning of labour markets has a direct bearing on pensions.  For example, projections about the impact of artificial intelligence are quite worrying.  A recently published report by the World Economic Forum suggests that increased automation and artificial intelligence in the workforce will lead to the loss of 7.1 million jobs over the next five years in 15 leading economies, while helping to create just 2 million jobs over the same period.  Moreover, in the United States in 2012, figures from Department of Labour show that the average tenure in a job was 4.6 years.  Were that to become the norm in Europe, it would pose enormous problems and challenges for pensions provision, particularly for mandatory second tier pensions, because it would be an enormous administrative task to try to ensure people's movements between jobs were catered for.</p><p> Deepening European integration, if it happens, will surely bring a greater EU influence to bear on pensions policy-making in Ireland.  At present, proposals for a revised directive governing occupational pension schemes are being considered by the European Parliament.  It is likely that it will require a more intrusive regulation of the governance of occupational schemes in Ireland than is provided for under current legislation.  Brian Hayes MEP is the rapporteur on that committee and I spoke to him about this yesterday.  His understanding is that it is very likely this legislation will come to a conclusion sometime in September of this year and thereafter, approximately 18 months will be allowed for transposition of the directive into Irish law.</p><p> As a matter of interest, in terms of my personal involvement, I have written fairly extensively about social investment in the context of European integration in a book to be published by Palgrave Macmillan next month.</p><p> The task of regulating the Irish pensions regime is one which requires a balance between security and viability in circumstances of fragility and uncertainty about the future.  Frankly, it will be a formidable challenge.  My suitability for the position of chairman of the authority has been discussed at length, if not in depth, in recent weeks.  Obviously, my own view is subjective.  I have attached a copy of my curriculum vitae on which members can make their own judgment.</p></speech>

We will now proceed to questions.  We have an agreed order, which we will follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. Begg for his presentation.  I did not have a copy of it in front of me but I took some notes.  I will look at the transcript later as the presentation was quite wide ranging.  We have a Minister for Social Protection who sets policy and yet Mr. Begg seems to suggest the Pensions Authority has a remit in terms of setting future policy.  Will he elaborate on that?  He said it was a small group, himself and two others.</p><p>On whom would the authority rely?  What type of discussions would take place before the Pensions Authority would take a position on different policies?</p><p> There is a need for a debate and I am not trying to restrict that.  I am trying to figure out how those debates happen and how we can contribute to them.  Obviously, Mr. Begg has experience, as every trade union leader would have, in terms of the concerns of members and society in general.  His opening statement reflected that in terms of the concern about the sustainability of pensions.  He mentioned that, in some ways, these are figures which in time could turn out to be right or wrong.  The concern about the sustainability of pensions may, in fact, be wrong.  Mr. Begg would be aware that some economists have suggested that it is wrong while others suggest it is a low estimate of what is required.  Is it Mr. Begg's intention to try to get another report similar to the one done by KPMG, I think, in 2012?  That could present us with more variables, for example, if the population increases or decreases.  What is the timeframe on that?  That would be important as a new Government is coming in within a number of months.</p><p> As chairman of the Pensions Authority, will Mr. Begg be able to comment in an individual capacity or must it always be as the chairman of the authority?  As chairman designate, has he a view on deferred pensioners who are in defined benefit schemes and their lack of rights when a scheme is wound up or transferred into defined contribution one?  We had a huge debate here about that.  I will not try to tease it all out again but it is something we need to revisit.</p><p> If members have the patience, there are questions to which I might come back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#H00200"><p>Our time is relatively limited.  The challenges facing the pensions industry and the authority are immense.  The role of the Pensions Authority has probably not assisted in the crisis over the past period and we will struggle to get to the bottom of it here in one session; even over a D&aacute;il term, we would struggle to do so.  It is appropriate that we take the opportunity to question Mr. Begg's expertise for the appointment.  We were certainly led to believe that was part of the role of this committee, even if that role is a little bit weak when it is not going to make any difference to the appointment.  Mr. Begg is obviously aware of the discussion around whether that appointment was appropriate, although it was not his decision.  It is something that is in the public domain.</p> <p>  The Chairman pointed out that the key function of the authority is to regulate and influence policy regarding pensions in order to ensure that the expectations of pensioners are met and that schemes are run with good governance.  Given that function, it is appropriate to question Mr. Begg's role in terms of some of the pension schemes he has been involved in, including the one to which he drew attention in his presentation, namely, the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS.  As he said, that was a very complex scheme involving multiple employers and groups of people, existing and deferred pensioners and current contributors.  It had a huge deficit and moneys were put into it to defray some of that deficit.  The real travesty is not anything said in the D&aacute;il but rather the impact of those decisions on the livelihoods of those affected by what went on.  </p> <p>  One of our considerations here is meeting legitimate expectations.  Since that scheme was restructured, retired members, numbering approximately 5,000 people, have seen incomes reduced by &euro;500,000 a month.  These people were specifically excluded from any of the talks in the negotiation process.  Mr. Begg, both in his roles on the board of Aer Lingus and, more particularly, in ICTU, stood over the process whereby those people did not have a voice in negotiations, going against the idea of "nothing about us without us".  He did so even though decisions that came out of that process meant that they suffered a loss of income.  Furthermore, no compensation measures were put in place to defray that loss, even though this took place for other groups.  The bitter irony is that their colleagues who worked in America and England got full pension entitlements while their own legitimate expectations were cruelly dashed.  How could that process have been stood over?  How is that track record going to be beneficial to pensioners going forward?  Retired staff associations and, indeed, the deferred members and so on repeatedly wrote to Mr. Begg and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions seeking assistance and seeking a seat at the table and yet the door was closed on them.</p> <p>  I would also be a little bit concerned that the trade union movement has not advanced the very necessary provision that pensioners who, in many instances, are former trade union members should have access to workplace relations bodies and so on in matters that refer to their pensions once they retire.</p></speech>

I will let members back in a second time.</p></speech>

I will come back in.  I am wondering why Mr. Begg thinks that would help pensioners in his new authority.  In light of the Chairman's remarks, what would Mr. Begg say to those who argue that, given that he was a director of the Central Bank for 14 years, and that the banking inquiry has been quite scathing and has made the point that the Central Bank had sufficient powers to intervene-----</p></speech>

It was the lack of oversight of the Central Bank that caused some of the problems.  How do we know we will have a different approach to oversight in respect of the Pensions Authority role?  My comments relate to Mr. Begg's previous experience and expertise.</p> <p>  The last question, in deference to the Chairman, concerns the fact that the Pensions Authority only requires trustees of schemes to send on an annual report to existing members - say, trade unions and current active members.  Does Mr. Begg have any views on changing that situation so that information is given, on a mandatory basis, to existing current pensioners?  Many of my questions concern how the rights of existing pensioners will be improved under the new Pensions Authority.</p></speech>

The Minister has a separate source of advice in the form of the Pensions Council, which is a separate body from the authority but on which the authority is represented.  As for the process by which that would happen, it seems that it would be the collective view of the authority meeting to discuss a particular issue, out of which would come either a response to the Minister or, alternatively, something that the authority felt should be brought to the Minister's attention.</p> <p>  On the second question of sustainability, the element of risk and uncertainty, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh quite rightly said, is very difficult to manage.  What might risk be?  Risk is that the demographic profile would be worse than we think it is.  Uncertainty would be that we do not know what the level of GNP will be in a few years time.</p><p>There is a necessity to try to balance this.  Perverse things can happen.  I referred in my evidence after the dotcom bubble in 2002 to how very interesting things happened at that time.  There was a collapse in the value of equities, which had a major impact on pension schemes, but the economy did not cease to grow.  One makes choices then as to whether one thinks that privately provided pensions are the best option or risk can be better handled in some extension of the State scheme.  These are very difficult and important questions and the committee is quite right to identify them.</p><p> The question of deferred pensioners also arose in Deputy Daly's remarks.  Let me say first, in response to Deputy Daly, that I took enormous exception to her contribution in the House last week.  I thought it was vitriolic, unfair and cowardly in the sense that she used the privilege of the House to say things about me that were unreasonable and unfair, in my opinion.  She is quite right about the time being limited in how to deal with some of these problems; that is the only issue on which I can agree with the Deputy.</p><p> We can discuss my expertise in all this, starting with the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS, and what I did in those circumstances.  That particular scheme was enormously complex, involving a number of employers and trade unions.  We had a &euro;720 million deficit in the fund, which was critical.  That arose because the strain costs on the fund had not been responded to properly in previous years.  There was a large number of restructuring processes in that industry, and the strain costs resulting in the pension scheme had not been responded to.  The other problem was there was no agreement on whether the scheme was a defined contribution or defined benefit scheme.  That decision would ultimately only be settled in a court of law, if tested, so nobody knew what it was.  From the point of view of the board of the company, the formal position was it had no obligation whatever to staff.</p><p> The Deputy pointed out that I was a member of the board and general secretary of congress as well.  I will park that for a moment before coming back to it.  With regard to contacts held with deferred pension personnel, I accept and have made the point that there is a real difficulty as organisations outside the formal structure of the Labour Court are in quite a difficult position because they cannot have effective representation.  It is not true that we did not engage with them.  I appointed the industrial relations officer of congress, Mr. Liam Berney, to have regular contact with those groups of people.  I made strong representations on their issues to the board in the course of the discussions that took place.</p><p> I will address the question of legitimate expectations.  It is certainly true that employees took an enormous hit but there was one difficulty with that scheme.  In certain circumstances it was a co-ordinated scheme but in other circumstances, it was unco-ordinated.  If a person served in the scheme until 65 and left on a normal retirement date, the person would have a co-ordinated pension.  That meant the person would have an occupational pension less the amount of the social welfare pension.  That is the norm in nearly all of the defined benefit schemes around the country.  If a person left prior to a normal retirement date - even within one week of turning 65 - there was an anomaly in the scheme that allowed an unco-ordinated pension.  If a person had 40 years of service, the person would get 40 eightieths as the pension entitlement plus the old-age pension.  That was an extremely beneficial provision but it was unsustainable because it was an anomaly in the circumstances of the pension fund being in deficit to the tune of &euro;720 million.</p><p> I worked very hard on the board and as the congress general secretary to try to improve that.  I was working at an enormous disadvantage as I could not say what I was doing at the board because I was constrained by confidentiality issues.  As most people recall, the major shareholder on the board was totally and utterly opposed to any input of money to fix the scheme's difficulties.  In the end, we tried to bring about a targeted benefit scheme that allowed people to have the same expectation as they would have had if they were part of a co-ordinated pension scheme.  In the end, the workers of the company voted by a substantial majority to accept that.  Of course, the deferred benefit people were at a disadvantage because of not having collective representation so they did not have a direct influence.  They did not have access to the Labour Court to argue around any of the decisions emerging from the court relating to all this.  I made a strong case to the board of the company for an injection of &euro;40 million and it was eventually secured.</p><p> I will speak a little about my role in the Central Bank.  I agree with the Chairman in that it has nothing to do with the Pensions Authority and has been brought in extraneously as part of the vilification process that has been ongoing.  Nevertheless, I will deal with it directly.  I have received no communication from the banking inquiry team regarding my comments on the draft of the report.  Clearly, there is nothing in this that bears upon me from the team's perspective.  I gave three and a half hours of evidence and made two written submissions, which are available to anybody who will take the trouble to look for them.  That is very detailed evidence.  In the course of giving evidence, I made a point that was fully vindicated by saying that in 2005, I pointed out to the board of the bank that there was a serious difficulty in circumstances where people felt they needed to get on a ladder of having a second house.  Such second houses were being built by people who came here as migrants to work in the construction industry and would, effectively, have become the tenants for those houses.  It would not have taken a genius to figure out that this was an unsustainable circular process.</p><p> My comments on this to the board were vindicated by no less a person than the chief economist of the bank in his evidence to the inquiry, such that the inquiry team wrote to me before I gave my evidence to ask if I wished to comment on what the chief economist stated.  Not alone did I do it in the Central Bank forum but I also did it publicly at a social policy conference in UCD on 10 October 2005.  I gave a copy of my speech to the inquiry and if anybody on this committee wants to find out what is in that, I am sure it can be provided by the inquiry team.  It will probably be published as part of the evidence, as I assume all the evidence will be published.  I reject completely that there is any connection between my suitability for this proposed role and my appointment to that position in the Central Bank.</p><p> I was asked about trustee information.  One of the big problems with trusteeship at the moment, as I stated earlier, is that we have 150,000 schemes, which is an enormous amount.  That means there is an enormous number of trustees.  We should be honest.  In many cases, people do not have the necessary investment experience or training to handle responsibilities of this type.  It is a serious difficulty.  There is a role for professional trustees, of course, who are people from the pensions industry usually commissioned to act on trustee boards.  There is a strong case for reform to try to reduce the number of schemes.  We will not really have the chance to ensure good investment decisions for people unless we can do that and professionalise the role of trustees.  None of that is to gainsay the contribution that trustees make, almost always in a voluntary capacity, to pension schemes.  There is a tremendous risk in this area and there should be full transparency.  I would support such an initiative with respect to trustee reports.  I would have no difficulty with that.</p></speech>

While I have huge reservations about the way we make appointments to these boards I believe Mr. Begg is the right man for the job at this time.</p><p> Did Mr. Begg&rsquo;s membership of the board of Aer Lingus cause a problem in respect of the difference between what happened with the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme, IASS, and the Waterford Crystal pension scheme?  Does he have any problem with dual board membership?</p><p> Trustees&rsquo; training is a major issue in pension schemes, given the large number there are and the role of the professional trustees.  Does Mr. Begg intend to merge many of these schemes and develop training schemes, similar to those in the credit union movement, where people must have qualifications to serve on the boards?  The professionals generally come from some of the big pension houses and sometimes, because of the lack of training, voluntary members of the board become subservient to them.  Does Mr. Begg have any comment on that?</p></speech>

I will not get into any controversy because I am not a pensions expert and I know very little about trade unions.  I will try to keep my questions as practical as possible.</p> <p>  Reading Mr. Begg&rsquo;s curriculum vitae, there is nobody more competent than him to chair the authority.  I come from a very ordinary background and know nothing about pensions and I got a fright listening to his statement that there is a formidable challenge to pensions in the future.  He said 91% of people have a State pension and only 40% plus also have a private pension.  Will his role involve encouraging young people to take out a pension when they start work?  If only 40% of people in the private sector have pensions maybe their employers are not encouraging them to take out pensions to sustain as they get older.  I have two girls who are beginning their working life and they have taken out pensions in their workplace.  I was encouraged when they said they had done that.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Begg broaden his comment about the formidable challenges?  I meet many women who stayed at home to rear their children and I am always taken aback by the fact this country has not been fair to them.  They only get a non-contributory pension.  What are Mr. Begg&rsquo;s views on that?  I know that is a different area but we need to acknowledge that in the past women stayed at home to rear their large families, for example, my sisters who are in their 70s.  They do not benefit in the way that someone who went out and got a job does.  It is not right that older women, who gave their lives to rearing their children well in order that they never caused trouble in society and knew how to function as normal human beings, are not acknowledged.  I would welcome any comments Mr. Begg might have on that.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Begg for deciding to take up this very important role, even though he has been appointed to it.</p></speech>

They were different in some respects.  With regard to the Waterford Crystal case, the expectation of the long-term employees - people who had worked for nearly 40 years - was to get two thirds of a pension entitlement.  More or less overnight, the scheme collapsed - it is termed "double insolvency" when a company and a pension scheme collapse - and resulted in the entitlement being reduced from nearly two thirds to an expectation of between 18% and 28%.  Unite, which represented the people in Waterford Crystal, assisted by SIPTU, litigated successfully on this in European on the grounds that Ireland was obliged to have a pensions protection scheme in place but did not have one.  That was a successful case but there was "a degree" question, that is, the extent to which the national system should cover the entitlements or the expectations of people in the scheme.  Through a long process that was eventually worked out, an acceptable solution was negotiated and the people in Waterford Crystal were extremely happy with that.  Indeed, some of them have said so in print in the past week.  I had a role in discussing that with the T&aacute;naiste, who made very considerable efforts to try to bring about a resolution to that situation, which was good in the end.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked if there were difficulties trying to manage my role on the board of Aer Lingus and my position as general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There were enormous difficulties, as it is a very difficult thing to do.  There are huge legal constraints on one when one is a member of any board.  Frankly, people were watching my every move to see what I did.  The possibility of litigation in that situation was very real because the amounts of money involved were enormous.  There were people who felt they did not need to, and should not have to, pony up the money which related to the needs of the workers there.</p> <p>  With regard to trustees' training, I absolutely agree that it is important.  However, it is consequent on first of all trying to reform the enormous number of schemes in the country.  There are 150,000 schemes, which is simply not sustainable and is an unmanageable situation.  In my statement, I mentioned that there are 400 schemes in the Netherlands.  I also refer to the element of part-dependency.  One cannot take out a blank sheet of paper and construct a completely new model.  One must have regard to what is already there.  While I could see considerable opportunity for amalgamation of a defined contribution schemes, it would be extremely difficult to amalgamate the defined benefit schemes as individuals would have different promises and entitlements under those schemes.</p> <p>  I was asked about the roles of professionals.  Given the gap between the experience of lay trustees and of professional trustees, does that mean professional trustees could have an overweening influence?  In my experience, professional trustees have always acted extremely honourably and I do not believe they would ever do anything wrong in that case.  Obviously, there is asymmetrical information between the two groups and the job of the board should be to try to bring up the skills of the lay trustees so they can, off their own bat, be competent to handle any issue which might come up.</p> <p>  I will now turn to Senator O'Donnell's question about my best qualification for this role.  How about the fact I am a pensioner?  Would that be a good starting point?  I have a lot experience in different industries and aspects of life.  In the past week, I would have said it was the virtue of being an old dog that is not gun-shy because so much fire has been directed at me.  If I was gun-shy, I would have gone to ground a long time ago.</p> <p>  I cannot really answer the comments on the Clery's workers' situation because I do not have a knowledge of that particular pension.  That problem blew up a considerable time after I left the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  While I am aware of it as it is in the public domain, I do not have a detailed, intimate knowledge of the situation.</p> <p>  With regard to the national lottery and whether it should have been sold, it appears to have been a Government decision designed to increase revenue for the Exchequer.  One might say that retaining a profitable lottery into the future would be better but this is a judgment call.  I do not want to say too much on it on that front.</p> <p>  I was asked about the statistics.  We might have been a little bit at cross-purposes and I am sorry I cut across.  The point I was trying to make was that the size of the population of over 65s will increase dramatically.  I believe it will double by the year 2056 from what it is currently.  This will bring a lot of attendant problems.  People will be older and they will live longer but the cost of maintaining people against chronic illness and so on is an aspect of demographics which is very difficult.  It is an extremely valuable point.  Consider people who may have paid into the VHI all their lives and suddenly they stop working and they have a big drop in income.  One of the first things people would look at is whether they can maintain paying for health insurance in these circumstances because, as everybody knows, it is quite expensive.  A situation then arises which nobody would want.  People who had paid for health insurance all their lives find they cannot avail of it when they most need it.  Demands will be placed on the health service with age-related chronic illnesses of diabetes, cancer and so on.  There are many issues, not just in pensions, around this demographic which are not explored.  There is a malign interaction between the insecurity of pensions and the increased cost of supporting people in old age.  It will be a huge strategic challenge for the State.</p> <p>  I was asked about my book which is based on a PhD thesis.  It was developed from that.  Publishers never admit that anything is based on a thesis or it would not sell.  I completed my thesis a number of years ago.  I looked at the way in which a number of small open economies in Europe have managed European integration over a 25 year period and at how they ended up and what the lessons were for Ireland.  Social investment is a key part in all of that.  The book was to update it to the present day and it will be published at the end of February 2016.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell asked if I intend to stand for the Seanad.</p></speech>

I do not want to frighten anybody but there are strategic issues for us as a country.  We are lucky in regard to the demographics in that we are about two generations better off than most of Europe.  That is a strong point we have.  However, in the next ten to 15 years, we will be in the same position as Germany, Denmark and countries like that.  It is a real and serious worry.  The real challenge for us is to use the intervening time to properly plan for this and to address it.  Let us face it that for the last 20 years, people have shied away from addressing this issue because of the enormity of the situation.  We cannot do that any longer.</p> <p>  On the topic of encouraging people to take up pensions, young people do not generally think about it.  I heard it said that pensions are very boring until a person reaches 50 years of age and then one becomes interested in them.</p><p>By the time one reaches the age of 60 years it becomes a riveting subject, but people lose out as a result of this.  A few years ago we had the personal retirement savings account, PRSA, which fundamentally was intended to deal with the coverage question, but it did not.  We must look at how we can deal with the issues of coverage and adequacy.  The issue of adequacy arises because the amount of money being put into personal pension schemes is not adequate to give people the coverage they need to have a replacement income of approximately 50%.  The general parameters of policy are to have a replacement income of 50%, approximately 34% of which is made up by the State pension, and coverage of approximately 70% of the working population.  As we have not got near these figures in the past 20 years, there is a real problem.</p><p> Much of the thinking behind giving tax incentives is that it would follow that people would seek to have private coverage, but one of the difficulties is that the associated tax expenditures which are almost as large as the amount of money we pay out on the State pension scheme gravitate very much to those on higher incomes.  If we take it that only 41% of those in the private sector are covered and two thirds of the benefit of the tax expenditures goes to the higher part of the upper 20% of the cohort of the population involved, we must ask from a policy perspective whether that is the best use.  We must open it up for discussion.  It is a formidable challenge because policy makers cannot operate in a way that suddenly collapses the fragile existing system we have in place.</p><p> The point made about women is absolutely correct.  It is a real difficulty.  If we look at the statistics, leaving aside occupational pensions, of those in receipt of the State pension, 64% of men receive a contributory pension, while only 27% of women qualify for the maximum rate of State pension alone and some 58% do not have this entitlement.  I will use the situation in my house as an example.  My wife had to leave the public service when she got married and could not continue her pension arrangements.  When our children were young, she was out of the labour force for 17 years.  She then went back in and tried to buy back an element of the public service pension.  However, as it is a co-ordinated pension scheme, she will not have made enough contributions to qualify for the full State pension.  Women are very vulnerable in that regard.  The risk of poverty for older women is somewhat higher than that for men.</p></speech>

He is a great candidate and eminently suitable, as he has demonstrated in his presentation.  I particularly welcome somebody from a trade union background because many members of pension schemes come from such a background.  Mr. Begg has a lot of experience to bring and a deep insight.  Most trade unionists to whom I have spoken in the past week certainly welcome his appointment.  I look forward to his input in this very important role in the years ahead.</p> <p>  I wish to raise several issues about the IASS, deferred members and Deputy Clare Daly's point about people having a legitimate expectation of what they might stand to gain on retirement.  Mr. Begg referred to an anomaly in the scheme.  I have argued that while some called it an anomaly, what it amounted to was the company exploiting the rules of the scheme to use it as a slush fund and encouraging people to leave on the basis of unco-ordination to achieve the productivity it was seeking to achieve.  It benefited from this anomaly, or what I argue were the rules of the scheme.  The trustees ought to have been aware of this, but they seem to have been asleep on the job.  What are Mr. Begg's general thoughts on this, with reference to what ought to happen in the future in such cases?</p> <p>  I also have a general point to make about the various categories of membership of the scheme.  There were active members, deferred members and retired members.  We meet them more often then we did in recent years.  I have met many of them and members in all categories are disappointed.  Active members are dissatisfied with the value transferred from the old scheme.  Retired members have lost 10%, while deferred members have lost 50% to 60%.  They are seeking to be treated in the same way as retired members, as they had been previously.  In Mr. Begg's view, was there any possible outcome which could have led to greater satisfaction throughout all of the groups?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#M00500"><p>I welcome Mr. Begg and wish him well on his appointment in a challenging role, as he outlined in his presentation.  There are huge challenges on the road ahead and the undertaking to which he has committed is significant.  I wish him the very best of luck and hope he and the board will have success in facing some of the challenges, the outcome of which will have a massive impact on the current and future generations.</p> <p>  A point touched on by Deputy Catherine Byrne concerned the lack of pension coverage.  Some 41% of workers do not have pension cover.  How far does the challenge of increasing coverage extend into Mr. Begg's remit?  He has oversight of existing pension schemes.  On a related question, would he support the idea of making pension contributions mandatory throughout the public and private sectors?  Is this the only solution to the problem?  I would appreciate Mr. Begg's views on this question.  I appreciate that he is only beginning his role and look forward to further engagement with him as he teases out some of these issues with a better insight, but I would like to hear his initial thoughts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#M00600"><p>I have several points to make about what Mr. Begg said.  Perhaps he did not understand the point about being a member of the board of the Central Bank.  In essence, the point is that he signed off on financial stability reports, particularly in the period 2003 to 2007 when the Central Bank allowed the banks to borrow 50% of GDP, loan it out and fuel the property bubble.  We know that as a result of these financial stability reports, many pensioners were encouraged to buy shares in the banks and that many of them lost their livelihoods.</p> <p>  I find it strange that Mr. Begg categorised some of the comments made about his appointment as hostile abuse.  To be honest, that is a gross exaggeration.</p><p>I am wondering how Mr. Begg could not possibly understand how people who have seen their retirement livelihoods decimated, most paretically in a scheme in which Mr. Begg&rsquo;s organisation had a very direct role, would be upset that he has been appointed to his current role.</p><p> Mr. Begg said I was vitriolic.  I do not accept that.  He said I made some cowardly remarks under D&aacute;il privilege.  I would like to know what those remarks were.  He said my remarks were unfair.  I am sure he did not like them even though they were not personal and certainly not intended to be such.  They were not untrue.  If Mr. Begg believes they are, I would like him to specify why point by point, after which I will answer him on those points.</p><p> Much time has been spent on the IASS because it is directly relevant to Mr. Begg's most recent appointment in terms of his experience.  He justified his role by referring to the scale of the deficit involved in the scheme and the strain costs imposed through management decisions to let people go.  It is a fact that, during the time in question, Mr. Begg was on the board of the company that stood over these decisions.  Deputy Ryan is actually correct in that it was not a case of an anomaly in the pension scheme; it was an absolute fact that the clause in the pension scheme was used to entice people to sell their jobs and take retirement to lower the costs of the company.  Mr. Begg was on the board of the company at the time.</p><p> There was a problem in that there were multiple schemes of this kind over the years.  It was not a case of just one redundancy scheme; there were multiple schemes throughout Aer Lingus's history.  The problem is that it is the pensioners and members of the scheme who have paid the price for this debacle.  I appreciate that Mr. Begg can say an effort was made to try to share the pain, but the companies involved did not share it.  They did not put in enough money to undo the poor decision-making in which they engaged.  Unlike Waterford Glass, these are highly profitable companies that had the money to put in.</p><p> I am wondering about this because Mr. Begg made a couple of points that were not really accurate or did not describe the full picture.  I was not just talking about deferred members but also about the existing retired members.  They comprise two separate groups who were prevented from sitting at the negotiating table.  While it is true that ICTU engaged with the deferred group, there was no engagement with the retired group, which was organised and represented by RASA, in particular.  While it is true that extra money was made available for defrayal and to compensate the deferred members a little &mdash; I do not know whether this is the result of Mr. Begg's input behind the scenes or the work of the pensions committee &mdash; Mr. Begg skipped over the fact that no moneys were allocated to compensate the existing retired members, who are the ones seeing &euro;500,000 going out of their collective wage packet every month.  They got nothing.  While it is true that these groups were outside the Labour Court mechanism, and therefore in a difficult position, the question I am asking Mr. Begg, the former head of ICTU, is what the union did do to alter these circumstances and give the workers a voice and a mechanism, for now and the future?</p></speech>

Will it be investigated under Mr. Begg's remit?  He said his greatest expertise was being a pensioner.  Of how many pension schemes is he a member?  How many pensions is he likely to receive from the various posts in which he served over the years?</p></speech>

I am not as familiar with the issue as Deputies Clare Daly and Brendan Ryan or Mr. Begg but I have certainly attended some meetings and have read the correspondence we received and listened to some of the debate.  My impression was that, in terms of working out a solution, everybody faced some risk.  If one were to go down the legal route and thrash these issues out in court, there would not necessarily be a better deal for the people concerned.  It could work out worse.  All of these factors are part of the picture when compromise is being reached.  These were my thoughts on the matter at the time.</p> <p>  When reference was made to the second tier of pension, was Mr. Begg referring to the auto-enrolment scenario?  What is his view on auto-enrolment?  This is a matter the committee has examined.  Should there be universal pension provision?  Deputy Byrne raised the case of women who had to leave the Civil Service because of the marriage ban and consequently did not have enough contributions for their pensions.  Obviously, there are others who are not covered.  There are also those who may contribute to a private or public service pension but who do not receive the State pension.  Should everybody not get a State pension from the outset as a basic principle?  Perhaps everybody should have to make a contribution in that regard.  Social welfare recipients obviously receive credit, but this could be tied into the equation also.  Those are my questions.  Mr. Begg has a lot of ground to cover.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Begg" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#N00500"><p>I shall respond to Deputy Ryan's comments first.  He is quite correct that most, if not all, occupational pension schemes are, as far as I know, the product of trade union and management negotiations.  Companies that do not have the collective bargaining remit would be very unlikely to have a defined benefit scheme.</p> <p>  On the anomaly with the IASS, one could perhaps find a better word for it.  However, the difficulty I saw, and in respect of which the Deputy and I have had many discussions, was that nearly all pension schemes in the country had a co-ordinated provision by which one's pensionable pay was offset by reference to the social welfare provision.  Sometimes it is one times the value of the social welfare provision, but more likely twice that value.  The difficulty I found in getting a better result out of all this publicly, leaving aside the willingness, or otherwise, of the company, its investors and shareholders to put money in, was that if one were to legislate on this as a public policy issue, one would have to legislate for a quite unique set of circumstances.  Personally, I believed that was unlikely but perhaps others have a different view.  Certainly, however, it was very unlikely that one could have allowed for what I describe, particularly in the way it operated because it was a co-ordinated pension under the rules of the scheme if one retired at 65.  It was unco-ordinated in practice if one retired short of that age.  It was a most extraordinary provision.  However, this does not gainsay the fact that it was a very heavy hit for many people, particularly people at the lower end, whose real income would have been reduced significantly as a result of the &euro;12,000 odd associated with the State pension.  Nevertheless, this was a quite difficult set of circumstances.</p> <p>  None of us can ignore the fact that the &euro;720 million deficit was enormous.  There was no great willingness on the part of the company to put money into the scheme.  One of the shareholders, the major shareholder, was said in public to have been against doing anything in this regard.  Therefore, it was practically very difficult to try to secure a resolution that would have mitigated the worst effects of the deficit of &euro;720 million.  Consider the outcome of a targeted pension to give the same level of co-ordinated benefits.</p><p>While everybody is probably dissatisfied with the outcome, it was possibly the least worst option.  Regarding the trustees and the strain cost over the year, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that something was missed.  These were important additional strains that were put on it, and it should have been copped much earlier.</p><p> I will not make any mistake between the two Deputies Daly.  In response to Deputy Jim Daly, only 41% in the private sector have a pension scheme.  Extending cover is a serious challenge and a universal or mandatory scheme is being contemplated at a policy level.  We should make it mandatory.  In Britain there is a "soft mandatory" arrangement.  It would not be terribly effective, given that young people do not always consider the value of a pension and they may have many other stresses and strains in their lives.  Given the choice between paying one's mortgage or paying into a pension, one might possibly opt out of a pension.  A separate organisation, the National Employment Savings Trust, NEST, is trying to improve pension coverage in Britain.  It will be interesting to see how successful it is.</p><p> Deputy Clare Daly asked many questions.  I really believe the Deputy abused privilege in the D&aacute;il in the attacks she made about my role in the IASS.</p></speech>

I do not accept it.  While I am well used to hostility publicly, the Deputy should consider, from time to time, the damage she inflicts on a person's family.  It never seems to go through her head.</p> <p>  While the Central Bank stability reports tended to indicate what the risks were, it can be argued that it did not stress them strongly enough over the years.  I can give an account only of my role.  I gave detailed evidence to the banking inquiry.  If the committee feels it is relevant, it is more than welcome to examine my three and a half hours of evidence to the banking inquiry and the two written statements I made.  I also ask the committee to consider the evidence given by the then chief economist of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  On the multiple schemes that affected the straining cost, it is true that from the 1990s, when the Deputy was a shop steward in a company, I was involved in only one, the leave and return scheme, which set up a provision whereby people could enter into a defined contribution, DC, scheme separately.  This restructuring was successful, in its way, although it was not very successful for the company which was loaded with many unanticipated taxation costs.  For the people involved, it was good enough.</p> <p>  The problem of representation of people at the Labour Court is a difficulty.  I am in favour of some opportunity for people to be heard.  The Deputy is mistaken in saying we had no engagement with any of the other groups.  ICTU staff were available to anybody who wanted to talk to them.  I was constrained from doing so for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  The difficulty was that there was not enough money.  Regarding how to extract more than &euro;200 million from people, maybe other people were better at it than I.  It was the best I could do, and it brought a result which, while probably not satisfactory to anybody, as a damage limitation exercise, it was not the worst outcome.</p> <p>  While I am not sure how relevant my situation is, I will tell the Deputy.  I have one pension from ICTU of &euro;32,000 per year.  Contrary to what was asserted, I do not have a multiple of public appointments.  I have reservations as to whether people should be asked to declare such personal information.  It has been said by all and sundry that I am a millionaire.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Begg" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012700002#O00600"><p>I did not respond to the Chairman's point about the legal route.  There was a fundamental issue of a legal nature as to whether the scheme was a defined contribution or a defined benefit scheme.  The company took the view that it was a defined contribution scheme, meaning it had no obligation to put in money to deliver on the pension promised under the old IASS scheme.  The staff view was, on that contrary, that it was a defined benefit scheme.  The question could only be determined by way of litigation, such as through the High Court.  The risk for either side was that if they lost in court, their case would be over.  Therefore, although many people talked about litigating, nobody litigated.</p> <p>  I agree with auto-enrolment.  Pensions should be mandatory, not "soft mandatory".  There is a reasonable argument that we would get better results if we took all the money we put into subsidising pensions and put it into State pensions.  Handling the transition would be tricky.  If the Government announced in the morning that it was going to do it, it would be saying good-bye to all the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes that exist.  If the Government made this policy choice, migrating from our current position would be very challenging.</p></speech>

It is a very challenging, interesting and brilliant role.  As he said, one of the greatest challenges is that pensions will not meet the costs of growing old.  We are not dying of cancer and disease so much but of old age, and we are getting older.  This is the major challenge, as I have learned here politically over the past five years.  I wish Mr. Begg much luck and thank him for answering my questions, although they might have been more creative than others.</p></speech>

It is strange that Mr. Begg took offence at such a question, given that he had no problem describing in detail his wife's pension entitlements.  There is a problem there.</p></speech>

Mr. Begg answered the Chairman's question as to whether it was a DC or DB scheme.  That was a tactic the companies used to delay the process.  There was a firm ruling that it was a DB scheme, with no question or doubt.  That issue was not relevant regarding the latter crisis around the IASS.</p></speech>

There is a practice in the D&aacute;il of not speaking about somebody outside the Houses who is not there to defend himself or herself.  I do not like to see the D&aacute;il used in that way.  It relates to the issue of privilege.</p></speech>

There seemed to be a coalition of attack on me involving the far right and the far left.  I have always been a nemesis of the Trotskyist left in my long career.  The latter has a total objection to anybody in social democratic politics.  I thought there was a vitriolic dimension to Deputy Clare Daly's attack in that particular political sense.  She was willing to make a coalition with the extreme right in order to do that.  That struck me as extraordinary.  As far as I can recall, in the whole experience of the Aer Lingus matter I do not believe I received a telephone call from the Deputy about it, whereas Deputy Ryan was on my case morning, noon and night.  I do not understand what Deputy Clare Daly was at in this regard, other than engaging in a very personal attack in that sense.</p> <p>  I do not know if I have any power to investigate the role of the trustees in the past.  I do not think it would even be useful to do that.  The past is the past.  I do not think anything good can come of it.  On the issue of whether it was defined benefit or defined contribution, the judgment on the defined benefit was by the then Pensions Board but that was challenged by the company.  Ultimately, it always appeared in the company's balance sheet as a defined contribution scheme.  Regardless of who was right or wrong, ultimately, it could only have been tested in the courts.</p></speech>

As the title suggests, these draft regulations related to provisions concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each Houses of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by the Minister.  The draft amending regulations make changes to the exempted development provisions set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2015, which are the principal regulations.  These changes relate primarily to the provision of a number of exemptions for development undertaken by Irish Water in the provision of essential water services.  The amendments also provide for the clarification of limitations or conditions on certain existing exemptions relating to electricity service transmission and grid connections, the removal of exemptions for portable waste disposal compactors, the insertion and amendment of some definitions, together with a number of minor technical amendments to the principal regulations generally.  In this context, my Department is continually engaged in reviewing and considering ways of streamlining the planning framework and, in the context of the exempted development regulations, whether it is appropriate to exempt further development from the requirement to obtain planning permission.</p> <p>  The primary basis for exempted development is section 4(2) of the 2000 Act, which permits development to be exempted which, by reason of its size, nature or limited effect would not offend against the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  As already indicated, the main focus of the draft regulations is to provide for exemptions for certain development works undertaken by Irish Water.  In this connection, the draft regulations insert a new class of exemptions, class 58, in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the principal regulations for certain works undertaken by Irish Water.  These exemptions will permit Irish Water to undertake works relating to normal day-to-day activities without the need to obtain planning permission from the relevant planning authority.  Previously, the provision of water services and related works was undertaken by the local authorities with broad exemptions under which they could operate.  As Irish Water now has taken over the water services functions of local authorities and cannot avail of these exemptions available to local authorities, it is now appropriate that Irish Water should have similar exemptions to those previously given to the local authorities, as well as those given to other statutory utility providers involved in the provision of electricity, gas and telecommunications services.</p> <p>  The proposed exemptions for Irish Water in the draft regulations include works relating to the maintenance and repair of existing water services, pipes and water mains and associated apparatus, the installation of new pipes and associated apparatus, such as kiosks and service connections with certain restrictions, the provision of below-ground pumping or booster stations and holding tanks with restrictions.  The exemptions also include the provision of telemetry and telecommunications apparatus on water service sites with restrictions, the provision of structures on water service sites for sampling and testing of water with restrictions, the carrying out of remedial works in compliance with a licence issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, under the Wastewater Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations of 2007, the maintenance, repair or upgrading of water structures on a water services site with restrictions, the installation of plant or equipment on a water services site, as necessary, to avert risk to public health or critical failure of infrastructure, the carrying out of emergency works to ensure the continued supply of essential water services for households and businesses, the provision of fences and gates etc. on water services sites with restrictions, as well as the undertaking of test drilling for public water supplies.  Allied to these amendments is the insertion of a technical definition of the term "accessories", which is referred to in the exemptions with regard to pipes, water mains and such apparatus, and as provided for in section 2 of the Water Services Act 2007.</p> <p>  I point out in particular that these draft regulations do not provide blanket exemptions for development works by Irish Water.  The proposed exemptions are subject to both general and specific restrictions and any works proposed by Irish Water that are not specifically exempted will require full planning permission.  In addition, Article 9 of the principal regulations provides for a range of restrictions on exemptions generally.  For example, it provides that development listed in Schedule 2, which relates to exempted development, shall not be exempted development if it would contravene an objective of a development plan or a local area plan or such draft plans where such objectives may relate to the preservation or protection of the character of a landscape or a site of archaeological or historical interest.  Restrictions also apply where development would endanger public safety or would obstruct a public right of way.  Furthermore, any exemptions in the regulations are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions as set out in the Act.  For example, section 4(4) of the Act provides that development shall not be exempted development if an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or an appropriate assessment, AA, of the development is required in accordance with relevant European Union directive requirements.  In such scenarios, planning permission is required for any such proposed developments supported by the undertaking of an EIA or AA, or both, of the proposed development.</p> <p>  In effect, there is a comprehensive range of restrictions or limitations which can be applied to any exempted development works undertaken by Irish Water.</p><p>In the absence of Irish Water being given exemptions for the types of works proposed in these draft regulations, which I have already suggested could be generally regarded as routine day-to-day activities for example pipe repair or replacement to guarantee continuity of supply, it would have to apply for planning permission to undertake the necessary works, with associated delays leading to significant inconvenience for households and businesses in terms of the resumption of normal supply.</p><p> The regulations also propose the substitution of a revised definition of the term "protected person".  This definition relates to recent exemptions given in the Planning and Development (Amendment) No. 4 Regulations 2015 to the change of use without the requirement of planning permission of certain premises such as hotels and hostels to provide accommodation or emergency reception and orientation centres for refugees and asylum seekers - protected persons.</p><p> As members are aware, Ireland is committed to accepting up to 4,000 people on resettlement or relocation into the country over the coming two years under the Government's refugee protection programme as the Irish contribution to the EU relocation programme for migrants.  This amendment to the existing "protected person" definition is a technical amendment to remove the possibility of any confusion in the reading and interpretation of the regulations with reference to the Refugee Act 1996 and the subsidiary protection regulations 2013, thereby underpinning the refugee protection programme.</p><p> With regard to electricity services and grid connections, the draft regulations also propose the insertion of a new condition or limitation to the existing class 26 and class 27 in Schedule 2, Part 1 of the principal regulations.  These classes currently provide exemptions for parties authorised to provide an electricity service to lay underground mains and cables, class 26, and to construct overhead transmission or distribution lines, conducting electricity not exceeding 20 kV, class 27.</p><p> The insertion of the proposed new condition to classes 26 and 27 will specifically restrict the application of these exemptions so that they will not apply to development which is for the purposes of connecting a project requiring an EIA or an AA to the national system for transmission of electricity, such as in the case of the connection of a wind farm development to the national electricity grid.</p><p> These changes will effectively provide, for example, that grid connections for wind farms requiring an EIA, an AA or both, will no longer be exempt from planning permission as they have up to now.  They will now become de-exempted under these regulations.  This will ensure that the grid connection element for EIA-scale proposed developments, such as wind energy development projects, should in the future be treated and assessed as part of the overall proposed wind farm development, in which case an EIA should be carried out for both the wind farm and the grid connection elements.</p><p> This approach is in line with the EU EIA directive requirements that the entirety of a proposed project should be assessed at planning permission stage and it further reflects a recent High Court judgment that found that connection to the national grid was an integral part of a wind farm development proposal and should, therefore, be assessed as part of an EIA for the entire project.</p><p> It is intended that my Department will issue guidance to planning authorities to provide greater clarity and advice on the assessment of applications for planning permission for such developments in order to ensure that such projects are assessed in their totality in line with the EIA directive requirements and also reflecting the High Court judgment in this regard.  The draft regulations further propose to remove the existing exemption in class 42B regarding portable waste disposal compactors on business premises.  Waste disposal compactors have a role to play in certain areas that have, for example, a transient population who are unlikely to sign up for a collection service - for example, an area with a large number of holiday homes or remote areas not served by kerbside waste collections.</p><p> However, there has been a significant increase in the use of such compactors in recent years, even in locations well served by kerbside collection services.  In these areas they are effectively in competition with kerbside collectors thereby potentially undermining that service.  Waste policy, as reflected in the regional waste management plans, recognises the importance and the primacy of kerbside collection in the management of waste.  Consequently, it is proposed to remove the current exemption so that all proposed waste disposal compactors are subject to a requirement to obtain planning permission.  This process will provide for such applications to be assessed in the context of national and regional waste policy to ensure that they play an appropriate role in the overall waste management infrastructure.</p><p> In addition, Articles 4 and 6 of the draft regulations make minor technical amendments to Article 193(2)(g) of the principal regulations and also to paragraph 16 of the directions for completing form No. 2, the planning application form, in Schedule 3 of the principal regulations, respectively.  If the draft regulations are approved by positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas they will come into force as soon as they are made by the Minister.  I commend the draft regulations to the committee and I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have on their content.</p></speech>

These regulations are practical and, in the case of Irish Water, will allow that organisation to carry out its functions with more efficacy and clarity on the basis that it will enjoy the same exemptions enjoyed by the local authorities.</p> <p>  On the issue of local authorities' planning and development, and Irish Water, there are a number of estates that have not been taken in charge.  In my constituency it has been stated that they are waiting to hear from Irish Water regarding the water services in estates.  Since these estates have not been completed properly, they are on a list to be taken over.  It now seems to have been pushed over and onto Irish Water, which is responsible for water services.</p> <p>  However, in cases where the bond has expired and there is no money to address any problems that are found in the wastewater or surface water drains, who will pay to bring these up to standard and allow the residents to have their estate taken into charge where they can ensure that lights, potholes and water services are properly attended to if they need repair or upgrading?  They are in no man's land.  There is a lacuna there whereby people are paying their property tax and everything else they are required to pay, including their water charges, and the local authority is passing this over to Irish Water even though it never ensured there was a bond or deposit in the first place.</p> <p>  Numerous people in these estates have asked me what will happen if it is found that the pipes under the ground have not been laid properly.  The local authority has not made provision, as it ought to have when it granted the planning permission.  Will Irish Water or the local authority pick up the tab?  Who will be directed to sort this out for these people?  There are many people in this situation.</p></speech>

Many local authorities now place composters in parks.  Will the local authorities be exempt under Part 8 planning provisions?  They do a very good job.  I have seen where small bins in parks overflow.  Where those are in use it takes ten times the volume on a weekend.  These are badly needed, especially in urban areas.</p> <p>  On exemption from planning, usually the utilities get a licence for digging up roads or whatever from the local authority.  It is a bugbear that none of the utilities co-ordinates with each other.  One could dig up the road one week and another one do the same the following one.  There should be co-ordination among utilities, including Irish Water.</p></speech>

While I share the views of Deputy Michelle Mulherin, I am not as inclined to blame local authorities, as responsibility rests with the Department, as well as those who did not insist on bonds.  They allowed builders to cash in their bonds or go away without finishing works.  The issue needs to be tackled.  We speak about homelessness and housing, yet there are many unfinished estates across the country.  There are no lights or the lights have gone out and not been replaced.  They are no water services and the roads are in an appalling state.  This is something that needs to be addressed and we need to be more specific about it.  <br/><br/>The other issue I wish to raise concerns the various groups and bodies which are exempt from participating in the planning process.  That is fine, but I want to relate an experience with the ESB.  Its staff come on to a farm to put up a power line and it will do what it likes.  I know farmers who have been put out of business.  On the wettest day of the year, its workers walk in - if they walked in, it would not be too bad, but they bring in heavy machinery - plough up the place, do untold damage to drainage infrastructure and put farmers out of business, not just for that year but a couple of years.  The land is made useless.  What safeguards are built into this legislation to protect people?  If the Minister of State is prepared to give companies <i>carte blanche</i>and free rein to enter people's property, will he outline the protections available to them?</p></speech>

She has raised the issue of legacy estates that are either unfinished or have not been taken in charge.  I can tell her that the Government initiated a scheme called the special resolution fund under which funding was provided for local authorities where they had identified estates that were unfinished or causing a hazard.  The good news is that significant progress has been made on unfinished estates.  I want to be clear and distinguish unfinished estates from estates that are almost finished and which just need to be taken in charge.  Unfinished estates are estates that possibly were left vacant because builders went off site for one reason or another.  The good news is that we have reduced the number of unfinished estates from approximately 3,000 nationwide to just over 600.  We are down to the last few hundred, which will need to be looked at more closely by local authorities to draw up specific resolution plans to provide for their finalisation.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the point made about the taking in charge of estates.  There was some confusion about roles and who was responsible for water services once responsibility transferred to Irish Water.  I inform the Deputy and the committee that my Department issued a detailed circular outlining a new protocol and procedures to be followed by both Irish Water and local authorities in the taking over of essential infrastructure, including water services.  These are having an impact, as there is a clearer understanding and we expect more progress to be made.  However, if the Deputy believes there is a specific local authority that does not understand the protocol, I assure her that we will look at it.  We can also circulate a copy of the protocol to the committee for information purposes in order that it is fully informed.  That should also prove helpful.  </p> <p>  Deputy Noel Coonan referred to-----</p></speech>

I have encountered several cases in which Mayo County Council has not taken an estate in charge.  If CCTV is used and problems are found with water pipes or surface water drains and there is no money available, either by way of a bond or a deposit, who will foot the bill to finalise the estate in order that it can be taken in charge?</p></speech>

Local authorities have a responsibility to pursue the builder or persons responsible for an estate and have a number of measures and powers available to them.  Deputy Noel Coonan mentioned the bonds and legislative powers available to them to pursue the people concerned.  If all of this has taken place and there is still no one to hold to account and there are issues in taking an estate in charge in terms of water services, I can report that the Department and the Minister are examining the possibility of taking a new national initiative similar to the special resolution fund to provide limited funds for the purpose of the taking in charge of estates where there is no alternative or other resolution.  This is being actively considered, but I caution that it would only apply as a last resort and where a local authority had pursued the responsible person or authority fully and, ultimately, there was nothing available to finish the estate.  I wish to make it clear that this is another legacy of the boom-bust cycle and that there have been consequences for people living on such estates.  The taxpayer is being required to clean up the mess.  It is something that is being actively considered.</p></speech>

It has had them since 1926.  Look at it in the round or at the bigger picture, it has had an excellent relationship with landowners and farmers, especially given the amount of development, including significant economic development, we have seen during the years.

I know for a fact that, if there are particular problems, it does engage with customers and landowners.  I know of cases in which land was destroyed and compensation paid, but that is essentially a matter for the ESB and the landowner involved.  On exempted development, there are no specific legislative powers available.</p> <p>  Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to waste compactors.  Local authorities can use their powers under Part 8 if they wish to locate compactors in specific areas.  However, as mentioned in my opening statement, kerb-side collection is preferred by constituents and consumers.  However, the other option is available to local authorities under the Part 8 process.  </p> <p>  On road opening licences, the same obligations apply to Irish Water under the regulations as apply to all other utilities and how local authorities manage them.

People will not know if they should contact the local authority, Irish Water or one of its private contractors.  They are not removed from proper lines of accountability or contact when it comes to issues that arise when works are being carried out on water infrastructure.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett said the measure is impractical.  I presume the case he is making relates to the subcontractors Irish Water uses.  The ESB, for example, undertook a national network renewal programme over the past two decades and used many subcontractors but, ultimately, the ESB was accountable.  In the same way, Irish Water is accountable for any works subcontractors may carry out.  Essentially, what is involved is installing new pipework, fixing burst mains, installing water valves, installing conservation apparatus and whatever is required to enhance or improve the essential water network in this country.  We wish to give the same exemptions to Irish Water as we do to other utilities so that it can access the network to carry out the investment and work that is so badly required.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett said it is impractical.  Does he think a system that allows leakage of 50% of treated water into the ground has worked well?  I, for one, do not agree.  Already, Irish Water, through the investment and work it is carrying out in terms of water conservation and quality and water treatment systems, has made a huge improvement in a very short time.  The facts are on the record.</p> <p>  The regulator has an oversight role of Irish Water and there is an appeals mechanism to the regulator if a complaint has gone through the Irish Water complaints system.  I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that there is nothing cynical behind the measure; it is purely to allow Irish Water to do the work it was established to do, namely, to enhance and improve the water network in this country.</p></speech>

I think the pudding might not taste good but we will see.  We all want clean water so that is a red herring of an argument; it is just that we differ on how to deliver it.</p> <p>  In terms of the priority to deliver new council housing and social housing, one obstacle to that is the servicing of land and the provision of the necessary water infrastructure.  Will that area be further complicated by all of this, because we now have two entities, if one likes, who will have to co-ordinate.  Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment budget might limit its capacity to put in water infrastructure.</p></speech>

The Deputy will agree that it was often the case in the past that we had development where services did not exist and, possibly, where developments should not have taken place.  We will depend on focused and appropriate development plans being adopted by city and county councils which take account of national and strategic decisions in terms of infrastructure.</p> <p>  At present, we are developing a new national planning framework which will inform where much major infrastructure will be provided in terms of capacity and services.  Local and regional development plans should follow that lead because if they deviate from it or are not aligned with the strategy then similar problems will arise to what we had in the past.  Irish Water will have to prioritise where it invests and it will prioritise where demand is highest.  It is a matter of local authorities liaising with regional authorities and all utilities and services, not just water.</p></speech>

Is there a list of what one would call rogue developers?  If a developer does not finish an estate properly the council can take it in charge and put such developers on a blacklist.  I accept we need developers but they must do the work properly.</p></speech>

If such development is not taken up, is there any sanction?</p> <p>  The point made by Senator Keane is something I included in planning legislation that was not opposed, but as happens when a proposal is made from the Opposition benches, there was, unfortunately, no further progress with the Bill.  I fully concur with her point.</p></speech>

However, it has been found to be very difficult to enforce that aspect of the legislation.  Currently, the Department is looking at Committee Stage amendments to the planning and development Bill 2016 to see how we can hold to account people that are not responsible in terms of finishing estates and preventing them from getting sanction for future planning applications.  That is currently being examined and we expect the Bill to go through the Oireachtas in the next few months.  I accept there will possibly be changes in the meantime but the Committee Stage amendments to the Bill are currently being framed.</p> <p>  In reply to Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s comment on developers sitting on zoned lands, is she referring to zoned land that is prioritised for infrastructure and then is not developed?</p></speech>

We did address it to some degree with the introduction of the vacant site levy whereby if land is identified in a local authority where there is a high demand for housing or other economic need then a vacant site levy can apply to the property in order to stimulate activity.</p> <p>  I accept Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s point about zoned lands.  Local authorities have the power to dezone lands if they are not being utilised.  It is a long process but it is a power local authorities have if they have strategic sites that are not being developed.  If developers are not developing sites there is also an opportunity to put a vacant site levy on them.  As the economy improves the number of houses being built is increasing year-on-year.</p><p>That is badly needed and we expect it will continue in the coming year.  As demand rises and the economy recovers we expect to see that improve.  We are considering a "use it or lose it" type of clause in planning legislation whereby a developer who does not use zoned land after a certain period could lose the zoning automatically.  We have to be very cautious about how we frame that, not to impede anybody&rsquo;s property rights but we are very conscious of it.</p></speech>

Part III of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 provides for the provision of indemnities in respect of cultural objects on loan from outside the State subject to certain conditions.  This allows the national cultural institutions to take temporary exhibits from abroad which would otherwise be too expensive from a cost perspective.  The institutions to which this applies are set out in the second schedule of the 1997 Act and are: the Chester Beatty Library, the Crawford Art Gallery, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Hunt Museum in Limerick and the Royal Irish Academy.</p> <p>  This provision enables the national cultural institutions to take loans of temporary exhibits or objects from abroad which would otherwise be too expensive.  It has been used on several occasions by different institutions and it enhances the artistic and cultural landscape of the State by ensuring that institutions can show objects from abroad alongside and contrasting with the valuable cultural objects contained in our institutions.</p> <p>  Section 44(1) provides that the aggregate amount of liability available for indemnification at any time cannot exceed &pound;150 million or &euro;190 million.  Section 44(3) provides that the liability ceiling can be varied by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by way of order.  Where an order under section 43(3) is proposed, the draft of such an order must pursuant to section 44(10) be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</p> <p>  Due to a combination of circumstances over the next number of years, a temporary increase in the threshold from &euro;190 million to &euro;1.5 billion is required.  This is a very positive development as it represents a renewal of our cultural institutions as they engage in a wide-ranging exhibition programme which will captivate and delight those who engage with our institutions.  The temporary increase in the indemnity threshold will allow for a number of institutions to hold a variety of new and major exhibitions.  To take account of these developments I have decided to put in place a temporary increase in the threshold beginning on 1 March 2016 and ending on 31 October 2021.  I have therefore decided to put forward this draft order to come into operation on 1 March 2016.</p> <p>  Regulation 2.1 specifies that the threshold shall be varied by substituting &euro;1.5 billion for the current amount of &euro;190 million.  The order provides that the variation in the threshold shall cease to have effect on 31 October 2021.  The order is co-signed by me and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I commend this draft order to the committee as it will enhance the capacity of our institutions to contribute to a vibrant cultural and artistic landscape in the country. </p></speech>

Not everybody has the money to leave the country.  From a citizen&rsquo;s perspective but also from a tourist&rsquo;s perspective the more vibrant our cultural institutions are, the better.  Surveys by F&aacute;ilte Ireland show that a significant number of people come here for a cultural offering.  Have there been exhibits that we have not been able to accommodate?  What prompted this change?</p> <p>  We have some very good exhibition spaces.  There is a major development due at the National Archives of Ireland for warehousing and retrieval of the archive.  Will the space proposed there be sufficient to display what will probably be small objects?  What does the Minister anticipate the cost of the indemnity will be?</p></speech>

In response to the first question, there have been no exhibits in the past that we have not been able to bring in but there are some arranged that we will bring in.  The cultural institutions asked that we increase the indemnity.  The National Gallery, for example, announced the possibility of obtaining the Leonardo da Vinci drawings from the Royal Collection.  That is one of several requests and we needed to increase the indemnity to accommodate these works of art.  It will be very exciting to be able to enjoy them and see them in our cultural institutions.</p> <p>  Last week I announced the investment of &euro;8 million in the storage facilities at the National Archives.  It will move some of the material from the present storage into the new area and provide for an exhibition space there.  That is the plan and would be a great addition to the National Archives.  The first phase of the project was announced last week.</p> <p>  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer for this indemnity.</p></speech>

D&oacute;chas first brought the European Year for Development 2015 to the attention of the committee when the organisation met here in 2014.  The committee will remember Mr. Hans Zomer who presented then.  Hans has moved on to other things and is now working at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in in the Phoenix Park.</p><p>Members are keen to be updated on developments and on behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the witnesses to this meeting.<br/><br/>Before we proceed, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Mr. Johnny Sheehan to begin.</p></speech>

As the Chairman already has stated, I am accompanied today by Dr. Lorna Gold, who is both head of policy and advocacy in Tr&oacute;caire and a member of the board of D&oacute;chas.  In the context of the European Year for Development 2015, Dr. Gold attended all the key international United Nations summits that took place during the year and can respond to questions on them.  Similarly, I am accompanied by Ms Marissa Ryan, campaigns and advocacy manager in Oxfam Ireland, which was also represented at all the key UN summits that took place during 2015.  As the Chairman noted, a delegation from D&oacute;chas met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in December 2014 to outline its plans for the upcoming European Year for Development 2015, EYD2015, and to ask the joint committee to play a role in shaping the European Union's position on key issues during 2015.  In today's presentation, I wish to update members on the achievements from the EYD2015 and my colleague, Dr. Gold, will highlight key international agreements reached during 2015 regarding sustainable development and climate change that have major policy implications for Ireland and the EU.<br/><br/>The European Year for Development 2015 was an opportunity to celebrate the power of ordinary people to make a real difference locally and globally.  It was rolled out across all EU member states and in Ireland, D&oacute;chas, which is the Irish Association of Non-Governmental Development Organisations, implemented a national plan of action in partnership with a range of actors across the development and environmental sectors, wider civil society in Ireland and with media organisations, local authorities and European institutions.  By the end of 2015, we had increased the number of people who believe they can influence global issues.  We encouraged people to recognise their potential as change makers and we dented the feelings of powerlessness people experience when it comes to global issues.<br/><br/>The European year confirmed that the vast majority of people in Ireland continue to support Ireland's overseas development programme.  Research conducted during the year showed that supporters of overseas aid outnumber critics by a ratio of 3:1 while a special Eurobarometer poll found that seven out of ten Irish people were in favour of increasing overseas aid.  D&oacute;chas members engaged 55,000 citizens directly through activities at 56 events during the year, including at national public-facing events such as Africa Day, the Electric Picnic music festival and the National Ploughing Championships.  As part of a Europe-wide day of action to mark the European year, D&oacute;chas took to the streets to deliver a special print edition of the<i>World&rsquo;s Best News</i>, which is an ongoing media campaign that highlights positive stories of development progress from the developing world.  A team of 95 volunteers handed out 10,000 copies of the <i>World&rsquo;s Best News</i>newspaper to members of the public in 14 towns and cities across Ireland in September.  The EYD2015 also reached hundreds of thousands of people through print, broadcast, online and social media.  For example, <i>The Irish Times</i>newspaper ran a monthly &quot;Inside Out&quot; series in its online edition to highlight positive stories of development around the world but which it also linked to Ireland.<br/><br/>The year was launched in January by President Michael D. Higgins and he continued to provide inspirational leadership throughout the year.  Moreover, the EYD2015 played an important role of the President&rsquo;s ethics initiative, which took place during the year.  Leadership also was shown by the establishment of a network board with representatives from environmental organisations, domestic NGOs, the private sector, local authorities and media organisations.  This contributed both to leadership for the year and directly to the establishment of partnerships with<i>The Irish Times</i>, as I mentioned, and with Dublin City Council, the European Commission and others.  Dublin City Council erected a large banner highlighting EYD2015, and citizen action in particular, on Dame Street for two weeks leading up to the UN summit on the sustainable development goals.  In addition, during the year we engaged in discussions and debates with journalists, advertisers and NGO communication professionals on how development stories are communicated and with regard to the D&oacute;chas code of conduct on images and messages.  Furthermore, we trained and mentored NGOs in storytelling to ensure the work of the year continued on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>At this point, I will hand over to Dr. Gold, who will speak about the sustainable development agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorna Gold" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012700002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Sheehan.  I believe members will agree on what was achieved by D&oacute;chas in 2015.  There was a phenomenal amount of activity involved in engaging and informing citizens on the issues of global development.  This obviously was not an end in itself, as the basic principle behind the activity was that engaged informed citizenship will enable the political and policy change required to achieve and implement the sustainable development goals.  While that job is far from over, we made a positive start in 2015 in achieving this aim.  The promises made at the summit in 2015 must now be translated into action and in particular, there is a strong European Union dimension to so doing.</p> <p>  As already outlined, three major United Nations summits were held during the year, which effectively should now define the parameters for international policy-making for the next 15 years.  I say "should" because obviously, there are other issues that determine and influence policy-making.  However, the three summits held last year, namely, the summit on financing for development held in Addis Ababa in July, the sustainable development goals summit held in New York in September and the COP 21 climate change conference, at which agreement was reached in Paris in December, should set a solid basis for directing us towards sustainable development and addressing in particular the challenge of climate change.  In September, at the United Nations in New York, 193 countries joined forces to agree a pathway towards sustainable development for our world by adopting the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  This framework of 17 sustainable development goals provides measurable social and economic objectives to which all countries are now obliged to adhere.</p><p>The former framework for action is to be implemented universally taking into account the actual realities as starting points for each individual member of the United Nations.  The goals are universal in nature and will not be deemed to have been achieved if not achieved by all countries.  They are interdependent and cross-sectoral and have implications for all aspects of policy-making.  They will respect and take into account existing national policy priorities and plans and are supported by a set of 169 indicators, which represent the monitoring framework.</p><p> In Paris in December a total of 195 countries agreed to the first ever universal legally binding global climate deal.  In July in Addis Ababa the UN financing for development conference took place.  In a strange way, it superseded the other two, but it is an absolutely essential element of the means to achieve the sustainable development goals on climate change.  The conference concluded an international agreement on how the agreements would be financed.  The agreements have significant policy consequences for Ireland's development in several key policy areas such as energy, agriculture, the environment, inequality, women's rights and human rights in general.</p><p> As NGOs working with the most vulnerable, D&oacute;chas members are proud of the role Ireland played.  In particular, during the sustainable development conference Ireland acted as one of the co-facilitators of the UN deal.  At a European level Ireland worked on the co-facilitation of the UN negotiations.  D&oacute;chas members actively contributed to the UN and European level negotiations prior to and during 2015, feeding in specific policy recommendations.  We were also part of the various Government delegations attending the conferences.  A key focus for D&oacute;chas members is to establish and sustain ongoing engagement at European level and with the Government towards implementation of the sustainable development goals, as well as a review of the relevant policies required to align our existing policy priorities with the sustainable development goals.</p><p> At European level some significant changes and reviews need to take place to address the consistency of European policy-making on the sustainable development goals.  I wish to highlight some of them.  In a sense, I have to take us away from a business as usual approach.  One priority in achieving the sustainable development goals must involve a review of the climate and energy 2030 package.  The 40% target, within the European climate and energy package, is in no way ambitious enough to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set in Paris.  The Commissioner has said this issue will not be revisited until a new Commission is in place in 2018.  From our perspective, that is far too late and sets the European Union back by five to ten years in addressing its emissions.</p><p> The second area of policy that comes within the achievement of the sustainable development goals and which needs to be reviewed is the transatlantic trade and investment partnership process.  In fact, I appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation yesterday to specifically address concerns about the TTIP.  Its review, in the light of the policy coherence obligations under the Lisbon treaty, is essential.  </p><p> We know that migration is becoming an increasingly serious issue at European level.  Unless it is taken into account, in particular, with implementation of the Valletta summit recommendations and the controversial EU trust fund for Africa, the sustainable development goals will not be achieved.</p></speech>

There was the summit in Addis Ababa which looked at how development was financed.  In September in New York we saw the biggest problems in respect of poverty being addressed.  In December in Paris the Conference of Parties talks led to a successful agreement.  I imagine we all agree that there has been some progress in the past year, which is positive.  The vision of D&oacute;chas for the year was to be able to change the way people thought about global issues and how we dealt with them.</p> <p>  I have carried out surveys of development aid and learned that people often believe we spend far more money than we actually do.  I carried out some surveys in my constituency of Meath East some time ago in which people were asked how much money Ireland gave in development aid.  They responded by saying approximately 50 cent of every &euro;10 was spent, but in reality less than five cent of every tenner is spent.  There is a real demand for additional information.  A considerable amount of good work is done throughout the country to improve people's knowledge.  In the north east organisations such as Development Perspectives work closely with local people to try to improve their knowledge of how much we give in development aid and how it benefits the developing world.  That is welcome, but we need to see more of these organisational networks.</p></speech>

She was keen to congratulate the D&oacute;chas representatives on their good work and applaud the presentations made.  She will probably meet the members of the deputation later.  I am happy to join her in making those positive comments on the work of D&oacute;chas.</p> <p>  I wish to make reference to the great progress being made on the issue of climate change.  I have been a member of the Council of Europe Committee on Social affairs, Health and Sustainable Development for a number of years.  In fact, I chair the sub-committee on energy.  As such I am mindful of the important progress made in Paris.  The initiative was pioneered by it at a time when, to use a colloquialism, it was neither profitable nor popular to do so.  The issues were being talked about and advanced by it.</p> <p>  It is reasonable to suggest the weather conditions and dreadful suffering endured in specific areas of the country on account of flooding this year are a stark reminder of the reality of uncontrolled carbon emissions and the lack of a deal to tackle climate change.  The deal made is welcome.  Obviously, options such as planting on land of no agricultural value will have to form a major part of our strategy.  Other energy-saving initiatives involving the use of solar panels and other green and alternative energy sources will be important, too.</p> <p>  I have had good experience of the wind energy industry.  In a particular part of my constituency wind turbines were provided, with a great buy-in and acceptance by the local community.  This is in contrast with what happned in many other areas.  The Chairman is my neighbour in County Meath and has family in County Monaghan and as such, is aware that this is the case.  There has been a great buy-in because of the community benefits and because local small farmers receive supplementary income from the use of the turbines.  All of this has been good.  However, there is a wave of publicity about wind energy that is negative.  It relates to the cost involved and the level of carbon emissions in construction, etc.  Will the deputation comment on this?  Will it also comment on sustainable agriculture in Ireland?  I know that bad land, for want of a better term, or agricultural land with less potential must be planted.</p><p>This must be a key factor in a strategy to deal with climate change.  We have good sustainable land and grassland production of cattle.  Is there merit in preserving this, considering the carbon emissions that will arise from the production of food in factories elsewhere?  Overall, the outcome of the conference and the new rules are to be welcomed.  Dr. Gold was right to emphasise this.  Will the witnesses comment in general on what they think of Ireland's role and what we need to do specifically?  Senator Hayden was anxious that I emphasise her welcome to the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012700002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses and I welcome them.  We addressed climate change several weeks ago when witnesses including Professor Sweeney came before the committee.  It was a very interesting meeting.  We had an in-depth presentation on the consequences of gas emissions, the targets we are setting and the obligations on Ireland as a State to comply in the very tricky areas of grassland, cattle and alternatives.  There is no doubt that we are suffering severely from climate change.  The winds are clear proof of this, as are the rainfall and the warmer summers.  Ironically, we have not hit the colder winters yet, but all the telltale signs are there.</p> <p>  We must applaud the French diplomatic corps, which is credited with having done a wonderful job in bringing so many diverse countries and views together, resulting in a positive climate change programme.  The witnesses mentioned concerns about TTIP.  I have been knocking about with foreign affairs and European affairs for the past five years, and I have noticed more association and trade agreements with countries such as Colombia and Peru.  We have just completed an agreement with Central America, which must still be ratified by the D&aacute;il, and there are various agreements with African countries.  We are invariably subjected to lobbying by the NGO sector.  My position is quite clear, given my experience with regard to Colombia and having had a private debate with the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is a huge advocate of these trade agreements and discussed the advantages of these relationships for countries.  European relationships develop, Ireland signs into these programmes and we go forward.  In a nutshell, does D&oacute;chas have a position on these agreements?  Is it negative or positive?  We will leave TTIP aside because it is not complete and there are many more rounds of talks to go before it will reach a conclusion.  I am not asking about TTIP but about the other agreements that Ireland has ratified as part of the European Union.</p> <p>  The witnesses do much fundraising, naturally enough.  Are they conscious of the sensitivities of, for example, the Ethiopians, given some of the slogans used by NGOs in eliciting funds for their organisations?  They project scenes of poverty and the depth of the wells.  We can look at the height of Liberty Hall and the slogans that went with it.  Do diplomats feel this is not the image they want, for example, of Ethiopia?  Do the witnesses have a comment on this?  I congratulate the organisation, which consists of 65 NGOs.  We would be lost without the lobbying and the contributions they make.  We hear many presentations, and they have been like our political advisers on many occasions.  I thank them for this.</p></speech>

They mentioned the level of support from Irish people for increases in aid.  What other information have the witnesses collected on the views of the Irish public?  Were any concerns raised about value for money or where money might be going?  An issue which has been raised with me is the number of charities working, and whether there are too many charities, I will not say doing the same work, but there is a perception that there are different charities for different places.  Do the witnesses have any comment on this?  They may not wish to comment on it.</p> <p>  The issue of climate change has been touched on, as have the hugely important deals on targets struck this year.  Are the witnesses somewhat concerned that sustainable development work in Africa is being overshadowed by the present crisis in Syria and the refugees?  The focus has been on this.  Is it overshadowing the important work being done in other areas?  I am conscious of this because the news cycle all year has been about the boats arriving, the crisis in Calais, the marches of refugees through Europe and various problems in Sweden, Denmark and Germany with regard to the arrival of an influx of migrants.</p> <p>  With regard to climate change, while the agreement is legally binding, are the witnesses confident that it will work when it comes to it, when governments change and we have new presidents and regimes in various countries?  Will there be an ability to deliver the requirements enacted in the climate change deal?</p></speech>

A number of issues come to mind, including the recent flooding, not only here but in numerous locations throughout the world.  These serve to highlight the fact climate change is taking place and we must embrace it, recognise it and do what must be done.  The Paris meeting will have been good if the participating countries which signed up to the agreement put in place the necessary measures to meet its requirements.  This is the crucial issue.  We have the capacity to do it in this country with regard to agriculture and energy if we decide to do so.</p> <p>  I happen to be one of the people who is committed to alternative and renewable energy.  Recently, in my constituency thousands of leaflets poured out calling on people - I think there might have been something similar in an adjoining constituency-----</p></speech>

It is a grand enlightened approach, which is very reassuring in the world in which we live.</p> <p>  The fact of the matter is the targets are attainable if we go about it in the right way without any massive impact of a negative nature on the community.  I believe that in ten or 15 years' time, all of the world's domestic motor cars will be electric.  As soon as electric cars can do a 1,000 km round trip it will be the end of the petrol car, and so it should be, because otherwise we cannot meet our targets.

It could go slightly more than that.  It could go to &euro;8 billion.  It will depend on the degree to which we have failed to meet our targets.  We can do a lot in terms of electricity generation.  We cannot really do a whole lot about heavy road transport yet.  We can minimise it a little but we cannot do a great deal about it because we are talking about 250-horsepower engines, which would require a great deal of electric energy.  The response spoken about would, without a doubt, come into play at that stage.  We need to talk about these things, isolate them and identify the extent to which we can deal with them.</p> <p>  The last point I want to make relates to the agriculture sector.  There is a danger that people may concentrate on agriculture as the bogey man in all of this and decide we must reduce our agricultural production and such like.  That is not necessarily true.  In fact, it is not true at all if we take into account and balance out the degree to which everything that grows absorbs carbon.  Everything that grows absorbs carbon or some other gas of one type or another.  We do that in this country in a particular way that they do not do in other countries.  In comparison to other European countries, it is possible to use the methodology used in Irish agriculture to bring about reductions to beneficial effect.</p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that there is a danger worldwide of replacing food production with biomass.  That would be a dangerous route to go down and a precarious position to take.  There will be those who tell us we should take that route but, if they do not eat, people will not survive very long.  We need to keep that in mind.  Importing biomass from Latin America is not the answer.  This creates negative carbon in all directions such as that associated with long-distance transport.  </p> <p>  I could go on about this indefinitely, the committee knows that but I do not wish to do so other than to ask a few questions.  What would be the witnesses' message to the Irish consumer on achieving the carbon reduction targets over the next number of years?  Given there is a tendency to ignore, postpone and hope certain things will go away, do they think this will go away?  How to they feel developing countries are likely to be affected over the next ten years or so?  Why are they running away?  What are they running away from?  We know the answer, indeed there are a number of answers.  For instance, our response throughout Europe is not what it should be.  I have to say that the appearance of razor wire across Europe is not at all the message the European Union, given the principle of free movement of people, should be giving out.  I am not impressed by some countries and people whose response is to rob refugees.</p></speech>

I think we would all agree he gave us food for thought.  A vote has been called in the House.  In approximately three minutes, some members will have to leave.  We can continue with the meeting, however.  I am sure the members will look at the transcripts after the meeting to see the answers.  Before I call Mr. Sheehan to respond, we will be adjourning today and another meeting is not arranged because the House will probably be dissolved.  On behalf of the committee members, I thank the staff for all their help over the term of this D&aacute;il.  We have enjoyed our experience and they have been wonderful and very supportive at all stages.  I wanted to say that while we were all still here.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy O'Reilly and his colleague for their congratulations and welcome the opportunity to continue that conversation after the meeting.

The committee has already had a full briefing from Professor Sweeney, who is probably the most eminent expert in this field, and I will not pretend to have his level of knowledge in this area.  Deputy O'Reilly commented that the recent flooding is making everyone realise that climate change is here and with us.  The World Economic Forum does an annual assessment of global risk.  Climate change has jumped into the top three of the greatest likelihood of risk in the next year and into the top five highest concerns in terms of global risk next year.  It is right up there now.<br/><br/>The impact of climate change on the countries we work in is already devastating.  This is particularly the case this year given the effect of climate change combining with the abnormal <i>el ni&ntilde;o</i>effect.  It is not possible to separate them out.  We are looking at a combination of once in a century storms as well as droughts that now extend across the entire east coast of Africa from the very north horn all the way down to South Africa.  The intensity of these weather events will play out in the coming year.  <br/><br/>From an EU perspective, it is now time to get down to brass tacks.  The achievement in Paris was significant.  I was there for the summit and it was not necessarily always going to end with a happy story on the last day.  It was very close to the wire, in particular in the final stages of the negotiations.  It is a huge credit to the French and all the leaders who attended that they managed to achieve an ambitious, binding and equitable deal.  The real issue now, however, especially with the EU, comes to the effort sharing agreement, which has been alluded to, and how the effort sharing will be divided up among EU member states.  We must remember that post-2020, no country can increase emissions and they will have to be within the range of zero growth and 40% reductions on 2005 levels.  As this committee knows, we will also be looking at possible fines within the region of hundreds of millions of euro to billions of euro, as agreed in the Council conclusions.  <br/><br/>We believe it untenable for Ireland to continue to argue it is a special case on account of its agricultural production.  This strategy, which was evident in the Taoiseach's comments during the Paris summit, is both damaging in terms of Ireland's international standing as a good EU citizen and incoherent with its other policy objectives, be they its development objectives or sustainable development goals.  We argue that this needs to be urgently rethought and other issues need to be taken into account when Ireland makes its case on the European burden sharing agreement.</p><p> One of the points raised was that focusing on agriculture as the bogeyman is unhelpful.  I wholeheartedly agree with that.  It seems to be exactly what the Government has done in its negotiations at EU level.  The focus is entirely on the agricultural sector and does not take into account that our climate mitigation objectives have to take account of our entire economic output and that measures can be taken in other sectors to reduce our emissions.  </p><p> On Ireland's emissions, I remind the committee we are one of only four member states not currently meeting our 2020 commitments under our EU obligations.  The EPA has projected our emissions will rise by 7% by 2030.  Tr&oacute;caire, like other NGOs, has not been calling for a reduction in agricultural production but has been questioning the planned doubling of the herd size under Food Wise 2025, which will make it virtually impossible to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement.</p><p> When Ban Ki-moon was here last May, he made the point that if a country wants to be a leader on hunger - as Ireland has stated it wants to be in terms of the sustainable development goals which are our real focus - it has to also be a leader on climate change.  Climate change is the single biggest issue driving food insecurity and reducing food yields worldwide.  It is an issue of policy coherence.  </p><p> There was a point made about the images used by NGOs.  D&oacute;chas has a code of conduct on images to which all member NGOs sign up.  A peer review mechanism ensures that we do not project images that are not respectful of human rights and dignity.  Deputy Byrne will be glad to hear that the images that will be used in Tr&oacute;caire's Lenten campaign in the coming weeks will be images of Irish people and will focus on the ways that Irish people engage in solidarity overseas rather than focusing on the image of poverty overseas.  That has been part of a dialogue we have engaged in with representatives of African and other countries over the past number of years.  </p><p> I will hand back to Mr. Sheehan.</p></speech>

He is right that human rights, as a central and fundamental tenet of the EU's foreign policy, has been completely eroded and undermined by the current failure of the EU to manage the current wave of migration.  We, as members of D&oacute;chas, absolutely reject the current discussion that it constitutes a crisis for Europe.  It is a crisis for the 3,500 people who died in the Mediterranean over the course of last year and their families.  It is a crisis for those stuck within EU borders in freezing conditions with no access to basic services.  It is a complete failure of EU member states when the foremost response has been to increase border security and meet people fleeing for their lives with razor wire, as Deputy Durkan mentioned; police brutality in Bulgaria, which we have documented; and the use of police dogs.</p> <p>  In terms of a European response and, specifically, Ireland's role within that, I am sure all members are aware that an EU trust fund for Africa was set up during the Valletta EU summit in 2015.  We have serious concerns about the role of and management of the trust fund, which appears to be very much focused on preventing people migrating from some of the states from which the majority of people are fleeing at the moment.  We have received assurance from Irish Aid that the funds put into the trust fund by the Irish Government will be compliant with Ireland's respect for international human rights.  However, we are also cognisant that many of the projects funded under the trust fund focus on border security and migration management.  We think the Irish Government needs to play more of a role in Europe.  The committee is probably aware of the commentary made yesterday by Peter Sutherland in which he said that the failure to reach a consensus in Europe and the continuing gap in terms of any sort of adequate response to the current wave of migration will only worsen.  We are seeing no decline in numbers despite the fact that winter conditions-----</p></speech>

Ireland is a member of the oversight board of the EU trust fund for Africa and we have our own refugee protection programme.  We need to have a louder and clearer voice in Europe in terms of trying to foment some sort of credible response based on human rights.  We do not see that happening at Irish or European level at the moment.</p></speech>

The Chairman has mentioned the development prospectus, which has been very active in the north east.  Both large and small organisations have been very active in the European year of development.  We are trying to get across the key message that each of us can make a difference.  Last year was pivotal because as a result of the international agreements, we have the opportunity to be the first generation to end poverty worldwide.  We are the last generation that can take effective action on climate change so it is a critical moment.  The Chairman is right when he says there is a demand for additional information.  Communication cannot be confined to 2015; it is critical that it continues.  Through the D&oacute;chas network of organisations, we will continue to communicate and try to change the way people think and talk about global justice and development issues.  Critically, we also need to change how people behave.  That will not be achieved in one year.  We have made a good start but the work needs to continue.</p> <p>  Dr. Gold mentioned the code of conduct on images and messages.  We are very aware of the impact that the images and messages used have on people's attitudes and behaviours.  One of the successes of the year has been in the communication of these messages.  In September, in the lead-up to the UN summit, we had a big campaign to try to get across the message that each of us can make a difference.  There was a very noticeable increase in the number of people coming to our website looking for information and there was a big surge in search terms such as "How can I make a difference?" and "I want to make a difference".  People in Ireland wanted to do something and to take action so it is critical to continue with this communication.   A couple of the Deputies mentioned sustainable agriculture and climate change.  Through its working groups, D&oacute;chas published a paper on climate smart agriculture and we could certainly make copies of that available to the committee.  </p> <p>  We hope the committee will put sustainable development goals and climate change on their agenda when it reconvenes after the general election.</p><p>We would ask that the Oireachtas committee invite the Taoiseach to talk to the committee in regard to how Ireland is going to implement the sustainable development goals, deal with its obligations around action on climate change, and address how that fits in at a European level.  As on the previous occasion we ask the committee to provide a place for Members of the Oireachtas to receive updates on how the European Union is embedding the new global agreements and to act as a focal point to bring the information to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I will ask the secretariat to make sure that those points are included in the legacy document we are leaving for the next committee.

I know that they are particularly interested in issues relating to broadband and mobile coverage.  As the Chairman said in a statement yesterday, high-speed broadband for every home, school and business is necessary to stimulate social development and commercial investment.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues and fellow commissioners, Mr. Kevin O'Brien and Mr. Gerry Fahy.  We aim to inform members of our role in these important matters and answer questions they may have.</p> <p>  There has been significant progress and development in broadband roll-out and increasing mobile coverage in recent years.  However, advanced services are not available everywhere and work remains to be done to extend coverage to areas not currently served.  As committee members are aware, ComReg commissioned and subsequently published a study of broadband speeds based on measurements made by consumers.  The survey examined the experience of end-users and gave useful information on how the speed experienced was affected by factors within the customer's environment.  However, it was not designed to measure the coverage of different broadband networks or to identify black spots.  ComReg collects aggregate data about the market, but it does not collect data for individual counties or regions.  The best, most accurate and up-to-date information on the geographical coverage of broadband networks is contained on the maps available on the website of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  They identify the locations and premises where high-speed broadband is provided by the commercial sector or where commercial provision is planned by the end of 2016.  They also identify the areas where the State plans to intervene to ensure high-speed broadband is provided.</p> <p>  We are happy to answer questions members may have about the matters raised and look forward to the discussion.  We have prepared a presentation on the key developments in the broadband and mobile markets.  I understand it has been circulated to members.  I will begin with a brief overview of ComReg.  Mr. O'Brien will deal with broadband issues, while Mr. Fahy will deal with mobile phone matters.</p> <p>  The role of ComReg and the reason regulators have been established in Ireland and other EU countries is to regulate communications markets and ensure they operate effectively in the interests of end-users and society.  ComReg was founded in 2002 under the Communications Regulation Act and has a number of statutory objectives, including promoting the interests of end-users, facilitating investment and competition and ensuring efficient use of the radio spectrum.</p><p>All of these objectives are very important for the broadband and mobile services that the committee is interested in.</p><p> I shall now talk a little bit about what we do.  The functions that ComReg has are derived from both Irish and EU law, probably rather more from EU law than from national law.  I have listed some of the important functions on the slide.  One thing we do is regulate operators with significant market power.  That means we make sure that competition works effectively and that the operators that have a dominant position in the market, which is mostly Eir, are unable to squeeze out competitors and there is room for people to offer choice.</p><p> ComReg upholds consumer rights.  We make sure that all operators in the market treat consumers fairly, provide accurate bills and so forth.  We also manage the use of the radio spectrum.  In other words, we make sure that the mobile operators and other operators that want to use radio communications are able to do so and that the resource is used in the most efficient way.  We ensure the delivery of the universal service obligations both in telecommunications and post.  For telecommunications that means basic voice services must be available at every fixed location in the State.  We have a number of other functions that are related to specific aspects of the communications markets.  </p><p> A wish to point out a couple of things.  I believe that when one says what one does it is also useful to say what one does not do.  First, we do not tell operators what technologies to use or where to invest.  It is up to them to make those decisions in the light of the market and their regulatory obligations.  Second, we are not a policy maker.  That means we do not spend public money on making sure that socially desirable services are provided.  That is a matter for the Department.  As members of the committee will be aware, the Department has a significant initiative, under the national broadband plan, to do precisely that.  </p><p> The last slide that I shall present before handing over reminds us about some trends in the marketplace.  From the user perspective, the uses that are being made of communications are very different now from what they were three, four or five years ago.  There is a lot more use of video streaming.  Some people may be watching the proceedings of this committee through video streaming, which is a very big use of the Internet and broadband networks.  People use social media a lot not just at home but when they are out and on the go.  People are mostly accessing these services through their mobile phones, smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers.  The access is largely at home or, after that, either through Wifi or through mobile networks.  There is much less phone calls and traditional voice calls being made, particularly on fixed networks, and less text messages.</p><p> I shall discuss the networks side.  Network operators, to support such usage, are putting fibre deeper into the networks.  Where traditional networks were mostly copper, between the   exchange and the customers' premises, we are seeing fibre being used to support the higher speed services.  We are also seeing much better wireless connections, faster connections through 4G and also more connections as mobile operators are being able to and permitted to re-purpose spectrum for other purposes.  Having said that, people use communications in different ways.  Many people have benefitted from such use.  We acknowledge that there is still work to do to make sure that those benefits are spread to everybody in the State.</p><p> I shall hand over to Mr. O'Brien who shall talk about fixed matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012700002#DD00200"><p>Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.  It is good to meet everyone again today.  As my colleague has mentioned, I shall talk about fixed networks.  I shall describe what networks are on the ground and who is building them.  I shall then talk about how those networks are being sold to consumers.  I shall give the committee an overview of what is happening in that regard.</p> <p>  My first slide shows information on household broadband penetration.  It shows the current take-up of household broadband in Ireland.  There is nearly 100% availability of basic broadband in this country.  Satellite, for instance, will cover virtually every house.  High speed broadband is a separate matter that I shall discuss shortly.  The graph on page 5 captures where we are in terms of actual households with broadband.  As members can see from the graph, take-up is improving all of the time.  At the moment Ireland is slightly ahead of the European figure of 80%. </p> <p>  The next slide is fairly busy but I shall use it to explain how networks are being built in Ireland.  The graph shows broadband subscriptions by platform and is colour coded.  I shall start by explaining that navy represents the cable network.  One can see that the cable network in Ireland passes around 800,000 houses.  It is owned by Virgin Media which used to be called UPC until recently.  Cable networks are used more in urban areas but not so much in rural areas, and it is historic in terms of its footprint.  We have seen massive increases in the speeds that Virgin Media is putting on the market.  Its most recent advertising campaign talks about 359 Mb.  Traditionally, this network sold TV but for the past six or seven years it has invested in high speed broadband.  This is entirely separate from the Eircom network.  It is the traditional cable network.  There has been a take-up of the cable network in urban areas.  Of the 800,000 that are passed by this network, more than 300,000 now take broadband from this network.  There are approximately 2.3 million premises in the country so a figure for roll-out can be judged against same.</p> <p>  On the same graph, one can see that the yellow bands turn into light blue and represents the Eircom network which has been recently rebranded Eir.  Traditionally, the Eir network used the copper cables that go into all of the houses.  In the past two to three years, Eircom has aggressively rolled out high speed broadband by installing fibre into these networks from the local exchange out to the cabinet placed at the end of the road or the end of the housing estate.  Putting the fibre into part of the path to the house means that broadband speeds have   increased greatly.  The graph shows the declining volume for yellow which is the more traditional copper-only broadband which has a maximum speed of up to 30 Mb.  The light blue piece depicts the fibre-based higher speed broadband that Eircom has invested in.  </p> <p>  The grey band represents what we have called fixed wireless operators and Imagine is one of the well-known providers.  Over the past ten years these operators have made a huge contribution, particularly in rural Ireland, and before fixed networks arrived, in providing service.  One can see on the graph that there has been a decline in the number of people using the technology as it uses lower speeds.  We have various plans for spectrum releases which may benefit this market.  My colleague, ComReg Commissioner Fahy will talk about those in a while.</p> <p>  The bottom of the graph shows a green band which represents mobile broadband.  Traditionally, this would be the dongle at the back of a laptop taking broadband off the mobile networks for fixed purposes.  This technology has been very substantial and successful in Ireland.  The graph shows a decline in its usage as fixed networks are rolled out further.  </p> <p>  The next slide shows the total fixed broadband subscriptions by speed in Ireland and the red piece represents speeds greater than 30 Mbps which is an important figure.  The European Commission has set a target for the Continent that by 2020 everybody should have 30 Mbps which shows it is seen as a minimum for the future.  With 30 Mbps one can pretty much do everything that the modern household wants to do today.  The graph shows there has been a significant increase in the red piece and represents where we are above that speed in Ireland.  The graph shows how broadband speeds have improved.</p><p>With this graph, I will briefly talk about competition in the marketplace.  The blue piece at the top shows Virgin Media, the cable network, which has invested in its high-speed network, is gaining customers and has increased its market share.  In recent years, we can see the entry of Sky, and we can see the Vodafone market share in red in the middle.  Sky and Vodafone provide fixed broadband into people's houses off the back of the eir network.  This is where ComReg's regulation is central to the story.  By regulating eir in various ways, we allow other operators to use its network, which would not happen otherwise.  This brings competition and choice and affects prices.  In green, we can see eir, formerly Eircom, with a declining market share in broadband as competition increases.</p><p> The next slide captures, for two different speed baskets at a point in time, some prices in the market.  Rather than concentrate on any detail, the slide shows that for different baskets of broadband speed, a large number of operators are offering products at different prices.  Approximately 30 entities are selling broadband in the Irish market.  Some of them are very big players.  This shows the choice the consumer has in price and product.</p><p> My next two slides summarise what I have been talking about.  Through the cable company and investment by eir, there has been significant roll-out of high-speed networks.  The total number of premises in the country is 2.3 million, and eir has passed 1.3 million premises.  According to its quarterly financial reports, published this morning, eir has passed 1.4 million premises and according to its public statements, it will reach 1.9 million premises with high-speed broadband.  Virgin Media covers almost 800,000 premises with its cable network.  The joint venture between Vodafone and the ESB, known as SIRO, is putting fibre onto the electricity networks around the country with a target of 500,000 homes.  Members will be aware of this, given that legislation to allow the establishment of the joint venture was passed by the Oireachtas.</p><p> There are three players in the country - eir, Virgin Media and the SIRO project - with significant ambitions around high-speed broadband fixed networks.  Our coverage for high-speed broadband measures well against the EU average.  Wireless continues to play a very important part, as wireless technologies develop in high speed.  As members are aware, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has set out plans for a State intervention to cover the remaining part of the country that does not have a market-delivered high-speed network.</p><p> The networks are all competing and, due to regulation, many companies compete using the eir network.  The way they are competing is changing.  More and more, they are selling bundles.  Last week, Vodafone launched Vodafone TV.  We now have eir, Vodafone, UPC and Sky all selling TV, broadband and telephony together, and many of them also include mobile services.  The way they try to attract new consumers is changing with these new technologies and new investments on which they are trying to recoup a return.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Fahy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012700002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the opportunity to meet them  I will give an overview of the mobile industry and how consumers perceive the services they get.</p> <p>  Slide No. 12 describes the market shares of the mobile operators in Ireland over the past five years.  At the top of the graph there is a small, but growing, segment of customers who are on virtual operators.  Virtual operators do not have their own networks but sell services on other networks.  In 2014, there was a large merger of Three and O2, which resulted in O2 exiting the market and reduced the number of operators with networks from four to three.  The merger was considered and approved by the European Commission.</p> <p>  At the time of the merger, ComReg expressed considerable concerns about the effect the loss of a network competitor might have on competition.  As part of the merger, Three gave commitments to the Commission that it would facilitate the launch of an additional two virtual operators on its network.  These virtual operators have launched in the past six months, and it is difficult to know whether they will have a significant competitive effect.  The intention is that they will.  At the time of the merger, ComReg expressed concerns that the competitive effect may not be sufficient.  We are waiting to see the degree of competitive effect and whether the competitive intensity returns to where we believe it should be.</p> <p>  One of the proofs of competition is how price evolves in a market.  The next slide shows how, over a number of quarters since 2013, both contract and pre-paid customer average revenue, which is a proxy for price, has changed.  During the period, it has declined by 8% for both contract and pre-paid customers, which is positive.  Over the past two or three quarters, this progress has slowed and reached a plateau.  This is not due to lack of competition but to the fact that people are using more data services than before.  More than 80% of customers have pre-paid phones, which are excellent at providing access to data services.</p> <p>  The next slide dramatically shows how data services have taken off during recent years.  The green line, which rises from the bottom left to the top right, shows that, during the past five years, data services have increased by 500%.  It is a very significant and rapid increase.  The blue line on top shows how voice minutes on the mobile networks have changed in that time.  They have increased slightly, probably because people are switching off their fixed networks and depending on mobile more as their sole means of voice communications.  The dramatic feature is the data service.</p> <p>  In 2012, ComReg instituted a multi-band spectrum auction, which released new spectrum into the market and repurposed the existing spectrum to be allowed to be used for higher-speed data services.  This led to the launch of 4G services in 2013 and the wider proliferation of 3G services.  From then, data growth has taken off significantly and represents the usage that the commissioner, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, talked about in terms of social media, watching videos and doing all sorts of things online with one's smartphone.</p> <p>  The slide shows that spectrum is the lifeblood of the mobile and wireless networks.  We give them capacity and coverage by assigning them spectrum.  The next slide shows how spectrum assignments will develop over the coming period.  On the left, a box represents the amount of spectrum available for the operators, and all 5 million mobile users today are camped on this amount of spectrum and use their services using this spectrum.  With the rapid growth in data, ComReg sees it as essential to release more spectrum into the market.  It is also under significant obligation to the European Commission to do so, given that mobile broadband usage, and broadband usage generally on wireless, is seen as a very high-growth area for society.  The evidence of this is on the previous slide.</p> <p>  This year, we will increase the amount of spectrum available for high-speed, broadband wireless services by 86% by instituting a new auction for spectrum to be assigned into the market.  This spectrum will be suitable for both higher-speed services in cities and, through our regionalised structure, for regional operators who want to offer fixed wireless broadband services in rural areas and offer services that are very competitive with the higher-speed services available on fibre.</p><p>Over the longer term, we hope to add another 52% to that tranche of spectrum which will, again, uplift the capacity and increase the potential coverage opportunities in rural areas.  A significant amount of work is under way in ComReg to add more spectrum to the pool to allow the market operators to choose where to use that spectrum, how to use it to compete against each other and offer better services to consumers.</p><p> ComReg does much research into how consumers perceive the services they receive from the market.  Between 2013 and 2015, we tracked how customers think about mobile phone, home landline services, fixed broadband services and mobile broadband services.  Across the board, between 2013 and 2015, customers expressed increased satisfaction with services with up to 90% in the case of mobile services and 74% in the case of mobile broadband services.  While this is positive, one must bear in mind that 10% of mobile customers are still not satisfied.  What does that represent?  That represents approximately 500,000 people nationwide who may still be less satisfied than they should be or dissatisfied with their service.  That obviously is a concern.</p><p> When we look behind the data and ask what would make somebody move operator, the most pressing issue that makes people most dissatisfied is price.   This outweighs every other issue when it comes to service.  When we examine how a basket of telephony services has fared against the overall consumer price index, consumers of communications services have fared quite well with an 8% price improvement against the overall consumer price index.  That is a good example of how competition, regulatory action, etc., has improved the lot of the customer.</p><p> Price is not the only issue in which the customer is interested.  ComReg, ensuring customers get the best service, has a call centre function through which it tracks customers which raise issues.  From tracking the statistics, we note year-on-year overall contact issues with ComReg have come down 15% from between 2014 and 2015.  This breaks down into various issues.  The major issue raised is around billing and disputed charges, an issue which does not change much year on year.  Contractual issues raised with us have come down 22% year on year and service issues down 15% year on year.  Customers are seeing improved interaction with operators.  ComReg now publishes complaint levels by operator and will be doing so quarterly from now on.  We hope this will cause operators to get even more concerned about the service they offer customers.</p><p> We also take a lot of actions in the market to support the customer getting the best service, ensuring they get proper services and the service they have been promised.  We have undertaken various court actions against operators in this regard.  They have received fines and pleaded guilty to various offences such as charging people for services not delivered.  Over the past several years, we have ensured customers have received rebates of &euro;1.6 million and operators have received fines and court fees of approximately &euro;3 million.  This is a lot of good work in support of the consumer.</p></speech>

Of course, that is no comfort to any individual who lives in a mobile blackspot, who cannot get high-speed broadband coverage where they live or work or who drives though a mobile blackspot regularly on their way to work.  I remember the last time we were before the committee hearing members&rsquo; stories about constituents who had those problems.</p> <p>  I will outline what we can expect to happen over the next several years to make this better.  The most significant initiative has not been taken by ComReg but by the Government through its national broadband plan initiative.  This is an ambitious programme, the aim of which is to ensure everyone not getting high-speed broadband coverage from a commercially rolled-out network will get it as a result of the Government&rsquo;s intervention.  While it is a not a matter for ComReg but for the Department, it will make a big difference to the market that we need to regulate.</p> <p>  We expect continued investment by the commercial sector, both in mobile and broadband networks.  From our regular contact with mobile operators, they have no wish to have blackspots.  They wish to improve their coverage and make significant investments in order to do that.  They have to compete with one another to differentiate themselves in this respect.  We expect that continued aggressive competition to continue, both in the fixed markets and in the mobile market too.  To facilitate this, ComReg will release more spectrum, so that wireless operators can roll out new fixed wireless networks, improve mobile coverage and mobile network capacity.</p> <p>  We will continue to uphold consumer rights, as well as the important, if less glamorous task, of ensuring fair competition rules are optimised and upheld.</p></speech>

I have long stated, along with other members, that we want broadband to come on stream as quickly as possible but it will only happen incrementally until 2020.  However, with mobile phone coverage, we used to have very good coverage but now there are so many extra blackspots.  I do not agree with that statistic on mobile services.  Constituents keep coming to us about this issue.  I have experienced it as everybody else here has.  What role has ComReg in dealing with the issue?</p></speech>

If some people are dissatisfied with price, some will also be dissatisfied with coverage.  It is easily the case that there are thousands of customers in every county who still have coverage issues.</p></speech>

Operators of mobile licences have coverage objectives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.249" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>ComReg monitors those coverage objectives very carefully.  Every six months, we do a 5,500 km drive test to verify whether the coverage is meeting the licence conditions.  Just last month, we published that drive test and have now shown the coverage outcomes per operator.  One can see the variation in the different operator outcomes.  Invariably, we find that the coverage objectives are met.</p></speech>

We recognise our issues.  There are a couple of things happening that may be contributing to that.  I would just like to talk about those.  One of the things that has happened that has changed very rapidly, as we explained in the presentation, is that the uptake of smartphones is a dramatic feature of modern life.  Smartphones are wonderful instruments.  They can do video and the Internet and can take pictures, but they tend to suffer in that they are jack of all trades and master of none.  In some cases, smartphones can be relatively poor as phones.  Although people think they should have the same service, the smartphone antennae are less sensitive.  In some cases, tests in Denmark have shown that they can be up to ten times less sensitive, which is to say they have only 10% of the sensitivity of the old Nokia phone that we all used to rely on.  Even if the coverage has not changed, the ability of the phone to interact with a network may have changed.  That is one factor.  If one is on fringe coverage, that will affect one's ability to benefit from that coverage.</p> <p>  Another thing that is happening is the roll-out of 4G services, the expansion of 3G services and the merger of O2 and Three.  There is a lot of network work going on at the moment.  It is a bit like the Luas roll-out in Dublin, which is very disruptive.  While it is happening it is very disruptive, but at the end of the process things will be much better.  There is a definite impact from rearrangements of the network and activity on the network which will cause disruption.  Hopefully, it will not cause permanent disruption, although that is a possibility if someone is just on the edge of a cell.  However, it can cause temporary disruption which will be alleviated over time as the network roll-out is completed.</p> <p>  The third major factor is planning issues.  The operators all know, as do the members here, where the black spots are and have been for many years.  The ability to address those black spots probably comes down in many cases to getting planning permission or permission from landowners to place masts.  In some cases, it has happened that a landlord has refused the extension of a lease that has run out.  I understand that happened, for example, in Spiddal in the last couple of years and the mast had to be removed.  Coverage definitely suffered in that area.

Am I correct in saying that?  With the greatest respect to the gentlemen, what I have heard for the last hour is the greatest balderdash I have heard at an Oireachtas committee for quite some time.  There is no mobile phone coverage in 45% of the State, whether it is the iPhone, the technology or broadband services.  I doubt one would get a 90% satisfaction rate if one asked people on O'Connell Street, not to mind if one asked people in Cork, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare, Meath, Limerick or any of the other places represented by the members of the committee.  There is a savage crisis out there.</p> <p>  With the greatest of respect, I ask that the meeting be suspended and that the witnesses go back to get the correct information and not the balderdash that has been put before us for the last half an hour.  We do not have mobile phone coverage.  The figure of 5,500 km was mentioned.  I travel between here and north Cork on a weekly basis and can tell the witnesses all the places on that journey that have no mobile phone coverage.  The places that had no mobile phone coverage in 1997 are exactly the same places that have no mobile phone coverage now.  The technology has increased no end.  If ComReg is charged as the consumer authority and watchdog to protect the consumer, may heaven help us.  It is disgraceful what has been put before us.  We should suspend and allow the gentlemen opposite to come back with the facts and to address what was supposed to be the content of this meeting.</p></speech>

The proposal has been made and I want to second it.  I concur with everything that Deputy Moynihan has said.  ComReg has carried out an analysis of the failures in the system.  Can it put together a presentation that sets out the problems it has identified and a path to resolution?  The witnesses talked about the objectives of the various network providers.  Obviously, under their contracts in terms of having bought the spectrum, they have obligations, which it is ComReg's role to police.  Can ComReg set out how it has engaged with the various operators where they have failed to meet their obligations, what sanctions, if any, it has put in place where obligations have not been met, to provide a metric across the level-----</p></speech>

What we find when we do the drive tests is that they significantly exceed their obligations and that there is coverage for over 90% of the population, which is well in excess of their obligations.  The drive tests are based on engineering measurements of signal strength.  There is no evidence from the drive tests that the signal strength has got any worse over recent years.  We acknowledge, absolutely, that notwithstanding what we see on the signal strength measurements, individual consumers and people who travel along these roads sometimes have a worse experience than they previously had.  We ask ourselves why, when the network signal is just as strong as it always was, people have a worse experience.  The main reason we can identify is not that the signal strength has got worse but that people are using phones that are less sensitive.  As Deputy Moynihan does, I also travel to Cork very often and sometimes experience dropped calls on the journey.  The reason is that there will be some black spots along the road.  The drive tests we have just published will enable people to identify for the first time precisely which operators have the best coverage on their journeys.  The drive tests cover every national primary and secondary route, and all of that information is available to help people make decisions.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we have done to police the obligations.  We check them four times a year and we have not found any lack of compliance with the obligations.</p></speech>

I am going to allow members to speak so that they can make their points.  Deputy McEntee is next.  I ask her to speak just on the mobile phone coverage issue.  I ask members to confine their questions to two or three minutes, because I want to let everyone in.</p></speech>

However, while the witnesses refer to road testing on national roads, people do not live on national roads.</p><p>I carried out my own survey last summer and of the first 110 people who responded, 45% of them lived on local roads.  ComReg needs to start testing local and regional roads where people in rural areas live.  Mr. Godfrey said fines worth &euro;3 million were levied where people did not comply.  An average telephone bill in County Meath is &euro;30, which seems small, but if one considers the number of people who live there and that some will have two phones, that means more than &euro;50 million a month is going to service providers or &euro;600 million a year.  Fines totalling &euro;3 million for the entire country are not much for a failure to provide the service.  Will ComReg consider testing the other routes again?  Does the organisation have the finance or the capacity?  It cannot do its job properly if it is only testing regional roads.</p></speech>

There is a huge gulf in our understanding of the level of coverage, because every public representative receives many complaints about the quality of coverage, particularly in rural areas.  Is the drive test informed by data from ComReg's complaints database or is there a set programme?  I become concerned when people use statistics and then say the antennae are less sensitive than they used to be in the old Nokia handsets, because if I were to make that assumption about a product, I would probably stop searching for any other potential cause.  It is not healthy to make assumptions about the sensitivity of the antenna being the source of the problem.  If it is, then it is a problem in every country.  The companies do not insert less sensitive antennae into their products for the Irish market.  I seriously question the assumption that ComReg has made.</p> <p>  Yesterday I received information about the Stiles report, which apparently addressed some of ComReg's operations.  I have not seen the report.  I do not know who commissioned it or what was in it, but the incoming committee probably needs to examine the report and bring the officials back again.</p></speech>

Huge swathes of the country were not tested at all.  Only a tiny fraction of my constituency was assessed because it has only one national primary road and one national secondary road.  Given the demographics of my county, I find it remarkable that the organisation's testing guidelines are in direct conflict with the national spatial strategy and the county development plan.  People are prohibited from constructing houses beside a national primary road or a motorway in County Limerick, and it is almost impossible to construct a house on a national secondary route.  ComReg is, therefore, testing coverage on routes along which people are prohibited from building houses.  The bulk of the road network is regional or local and there is no testing whatsoever, as is the case in huge swathes of other counties in Munster.  Practically all of Deputy Moynihan's constituency is excluded, as is the case in Cork South West.  Only a tiny proportion, therefore, of Cork North West, Cork South West and County Limerick have been examined.  The results are flawed on that basis.</p> <p>  Is advance notice given to operators of these drive tests?  Are they conducted on the same dates every year?  Mr. Godfrey said they were conducted four times a year.  Are they done on a quarterly basis on the same date?  Does he accept that ComReg's testing is out of kilter with where people reside?</p></speech>

It is scandalous to come out of with some of the stuff they have come out with when every one of us has raised this.  This is not just an issue in one part of the country.  Why is it that in some areas of the country people cannot talk on their phones in their houses today, when they could five years ago?</p> <p>  The municipal area I come from has 500 km of road, which is one quarter of the area.  The officials said they had tested 5,000 km.  They should go down back roads and byroads to see what is going in different parts of the country.  When I drive along the N4 past Leixlip, by the time I reach the toll bridge, I cannot hear what anyone is saying to me on the phone.  Why is that not being sorted?  There is no signal past Kinnegad and there is no coverage on back roads.  The officials need to get real about the picture they are trying to paint.  They are not accountable to people who have mobile phone accounts and who are not getting what they are paying for.  A person came to me about this.  He had been talking to service providers who said that once they go outside Dublin, it is not attractive commercially to give the same coverage down the country.  ComReg needs to get up to speed about what is going on.</p></speech>

I suffer increasingly from dropped calls in areas where there was never a problem on both national and secondary roads.  There are black spots that have been there since the introduction of mobile phones and they have not been addressed.  I travel up and down the N4 and I can tell the officials where they are.  They have been there since I first used a mobile phone.  The officials are not doing their  job; it is as simple as that.  Somebody is fooling them.  To come in here and say what they have said is impressive, but they have heard about the reality on the ground.</p></speech>

Our drive tests are there to police those obligations.  In terms of the proportion of the population that lives within the vicinity of national roads where coverage can be verified through driving down the national road nearest them, the drive tests we do are adequate to police that particular obligation and, as a result of those drive tests, we can see that the obligations are significantly exceeded.  That is, of course, not the same as saying that everybody in the State can have coverage, particularly the people who live in more remote areas.  We understand that, and that is an issue that mobile operators seek to address by rolling out their networks further - as Mr. Fahy said, there are logistical issues for them in doing that - but it is their responsibility to provide better coverage in response to the needs of their consumers.</p></speech>

Mobile phone companies say they have 99% population coverage.  Obviously, 99% of the population does not live in 99% of the country.  What is the percentage that ComReg is basing its figures on?

We have evidence that there is a difference in the performance of phones.  We also have evidence that the technology people are using in their homes may also be making it harder for the signal to penetrate.  Some operators offer boosters and other devices for within-home coverage.  Under the spectrum strategy we published recently, we will also consider whether we can do things to extend the use of those boosters.</p></speech>

Mr. Godfrey is clearly telling us that his office is fulfilling its remit.  In that context, he has said that types of phones and so on have changed over the years.  Based on what he has heard today, does he agree that, if his office is fulfilling its remit and change is taking in place in the types of devices being used, there needs to be a change in the office's remit because it is not matching what is happening on the ground?  Will Mr. Godfrey comment on that matter?</p></speech>

It is part of our remit to ensure that operators are given the tools and incentives to do that.  Let me run through some things ComReg can do to improve matters.  Mr. Fahy spoke about spectrum for rural broadband.  I do not want to get too technical but there is also the possibility of releasing more spectrum in a band at 700 MHz.  This band is particularly suitable for providing wider coverage of services in more remote areas.  Managing the spectrum is not something that can be done overnight.  It will take a little time to free up that spectrum from its existing use.  When the spectrum is released, it will give mobile operators a tool for improving coverage.  We will consider the licensing of amplifiers to enable individuals, through their mobile operators, to improve the coverage within their homes.</p> <p>  We uphold consumer rights.  I know coverage is a big issue for Deputies and Senators.  However, it is not the biggest issue that people raise with our complaint line.  If people have complaints-----</p></speech>

Please tell us now or encourage constituents to call our helpline.  If they call, we can raise those issues with the operators.  The operators can then address them.  The final thing we do is to try to ensure competition.  One of the things that drives operators to invest in and improve coverage is competition.  There are a number of things ComReg can do and I absolutely agree with the sentiments expressed by members that we should do whatever we can to improve the experience of individuals who have had a poor one.</p></speech>

What is the reason for the delay?  Mr. Godfrey has outlined what the office can do and what it is looking at doing, but why the hold-up?  There is huge frustration.  Many delegations have appeared before the committee but people are almost screeching across the floor at the witnesses.  I challenge the witnesses, when taking their scenic drive around the country on the national primary and secondary routes, to take seven Members of the Oireachtas - regardless of who is here in a month's time - to plan the route.  They will come back with evidence of 3% satisfaction or 3% penetration and not 90%.  It is very frustrating.  Mr. Godfrey makes the point that smartphones and other devices are the problem but we are talking about mobile phone coverage.  The coverage is to connect to a mobile phone.  That is how I understand it.  The witnesses are now saying the device at the other end is not picking up the service; that the mobile phone is wrong and not the service.  I do not buy it.</p> <p>  If doing a circuit of Ireland rally in a month's time, ComReg should ask the politicians going to the doorsteps over the next four or five weeks about it because they will tell the witnesses exactly what is happening.  There is an outcry about mobile phone coverage.  What the witnesses put in front of us this morning, with the greatest of respect, bears no relation to the reality on the ground.  I am glad to see colleagues from all over the country are rowing in on this matter.  The witnesses have outlined what ComReg can and should do.  Why is it not being done?  Why the delay?  What is the issue?  Why are those things not being done to improve mobile phone coverage?  Look at every local radio station in the country.  I will go back to the point about the complaints.  A community group in Ballinteer in County Cork has contacted the witnesses' office continuously about the broadband service and how operators are charging for a broadband service when there is none.  That group has received very little hearing in respect of its compliant.  ComReg has to see the reality.  What the witnesses are saying is not based on fact.</p></speech>

That a person can now watch a movie on a smartphone in a car travelling down a motorway but may not be able to make a phone call is becoming an issue.  However, if the issue is with the mobile phone provider, there needs to be a health warning with mobile phones that they do not actually do what they are supposed to do.  ComReg needs to do its job in the first instance and identify if that is the case.  Why can ComReg not test on the other roads?  It is a simple question.  What happens if we discover that phones and devices are not doing what they are supposed to do?  Surely ComReg has an obligation to service users to test all the routes.  Why is it not testing them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-27a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012700002#J01600"><p>I wish to mention two matters, one of which follows on from what Deputy McEntee said about the issue of the smartphone not being as capable of engaging with the networks as older technology.  What discussions has ComReg had with the network operators to enhance their broadcasting capacity to make contact with the new devices which, as indicated by the witnesses, are less sensitive?  We have heard that before from the operators.  Is there any debate on improving the communication between the base station and the phone?</p> <p>  The other point is the kernel of it all.  Mobile phone network operators have service obligations with ComReg.  These are set out in the licence agreement.  The witnesses are telling us that ComReg polices and verifies it on an ongoing basis through a drive test.  ComReg seems to believe the drive test shows that in all instances the performance of the coverage is above and beyond what is set out in the service obligations.  That, to me, says one of two things.  First, the obligations are irrelevant or too low.  They certainly do not meet the needs of service users.  Alternatively, the drive test is not an adequate method of checking the level of coverage.  In light of this discussion, it seems that the latter is probably the case.  Has ComReg examined any other method of verifying the obligations set out in the licences other than the drive test?</p><p>I suggest it is no different from polling that is done on consumer behaviour where there is a scientific methodology deployed.  Would ComReg look at it in the context of scientific face-to-face contact with members of the public and conduct its own checking of the coverage and service levels within or around the curtilage of homes rather than merely this continuous drive test in a loop around roads?</p></speech>

I asked whether advance notice of drive tests was given to the operators.  Are they told when these drive tests take place?</p> <p>  In fairness, ComReg's maps are clear.  It is carrying out drive tests on roads where people do not live.  No one lives on the M6, M7, M8, M9 and M1, and no one lives within 300 m either side of the motorway network.  The motorway network now encompasses a significant amount of the road network that ComReg covers.  After that, its drive tests are on national primary roads on which, like national secondary roads, one is prohibited from constructing houses.  It is not only about dropping calls in a car and the meeting should not focus only on those driving around the country.  My concern is that ComReg is carrying out no testing whatsoever on the roads on which, under the National Spatial Strategy and the planning guidelines, people are allowed to construct one-off houses in rural areas and it is not a representative sample.</p> <p>  I have two queries.  As Deputy McEntee asked, why does ComReg not test on roads where people actually live?  Does it give advance notice to companies of a drive test?</p></speech>

According to page 16 of the ComReg presentation, consumer satisfaction with mobile phone coverage, which was 76% in 2013, has increased to 90% in 2015.  That would indicate that everything is rosy here and getting better.  I do not know the source of these data.  Either that is misleading us, wittingly or unwittingly, or we are misleading ComReg, wittingly or unwittingly.  Perhaps what we should do every time there is a complaint is, instead of getting on to the operators, get on to ComReg and that should be used as a database.</p></speech>

How many people did Red C poll, what was the methodology used and what was the question asked about mobile phone satisfaction?  I am sure Mr. Godfrey has that information because he would have commissioned this poll.  It is always about the question asked.</p></speech>

Is it ComReg who sets the guidelines for the suppliers on the level of coverage they should supply?  Who is ComReg answerable to?  Is it answerable to the Minister?  If it is, it needs to consult the Minister and change the guidelines.</p> <p>  ComReg mentioned houses changing.  For the information of the witnesses, I live in a house that did not change for the past 12 years and in a 20-mile radius the mobile phone coverage has gone from very good to zero.  Do not tell us that we are changing our houses.</p> <p>  If hand pieces are responsible, is it ComReg's responsibility to make it clear that a particular hand piece is no good if one wants mobile phone coverage or that it is very good if one wants to get data or whatever?</p></speech>

Mr. Fahy mentioned a phone mast that was not renewed which could have affected coverage in Spiddal.  Are there many such instances throughout the country?

It makes more sense.</p> <p>  A number of questions were asked and I will try to deal with them.  First, I will address the question of our perception here.  There is no question that we understand there are people who are not able to use mobile phones in certain locations and in the way they want to use them.  The members are hearing that from their constituents.  We sometimes hear it from the complainants.</p></speech>

One way this can be improved is through the release of the additional spectrum at 700 MHz.  That spectrum is currently being used for broadcasting.  The broadcasting network could be reconfigured to release that spectrum in order that everybody can continue to watch Saorview, but it  will take time for the policy decision to be made and for the broadcasting network to be reconfigured.  That sort of matter is not an overnight fix.</p></speech>

While we were talking, I put a message on Facebook about what we are doing here and I got two quick responses.  One stated that coverage in Doolin is fairly bad.  The other told me about Whitegate in County Clare, which I know a lot about, stating that Vodafone Ireland says the coverage is classed as fair but the responder has two phones, one of which is the older type and one is a smartphone, neither of which has coverage most of the time.  It is clear that the methodologies ComReg uses to establish whether the coverage is up to a standard is not working.  I need to hear from Mr. Godrey, or perhaps he can come back to us, that he is prepared to look at the methodologies ComReg is putting in place to check these service obligations.</p></speech>

They know that they happen twice a year but not when or where.</p> <p>  Members have made the point very well that users of mobile services expect to be able to use the voice or data service where and when they want to use it.  They want to be sure that if they used to use it in a certain way, they will be able to continue to use it in that way.  There are several reasons these expectations are not always met.  We have discussed several initiatives the industry and ComReg could take to improve matters.  Members have also made a raft of other suggestions to improve the position on which we need to reflect.</p><p>It is already part of our consultation on spectrum strategy, which is currently open, to ask for input on what can be done to address these issues of customer experience and the mismatch between the customer experience and the expectations of customers.  We would like to reflect on what the committee has said and the feedback the Deputies have had from their constituents.  We would be very happy to come back and respond, having reflected on that, to the committee or to its successor in a few months' time.</p></speech>

Obviously, the witnesses can give some answers today but it is important that whatever committee is in place in a month's time would get answers on their reflections on the actions taken.  If the remit ComReg has at present is not matching the demands, then something needs to change.  That is a reasonable assertion.</p></speech>

On the drive-testing, if it says one has to have a higher percentage, is it the case that ComReg will just travel more national roads or is it willing to re-examine the system?  At present, it is not fit for purpose.  Is ComReg willing to examine the position and suggest to the powers that be that it will change the methods employed?</p></speech>

We will have a look at whether one of the things we could do is to extend drive tests.  Many of the points that have been made have been about indoor, not just outdoor, coverage.  We will need to reflect on the best way to measure that and provide meaningful information for us, for the committee and for users.  We would not rule out having more drive tests on other roads for that purpose.  However, it is something we need to reflect on to make sure we design that in a way that is meaningful, produces valid results people can rely on, and is also cost-effective.</p></speech>

The particular issue around 700 MHz will take that time but obviously we need to reflect on what can be done in the shorter term.</p> <p>  In terms of the question about who funds ComReg, it is funded through a combination of levies and fees for the use of spectrum.  Those are paid by the industry and there is a legal obligation on it to pay them.</p></speech>

We are required by law to operate independently.  We have core values of independence, we follow the law and the operators have no choice but to pay the fees.  It gives them no influence whatsoever on what we do and the Deputy will see that we regulate without fear or favour.  We have no problem prosecuting the people who pay those levies if they have broken the law, we have no difficulty imposing or taking regulatory action against them and we are not in the slightest bit compromised by the method of funding.</p></speech>

They are issues on which to reflect.  Regarding the Red C poll, what question was asked and is there any breakdown on the level of dissatisfaction?  Did that relate to the coverage or was it costs?  Is there any further breakdown that could be given on that?</p> <p>  Second, regarding masts, we are all aware that a number of years ago there were many objections to masts.  How widespread is the non-renewable usage of masts?  On what basis was their use not renewed?  If that is an issue, the public needs to know about it.  If the issue is that there are many areas where their use is not being renewed, the solution probably lies with the communities involved.</p></speech>

ComReg published a survey last year in respect of broadband speeds and it was acknowledged that an expectation is created because companies talk about their highest speeds and what they can provide if everything is perfect.  Obviously, the latter is not the case.  It was stated that ComReg's view is that consumers should have the information before they sign up and that it was considering the next steps and options available, so that people would know before they sign up that they will not get what they think they will.  Where stands ComReg in respect of that matter?  How far has it taken that and should we expect to see something of that nature coming down the line soon enough?  Will the witnesses indicate what they perceive will be ComReg's role in respect of the national broadband plan in the future?  I think this committee, if it is in the same form after the election, would have to take an active role in monitoring the plan and ensuring that there is accountability in the context of the timeframe relating to the plan and its roll-out.  It would also have a role to play in ensuring that the commercial investors are held accountable for their plans.  We will all have roles in that regard but what will be ComReg's?</p></speech>

The national broadband plan is a Government initiative, so it is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that makes all the decisions.  We engage with the Department and share expertise and experience that the Department might find helpful in coming up with the plan.  However, it is really the latter's responsibility to put a plan in place and to make all the decisions about its extent and how it should be shaped.</p></speech>

Regardless of whether the State has responsibility, it should apply to everybody.  We do not want to put people who are under the State in one category because if that fails, where do they go?</p></speech>

Once the national broadband plan intervention has happened and operators are providing service, those operators will be regulated by us, just like any other operator.  Any consumer protection rules that apply to operators, wherever they are in the State, will be enforced by us.</p></speech>

However, it transpires that, thankfully, the European Commission has also been concerned about this.</p><p>In the recent network neutrality regulation, which was produced in November, a section was added at the last minute which requires operators that provide internet services to have a clear and comprehensible explanation of the normal minimum and maximum download and upload speeds and to advertise these.  Therefore, the obligation has been placed at the European level, which we can now deploy at the national level.  It requires enforcement regulations to be enacted at the national level, but there is also some work to be done among the European regulators at the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, BEREC, to agree a standard way of interpreting and measuring performance under that particular clause and the types of remedy and actions of enforcement to be taken-----</p></speech>

We expect the enforcement regulations in the next quarter from the Department, and the BEREC work will take place between now and the third quarter of this year.  It will therefore not have immediate effect, because we will not be able to deploy it immediately, but it will happen much more swiftly than our capabilities would have allowed if we were to implement it ourselves.  I think it is a very positive development and will mean that we can accelerate the process whereby people will be able to expect and rely on commitments given by their operators on the speed and the performance of broadband services.</p></speech>

I have witnessed numerous examples in different households in which the broadband connection was a certain speed, the family knew that that was the speed that they were going to get and they were not expecting a higher speed, and it was then reduced.  I heard from somebody who would know what they were doing when it comes to technology that the speed was actually turned down intentionally.  Whatever about not getting the top speed, if a person is happy with the average speed but it is suddenly reduced, how is that monitored?</p></speech>

Now that that obligation exists, those measurement processes can be developed and a monitoring process can be rolled out.  That will all be part of what we hope to be involved in with our European colleagues and will ensure that consumers can see which operators are quoting which speeds, make an informed choice on that and, having bought that particular product, be able then to rely upon the measurement process to see that they are still getting what they paid for.</p></speech>

Are broadband speeds in the west of Ireland as a region lower than in the east, in Dublin and so on?  Reference was made to the number of houses getting better broadband; the number mentioned was 2.3 million, which I believe includes businesses.  How many of these are in Dublin and the east coast, and what is ComReg proposing to do about towns outside Dublin and rural parts of Ireland?  Some of the operators - Eir, Vodafone, etc. - have not yet reached the targets that they set out.  What does ComReg propose to do with them to make sure that smaller towns, in order to survive, will have proper broadband coverage, and can the witnesses make a statement here and now on the matter?  I believe that there must be a specified speed of broadband per house in the EU by 2020.  What speed rates will ComReg guarantee for every house in Ireland within five years?</p></speech>

There is also an amber area, which is the rest of the country, and I think the Deputy will see if he looks at the maps that Dublin is all blue and most of the west of Ireland is amber.  What is to be done about this?  That is precisely the focus of the Government's national broadband plan.  I am not the decision maker on that, but the Government has said that it is its intention to intervene to deliver a network that is capable of speeds of at least 30 Mbps throughout that amber area, and in fact it is already in the procurement process to choose the contractor or contractors that will deliver this.  The detailed questions the Deputy raises about the timing and guarantees are matters for the Government, but our understanding of it is that the minimum speed requirement in that procurement is 30 Mbps.</p></speech>

However, what he is basically saying to me is that it is the hurler in the ditch - that whatever the Government does, it does; that ComReg cannot guarantee, or will not force or oversee, the suppliers or the Government in providing coverage to all houses in Ireland within five years.  Mr. Godfrey cannot guarantee that.</p></speech>

The Government is saying that that plan will deliver a speed of 30 Mbps to all the places in Ireland which are not covered by the commercial sector on the basis of commercial investment.  As we said to Deputy McEntee, once that plan is deployed, if operators using that network were then to make a promise to consumers that they will get speeds of at least 30 Mbps, it would be up to us, through the operation of consumer law and the provisions referred to by Mr. Fahy, to take action if those promises are not delivered under the general regulatory regime, just as we would in any other part of Ireland if a promise was not being delivered.</p></speech>

It turned out to be quite difficult to get enough people to collaborate in downloading software onto their PCs and leaving them turned on for long enough for the test to run, so it turned out to be somewhat difficult on a practical level to get sufficient information.  However, now that we have this new regulation from the European Commission, and part of that is the obligation on the regulator to enforce it, we have a joint responsibility at a European level to come up with viable and practical methods to test for this particular performance.</p></speech>

There are two ways of measuring broadband speeds.  One is to get consumers to download some software, while the other is to provide a piece of dedicated hardware in the consumer's house.  We ran the pilot test based on the downloading of software.  It enabled us to understand its limitations and benefits.  The report we published was clearly intended to set out the limitations.  We have no interest in making people look good if they are not.  We may be a little ahead of the game within the discussion in Europe about what is the best and most accurate way of measuring broadband speeds for the net neutrality regulation.  We are completely at one with the Deputy that it is important before consumers sign up, that they be told what they can expect.  It is important that there be a verifiable way of measuring whether it is actually happening.  We are working with our colleagues in Europe to put it in place.  One of the pieces we can give will be our experience of the broadband speeds test.</p></speech>
