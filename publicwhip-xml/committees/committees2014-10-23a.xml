Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  Last week, the Comptroller and Auditor General was asked to provide a note on the number of audits that have been completed within the six-month timeframe recommended in the code of practice for State bodies, and within a 12-month period.  We will start the meeting by asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide us with an update on that.</p></speech>

It does not specifically address all the things we have there, but I can certainly expand it and provide the additional information next week.</p></speech>

He raised that matter last week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B00900"><p>I will make a quick comment on that.  It is a relatively unusual event for a body to publish unaudited accounts.  I only know of a handful of cases where it has happened.  In the code of governance there is an expectation that unaudited financial statements, with all the notes and so on, are submitted to the relevant Department within two months of the end of the financial year.  Therefore, unaudited accounts are being used at an official level, but it is quite unusual for them to be published.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01000"><p>The accounts were late anyway.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01200"><p>Maybe that is the reason but it is a strange thing to place unaudited accounts in the public arena, is it not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01300"><p>It is.  One would normally expect that there would not be much change between the unaudited financial statements which would be presented to us for audit and the finished product.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01400"><p>But there might be.</p></speech>

That is one of the things that holds up the completion of the audit, but there can be changes.  It is important that, if that occurs, it is very clear what is the final audited version.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01600"><p>When is this going to be resolved?  When will the final audited version come through?  This is the LRC, is it not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01700"><p>Yes, the LRC.  My understanding is that we have the signed accounts from the body after any audit changes have been put through.  I do not know if there were any significant changes from those that were published.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01800"><p>Mr. McCarthy does not think there is any particular reason in this case?  Does he think they just threw them in because they were late with the other ones?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B01900"><p>No.  If one looks at the legislation around annual financial statements and annual reports, in general a distinction is made between the preparation and the presentation of the two.  There is a provision for them not to move in locked step.  Sometimes one will see in the certificates that we issue a reference to where an annual report is being published together with the financial statements.  We have an obligation to consider the content of the annual report to establish that there is no inconsistency between what is in the report and what is in the financial statements.  Most organisations will publish their financial statements separately from their annual report which generally focuses on performance and what the organisation is doing rather than on the financials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02000"><p>That is fine.  I think we have bigger fish to fry next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02100"><p>Would the fishery harbours be unique due to the fact that they did not keep proper accounts?  That came across last week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02200"><p>Yes, it is quite unusual.  One of the things we have to be satisfied about in preparing and presenting an audit report is whether they kept proper books of accounts.  Occasionally we will reference it.  There would be situations where there may be a lot of manual aspects of the books of accounts.  In such situations we may find ourselves having to do more work to try to be satisfied as to the correctness of the financial statements.  However, there is an expectation that proper books of accounts are kept and we do address it in every audit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02300"><p>In terms of the audit committee itself in a lot of these places, does Mr. McCarthy get copies of the internal audits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02400"><p>Yes, that would be one of the things done as part of the audit planning.  We would look at internal audit reports that have been published to see if there are any issues that may have an implication for the financial statements particularly.  We would also look at internal audit reports to see that a proper regime is in place for carrying out internal audits so that, first of all, the findings of the internal audit are sound and, second, that they are acted upon.  Those are the things we would examine in relation to internal audits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02500"><p>Just to conclude on this point, I thought what happened last week was extraordinary because so many items within an audit were ignored.  I am not talking about Mr. McCarthy's audit, but their audit in fisheries.  Leases were not being put in place and money was not being collected - the basic management of all the harbours.  Last week, I asked them to give us a copy of their internal audits because they said they had them.  Would those internal audits have shown up the issues we discussed last week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02600"><p>The normal expectation would be that an internal audit would look at the risks particular to the business, and they would design their work to test the key risks.  For instance, if the collection of fees from trawlers is one of the key potential income areas, an internal audit should on a cyclical basis - one would not necessarily expect them to do it every year - give it a thorough examination.  Similarly, if rents are a key aspect of the activity of the organisation, there would be an examination of the assets and of the rent generation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02700"><p>They did not just fail in one year.  They failed in a number of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02800"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B02900"><p>By way of observation, there was something slightly curious about the fact that from 2007 on, the accounts for the harbours were qualified whereas in 2006 they were unqualified.  I was wondering how we went from a situation where they were unqualified to being qualified the following year.  At that stage, both were under the Department of Communications and Natural Resources.  It is just an observation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B03000"><p>We were carrying out the audit of the 2007 financial statements, that was after the transition had occurred between one Department and the other.  It was in the process of handover that the thing fell apart.  There were obviously ongoing issues that had not been picked up in previous years, like a property sale going back to 1993 which would be very difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B03100"><p>That is new information.  We did not have that at the time they were here.  Mr. McCarthy is saying that his audit qualification was based on the fact that it went from the Department of Communications and Natural Resources to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Yet we were told on the day by the latter Department's officials that, in essence, the same people were on the ground, were they not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300003#B03200"><p>There was a transition arrangement put in place.  I think the official handover was in October 2007, but the practical handover was in April 2008.</p></speech>

What happened in 2007 is that when responsibility transferred, there was a fall down in the billing of landing charges.</p></speech>

In future, when the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing an annual report, it is important that audits that are ongoing would be highlighted so we can be made aware of audits that are ongoing for six years.  If that happened in the private sector, companies would be struck off and gone.</p></speech>

I have been contemplating what is the best format to present that report, and the best timing.  One option would be to put an additional report into the September annual report.  The difficulty with that might be that the information might not be as complete as the committee would wish.  It might be better to do a special report in January or February.</p></speech>

No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 15 October 2014, from Mr. John Treacy, Irish Sports Council.  It is a follow up to our meeting on 2 October 2014, to be noted and published.  I ask the Clerk to the Committee to check on the correspondence that has been received from Dr. Thomas Reid.  We asked that all of the issues he addressed in his correspondence would be answered by the Irish Sports Council.  I am not sure if this letter deals with all of those issues, but we will check it.  Second, Dr. Reid suggests that the council meet with him to discuss the issues.  We should have a response from that meeting, if it happens.  We might write and ask them to keep the committee up to date on the matters that have been raised.  We can return to this correspondence again at our next meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p></speech>

I asked a question about Team Ireland Golf Trust and he responded by saying that nobody who applied for it did not get it.  However, my point was that the amounts of money involved were tiny and the cost of pursuing that career is enormous.  I have been surprised at the reaction to the exchange, because so many people were also of that opinion.  Perhaps the committee could ask the Irish Sports Council to examine how much other countries give to similar young professionals starting their career.  It is a reasonable issue.  The success Ireland has achieved in this area has been amazing and the amounts of money being disbursed to these young professionals are very small.  We should at least try to compare it with the situation in other countries, particularly in Europe.</p></speech>

Considering the other mechanisms they have for accessing funding, sponsorship and so forth, I asked that it review that and also include a criterion that would be based on need, which it does not have in its existing criteria.  The council agreed to do that.  Could we ask the council to send us a copy of the new criteria, including the criterion it agreed to include henceforth, for its determination as to how certain bodies, such as boxing and so forth, are to be included in the grant allocation?</p></speech>

This relates to the special investigation unit and the fact that this person is now anxious to come forward and speak to the committee regarding the costs and so forth.  It is an issue I raised last week.  Perhaps we could list the names of individuals who have asked to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to raise certain issues, and we can decide on it later when we see the extent of their interest.  It is something the committee would be interested in because it is taxpayers' money and it is very hard to get a handle on how much was spent in respect of these matters, particularly when the court cases were stood down or the charges were dropped.  A considerable amount of money had been spent in one case over ten years.  We will gather the information, bring it to the next meeting of the committee and perhaps decide on a date for a hearing with these individuals.</p><p>  No. 3C is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.

It is a complex arrangement on pension funding for universities.  In effect, the Higher Education Authority controls the disposal of these funds, although they are held not by the authority, but by the individual universities.  It is a technical issue, which will probably wash out in due course.</p><p>  I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that we published a special report this week on the effectiveness of audit committees in State bodies.  The report was presented to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday.  Also, just this morning, a special report was presented on the development of the greyhound stadium at Limerick.

Last night, members received from the Clerk to the Committee a copy of a letter sent to him by Ms Ramona Quinn, the parliamentary legal adviser, in which she refers to an earlier conversation regarding the proposed examination of Irish Water officials by the committee and notes that is envisaged that officials of Irish Water will be invited to attend a public meeting wherein managers will be examined.  The letter then states that this is absolutely unlawful.  Why has this issue arisen?  I was not aware that representatives of Irish Water were due to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

Representatives of Irish Water appeared before the committee some time ago.  I believe the letter also refers to the Poolbeg incinerator project.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy and other Deputies had asked whether the committee could investigate the money spent on the project and sought a report on the issue.  We received a report from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on its audit of the project and it was proposed to return to the issue.  While the committee discussed Irish Water in the context of the Poolbeg incinerator project, nothing materialised from these discussions until officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government appeared before us.  I did not see the letter to which Deputy Ross refers until this morning.</p></speech>

The issue is not on our work programme and has not been raised here, although it was mentioned repeatedly in meetings with departmental officials.  Representatives of Irish Water appeared before the committee and members of the committee expressed an interest in the role of the Department, Dublin City Council and Irish Water in the Poolbeg incinerator project.  The issue continues to be of public interest and members have expressed an interest in examining it.  We have a report on expenditure on the project.  I do not know the reason a legal opinion has issued because, as I stated, the matter is not on our work programme.</p></speech>

My understanding is that some media comment was made yesterday suggesting that representatives of Irish Water were to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and members would also discuss the issue of Poolbeg.  I saw some media comment to that effect.  The issue is not on our work programme, however.  In fact, we were working on a proposal with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, arising from a letter received by the committee in September from the Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, in which he stated he saw considerable merit in having the start-up costs of Irish Water and the Poolbeg project come within the remit of the committee.  The Poolbeg project will be a major project and it is not dissimilar to the issue the committee will shortly examine.  I wrote to the Department on the matter to ascertain how this could be done.  As to the legal advice, I received it yesterday evening and was told to forward it to members.  I believe it arose from media comments.</p></speech>

Representatives of Irish Water should come before the committee and someone should answer questions on the Poolbeg incinerator project.  These are two major issues on which there has been considerable public comment.  I stated in public my belief that representatives of Irish Water should appear before the committee.  I based that on the suggestion by the Secretary General, Mr. Watt, that the committee have a role in these matters.  Mr. Watt stated he was prepared to examine, with the committee, the possibility of examining the start-up costs of Irish Water and the costs the State has incurred to date from the Poolbeg incinerator project.  That is the extent of the commentary, if one likes.</p><p>  I take exception to the fact that, arising from the comment I made and possibly other comments made by members, this legal advice dropped out of the sky last night or this morning.  I was not asked about it and I do not know about it.  I am simply reacting to conversations we had with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the interest expressed by members.  Legal advice should be given after it has been sought, not on the basis of information that appears in the press or comments made by someone else.  The legal advisers will be very busy if they propose to adopt an approach of responding to every comment that is made.  Frankly, I find it ridiculous and a waste of money. </p></speech>

We are getting to a point of absolute absurdity here.</p></speech>

This is a reasonable issue that needs to be dealt with now.</p></speech>

I am curious to know who requested the legal services to send the letter.  The Chairman has indicated, as has the clerk, that the opinion was not sought by either of them.  It stretches belief that this happened on the basis of a comment.  With all the commentary on Irish Water, meters, who can pay and who cannot pay, the Committee of Public Accounts has not been a big part of that media commentary.  I would like to know who precisely asked the legal services to send that letter?  I find it hard to believe that off their own bat, because they are extremely busy and we know they are under-resourced, they took the initiative themselves.  We need to know who asked them to send that piece of unsolicited advice and why.</p><p>  I share Deputy Ross&rsquo;s concerns and I have said it before that I have a sense - nothing more than a sense and I cannot prove it - that there has been an attempt to trim the sails of this committee.  I do not think that is in anybody&rsquo;s interests.  I want to be proved wrong in that sense.  The best way to do that is to get to the bottom of who instructed - not who wrote the advice - that the advice be written and sent to the clerk and an instruction given for all of us to be circulated with it.  Can you tell us, Chairman, when we might get answers to those questions?</p></speech>

I was surprised and disappointed to get that letter.  Second, while not speaking for the clerk, I am aware that he did not instigate this either.  Therefore, I can only presume that there is another active section of the Oireachtas which is anxious that we would not do our work the way we have been doing it.  I agree entirely with you, Deputy McDonald, and I would like to be proved wrong.  There is an effort, however, being made to stall the work of this committee.  That does not make for good governance in the State.  It does not send out the right signals to people who come before us.  We have gained considerably from people who have come before us wanting to explain their story.  After this meeting, as I have said, I will discuss this letter with the clerk and take it up immediately with whoever is responsible.  I intend to defend the right of this committee to its independence in terms of how it is viewed in the D&aacute;il and, indeed, in the public.</p><p>  In his letter Mr. Watt stated: "I would agree that the Committee of Public Accounts should have a role in examining these issues [this is relative to Irish Water] in this phase of the company&rsquo;s development until it begins to operate on a fully commercial basis".  I believe that is entirely reasonable.  I think the members have acted correctly and wisely in relation to their work programme.  I find that this letter going out is somewhat offensive and that some other entity in the Oireachtas would decide with greater authority that it had the power to do this.</p></speech>

It is quite clear in its assertion in that the author states, &ldquo;I note that it is envisaged that officials of Irish Water are to be invited to attend the public meeting [of the Committee of Public Accounts]&rdquo;.  That is a very clear statement.  I would propose that the way to resolve that is that the author of the letter - the legal adviser - would be invited to our next committee meeting and that this matter and the other issues raised around the arrival of this particular letter could be clarified for once and for all.</p></speech>

To make a long story short, the subcontractor is caught between the prime contractor and UCC.  They are in a situation where they are owed well over &euro;100,000.  UCC has said it will not pay the money in that it is bound by the contract it had with the prime contractor.  The reason I am raising it here is that it really does bring up an issue.  We have updated prompt payment legislation in the Oireachtas over the past three or four years.  I am not sure if it is operating or functioning yet but there has been legislation dealing with subcontractors being paid by the State within a certain period of time.  It runs contrary to that.  The replies UCC has given this subcontractor are, in my opinion, unsatisfactory.  It might be something we could take a look at and send to the Department of Education and Skills to ask its opinion.  The danger is that the prime contractor will go out of business and this subcontractor will never be paid.  That is the issue.</p></speech>

The reason I am bringing it up is the underpinning of the prompt payment legislation which has been updated in the last few years as well as the legislation dealing with subcontractors being paid by the State.  Is there a precedent for subcontractors to be paid directly by an organisation like UCC?  Is there some kind of nexus for this company which will be in serious financial trouble if it is not paid?</p></speech>

My queries relate to the area of Irish Water.  The Commission for Energy Regulation falls directly under the remit of this committee.  I do not know how my colleagues feel but I ask that an immediate invitation is extended to the CER to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>  The type of questions that need to be considered are as follows.  The type of financial appraisal or various works it has done in terms of the various options that can be put in place, in terms of charging the public, in terms of a flat rate, time periods and what work it has done.  It is critical that the CER is brought before this committee as quickly as possible.  With the indulgence of my colleagues, I ask that an immediate request is extended to CER to appear before this committee. </p></speech>

An issue has been rumbling along in the background for a long time which has surfaced again in the past 24 hours.  I refer to Positive Action, a group funded by the HSE, which has come to the public's attention in a very obvious way for the use of public money in a way which has been found to be utterly unacceptable to an internal audit report commissioned by the HSE.  These are very serious money and Government issues.  Everybody is probably aware of them so I will not go through them.  I would have thought we could invite Positive Action to come in and explain to us what happened to at least &euro;2.3 million which it got from the HSE.</p></speech>

The matter has given rise to public comment.</p><p>  On the issue of Positive Action, I am sure it no longer exists.  I would like us to be conscious that it was an advocacy and service group that represented people who were poisoned by the State and suffered as a result of direct negligence by the State.  That is not to say that we do not get to the bottom of this issue - it is absolutely legitimate.  In terms of how we approach this issue, we need to be very clear that whatever happened with that pot of money and whatever flaws need to be identified.  That should be done in a spirit of recognising that Positive Action existed, in the first instance, because women were damaged and had their rights violated by the State.  I say that for the record because we need to keep it in mind as we proceed.    </p></speech>

We contacted the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in regard to the issue about the sale of the house to U2 and it will come back to us on that matter.</p><p>  The DDDA has a final set of accounts that have not been completed yet for 2014, I think.  I am not sure whether it is 2013 or 2014 but the audit has not been completed yet.  We will get the authority in because it will give us a great summary as to wherein lies all the assets or whatever has to be handed over.  The DDDA will be part of our work programme before it is wound up, yes.  There is not a current account that we can examine, for the docklands authority.  I shall talk to the Deputy about it afterwards.  Yes, we have.  It did indicate that a final, or an almost final account, was being prepared which will be audited.  We will be able to bring it in once that is done.</p></speech>

Both bodies come under the remit of the committee and have been in here recently.</p><p>  An abrupt announcement was made a couple of days ago that the amalgamation or merger of the two organisations was ending.  A joint application was being worked on by those two bodies with a mind to ultimately putting together a successful application for a technological university in the south east.  Similar applications by a number of different educational institutions in Dublin are ongoing.  </p><p>  I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is my understanding that when it comes to a restructuring like this one, which has gone on for many years, there is a significant cost for restructuring.  Those on the boards of these two organisations have a responsibility to account for the money that has been spent on the process of restructuring which I believe could be reasonably significant.  They need to answer for that.  The suspension of this amalgamation or merger, as abruptly as it has occurred, needs to be questioned because of the cost that has been incurred by the State over the past few years.</p><p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General the following.  Is it the case that a significant amount of money accrues when it comes to this kind of restructuring?  Does the Committee of Public Accounts have a remit to ask both of these organisations to come in here to explain the amounts of money that have been expended and find out why they decided to abruptly end the merger or amalgamation?</p></speech>

That is not just a question for Waterford and Carlow because there are other organisational restructurings in the offing.</p><p>  My recommendation to any institute of technology would be to disclose exceptional expenses of that nature in the financial statement.  It is the Higher Education Authority that dictates the format of accounts and the type of analysis that is done of expenditure.  If there was expenditure incurred, it is presented in the financial statements.</p> <p>Therefore, for anything that is an expenditure item, one would certainly be entitled to ask and to try to go behind if the-----</p></speech>

Normally, one would expect a restructuring to be on a slightly shorter timescale.  In a way, it has become embedded in the institutions because this has been going on for quite some time.</p></speech>

Time is of the essence here.  I do not want to clog up the work programme any further but there is an imperative to ask these organisations to come in quickly.  This has been going on too long.  Depending on who one asks, one gets different answers as to why this occurred.  It is unacceptable.  Representatives of both boards need to be asked now what exactly has happened here.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we will be looking at accounts and the figures will be wrapped up in some other figure for one thing or another.  It is likewise with the HEA.  We can bring in the three bodies and we will insist on it being done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

They are tired of it.  It has gone on too long.  They can reasonably expect a reasonable degree of governance when it comes to these two bodies and this joint application.  I am coming to the conclusion that the governance of this application has not been adhered to.  We need to get to the bottom of this sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

If the D&aacute;il decides we can look at what Mr. Watt has outlined in regard to the set-up costs, there may be scope to do a piece of work around that.

The board was established in 2007 to oversee the development of a national hospital for children on a site at the Mater hospital.  As members are aware, following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the proposed development there, a Government decision was taken in November 2012 to discontinue the project at the Mater site and to relocate the development to a site at St. James's Hospital.  The term of appointment of the original board members expired in December 2012.  Interim appointees to the board served between January and July 2013.  The current board members were appointed in August 2013.</p><p>  Between 2007 and December 2012, the board incurred costs totalling just under &euro;40 million.  Funding for the board's expenses was provided by the Health Service Executive.  The cumulative expenditure by year is shown on the screens before us in figure 1.  The profile of expenditure is influenced by the rate at which the project advanced with most of the expenditure incurred in the years 2009 to 2011.  The breakdown of total expenditure to the end of 2012 is shown in figure 2.  Expenditure of &euro;24.5 million was incurred on the business services team, which has responsibility for business and health care planning and overall programme management.  Expenditure of just over &euro;6 million was incurred on the integrated design team whose responsibilities relate mainly to development of architectural designs, engineering and quantity surveying activities.  Cumulative expenditure on the project management team amounted to &euro;3.2 million.  This related to project planning and management, management of design quality and procurement management.  A further &euro;6.2 million was incurred in relation to administration costs including support staff salaries.  I am sure the board representatives will be able explain if I have got any of the assignments of responsibilities incorrect.  It should be noted that the board has not incurred site acquisition costs either at the Mater site or at St. James's.  I understand that the HSE and St. James's have incurred costs for site assembly.  </p><p>  Since the board exists solely to develop a major physical asset, all of the expenditure incurred was capitalised and recognised as a construction work in progress asset in the board's balance sheet.  That persisted from its establishment.  Accounting standards require that if circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable an impairment review should be conducted.  The carrying value of the asset at 31 December 2012 was impacted by the Government decision of November 2012 to change the location of the hospital.  Given that the required impairment review had not been completed, the audit certificate on the 2012 financial statements drew attention to the uncertainty in relation to the value of the main asset included in the board's balance sheet at the year-end.  Following its appointment in August 2013, the board commenced a review of asset values in relation to all costs incurred up to July 2013.  The review took account of the extent to which the outputs produced could be used on the project at St. James's and was completed in August 2014.  The resulting write-down of the asset will be reflected in the 2013 financial statements.  The audit by office of the impairment exercise and its impact on the draft 2013 financial statements has been completed and our views on the matter have been communicated to the board.</p><p>  I understand the board has now considered the impairment review and the audit comments and wrote to the Department of Health on 16 October detailing the process and its outcomes.  I believe the Department is considering the matter in consultation with the HSE and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As soon as the board presents signed financial statements in relation to 2013, we will be in a position to close the audit and issue the audit opinion. </p></speech>

As set out in the accounts, a number of significant developments took place in 2012 which impacted the work of the development board and the Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to some of these.  In particular, these were the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the planning application for the children's hospital on the Mater site, which took place in February 2012, the subsequent decision by Government to locate the children's hospital at the St. James's site in November 2012, and the expiry of the term of appointment of the members of the national paediatric hospital development board in December 2012 and their replacement in January 2013 with a transitional board.</p><p>  The total expenditure for the year 2012 was &euro;3.36 million.  This can be summarised under the following headings.  The business services team received &euro;1.47 million, the project management services team received &euro;0.13 million, the integrated design team received &euro;0.34 million and administration and other costs including payroll were &euro;1.42 million, giving a total expenditure of &euro;3.36 million.  The board had 1.5 whole time equivalence at the end of 2012.  Other than these, the day-to-day work of the board in 2012 was carried out through the business services, project management and integrated design teams rather than through additional, directly hired staff.  The 2012 balance sheet includes asset values at &euro;39.98 million in regard to the planning and development work for the children's hospital plan for the Mater hospital campus.  This value relates to a cumulated expenditure in the period 2007-12.  </p><p>  The current board of the national paediatric hospital development board chaired by Mr. Tom Costello was announced in August 2013 and commenced familiarising itself with the overall project details including the 2012 accounts.  On page 14 of the 2012 accounts, note 3, identifies that arising from the refusal of planning on the Mater site and the Government decision to change the location to St. James's Hospital site, that the board is of the opinion that the assets of the development board are now impaired and that a detailed asset impairment review process is required.  The development board initiated a process in 2014 to review and analyse the asset impairment.  This work is nearing completion and is part of the 2013 accounts.  A draft has been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, as he has alluded to, for approval.  On 16 October, the development board wrote to the Department of Health and the HSE setting out details of the process that was undergone for their consideration and sanction.  A response is pending.  This is in accordance with public financial procedures.  We hope to have concluded the asset impairment process and to be in a position to finally sign off and submit the 2013 accounts to the Minister for Health within the next few weeks.  </p><p>  As requested by the Committee of Public Accounts, we set out in our briefing document details of expenditure since 2012 which can be summarised as the expenditure in the year ending 2013 was &euro;1.7 million and the expenditure in the current year to August 2014 is &euro;1.76 million.  The current project status is that, as of August 2014, the design team for the new children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital campus led by BDP architects has been appointed.  A separate design team will be appointed for the design of the two satellite centres in regard to emergency, urgent care and out-patient services.  One of these is at Tallaght Hospital on the south side of Dublin and the other at Connolly Hospital on the north side.  A planning application for the main children's hospital and both satellite centres is scheduled to be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in June 2015 and, subject to a positive decision, construction will commence in early 2016.  </p></speech>

I imagine a lot of the questions I am going to ask refer to a period before the delegates' time but they will have familiarised themselves with the accounts in any event.</p> <p>The issue I start with is the big one, which is the impairment of just shy of &euro;40 million.  The board has finished its report, which went to the Comptroller and Auditor General and has now gone back to the HSE.  When can we expect to find out what exactly will be written off as impaired?  What is the figure?</p></speech>

We did not do this externally.  We reviewed all the assets that related to the Mater hospital site in respect of health planning, design, business cases, project execution plans and risks registered.  We assessed the assets to see which could be retained for value.  The process took a long number of months and we had an initial view in August 2012, which the Comptroller and Auditor General has spoken about, and separately the board decided it was not happy with the figures presented.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General came back to say it did not consider the figures as presented were correct and that some of the issues could be challenged further.</p></speech>

We have now carried out the more detailed analysis with the sign-off of the board and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has provided its imprimatur.  We are waiting for the sanction of the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but retained value will be of the order of &euro;6 million to &euro;6.5 million.  There will be a write-off on the 2013 accounts, subject to sanction, of the order of &euro;35 million.</p></speech>

One point I make is that the expenditure incurred in 2013 will have to be added on.  There was &euro;40 million at the end of 2012 and the impairment relates to that.

One of the key pieces of work done on the Mater was the design brief.  When one goes to design a hospital one must decide how many beds to put in, how many theatres, how large the out-patients department should be, how large the emergency department should be and how large the imaging department should be.  The design brief on the Mater side cost approximately &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million to develop.  It looked at the activity, operations and procedures taking place at the existing three hospitals - Tallaght Children's Hospital, Temple Street Children's Hospital and Crumlin hospital - and future-proofed the project for inflation growth between now and 2025.  It projected the child population looking at current activity and modelling the number of operations to determine how many broken legs will be treated and heart surgeries undertaken.  That whole activity was then converted into a design brief for the hospital setting out a need for 480 beds, 14 theatres, an out-patients department of a certain size and determining the size of the two satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly and the level of clinical activity to take place at those hospitals.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Pollock" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014102300010#J01600"><p>It is both.  Regarding the internal workings of how it is going to work, one must look at the manpower resourcing of the new hospital also.  In looking at that when one merges three hospitals into one, one will look for efficiencies in terms of how the hospital is staffed and in terms of procurement of consumables, materials and drugs with greater buying power.  One is looking at how the hospital will be run.  However, one must also tell the design team how large a hospital it must design.  We have told our design team the hospital will be approximately 65,000 sq. m of net clinical space.  That is purely clinical space and when one grosses it all up for communications and circulation, one ends up with a gross hospital space of approximately 110,000 sq. m.  We must provide this information to the design team in advance.  It is design information we provide to the BDP team in terms of saying to it that is the hospital we want it to design.  It is very similar to what was planned at the Mater in terms of scale and when one moves to a new site there will be some synergies in terms of what can be shared on the St. James's campus that will be different to what might have been shared at the Mater.  One conducts a stress test to bring it up to current medical practice and to accommodate it at St. James's.</p></speech>

That is an interesting point that the Deputy raises.  When the Dolphin review was carried out it identified moderate risks on the site of St. James's Hospital.  Again the development board, in conjunction with St. James's and the HSE and the Department, addressed.  Even though the site was much bigger than was proposed on the Mater site and fundamentally the Mater failed because the site was too small in terms of development, which is why it was to be a 16 storey building.  From what was originally proposed to the Dolphin group, the site has been enlarged.  What we have now is a 4.86 hectare site which is 12 acres.  12 acres in any terms in the inner city is a huge site.  It is three times the size of the site we had at the Mater.</p><p>  As part of the lessons learned, the development board has been stress-testing the site.  Once I was appointed in August-September 2013 I said let us examine, as the Deputy has asked, whether we have enough land.  The Dublin City Council development guidelines set a height of approximately of 28 metres.  We can work within those guidelines so that we will not be in breach of the development guidelines, which are different from those that were on the Mater site.  We can work within those guidelines and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take cognisance of that.  We certainly have enough space for it.  We stress-tested the site so that if a decision is made to place a maternity hospital on the site that can be accommodated as well.</p></speech>

A children's hospital group board has been established on an administrative basis to look after the integration.  That separation is important.

However, there is probably a clearer focus on the remit of the build board and a separation of responsibilities between the build board and the children's hospital group board.  It is a massive capital project.  It is the biggest health infrastructure project since the foundation of the State.

However, if one were to summarise the situation, it has lost a great deal of money so far and there have been three different boards.

There is an obligation on our board and we accept that.  There are people like me on the board.  I worked in the construction industry and was managing director of Sisk Group for 13 years.  The strength I bring to the board is the understanding of how one delivers major complex projects.  I was involved in many of the multinational investments here with companies such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and I was closely involved with the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park and so forth.  As Tracey Conway said, it is bringing an understanding of the design and construction of it and how one manages it in the private sector in terms of controlling costs and so forth.</p><p>  I am supported by a board which has all the expertise involved in planning, project management, legal, procurement, engineering and architecture.  The board is competency based in terms of the type of people who are put together on a team.  Certainly, in the year I have been on the board, our immediate focus before we got involved in any substantial costs, and the main cost is the appointment of a design team, was that we do a due diligence on all the decision making surrounding the suitability of the St. James's site.  I support what John said.  Even in terms of the size of the site, for example, we went to so far as to carry out site investigations on the site to ensure there was nothing in respect of contamination, archaeology or rock.  We have confidence about that and that has been proven, now that we have our design team on board, in the feedback it is giving us.  The team is telling us there are no surprises.  That is as I expected, because we spent a year just conducting due diligence on it.</p><p>  The board and the executive are approaching it in a very professional way.  For me and the board it is our project.  There is a real sense of ownership.</p></speech>

When the term ended it was around the same time that the decision was taken to move to another site.  The board that was appointed thereafter was a caretaker or interim board and it kept the entity in operation, which we would expect.  One cannot just abolish a board, wait for six months and then appoint another one.  It was important that there was continuity.  While one can characterise it as three boards in a short number of years, it is reasonably acceptable in the circumstances from a governance point of view.</p></speech>

The lion's share of the &euro;40 million is business services team costs at &euro;24.5 million.  That obviously runs from 2007 to 2012.

It is a consortium of four companies.  PM Group was one of the companies involved.  It provided design expertise and took responsibility for doing the feasibility design up front, before the O'Connell Mahon Architects team was appointed later.  PM Group was responsible for managing the budget.  It was also responsible for managing the schedules, in terms of coming up with the schedule we were working to and what the budget is.  It was &euro;650 million in the case of the Mater hospital site.</p><p>  There was the legal team and Beauchamps Solicitors, which are part of the PM Group legal team, providing legal advice and procurement advice as regards how the development board would procure the project management services team and the design team.</p><p>  The next big inputs were around the health planning role, which was the health planners.  That involved coming up with the design brief for the Mater hospital, looking at the resourcing plan for the current existing hospital, the future hospitals, the savings that would be made, what type of work practices would be put in place in the hospital and what model of care this hospital would work under as it was a different model of care from the model of care the three children's hospitals are currently working on.  For example, to come up with the design brief that group attended 1,200 meetings with the user groups, such as the nurses, doctors, consultants, outpatient departments, emergency departments, theatres, ward sisters and so forth to understand exactly how they currently functioned.  The 1,200 meetings was a huge volume of work.</p><p>  The fourth member was BDO which was producing the business case.  Having worked up the capital costs, one must show that there is a return to the State on its investment.  This is linked to the workforce planning.  How many people are in the hospital and what salaries will they be paid, currently and in the future?  What is the head count in the hospital and will savings be generated in that regard?  As I mentioned previously, there is buying the consumables, medicines, linen, the food, catering and everything that goes into the hospital, assessing where one is currently and where one can go in the future.</p></speech>

Build, design and operate costs were approximately &euro;5 million.  The health planning role also cost about &euro;5 million.

As Mr. Pollock indicated to Deputy Connaughton, these costs related to connectivity and joining up, in a rational, efficient and quality manner, the services of three separate hospitals to create one service.  I am concerned and do not fully understand how the level of impairment is as great as Mr. Pollock suggests.  In terms of the business case for the hospital, according to Mr. Pollock, the build, design and operate costs were &euro;5 million.  While I understand that the hospital location has changed and the hospital will have a different appearance, I would not have expected the capacity of the hospital, as a national facility, to change to such an extent that the work would not carry forward.  Does Mr. Pollock see where I am taking this line of logic?</p></speech>

Clinical activity and practice change as does the way in which a hospital is run, then versus now, and there are improvements, for example, in imaging scanners.  One must update to accommodate current clinical practice and the clinical practice that will operate in the three children's hospitals.  Our clients in this are the children's group board.  Will they operate the hospital on the St. James's Hospital site in the same way as they would have operated on the Mater Hospital site?  Obviously, we cannot transcribe a building directly from the Mater Hospital site to the St. James's Hospital site.</p></speech>

The workforce planning in the business case will have to be redone.  There have been many changes in Temple Street hospital, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and Tallaght hospital, as a result of the Haddington Road agreement and the loss of staff.  All the relevant information will have to be gathered again from the hospitals and recast into the new design, which will have a different layout.  Basically, not all the value is transferred.  A new business case and new workforce planning need to be done.</p></speech>

While I do not pretend to have expertise in the field, speaking as a layperson, the scale of impairment on a figure of &euro;40 million is astonishing.  I fully accept that this is a new plan for a new site and that time has moved on, albeit not to any great extent in the sense that I have not noticed any radical transformation in health services since 2011 in terms of equipment and so forth.  I am not taken or convinced by that argument.  It is astonishing that Mr. Pollock has informed us that &euro;35 million of the &euro;40 million is essentially null and void and impaired.  I refer to moneys spent on work done on planning, workforce planning, business cases and so on.  I accept the impairment in respect of legal costs as the board has entered a new arrangement on a new site.  The figures are stunning.  I presume we will be provided with more detail on this when the Health Service Executive and Department sign off on it.  It is remarkable.</p></speech>

We need to return to this issue because I am taken aback by the scale of the impairment.</p><p>  We will move on to the here and now.  I have a couple of questions on the report the board forwarded to the committee and the current status of the project.  The report states that following approval of the project brief, the design team was appointed and design development is now under way.  We are informed that the international architects, BDP, have been appointed to design the new children's hospital and that, in addition to these architects, seven other disciplines on the design team have been or are being procured in separate processes.  These include quantity surveying, mechanical and electrical engineering, civil and structural engineering, project supervision, the design process, planning, traffic consultancy and fire safety.  We are informed that seven of the eight design teams are in place, the exception being the fire safety consultants, for which the procurement process has not been completed. </p><p>  On BDP, the architects, what process applied to the appointment of this company and what was the scale of the contract for which it tendered?</p></speech>

We first issued a suitability assessment questionnaire, SAQ, to ensure we got the best teams, both international and Irish, to bring forward to the official tendering stage.  We received a huge response, as the Deputy will imagine.  We then drew up a shortlist of six companies, most of which were consortiums in that they had an international architectural partner and a local architectural partner.  One of the criteria was that the bidders needed to have experience of designing a children's hospital.  We were not prepared to have somebody learning on the project, which meant the company had to demonstrate a track record on designing a children's hospital.  We went through the suitability assessment questionnaire and drew up a short list of six.</p><p>  Within the development board, there is probably greater oversight than is normal in that we set up technical evaluation panels for each individual discipline.  The architects featured on one panel, while civil and structural engineering was another.  There were eight different members of the design team.  Each of these had a technical evaluation team, which would have had expertise to evaluate, whether in the area of architecture, engineering or urban planning.  We had a financial evaluation panel which assessed the fees tendered for the project.</p> <p>A steering group oversaw the entire process and all eight technical evaluation teams fed into that group to ensure consistency on how we dealt with the design teams.  The steering group reported back to the development board for sign off.</p></speech>

A technical evaluation team would have made the assessments and recommended the top six and forwarded that list to the steering committee.  That committee could challenge the list and ask for more detail, and then the steering committee forwarded the list to the development board for final sign off.</p></speech>

Mr. Costello sat on a number of the panels and we had outsiders, from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.

Once one comes to awarding the contract, one nominates the preferred candidate - in that case, Arup was the preferred candidate - and one then enters a stand still period of 30 days, to allow people the opportunity to object and raise concerns.  One sends out the marking to the unsuccessful candidates to show them how they scored in terms of the technical and financial evaluations and how they compared with the successful candidate.  For example, out of an overall score of 100 a score is awarded.  We made a mistake in that we gave the total score for one of the evaluation panels.  Let us say, for example, it was a score of 70.  However, when the bidder looked at the addition, a 45 had become a 54 in transcribing the letter.  Therefore, the addition was not correct, but the bottom line was correct.  Therefore, the bidder raised an issue regarding whether we were sure we had marked the teams correctly.  We reviewed and confirmed the evaluation had been conducted correctly and the arithmetic stood.</p></speech>

We have heard nothing more of it.

Will he talk to us about ongoing oversight and evaluation of the issue of conflict of interest from the perspective of the board?  I do not make this point to impugn anybody or suggest anything improper, but I am conscious that within different sectors of expertise, there can be quite a considerable crossover in terms of people's work experience, who they worked for, who they know and so on.  The development board is not starting from a good place in respect of the value for money element and the &euro;35 million which is down the tubes.</p> <p>Apart from value for money there is the issue of fair play for contractors, putting in place proper procedures and oversight, and ensuring there are no conflicts of interest.  Could Mr. Costello talk to us on that and provide reassurance to the committee on that score?</p></speech>

Over recent years, because of extremely low-cost tendering, there has been a move towards evaluation and awarding contracts based both on quality and cost.  Nowadays with most public contracts it is not only about price.  It is important that it would not be based on price only because low-cost and under-cost bidding has caused major problems on a number of projects because whether it is design teams or contractors they are not resourced to do the job and one ends up with mismanagement, which costs more at the end of the day.  This balance of competence and cost is also a good international norm.</p><p>  Then there is the issue addressed by Deputy McDonald, namely, the importance of selecting people who are competent in the first instance.  The price is still a big part of the evaluation but there is a technical evaluation as well.  The important thing is to ensure that people have the technical skills.  Within the HSE there are guidelines on the selection of panels.  We gave much thought to ensuring first that the people were competent.  After that one relies on people to declare a conflict of interest.  It is a small country, so inevitably people will at some stage have worked on a project together and may have been involved in joint ventures together.  The important thing is - because there are guidelines set out as to what a conflict of interest means - we are satisfied that-----</p></speech>

Reference has been made to philanthropy, philanthropic funds and so on and I do not have the scope to ask about that, but the lion's share of this is public money.  What are the board's plans in respect of social clauses?  I introduced legislation last Friday on the issue of social clauses in public procurement contracts.  As the witnesses are probably aware, this is something that has been done in Grangegorman, for example, and the Dublin docklands signed up to it, but it is very <i>ad hoc</i>and it is not yet based in statute.<br/>It would be remiss of me not to ask what the plans are, given that this is a big project in the heart of the inner city and that, like many inner-city communities, the area has very serious issues in terms of long-term unemployment, significant training and apprenticeship needs and so on.  Could the witnesses tell the committee what their plans are to leverage the best that the public euro can get in terms of constructing the hospital but also in accordance with EU law, because we are aware that there are constraints and that it must be done in a particular way but it is still entirely possible to do?  I am asking the witnesses what they will do about that.</p></speech>

We have begun engaging with the community and the regeneration groups in the area.  We made a visit to the NHS hospital in Glasgow, where they seem to have been very successful in particular in delivering on the community gain.  One of the people there, Mark McAllister, came over to meet with the community groups and ourselves - not just the development board but also the group board, which will be running this hospital.  Yes, we absolutely must deliver on the community gain.  To date we have been looking at the model that was delivered in Glasgow, which places emphasis on being proactive right from the off, in terms of engaging with social protection as regards who are the unemployed in the area, finding out their skillsets and getting their CVs.  We have not done this yet, but the plan is to upgrade their CVs, to give them training so that when a contractor comes on board, one will be able to go to the contractor and tell them who is available in the area and what the skillsets are, whether they are carpentry or steel-fixing, so that they start to procure people.  One makes the contractor's life easy, because we cannot compel the contractor to give jobs to locals, but we can make things easy for it.</p><p>  We must start gathering a database of local suppliers - whether it is someone who supplies doorknobs, meals, or joinery - one creates that database.  That seems to have been quite successful in Glasgow.  We must set hard targets for the contractor.  That is the lesson we learned in Glasgow.  They must not be soft targets, they must be real metrics - "You will deliver X% of jobs".  We cannot guarantee them locally but we can craft the documents in the right way and make it user-friendly for the contractor to promote this.  We met with the contractor in Glasgow, Brookfield Multiplex, which explained to us how it engages in that process and yes, it did provide apprenticeships and locally-delivered training schemes.  It must go further so that when the hospital opens, the kids in the area have an ambition that they want to be a manager, a doctor, a nurse in this hospital.</p></speech>

We had some discussions with the Construction Industry Federation at an early stage.  I suppose I am close to that side of the business because I have a background in contracting.  I am really stunned by how few apprentices are going through the system at the moment.  It is really awful.  I was involved in a hospital project like this in Castlebar 25 years ago.  At that time, there was an obligation to have a certain number of apprentices in every trade.  I accept that the Deputy is right in what she is saying about EU procurement, etc.  We have to come up with some system, not only to support the local population and its hospital but also to ensure there is a flow of apprentices coming through the system.  I know I am going a little bit left here altogether.  Many of the best people in the industry have left the country.  It is expected that the level of activity in the construction industry will increase.  We hope that will happen.  If it does, there will be a shortage of skills.  We are going to meet the Construction Industry Federation to see whether we can jointly come up with a solution which we would implement in the case of the children's hospital.  Hopefully, that would be a benchmark for future projects.</p></speech>

I did not raise the new EU procurement directive as a barrier.  It is entirely doable.  The thing is to know how to do it in the correct way.  I ask the development board to give consideration to the unbundling of contracts to give SMEs and indigenous players an opportunity to procure.  That is a broader issue.  In light of the scale of this project, we need those who are at the helm to give a commitment that these matters will be at the fore as they do their business.

I have a few short questions.  Much of the ground has been well covered already.  I would like to have something clarified in my own mind.  I know the development board was established by SI 246/2007.  What is its legal standing?  Is it a company limited by shares or by guarantee?  I cannot get information on its legal standing by looking at its annual report.  What is the board's legal standing as a company?</p></speech>

We need to bear in mind that we are talking to the public here.  I know the board was established under an establishment order, as set out in SI 246/2007.  Can Mr. Farragher explain to the public what that means in plain English?  People understand that a company has shares, is limited by guarantee or runs a community employment scheme.  Is the board simply a committee of people?  What is its legal status in terms of company law?  Is the board a company under company law?</p></speech>

I wonder whether there is a layman's answer with regard to what the development board is.  It is not a company.  It does not come under the Companies Act 1963.

I am more interested in the legal form.  If a receiver or a liquidator comes in, he or she can chase a company director for reckless or fraudulent trading.  There are liabilities attaching to being a director in a company.  Can the members of the board make a hames of this without being chased?  Do they have the same level of legal responsibility to the board as a director of a company would have to that company and its shareholders under the Companies Act?  This has nothing to do with the job the members of the board are doing.  We all know about that.  I want to know who carries the can.  If the directors of a limited company were reckless in their work, they could be chased for that by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Does the Director of Corporate Enforcement have any remit if the members of the board do something wrong while they are running this organisation?</p></speech>

I suspect I am not getting an answer.  Perhaps Mr. Woods will be able to help here.  Is there a lacuna here?  Are people being put on a board without having any legal liability?  It is not a limited company.  If it was, the Director of Corporate Enforcement could come after the members of the board if they did something wrong.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or some other body could come after anyone who acted fraudulently.  I am not suggesting that will happen.  These things do happen in life.  Are the members of the board exempt from all of this?  Is there a cloak of exemption from all the responsibilities that apply to everyone else we see in here?</p></speech>

It is a sueable entity.  I say that in response to the Deputy's earlier point.  The board exists as a body under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, so it is bound by public regulations.  The financial procedures of the State are relevant.  The proper governance and ethics codes that apply across all State entities apply to the board.  The internal control environment, which was noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts as being the duty of the directors, applies too.</p> <p>All of that comes under the banner of good governance for any publicly funded entity.  Compliance with the rules for semi-state bodies is also a factor, which includes things like compliance with tax codes.  The point being made about reckless trading is coming from the Companies Acts, so it is not a requirement. However, there is an equivalent, reckless trading in a public environment.  That is about managing your resource, as the Chairman was saying, within the available limits and being prudent in the deployment of the resource.  The board is funded by the HSE based on a capital plan approved by the Minister and it is controlled in that way. </p></speech>

With regard to the governance structure that Mr. Woods has explained, it would be similar, with similar provisions, a provision to sue and be sued, and so on.  I would make a distinction with regard to a committee set up by a Minister, of which there are very many that operate without producing annual reports or financial statements.  Certainly my understanding of it is that a body with a statutory basis would be quite different from a committee.</p></speech>

I am not asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on the Minister's comments, but he said it time and again.  The D&aacute;il record is littered with his references to the ring-fenced fund consisting of a portion of the proceeds of the National Lottery sale to finance the national children's hospital.  If that fund existed, I would be very happy with the use of the going-concern accounting basis, knowing there was a ring-fenced fund.  However, essentially, there is no such thing as a ring-fenced fund in the Central Fund.  That is what I am being told.  It is all in the one fund.

Immediately after the refusal of the Mater proposal and before the Dolphin group was established, it sought to see how else it might get planning permission on the Mater site.  It re-engaged to investigate whether it could make the site larger and it asked the design team to consider the options.  That was developed in some detail and there was engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la because, obviously, it would be the decider.  I do not know where those discussions went, but the board sought to maximise what it already had and retain its value.  Dolphin came on board and, ultimately, a Government decision was made to move the site.</p></speech>

I do not mean it is financially carrying the can but that it was <i>in situ</i>when this came to pass.  Given that it has an opportunity to safeguard the assets, corporate governance involves assessed risks.  I am sure it is a fundamental element of the board's macro considerations in regard to its handling of the project.  Mr. Pollock has already indicated that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent.  There is a chance that it will refuse planning permission.  I do not think anyone in this room can answer that question.  The application will not be submitted until next summer, or some time in 2015.  This committee's role is to assess the board on how it manages risks.  I ask Mr. Pollock to outline the procedures in place if planning permission is not granted.  It would be reckless not to consider that possibility.  Everybody wants the children's hospital to be built, but it is a possibility.  If the board has not considered that risk, it would not be doing its job.  What plans are in place to cope with that risk and where does Mr. Pollock see the board going if it does not get permission?  I am not asking about the construction of the children's hospital.  The key job of the board's directors is to manage risk in the organisation that they lead.  I know Mr. Pollock has examined this risk because he should not be here if he has not done so.  It is fine if permission is granted, but what plans are in place for the possibility that permission is not granted?  What is the risk assessment in terms of the value of the assets and where everything will be at that stage?</p></speech>

The project is associated with hundreds of risks, and planning permission is one of them.  The board was appointed just over one year ago, and before we committed to expenditure on the design team we went through a due diligence process to ensure the site was suitable and to fully understand the issues arising.  A planning report that was carried out as part of the decision making process and the selection of the St. James's Hospital site highlighted all the issues and potential risks arising in the short-listed sites.  A number of issues were raised in regard to the St. James's site.  Prior to employing the design team we set out to interrogate and understand these issues.</p><p>  The fundamental issue was, of course, the size of the site.  The site that was offered initially was similar in size to the Mater site.  In the deliberations that took place prior to the selection of St. James's Hospital, that site was significantly expanded.  We carried out further due diligence in order to get a high degree of satisfaction or comfort that we were working within the planning guidelines.  One of the major issues in this regard is the height of the building.  The site would easily accommodate a building under the 28 m limit, with capacity for future expansion.  In order to be satisfied in that regard, we insisted on St. James's providing a large site.  The site that is now being provided is three times the size of the Mater site, at 12 acres.</p><p>  Our first concern is to plan for success and to address the issues identified as part of the planning report.  We have the benefit of two planners on our board, one of whom was previously a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This means we have good internal advice on planning.  We are building a degree of confidence in this regard.  At the end of the day An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make the decision, but we are making sure all the potential issues are addressed as we proceed.</p><p>  If we are unfortunate in not getting planning permission, Government policy as it stands is to build a children's hospital at St. James's.  I envisage that the board would attempt to understand the issues arising.  We are sure it will not be due to the site being too small and we will continue our efforts to deliver on Government policy by building a children's hospital at St. James's.</p></speech>

We know that went wrong and we will not revisit that, but we are in the same range of funding and requirements before we get to the next planning decision.  I know there are no certainties in this world, but most businesses take out some sort of insurance or indemnity against these types of risk.  Has the board considered taking out insurance for the taxpayer in respect of that &euro;32 million in case things go wrong, or has it built it into the tender or contract with the design team?  I recognise that the latter is not responsible for getting planning permission, but if issues arise in the planning process which the board thinks are fixable or manageable, or which should have been foreseen by the various design teams and other people involved, does it have a comeback?  Will they be paid the full amount even if they prepare a shoddy application or an application that does not stand up to the rigours of An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is there a clawback mechanism from these people in terms of their professional indemnity, or does the board have an insurance policy to protect the taxpayer?  The last &euro;35 million is gone but we want to safeguard the next &euro;32 million.</p></speech>

In other words, some will have been paid for their work on the Mater, and although it went down, some of those people are still involved.

I will follow Deputy Fleming's train of thought as it was very valuable towards the end in regard to the impairment expenditure and the current procurement contracts.  At this point in time, we are effectively talking about &euro;40 million that was spent on the previous process in regard to the national paediatric hospital on the Mater site and in the region of &euro;30 million to &euro;32 million in regard to the current tenders that have been acquired, so it is a considerable amount of public money.  Deputy Fleming asked whether there is a liability whereby the board can be sued, on the one hand, and, on the other, whether there is any insurance mechanism in place.<br/>I was very closely involved with the original project around the Mater hospital, which is in my own constituency.  Effectively, this project came to the current location at St. James's Hospital not because of a decision of the Government, but because of what I believe to be reckless planning by the previous board.  It was very clear from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector's report that the planning application, which was for 16 storeys high, was, first, in breach of the statutory local area plan for the Phibsborough area, and, second, in breach of the Dublin City Council development plan for the period up to 2017.  On those two statutory considerations, there was a reckless breach in the planning application that was put forward, with the result that it was pointed out to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by local residents and others that this planning application could not be granted because it was invalid in the manner in which it was presented.<br/>An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision states that the proposal failed to:<blockquote>...comply with the specific objectives for this site as set out in the Phibsboro/Mountjoy Local Area Plan. ... The proposal would contravene Policy SC18 of the Dublin City Development Plan 11-17...</blockquote>It found it was incongruous and grossly out of kilter with either the city development plan or with the local area plan.<br/>How in God's name could so much design work and planning work be done, with almost &euro;40 million being spent, and then this totally inadequate presentation be made?  Of course the inspector rejected it.  Within a few weeks of the rejection by An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspector, the board presented another plan to make the hospital nine storeys high but, already at this point, the Minister of the day was fed up with what was going on and he made the decision that we should go to an alternative site entirely.  This is despite the fact there had been an independent review that had decided that the optimum site was, in fact, the Mater site.  That does not tie in with what Mr. Costello or Mr. Pollock said, namely, that the Mater site failed because the site was too small.  The Mater site did not fail because the site was too small.  There had been two independent reviews that had determined the Mater site was adequate but, for some reason, there was a presentation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for 16 storeys, which could not even allow a helicopter to land, although that was necessary for a children's hospital.  This is what was presented to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then, within a few weeks, it had been cut down to nine storeys because other areas within the confines of the Mater hospital were being utilised in a new planning application that was all of a sudden put forward.<br/>There are serious questions with regard to the use of public money in a situation of that nature, where a planning application is so out of kilter with the statutory guidelines already in place.  I have serious questions.  The previous board consisted of a number of developers, some of whom are now in NAMA, whereas the current, entirely new board seems to be much more representative.  Where does responsibility lie if the current board's planning application receives anything like the response from the inspector of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the previous application received?  It cost the State almost &euro;40 million, most of it impaired at this time.  We now have another &euro;32 million of taxpayers' money being spent and, as Deputy Fleming pointed out earlier, what guarantee do we have that this is going to be successful?  Who takes oversight of a board's planning application?<br/>I do not know if the witnesses have read the planning application that was put forward for the Mater hospital.  Part of the reason there has been so much impairment is due to the design work that was done.</p> <p>It was obviously not in the real world and it is, therefore, impaired.  This is the real reason so much is impaired and cannot be brought forward to this project.  Serious questions must be addressed and I seek opinions on the issues I raised.</p></speech>

This accrued from work that was done previously on a stand-alone hospital on the Mater hospital site.  The stand-alone hospital was to replace Temple Street and the work was carried out prior to the decision on the national paediatric hospital.  There were, therefore, two sets of designs, plans and so on and most of this is now impaired.  Surely if a significant amount of consultancy work was done by competent people on what was to be a top-class development of excellence, it should not now be impaired.  Surely there should be some transferability.</p></speech>

Mr. John Pollock, will go through cost details but, from the point of view of the board, we aim to ensure that what happened at the Mater hospital will not happen on the St. James's Hospital site.  As I mentioned to Deputy Fleming, there are two planners on the board and a planning adviser is on the design team.  What we are doing has been informed by the decision on the Mater hospital but it is also informed by the local area plan and the Dublin City Council development plan for the St. James's Hospital area.

How will lessons be learned?  How can the witnesses be sure that what they are doing will not result in the same situation that occurred at the Mater hospital?  Can the witnesses break down the reasons for the impairment that occurred and the waste of taxpayers' money?  These are the statements from 2012 and I think we must seek greater clarity on how the decision was made to put forward a planning application that anyone could have seen had no chance of success - there were too many question marks.  The report says that formal processes were established to identify and evaluate risks associated with the planning.  Did the previous board do this?  There are planning expenses of &euro;1.5 million and this is separate to the figures given for the four bodies - the business service, the integrated design team and so on.  It states on page 14 that, arising from the Government decision to change the location of the new children's hospital to the St. James's Hospital site, the board is of the opinion that there are certain elements of the business project management services and design works procured to date that are unlikely to retain their full value as assets for the future hospital.  It also says the board will complete a process to review the matter.  This is the process I want to see.</p><p>  The witnesses have said such issues are unlikely but have not detailed the reasons for this and I believe serious questions must be answered on why there has been total impairment.  Why is it not possible to carry the value of these assets into the work that is currently being done?  I request a detailed account from the witnesses based on the history of the project.  If they do not read the relevant documents, get the background information on the decisions that have been made and see why An Bord Plean&aacute;la categorically refused the planning application after years of work and high expenditure, they will not understand how the impairment of assets occurred.</p><p>  The accompanying letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General states that on 31 December 2012 the financial statements included assets valued at &euro;40 million.  This is with regard to planning and development costs for the national paediatric hospital.  The letter goes on to state that, arising from the Government's decision to change the location of the hospital, it is likely that these assets are now impaired.  I contend that is not correct - the impairment arises not from the Government's decision, but from a reckless planning application.  The Government had no choice but to make its decision and this should be clarified.</p></speech>

There are no developers,<i>per se</i>, on the current board but there are engineers, architects and so on.  There is a representative on the board for Trinity College and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, but nobody carries a brief for the other main children's hospital, Temple Street, and the same goes for the Mater hospital and the Rotunda Hospital - all three were to be united on a single campus.  Would it not be appropriate to co-opt a person onto the board who was part of the previous work on the initial decision on the location of the national paediatric hospital?  Perhaps the witnesses are not responsible for this.  Is it not the case that all paediatric institutions in the State, including those in Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street, should be represented on the board to ensure a full view of what is appropriate?</p></speech>

There is a close working relationship between the children's hospital group board and the National Paediatric Hospital development board.  The children's hospital group board is the client for the project and there is an ongoing relationship in that regard.  A good way of illustrating it is that before the design brief was approved by the HSE with the Minister's consent, and which the Minister brought to Government in July this year, the children's hospital group board signed off as a client on that design brief before it then went to the National Paediatric Hospital development board for sign off before submission to the HSE.</p></speech>

The Rotunda, Mater and Temple Street hospitals were involved in that.  I do not see any direct organic relationship between Ms Conroy's board and any of the previous work that was done, either in terms of work or personnel.  I suggest that Ms Conroy should bring back to her board the idea that it might be appropriate, even if she has somebody who represents everybody more than adequately, to have such information, wisdom and expertise.  There was a period of time when a huge amount of work was done that might be useful to the deliberations of her own board in future.</p></speech>

Temple Street, through its CEO, is represented on that board.  All that corporate knowledge the Acting Chairman talked about is being captured and passed on to us as the brief for the hospital.  Our remit is to design, build and equip based on that brief. </p></speech>

While this hospital is being built, the parallel work stream is being managed by the children's hospital group board around the integration of existing services.  The intention is that by the time the hospital is built and ready to take services, the three hospitals will have come together as a virtual hospital ready for all of those services, which are currently delivered across those three sites, to be transferred into the national children's hospital.  It is not envisaged that paediatric services will remain on those sites.</p></speech>

We have the two main providers of services at the present time: Temple Street and Crumlin, which apparently are going to go out of existence.  We do not get any reference to it other than that other satellite centres will be developed.  That has to inform your planning and development, so can we get a clear statement?  Is that the way Temple Street and Crumlin see it?  There are loads of volunteers around the country collecting money for both those hospitals who think and believe that they will remain on, at least in a local capacity, to provide a service in their communities.  Can we get clarification on all of that?  That would definitely inform a lot of the planning that you are going into.</p></speech>

My understanding is that once the Mater decision was made - and obviously there was a question mark over the project - the business services team contracts were terminated, so we needed much more modest accommodation.  The HSE had accommodation in Sir Patrick Dun's, so a decision was made to retrench to rent-free accommodation there.  I can give the committee what was spent previously.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Pollock aware that no funding, <i>per se</i>, was ring-fenced for the hospital prior to the present Government deciding that the proceeds of the sale of the national lottery - which I understand are in the region of &euro;400 million - were to be ring-fenced?

One element is philanthropic in that you have to raise a certain amount of money.  I would like to know the amount of money that is expected to be raised.

It does not include the cost of research and education work which, it was always envisaged, would be funded through philanthropic funding.  We will apply for planning both for the children's hospital and the research and education facility.  Until the research and education funding comes on board philanthropically, we will not proceed with the construction of that.  However, one still needs an element of research and education within the main children's hospital which will be built with a separate stand-alone block.  It is dependent on the philanthropic funding to come through.  That would have a much shorter period for construction so it could lag the children's hospital by two years and still be there at the same time.  It is the remit of the group board to start the philanthropic process.</p> <p>That means one starts to assemble a philanthropic committee and then commences to fundraise.</p></speech>

I ask the clerk to the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General if they can determine from the accounts of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the amount of money allocated to Irish Water and Poolbeg by the Department.  If there were two allocations and with what is going through the Estimates, does that have a bearing on our investigations?  If they are in the accounts, surely it is a matter for us to examine.

They also interfere with members of staff.</p><p>  This morning's meeting is divided into two sessions.  The first is a meeting with representatives of Mental Health Reform from which I welcome Dr. Shari McDaid, director, and Ms Kate Mitchell, policy and research advisor.  As members know, Senator John Gilroy is the committee's rapporteur in the area of mental health and will present a report in due course.  We look forward to a very good discussion today on the priorities for the mental health service in Ireland.  Mental health issues have a huge and profound impact on people's lives in all parts of society.  We look forward to hearing from Mental Health Reform, which promotes and prioritises mental health services.  I thank Dr. McDaid and Ms Mitchell for attending the meeting on behalf of a very powerful advocacy agency which campaigns for improved mental health services.</p><p>  I remind witnesses regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p> <p>You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> As we will have two parts to our meeting, is it agreed that we will conclude this section by 11.15 a.m. at the latest?  Agreed.</p><p> I invite Dr. McDaid to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

Some of the issues we will discuss were contained in our pre-budget submission which was circulated to the committee.</p><p>  Mental Health Reform is the national coalition of 48 NGOs interested in working towards improved mental health services and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  There is no doubt that in recent years there have been positive developments.  However, the reality is that despite the appointment of 727 staff in the past three years, at the end of July there were just 63 more staff in the mental health services than there had been at the end of 2012, and still almost 1,000 fewer than in 2009, showing that the huge losses the mental health services incurred in the early part of the recession have yet to be made up, never mind increasing the staffing the levels that were envisaged to provide the holistic service set out in A Vision for Change.  The scale of the challenge before us is clearer when one considers that full implementation of the policy would entail having 12,482 staff and as of July we had fewer than 9,000.  It is in this context that I would like to outline our perspective on the recent progress made on the policy.</p><p>  In our view, recent years have brought some significant positive developments.  For the first time in the modern era, the national public health service has a leader at the head of the mental health services who sits at the senior management table, with a national director for mental health and a distinctive mental health division within the HSE.  The Government had ring-fenced funding amounting to &euro;90 million to develop specialist community-based mental health services and for suicide prevention between 2012 and 2014, and a further &euro;35 million has been allocated for 2015.  We certainly appreciate the additional investment.  However, it is important to understand that much of this funding has gone to replace staff leaving the service, so that the net increase in funding up to the end of 2013 was quite marginal.</p><p>  As in prior years, we are concerned that the HSE has delayed recruitment of staff under this year&rsquo;s allocation so that the funding of &euro;20 million allocated under budget 2014 is not likely to be spent this year.  On a positive note, the proportion of non-medical staff, including social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists, within the mental health services has more than doubled since 2009.  This is very positive as it reflects the strong desire expressed by people who use mental health services to have access to a less medicalised service and access to more complementary or non-medical supports.</p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s recent decision to mainstream its culture-change project, Advancing Recovery in Ireland, on a national basis provides a basis for driving the culture change needed within mental health services towards a recovery-orientated service that works in partnership with service users and family members.  The appointment of someone with personal experience of using mental health services as a member of the national management team for the mental health division is also a very welcome symbol of how service users need to be at the centre of planning.</p><p>  However, Mental Health Reform is very concerned about the continued gaps and very real strains in the mental health supports available for people across the country.  We still do not have in all parts of the country the model of 24/7 crisis intervention within the specialist mental health services that was set out in the policy.  Not all services are providing home treatment and there are very few crisis houses to provide alternatives to inpatient beds.  This is unacceptable in a context where we still have upwards of 500 people each year taking their own life, the majority of whom will have had some contact with a health professional during the previous year.</p><p>  The waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services is still too high.  In July 2,757 children and adolescents were waiting to be seen by CAMHS.  Although this was a 2% decrease on a year earlier, it still means that quite a large number of children are waiting to be seen.  There are also too many children and adolescents being admitted into adult wards.  The most recent information from the HSE shows that for this year out of 158 admissions up to the end of June, 53, which is more than a third, were to adult units.  This is despite the fact that under the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s code of practice, no child under age 18 should be admitted to an adult ward, save in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  We are also concerned about the large increase in the numbers of homeless people being admitted to inpatient units.  The information for 2013 is that 245 people of no fixed abode were admitted to inpatient units, an increase of 40% on 2012.  We are concerned therefore that the wider housing crisis is having a very real impact on people with mental health difficulties.</p><p>  We continue to be concerned about staffing shortfalls, as mentioned earlier.  In order to fully implement the policy, the HSE would need 12,482 staff.  As of the end of July of this year, there were fewer than 9,000 posts and the services were short 231 doctors and 567 nursing posts.  More than 1,000 nurses have been lost to the service since 2009.  The combination of the moratorium along with the wider difficulties of the levels of remuneration for people taking up positions as nurses and doctors are clearly impacting negatively on the ability of the HSE to recruit and retain staff for mental health teams.</p><p>  We are also concerned that mental health services in primary care are not able to cope with demand.  We have been told by the HSE that there are waiting lists for the new counselling in primary care service.  This is a service which is intended to be available free to medical card holders by referral through their GPs.  It was only initiated nationally in July 2013 and as of the end of August 211 people were waiting between three and six months for an appointment and 70 people had waited more than six months.  Clearly, timely access to a counselling service is vital to give GPs confidence in referral and also to make it an effective early intervention.</p><p>  Despite recent positive developments, there are still huge challenges to bringing about the type of primary care and specialist mental health services set out in A Vision for Change.  These challenges reflect the continued vulnerability of mental health services within the overall health system and the need to have sustained political will in order to redress decades of neglect.</p></speech>

She has outlined it as it is.  There are clearly grave challenges in terms of funding.  We must accept that governments need to work within certain parameters.  For many years mental health was described as the Cinderella of health services.  There was clearly insufficient commitment in any programme for government to ensure there was enough funding.  When we saw the cutbacks even though there was ring-fencing of funding it was only ring-fencing in name and did not really translate into guaranteed committed funding year-on-year.  Obviously we have seen the exodus of health professionals over recent years creating further problems.  That is the backdrop to where we are in terms of trying to provide mental health services in our communities throughout the country.</p><p>  Dr. McDaid referred to child and adolescent mental health services.  Many adolescents are still being admitted to adult units even though we all know it is wrong from a clinical point of view as well as from the point of view of an individual's rights and entitlements.  Have we made much progress in that area?  I know there are ongoing developments.  Have we gone much further down that road to ensure that we do not have adolescents attending adult psychiatric units, for example, and being admitted to adult psychiatric services?</p> <p>Some general practitioners have expressed concern to me - as I am sure they have to others - about the new counselling and primary care service.  The view appears to be that if we do not address this particular problem quickly the result will be people again being admitted through the emergency departments of our hospitals.  Is that something about which the witnesses would be concerned?</p><p> It was stated that we have sufficient social workers.  There is one area where I believe there may be a break in the chain, namely, secondary school career guidance counsellors.  There has been a huge reduction in recent years in the number of guidance counsellors in our schools.  Is Mental Health Reform aware of any difficulties in this area?  People often say that vulnerable people should be seen by a general practitioner.  A vulnerable child whose general practitioner is the family general practitioner may not wish to speak to him or her.  Are there other avenues open to vulnerable students, who previously would have spoken to their career guidance counsellor and so on, who may have been camouflaging their difficulties for some time and may not want the family to know about them.  In the witnesses' experience, are there any difficulties in this regard?</p></speech>

I wish Ms Mitchell every success in her new role.  Wearing my hat as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on health, mental health is of huge concern to me.  I am the Sinn F&eacute;in representative on the all-party group on mental health.  I commend the representatives of each of the parties and Independent voices represented here for their input in this area over the past number of years.  Without the help of Mental Health Reform and Lara Kelly we would not have been as proficient as we have been in drawing attention to some of the critical areas that need to be addressed.</p><p>  That said, the Mental Health Reform presentation made this morning is alarming and distressing.  Despite all our best efforts at highlighting the importance of properly resourcing our mental health services, in excess of 2,700 children are awaiting access to child and adolescent mental health services.  While there has been a 2% decrease on the data for the last year, this is not good enough.  When presented with such stark relief it is very alarming.  We will have an opportunity during the second part of this meeting to address some of these points with the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar and representatives of the HSE.  I would encourage colleagues to reflect on some of the information shared with us by Mental Health Reform.</p><p>  On homelessness, it was stated that 245 homeless people were admitted to inpatient units last year.  Data for this year is not yet available.  However, 245 is a significant increase on the data for 2012.  This information indicates a connection that needs to be recognised and addressed and not only through mental health services.  Homelessness in all of its dimensions needs to be properly addressed.</p><p>  On staffing levels in the mental health services, the position that should apply under implementation of A Vision for Change is being missed when there are fewer than 9,000 people providing a service for almost 12,500 people.  I know from personal experience, having met and conversed with the services in my own area, that the people involved are giving heroic service in terms of front line provision, in particular the community mental health teams.  Their role in all of this must be acknowledged and commended.  </p><p>  Roll-out of the new counselling and primary care service across the country is unequal.  There are huge gaps in access to and the availability of counselling supports in terms of mental health needs.  Having highlighted some of the most salient points made by the witnesses, I would like now to put some questions to them.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, referred in his budget address to the D&aacute;il immediately following the address by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to new staff recruitment and in this regard mentioned psychologists and counsellors for the mental health services area.

The allocation for this area in 2015 is &euro;35 million.  It has been highlighted today that the lesser sum provided in the current year will not be fully employed.  We had a commitment from the Minister of State that the shortfall for this year of &euro;15 million would be provided in addition to the &euro;35 million allocation for next year but that has not happened.  Perhaps the witnesses would set out the likely negative consequences of that failure to adhere to the commitment that was contained in the programme for Government in 2011.</p><p>  The witnesses might also elaborate on the Mental Health Commission's needs in terms of fulfilling its functions as set out in its pre-budget submission.  Reference was also made in the agency's pre-budget submission to the need for extension of free primary care to all who require long term mental health treatment.  As part of Sinn F&eacute;in's effort in its preparation of an alternative budget, I attempted to have that costed by the Departments of Health, Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform but they were not able to do so as they have no information in relation to the current number of people who require mental health services, never mind projections in this regard into the future.  There are major problems in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300004#C00500"><p>I, too, welcome Dr. McDaid and Ms Mitchell.  It is helpful to us as Oireachtas Members when organisations come together.  I have a few questions arising out of today's presentation.  While I can speculate the answers to those questions I am interested in hearing the responses of the witnesses.  It is difficult for us to know how we are performing given that the last review of the monitoring group of A Vision for Change was in 2011 and published in 2012.  The Minister has said that there will be no more reporting and that other mechanisms will be put in place.  However, there is no other mechanism which allows us or the State to assess its progress.  Progress is not reported in any other way, other than, perhaps, the CAMHS reports.</p> <p>We are still getting the annual CAMHS reports, which  is a tribute to those concerned although I do not like what I am reading.  However, it at least shows us where we need to focus attention.  I am very concerned about the absence of a reporting mechanism.</p><p> I am concerned about children being placed in adult psychiatric wards.  I very much support the witnesses' position that no child under 18 should be admitted to a ward of this kind, except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p> Several years ago it was agreed that no child should be in an adult ward.  I do not know why this is occurring and tried to establish why the practice persists.  Anecdotal evidence gleaned by me shows that some units are determining themselves that they will deal only with certain cases or conditions, such as eating disorders.  There is no national co-ordination.  Thus, when a place is being sought for a child, services are deciding locally the cases they will deal with and not deal with.  I refer to children in need.  It is unacceptable that we cannot deal with the more difficult, complex cases.  Surely it is for these that we have a health system in place.  Surely it is when the issue is complex that a child should be put into a ward.  It is not a treatment but part of a process.  When this part of the process is required, the appropriate beds need to be in place.</p><p> On the issue of CAMHS, which I mentioned, I was interested to see that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has expressed concern that we have the highest rate of mental illness in Europe among those under 25.  We need to be cognisant of that when dealing with children and young people.</p><p> I am concerned about the waiting lists and will certainly be bringing this up with the Minister at our subsequent meeting.  I am concerned also about the experience of teachers and social workers.  When referring cases, they are not getting the responses they wish for.  In fact, social workers have told me that when they refer a case of a child in care to CAMHS, they are basically told, "They are in your care now; they are out of the community and you should look after them".  For me, the very reason for having CAMHS was to address this.  It is for this reason I felt CAMHS should be moved into the Child and Family Agency.  Do the delegates believe that would be beneficial?  Is it a position they support?</p><p> I am concerned about the triage process for determining priority because it has a masking effect.  Children are often medicated and other options are given such that, by the time a child is seen, we do not always know the position.  The age in question is such an important one developmentally.  Saying three months or one year has an effect on a child's educational and social development, in addition to other critical aspects.  We know it is during the teenage years that children are most likely to present for the first time.  That we are not dealing with the issue causes stigmatisation later in life.</p><p> Having read about this matter in preparation for this meeting and our next, I noted two issues, one of which is awareness-raising and the other of which is the action taken.  Over recent years in particular, NGOs have increased the level of awareness-raising.  I question, therefore, why the State needs to focus on this area.  Perhaps it should be supporting the NGOs in focusing on awareness-raising and focus itself on delivering the mental health services for people in need of them.  We are raising awareness but the service is not available when requested.  We ask people to talk and present, yet the service is not in place for them.  Therefore, I have a huge question about this.  While it is nice for the State to engage in awareness-raising with the NGOs, it should ensure the services are in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300005#D00200"><p>I will respond to the questions one by one.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher started off by talking about funding and the fact that there has been investment.  The challenge has been that, despite allocations of funding at budget time, the issues with retaining staff in the service and the slow process of recruiting new staff have meant the numbers have just not increased; that is the bottom line.  It is a case of a boat with a hole in it wherein one keeps trying to throw the water out.  The services are leaking staff all the time.  This is the case because there are attractive retirement packages.  The age profile of the nurses in the mental health services is such that a generic provision meant to lower the overall number of health service staff has affected mental health services much more heavily than others.  This has not been dealt with.  We are now at a point where, for the first time since 2006 and the publication of A Vision for Change, we are facing severe difficulties in providing enough nurses to staff acute wards and provide community services so people do not end up in acute wards.  I refer to services such as day hospitals open seven days a week.  These have to be staffed by nurses.  If we do not have enough nurses, we cannot provide the crisis support required to prevent people from ending up in hospital.  Right now, we are really in danger of moving seriously backwards with the agenda in A Vision for Change  because of the difficulties with staffing.</p><p>  Interestingly, the difficulty employing consultants is part of the reason CAMHS is not doing as well as it should be.  It has had severe difficulties in recruiting specialist consultants to fill teams and man inpatient wards.</p><p>  With regard to the admission to wards of children and adolescents, we have actually gone backwards this year.  This is of severe concern.  Steps were taken to increase the number of beds.  There was a maximum increase of approximately 56 beds earlier this year.  This then decreased by ten over the summer, resulting in fewer than had been anticipated.  In the context of A Vision for Change, there should be 80 beds.  This was based on a smaller population so we really need more now.  We are in danger of moving backwards rather than forwards.</p><p>  With regard to the counselling in primary care service, it was asked whether difficulties in meeting demand mean people end up in hospital.  That is a possibility although the service is really geared towards people with mild-to-moderate mental health difficulties, not those in a severe crisis.  The intention is that, by catching people early, they will not end up needing specialist mental health services and potentially more severe treatment down the line.  It is so important that general practitioners have a place to refer patients to because we hear time and again that people have felt over the years that all they are offered on going to their general practitioner is medication.  They do not necessarily want medication alone; they want other types of supports.  The service needs to be built up much more and we need to consider creative solutions.  If we do not have dozens of psychologists available, we need to consider creative solutions drawing on the expertise of NGOs and other types of providers so as to meet the need.</p><p>  The reality in Ireland is that there are very strict referral criteria for child and mental health services.  Basically, a general practitioner must make a referral.  There are some sound clinical reasons for that.  This is understandable but, in recent work we did examining procedures, we learned there is more flexibility in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Australia.  Therefore, we believe there is scope for more flexibility, as in allowing concerned teachers and social workers to have easier access.</p><p>  The Jigsaw services comprise a positive development.  I refer to open community centres that young people can go to.  They are more youth-friendly than other services.  They are not medical or general practitioner surgeries but centres to which people can go to talk to somebody if they are concerned about their mental health.</p> <p>Those seem to be working well and there is investment in rolling them out more widely this year.</p><p> I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his kind words about mental health reform.  We work hard to essentially draw together the concerns, issues and good practice around the country.  We will keep trying to do that.  I will speak to the homelessness issue and the relationship between the housing crisis and what might be happening in mental health services.  One of the concerns drawn to our attention this year in particular is the difficulty in being able to discharge people from acute wards because of a lack of housing availability.  It is shocking that despite a major push towards community-based mental health services, we might have people ending up in an institutionalised setting in an acute ward longer than they need to be there because there is no appropriate housing option in the community.  That concern arises because of the housing crisis.</p><p> We were asked if we had any information on where the 2015 allocation will go but we do not.  It is correct that this was not specified by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in the joint announcement about funding.  We expect there should be some information about that in the HSE's national service plan or the mental health division's operational plan.  There is still a major shortfall to be made up.  We were asked about the negative consequences of the &euro;15 million shortfall and I can allude again to staffing shortfalls.  We are not in a position that we have so many staff in mental health services that we cannot think of what to do with more; we are in the opposite position, as services are under strain.  Even with multidisciplinary staff, although it is positive that the proportion has doubled, the numbers of staff are still well below needs according to A Vision for Change.  There is plenty of scope for further investment.</p><p> There was a question about the Mental Health Commission, which has been impacted by the moratorium to the extent that it was having difficulty filling some of its inspection and other senior management posts, meaning it has been difficult for it to fulfil its functions, particularly in having multidisciplinary input into its inspections.  We want to know that the Mental Health Commission can fulfil its remit, as it is the main means of accountability for how well mental health services are fulfilling legal obligations.</p><p> I thank Senator van Turnhout for her kind words about our organisations.  She expressed concern about the absence of an independent reporting mechanism.  I agree that we are in a position without regular annual reporting, which is against the recommendations of A Vision for Change, either internally by the HSE or externally by an independent body.  That puts us in a very difficult position.  No voluntary organisation has access to the information that might be obtained by having an official mechanism for reporting.  I agree that there is a need for a robust but efficient reporting mechanism, which should not be overly onerous on services but which should give the required information.  I did not allude to a difficulty in my statement but it is mentioned in successive pre-budget submissions.  We asked for an information system for mental health services over previous years and were told initiatives were under way to improve the position.  There has been a modest improvement this year, with some activity data for the adult mental health services that we have not had before but it falls far short of what is provided for the child and adolescent section.</p><p> We are very disappointed the development of an information system is not progressing at a better pace as we simply do not know the level of need for mental health services.  It is very significant that we have not had a national survey on the psychological well-being of the population since 2007.  Right through the recession we have not had a data source on the national levels of need.  It is very welcome that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has produced data on child and adolescent need which is pointing to the higher levels in Ireland, and we can only suspect what may be the higher levels for adults as well, given the economic strain that people have been under.  Both of those elements are very important.</p><p> Why are children still being admitted to adult wards?  We have spoken about the reduction in the number of beds and there is also a need for good training for staff.  The HSE's restriction on training has had a very direct impact on the adequacy of the inpatient child and adolescent mental health services.  Staff who do not feel equipped to respond to children with very complex needs or behaviour will resist children being admitted to wards.  We need to shift towards investing in training for staff so they can respond appropriately.  Interestingly, that extends to services where we need training in how to work with adults with difficult behaviour as well so we can have less use of seclusion and restraint.</p><p> We were asked if non-governmental organisations, NGOs, should see more investment in order to provide awareness training.  There is a need for a combination of public sector investment and work with NGOs.  A partnership approach is probably correct and I would like to see much deeper investment in community development initiatives for mental health and well-being.  Sustained community development work will bring about a shift so that fewer people will develop mental health difficulties at an early stage.</p></speech>

In fairness, it outlines the positives and where there is a need for action.  With regard to staff shortages, the witness indicates that over 12,000 people are required.  Will she indicate where is the shortfall between the 9,000 people and the 12,482 people?  Per head of population, is the 12,482 figure comparable with what is available in the UK?  The witness spoke about the shortage of doctors, with a shortfall of 200, and there is also a shortfall of 500 nurses.  Is this a result of action not being taken by the HSE to recruit or is it because people are not available?  The number of doctors mentioned is quite high, so does that take in both consultants and junior doctors?  Is there a major problem in the area?  How can the issue be tackled?</p><p>  There is the issue of homelessness, and the witness has pointed out the lack of services for homeless people.  What could be done immediately to address the problem?  I am referring particularly to something that could be done over the next two to three months, especially as we are approaching Christmas.  The issue is highlighted at that stage more than any other time of the year.</p> <p>What do the witnesses believe could be done to deal with the issue in order to fast-track some action?</p></speech>

I have one or two questions, one of which Senator Burke alluded to, about the shortfall in staff numbers outlined in A Vision for Change.  It was said that up to July there was a shortfall of approximately 3,000 staff.  I am concerned about the 567 nursing posts that have not been filled.  I accept dealing with people with mental health issues requires highly skilled professionals.  The work is very intense.  Are agency nurses employed in the mental health sector?</p><p>  It was said that 212 people are waiting for between three months and six months and another 70 are waiting for up to six months.  Is there a breakdown of their specific geographic location?  I read that 34% of children are still being admitted to adult psychiatric services in hospitals.  I echo the comments of other speakers that it is absolutely scandalous.  We must examine the situation as a matter of urgency.  It was said that some of the 500 people who took their lives had contact in the past year with health professionals.  Is there a percentage available?  Is it 20% or closer to 80% and where does one get such figures?</p><p>  I fully agree with what was said about homelessness.  People seek housing on a regular basis.  Depression and anxiety about where to go in the evening are among the main problems that arise.  Many people end up sitting in accident and emergency departments and they develop many other problems there in addition to the reason for which they are admitted.  Alcohol abuse is one of the main problems I encounter among the people I deal with who experience homelessness.  In my area there are two houses where homeless people can go in order to drink.  Not all areas in Dublin have such a facility as they seem to be concentrated in certain parts of the city.  That is a real problem because I meet people who regularly come from other parts of the city to the inner city in order to be facilitated in wet hostels.  Some homeless people would not have to go to accident and emergency departments if they could be facilitated elsewhere.  I accept that is a broader issue but the situation must be examined.</p><p>  I have had some dealings with community-based mental health services as part of primary care services through relatives of people who suffer from their nerves.  All of them have said the service in the community is excellent and that people are well looked after.  It is a huge comfort to families that their relatives can be seen in the community rather than them having to travel.  It is good for communities to know that people suffer from mental health issues and that people should not be stigmatised as being affected with some kind of plague.  Most families in this country have someone who suffers from depression, anxiety or other mental health illness and we should not hide the fact in a closet and pretend it does not exist because it does.  One of the things that has helped families to cope with the mental health illness of a family member is the availability of a community-based service.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the shortfall in the number of psychiatrists.  Even if the shortfall were addressed, where would we fit in an international league table of psychiatrists per head of population?  For most specialties in medicine we are way off the bottom of the charts.  I am sorry to catch the witnesses on the hop and I understand if the information is not to hand.  What is our ratio of psychiatrists per head of population compared to the United Kingdom, which tends to be second worst in the world among OECD countries for most specialties, and in comparison to an average figure for continental Europe?</p><p>  This is a specific and technical question.  Does Dr. McDaid have any sense of the provision of liaison psychiatry services?  I do not know where this fits in the planning for psychiatry services.  A great deal of the demand for mental health services comes via other doctors and other illnesses.  People develop complications that require psychological care, which I find is often very hard to access.</p><p>  Could Dr. McDaid also give me a sense of the average waiting time for treatment?  I refer to somebody who has a routine psychiatry request from a GP for an outpatient appointment that is not felt to be life threatening; if, for example, somebody has an addiction issue or personal issues which are not felt to put the person in the way of self harm.  Approximately how long does a person wait to get seen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300007#F00400"><p>My query relates to the question asked by Senator Crown about waiting times.  I am aware of a lady who tried to take her life.  When she contacted the hospital where she was to see a psychiatrist, she was told it would take eight weeks.  Her family was obviously very upset.  In spite of that, the doctors in the hospital were able to ring her and tell her to come in as they had a bed for her.  I do not understand how a long timespan would be given and then the doctors could change their minds within 24 hours.</p><p>  Reference was made to a national coalition of 48 NGOs in the context of Mental Health Reform.  Following a previous presentation I inquired how many groups were involved in suicide prevention and I did not get an answer.  I was told that between 350 and 500 groups were in existence.  Could the witnesses comment on those groups and what they are doing, given that we have been told there are 48 groups in the national coalition?</p><p>  Twice this week I have been contacted by school principals who are extremely worried about adolescent children in their care.  They want to know where they can go and who they can get to see.  It is not that the children need to be admitted to hospital but they need help.  I am aware that when one rings the local support services, one gets an answering machine but one never gets a call-back.  Nobody seems to answer the phone.  Why is that the case?  The support group is based in the locality but it does not respond to people.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I have read it in the meantime.  Could she provide a view on out-of-hours social worker access?  Actions speak louder than words.</p><p>  The National Office for Suicide Prevention advertised recently for ten suicide prevention officers nationally.  Our assessment is that 40 are required, at least one per county and significantly more for larger counties such as Dublin, Galway and more populous areas.  Has the organisation done an analysis on the cost of mental health versus the funds allocated to it, including indirect costs such as the impact on affected families in terms of reduced output and what may be termed "presenteeism"?</p></speech>

My problem is that coming last, most of the questions have already been asked.  Suicide is my main concern.  Every family in this country has some experience of suicide.  I am concerned about whether the money is going to the right place.  As Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor outlined, there are so many agencies around the country but I wonder whether the money is going to the right agencies.  A total of &euro;90 million has been spent on mental health in the past three years.  In fairness to the primary care centres, they are doing a fantastic job.  Most of the money has gone towards the replacement of staff.  I refer to social workers, psychiatrists and occupational therapists.  They are very important people in combatting mental health issues.  The Government is taking mental health very seriously and has ring-fenced &euro;35 million for next year.</p><p>  Two weeks ago in my area of Dundalk the son of a family who contacted me was knocked down by a car and there is nothing they could do about it.  If people are suffering from mental health problems and are thinking about taking their own lives, I am sure there must be some early indications.</p> <p>This is something we can prevent.  Is the money going to the right places?  Is it following the patients?  The money allocated is considerable.  Some &euro;90 million has been allocated in three years, &euro;35 million is to be allocated for  2015 and I hope that the Government allocates more.  Are we doing enough to help prevent suicide?</p></speech>

When one sees it all presented in this way it is very shocking.  I want to make one point regarding the shortage of doctors and particularly nurses.  I find this hard to understand that there is such a shortage of nurses when nurses are emigrating to find work.  I know nurses who could not get employment here.  I find it difficult to get my head around that</p><p>  I have only one question to put to the delegates.  In terms of A Vision for Change, is the situation getting better, standing still or is it getting worse?  When people come to my clinic, as they would call to other members' clinic, I find I am getting stressed trying to access services on their behalf.  I can only imagine what that does to the people who suffer from mental illnesses.</p></speech>

Senator Colm Burke asked where the staff shortages are but I do not have exact figures with me.  He asked me a number of questions around figures and I would be happy to forward them to him after the meeting as I do not have all those figures with me.  The staffing numbers, to which we refer when we mention a shortfall are the numbers that were developed by the expert group.  In all of the international information on good practice that is available, there are not necessarily figures indicting that X number of  doctors, social workers or occupational therapists are needed because it depends very much on the population, its needs, specific make-up in terms of, say, disadvantage and its age profile.  We have a particularly young population and we might need more child and adolescent mental health services than other jurisdictions.  It is not easy to do a straight like-for-like comparison in terms of this is what is provided elsewhere and this is what we should have.  What we have is what the expert group came up with.  This is the expert group appointed in 2014 to develop the mental health policy.  It gave its considered and consensus views on what the staffing levels should be, and that is what we are working off now.</p><p>  The percentage of the health budget that goes to mental health services in Ireland is still only about half of the percentage of the health budget that goes to mental health services in the UK.  We must recognise that we are coming from a very long legacy of decline in spending on mental health services.  In the 1980s, 13% of the health budget was spent on mental health and it is now down to 6% or 6.5%.  I would have to check the most budget and once we have the HSE service plan for next year we will have a clear indication of where it is at for 2015.  We still have a long way to go and for all the reasons I outlined earlier it has been very difficult to get an increase in spending because of the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.  </p><p>  Deputy Colm Burke wanted to know whether the difficulties in recruiting the staff arises from action not being taken by the HSE or from it not being able to recruit.  It is a combination of both.  On the one hand, the HSE has been very slow in deciding where it wants to spend the money.  We know it is only as of September of this year that it was able to say that this is exactly where it wants to spend the 2014 allocation.  We hope they will be in a much better position to know where it wants to spend the funding for 2015 but that is the third successive year the funding has been delayed, in part because the Health Service Executive has been slow to determine where to spend it.  On the other hand, we have to take account of whether the recruitment package is attractive enough to get people into the service.  That is a wider issue across the health service.  </p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked the reason we would have a shortfall of nurses but psychiatric or mental health nursing is a specialist discipline.  We need people who are particularly trained in mental health nursing and, generally speaking, it has been difficult to recruit nurses.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne wanted to know if there are any private agency nurses involved.  My understanding is that to make up deficits agency nurses are used, but I do not know the extent of that at this time.  I do not have a breakdown of that.  We would have to go to the HSE to get a breakdown of the where we are at in terms of the waiting lists in the counselling and primary care service but if that would be helpful, we would be happy to seek that information.  The Deputy wanted information on the fact that the majority of people who take their own life will have seen a health professional.  I would have to double check that.  I believe it comes from research carried out by the National Suicide Research Foundation but I will confirm that because I would like to be sure of the information I am providing.</p><p>  I would agree with the Deputy that as we have travelled around the country, and we hold four public meetings every year to make sure we are hearing what is happening to individuals trying to access services and their family members, we have heard of good services being provided and the difference a good service makes.  Where an individual has good access to a mental health nurse in terms of having their telephone number and being able to ring them whenever they are concerned, or where the mental health nurse gives a family member their telephone number directly so that they can access that kind of follow-on support after discharge from hospital, that is very valuable and appreciated and can work very effectively to keep well and out of hospital.  I agree with the Deputy on that.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked for some specific information, which I would be happy to provide at a later date.  The numbers in A Vision for Change were set out by the experts involved in developing the policy, therefore, that is the basis upon which we are saying that there is a shortfall of psychiatrists.  However, there is scope for looking at those numbers again with regard to Ireland's population to see if they need to be improved upon.  The Senator asked about routine procedures referral by general practitioners into mental health services and the waiting period in that regard; I hope I am correct that this is what he asked.  To clarify, if someone goes to a GP with an addiction they will not be referred to mental health services because there is a separation of services in Ireland between mental health and addiction services.  That is a difficulty in that many people with mental health difficulties also have addiction issues that need to be addressed.  That is something that needs to be examined.</p><p>  In the adult mental health services I believe the target  being worked towards in terms of people being seen is 12 weeks.  That can be seen on the HSE's published information on its performance monitoring reports.  It is working towards a target of 12 weeks, which is the reason it seems to take a long time to get access.  However, this is the first time we have had a target and we need to consider now whether that target will be adequate.  When a GP refers someone into a specialist mental health service he or she generally has significant concerns about that individual because only people with severe mental health difficulties are referred to the mental health services.</p> <p>On the other hand, we need to provide more support to GPs in order that they feel more capable of responding and providing mental health support to individuals, both those at risk of developing a more severe mental health difficulty and those with mild to moderate difficulties.  We are looking to some of the clinical care programmes being developed in the HSE to improve the supports to be provided to GPs.  For instance, there are plans for an early intervention in a psychosis clinical programme within the HSE.  A key function of that programme is to improve the consultancy support for GPs in order that where they are concerned that someone might be developing psychosis, they are quicker to refer the person to the mental health services but are also more able to provide a range of supports.  The early intervention psychosis programme has been discussed for a couple of years and it needs to be implemented.</p><p> I think I have answered the question from Deputy Mitchell O'Connor about the waiting list for adult services.  With regard to the number of suicide prevention organisations that have arisen in response to suicide in local communities, there is a difficulty with the co-ordination of those activities.  We are looking to the new suicide prevention - what I hope will be a mental well-being framework as well - to address better co-ordination of the local initiatives on suicide prevention.  It is widely recognised that while people initiate local programmes out of very sincere desire to improve the situation, there will be a better impact overall if those supports are co-ordinated throughout the country.  We need to see in the new suicide prevention framework what specific actions will be taken by the National Office for Suicide Prevention to improve the co-ordination of those initiatives.</p><p> On the question of why support groups might not be available, co-ordination would help with that.  With the launch of the Little Things campaign - I am wearing a Little Things badge today - the Samaritans have a phone number which is 116123 for people to call which has been provided to the Samaritans by the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  This is a way of getting the message out to the public that there is a centralised highly skilled service available for individuals who are feeling like they are in danger of harming themselves.  This initiative will be helpful.</p><p> In reply to Senator MacSharry about out-of-hours social worker access, the mental health policy sets out that every community mental health team should have a 24-7 intervention arrangement.  It does not specify what that arrangement should look like.  We consider it should be a combination of the seven day a week day hospital with telephone access to acute wards with good family education in order that families will know how to respond to a person in crisis, as well as home treatment in order that families are supported by intensive home treatment where a family member is going through a crisis period.  Those are some of the components we would expect to see in a 24-7 service.</p><p> With regard to the ten suicide prevention officers being recruited, I do not have the exact number of existing suicide prevention officers but these ten would be additional-----</p></speech>

The funds specifically allocated to mental health are approximately &euro;700 million.  A significant disparity exists.  I refer to an initiative undertaken in the UK which we have not considered as yet in this country where it has been decided that mental health needs to be given parity of esteem with physical health in allocating the budget.  That issue has not even been broached in this country but in the UK they have grasped the nettle and decided that the only way to address the decades of underspending on mental health is by having a concerted effort to have parity of esteem on spending.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked whether the funding for suicide prevention is going to the right agencies.  My reply to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor links in with that question in the sense that we need better co-ordination of the funding on suicide prevention and we need it to be going to evidence-based interventions on suicide prevention.  We need to see that change coming out of the new suicide prevention framework.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked about the strategy, A Vision for Change, and whether we are getting better, getting worse or standing still.  I am very hesitant to call it in that way because we have a very disparate system where parts of the system are moving forward and parts of the system are falling backwards.  Those parts of the system that are moving forward are still scattered and are still in some ways the exception rather than the rule.  The number of services which provide home treatment are still in the minority.  I refer to the number of services adopting a recovery orientated progressive approach and which are reaching out and pushing social inclusion for people with mental health difficulties, but these services are in the minority.  While those services are to be commended on how they are driving things forward, it needs to be much more consistent throughout the country.  We also need to remember that there are particular disadvantaged communities who have received very little attention to date in A Vision for Change.  When I say disadvantaged I mean people with intellectual disability for whom the services have not been given attention since A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  I am talking about people from ethnic minority groups and I include the Traveller community for whom the services recommended in A Vision for Change have not been given attention.  I refer to people with eating disorders where the eating disorder service has not yet seen any significant developments since the publication of A Vision for Change.  My overall assessment is that I commend those areas where it is doing better because in every place where it is doing better there are individuals who are getting a good quality service and it is making a real difference to their lives.  I would not rest easy, however, until everyone in the country has that level of service.</p></speech>

Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, the director general of the HSE is also present along with his colleagues from the executive.</p><p> I updated the committee last week on how we were dealing with the threat of Ebola.  The risk to Ireland is considered very low but we are maintaining high levels of preparedness.  We continue to plan and prepare at a national level while engaging at an EU and international level to contribute to and participate in the planning and preparedness process.</p><p> Before I continue with my prepared script, I will share one reflection.  As someone who has been in the job for about three months, what has been very interesting to me is to compare the health service in which I used to work seven or eight years ago with the one of which I am, at least nominally, now in charge.  The focus in health tends always to be on the things that are going wrong, whether it is the number of people on trolleys or waiting lists, gaps in services or difficulties with eligibility.  I expect, for obvious reasons, that this committee meeting today will focus on those things that are going wrong.  That is fair enough.  I point out, however, a few things that are going right and things that have really improved in the health service since I wore a white coat and stethoscope.</p><p> To mention a few of them, there are the national clinical programmes led by Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, who is present , and the improvements are phenomenal in areas such as stroke and acute coronary syndrome.  People get treatment for their heart attacks or strokes very quickly.  There is also the stroke programme.  A person's life is saved every day who would have died when I was a doctor, not because I was a doctor but because health care was different in those days.  In addition, every day a person who would have become disabled does not become disabled because of our stroke programme.  That is just one example of such programmes.</p><p> We have HIQA inspections.  While they can be very annoying for staff who can find them unfair, I have no doubt that standards have been raised because we inspect and investigate things now that would not have been investigated in the past.  We need to realise, when we hear about HIQA inspections in the news and when HIQA highlights bad things, that is in some ways a reflection on an improving health service.  Such issues would have gone uninspected and unreported ten or fifteen years ago and would not have been acted upon.</p><p> We have greater access to health care free at the point of use than ever before.  Two million people have medical cards or a doctor visit card.  That is more than was ever the case.</p><p> In respect of hospital acquired infections, MRSA rates are falling and have been at their lowest rate for quite a number of years.  That is reflected in the fact that we do not talk about MRSA very much any more whereas we used to when it was an enormous problem years ago.  It still is a problem but not to the extent it was.</p><p> We have more day surgery than ever before.  We have reduced the length of stay.  People who go to hospital are spending less time in hospital.  To give the committee one example of that, people who go to hospital with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, which in the old days was bronchitis or emphysema, used to spend on average nine days in the hospital.  They now spend about seven and a half days in hospital because they can be discharged to the community and have nurses visit them initially after discharge and check on their care.</p><p> Notwithstanding the marked deterioration that has occurred in recent months, waiting times and trolley numbers are still better than they were in 2011, when the Government changed.</p><p> We have the air ambulance, which is a huge improvement, especially for the west and the midlands, in getting people to hospital quickly.  That did not exist in the past.</p><p> We have a very good story to tell on transplants.  Ireland is moving up the league table in terms of transplants done.  Today, Ireland will perform its 100th lung transplant in the Mater hospital.  I want to recognise the CEO of the hospital, Professor Mary Day, and also the director of organ donation there, Professor Jim Egan, for the work they do.  In a country with very high levels of cystic fibrosis, in particular, having a lung transplant programme is very important.  Similarly, when it comes to renal disease and kidneys, we are one of the few countries in the world that has more people who have had a kidney transplant than are on dialysis.  That is a remarkable achievement.</p><p> Also, and it is the final good thing I am going to talk about before I talk about all the bad things, we are seeing real improvements in patient transfer, for example, in getting patients from a smaller or regional hospital to a national centre.  When I was a junior doctor, if I had to transfer a patient from Navan to Dublin, for example, I would go in the ambulance.  I would be a rather junior doctor, not very experienced, but I would be going with the patient, probably for several hours, to get the patient from Navan to the Mater or wherever they were going, and then I would go back in the ambulance or by taxi.  Not only did that mean the patient had a relatively junior doctor travelling with him or her, it also meant the hospital was down a doctor for half the day.  That was quite a dangerous thing, particularly on a Saturday, Sunday or bank holiday.  The hospital could be run by one or two doctors for the best part of a day.  With neonates and paediatrics, that is no longer the case.  Last week, a new paediatric transfer service was put into place.  If a child is being transferred from a regional hospital to one of the two national centres, there is now a dedicated team whose main job is to go in the ambulance, pick up the child, provide them with the care they need from the moment they get into the ambulance, and take that child to the national centre.  At no point is any hospital denuded of their core staff because a patient needs to be transferred.</p><p> Dare I say it, those are ten examples of how the health service has improved since the days when I worked in it.</p><p> It is just over 100 days since I was appointed Minister for Health.  On my appointment, I said my first priority was a realistic budget and I believe we achieved that with our budget allocation in 2015, which has an increase in the exchequer allocation of more than &euro;300 million when compared with the 2014 allocation and more than &euro;500 million when compared with the ceiling that had been planned for 2015.  Alongside the increase in this allocation, we have also identified one-off additional income measures of &euro;330 million and savings of a further &euro;130 million in procurement, medicine and agency staff .  Combined, this means the HSE has in excess of &euro;750 million more to fund services than it did when it was preparing its 2014 service plan, roughly this time last year.</p><p> The cycle of cuts in health care has come to an end.  As I said on the night of the budget, we have secured a welcome but modest increase in the total financial resources available to the HSE, which is for the first time in seven years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300011#O00300"><p>The 2015 budget is challenging, but its targets are achievable.  We are entering a two-year process in which we aim to stabilise the budget and allow for existing service levels to continue, along with some enhancements in targeted areas.</p><p>  Members of the committee will know, as much as I do, that despite the additional spending power, next year is still going to be a real challenge.  There are major cost pressures.  We have a rising population and within that we have an increasing number of older people, particularly very elderly people.  Our achievements in developing new medicines and treatments also come with higher bills attached.  Our progress in diagnosing and screening for cancers and chronic diseases means more people require those treatments.  We know our responsibilities in addressing these needs but we must also recognise the additional resource demands that are going to come with that.</p><p>  Management of health spending within available resources will require an exceptional management focus with strict adherence by all services and budget holders to their allocations.  It is important we are clear that where we identify further savings or efficiencies, we will now have the capacity and scope to reinvest those savings back into the health service rather than giving them up to service a debt or reduce a deficit.  That is a key message I want front-line staff and managers to understand.  From now on, savings made in our health services go back into health services; they do not go to pay down debt or to reduce a deficit.  If we can exceed our savings targets, that is more money for services.  It will not go back to the central Exchequer.</p><p>  The progress we have made as a country in dealing with the legacy of the global financial crisis has empowered us to take more control of our resources in the health service.  This does not just apply to financial resources.  We will also have more autonomy with regard to staffing and human resources, following the announcement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin on the public sector recruitment embargo.  With greater autonomy and capacity to reuse our savings for services comes a greater responsibility for cost containment and cost avoidance.</p><p>  As a country, we took very tough decisions in our health services, just as we did in education and a range of other things.  Tough decisions still have to be made in terms of managing resources, addressing performance and ensuring accountability, but the difference now is that those decisions will yield benefits we can use to improve our health services. For this reason, we are focusing on an improved accountability framework in 2015 in order that our hard-earned flexibility will not go to waste and people and patients will benefit from our economic progress.  We are also continuing the reform programme because improving structures through, for example, hospital groups, helps staff in the health services to do a better job.</p> <p>Better structures empower people who can then deliver better care.  Reform is not just an end in itself but a valuable tool which helps us do more with the additional resources we now have.</p><p> Our budget is patient centred.  We have frozen hospital and prescription charges for next year and no adjustments will be made to the drugs payment scheme threshold or eligibility for medical cards.  With the patient in mind, we will deliver on GP care for those under six and those aged over 70 once we come to an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation.  Once this is achieved, for the first time in our history more than half the population will have access to GP services without fees.  I see this as the first step to universal health care, which is seen as the norm and a right throughout the western world but, for some reason, is still controversial in this country.</p><p> We have also allocated specific funding to deal with delayed discharges because these involve citizens, mainly elderly people who have earned the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and because it improves health outcomes when discharges from hospital are timely.  We have also set aside further money for mental health, approximately &euro;35 million in 2015, and we will extend BreastCheck to women aged 65 to 69 years.</p><p> As part of the two-year process starting in 2015, the spending ceiling for 2016 will increase by a further &euro;174 million.  This does not mean we are awash with cash, but it does make the funding situation in the health service more manageable, knowing that budgets will increase each year.  I should also mention we have a capital allocation of &euro;382 million.  Members of the committee know we intend to progress five important capital programmes.  These are the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus site; the new mental health campus at Portrane, for which planning permission has been lodged; the national maternity hospital, which will move from Holles Street to St. Vincent's; the development of primary care centres, of which we are opening one a month at present; and additional community nursing homes for our rising population.</p><p> We also plan to invest in information communications technology, where existing systems and the level of integration are not appropriate to a health service of our scale and complexity.  Better facilities and better IT systems benefit patients and their families.  They help improve health outcomes and they help our staff do a better job.  They are not just an investment in computers and software but an investment in our staff, our people and our shared future.</p><p> The next step in the process is for the HSE to develop a service plan which will set out the volume and type of health services to be provided in 2015 within the agreed allocation.  With the return of the Vote to the Department for 2015, working closely with our colleagues in the HSE, the Department will be able to better monitor budgets and spending.  This is part of the improved accountability framework I mentioned earlier.  Once the service planning process has been concluded, the HSE will publish it and we will immediately set to work on ensuring it is fully implemented from January next year.</p><p> In his opening statement, Mr. Tony O'Brien will address some specific issues about which the committee may wish to hear.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Mr. Fergal Goodman on his appointment.  Before I call Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the Health Service Executive, I congratulate Mr. Barry O'Brien on his new appointment and thank him for his courtesy to the committee and the Oireachtas.  I wish him well.  In his opening remarks I ask Mr. Tony O'Brien to refer to the HSE report on Positive Action.  Will the report come before the committee?  I believe it should.  What are Mr. O'Brien's plans for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300012#P00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his remarks on Mr. Barry O'Brien, who will be sadly missed at the HSE.  I will certainly pass on the Chairman's remarks, which I know Mr. O'Brien will appreciate.  He is going to UCC so he will be near to where the Chairman has other interests.</p><p>  I am joined by Ms Laverne McGuinness, Dr. Aine Carroll, Dr. Tony O&rsquo;Connell, Mr. John Hennessy and Mr. Pat Healy.</p><p>  The committee requested information and replies on a number of issues prior to the meeting and committee members have received responses, so I will confine my remarks to some of the key areas.</p><p>  The latest performance assurance report for August is about to be published.  It will show hospital emergency departments continued to be very busy during the month.  The cumulative increase in the number of emergency or unscheduled admissions in 2014 compared with same period last year is just over 5,000, or 1.9%.  As a result of increased emergency admissions, elective admissions for the same period have reduced by 3,700, or 5%, and this has had a knock-on effect on the number of people on waiting lists.  The capacity of acute hospitals to respond to increased demand is reduced due to the number of patients who are medically fit for discharge and who are awaiting alternative arrangements.  The Minister touched on this issue.  At the end of August, 704 people awaited alternative care arrangements.  Acute hospitals and the older persons service are working collaboratively to address this issue.</p><p>  The number of home help hours provided to the end of August was 6.8 million, and home care packages are 20% above expected levels.  At the end of August, 82% of adults, or 39,743 people, were waiting less than eight months for a scheduled procedure and 18%, or 8,692 people, were waiting more than eight months.  Outpatient attendances are 25.1% ahead of the expected target with 2.14 million attendances recorded for the first eight months of the year.  The National Ambulance Service recorded an increase in emergency calls of approximately 1,000 calls each month.  Notwithstanding this, improvement in response times continue to be made, with ECHO calls reaching the target of 75.3% and DELTA response to calls improving from 64% to 67%.  A total of 94% of specialist palliative care inpatient beds were provided within seven days of referral.</p><p>  Despite the demographic and other service pressures which drive costs, the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2012 report shows that of the six Government Departments or agencies which generally required a Supplementary Estimate between 2008 and 2012, the health service had the lowest average annual supplementary at 1.3%, compared with a range of 1.7% to 7.1% for the other five, none of which operates in as complex an area as health.  Similarly, despite much adverse media and other comment, over the period 2008 to 2013, the HSE received just 0.19%, or &euro;137 million, in Supplementary Estimates related to its core services.  In other words, it was 99.8% compliant with the available budget over the period.  It received 0.63%, or &euro;452 million in Supplementary Estimates related to medical cards, GMS drugs and demand-led schemes.  This indicates it was 99.4% compliant with the available budget over the period despite these primary care reimbursement service areas not being within the sole control of the HSE, by virtue of being demand led.  A total of 71% of the total Supplementary Estimates were related to Exchequer or technical items which do not reflect health service financial performance.</p><p>  Within the overall 2014 projected deficit, the acute hospital section is expected to have a net deficit after application of held funding of &euro;273 million by year end.  To put this in context, hospitals had a deficit of approximately &euro;180 million at the end of 2013.  It was only possible for us to deal with approximately &euro;100 million of this in setting the budgets for 2014, leaving an ongoing underlying problem of approximately &euro;80 million.  Hospital costs have grown by approximately &euro;80 million, or just over 2%, against a &euro;4 billion cost base in 2014.  This is at or below the growth in the workload of the hospitals.  Bed days used and day cases increased by between 1.8% to 3%.  As I mentioned, total emergency admissions increased by 1.9%, with the number of very elderly patients, those aged over 85 years, up 4.5%.  Medical agency and clinical non-pay costs, including drugs and medical supplies, have risen the most within this.  Hospital pay and non-pay budgets were reduced by &euro;115 million in 2014.  Therefore the &euro;80 million incoming problem, plus the &euro;80 million cost growth linked to activity, plus the &euro;115 million in budget cuts this year accounted for the current &euro;275 million projected deficit for 2014.  In light of the budget announcements last week, we are working to finalise the service plan for 2015, which we expect to submit to the Minister by mid-November.</p><p>  Preparedness for Ebola was the subject of a specific meeting last week.  As committee members are aware, the overall risk of a case of Ebola being imported into Ireland is low, and while there has been no case of Ebola in Ireland to date, we are preparing for the eventuality that we will have a case at some stage.</p> <p>Our preparation includes Ireland's representation on the European Union health security committee, which was set up to co-ordinate health threats at EU level.  Officials from the Department of Health attend and participate at the committee.  The HSE emerging viral threats planning and co-ordination, EVT, group is focusing on the co-ordination of operational response plans for the HSE.  An operational response subgroup of the main EVT group includes representation from emergency management, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, public health, general practice and acute hospitals.  The purpose of the subgroup is to ensure co-ordination of operational response plans, whether the patient presents in primary care or acute hospital settings.  The HPSC produces up-to-date information on Ebola for the public and health professionals.  This information includes extensive guidance for health professionals, hospitals, general practitioners and laboratories.  There is also extensive information on travel advice for the public and a range of other information.  Personal protective equipment in line with HPSC guidance is in place in hospitals and we have in place procedures for the urgent re-stocking of hospitals where required.  We have also distributed PPE to GPs as an additional measure.  Specific ambulance protocols are in place for the appropriate inter-hospital transfer of an Ebola patient throughout hospitals.  We are linking in with international colleagues daily with respect to new or revised guidelines on PPE and all other matters.  It is important to emphasise this is a dynamic process.</p><p> We have a national isolation unit located at the Mater hospital in Dublin.  It is the national referral centre for high-risk suspected and confirmed cases of viral haemorrhagic fever, such as Ebola, and other serious infectious diseases.  The national virus laboratory is fully equipped to diagnose Ebola in the event of a case appearing here.  The HSE is briefing staff representative organisations and a wider set of stakeholders on Ebola preparedness.  The HPSC continues to monitor the situation closely and, together with our emergency management and response functions, will remain at a heightened level of activity until this crisis is over.  The HSE is considering options for how to support the countries and the people most acutely affected by this outbreak.</p><p> It is important I should make clear that the HSE has no policy in respect of the manipulation of waiting lists.  The HSE would never condone any such action.  Had the HSE been aware that any manager urged employees to manipulate waiting lists, if indeed this ever happened, it would be the subject of appropriate disciplinary action.  The HSE recently called on the Sunday newspaper in question to release the document or alternatively to furnish us with some of the necessary detail.  To date, the HSE has not received any information from the newspaper to validate what it has alleged.  We suggest it is neither just nor equitable that the Sunday newspaper failed to contact the HSE prior to publishing the article.  Had it done so, it would have allowed us to bring a modicum of balance to an otherwise one-sided article.  We consider it unreasonable that the Sunday newspaper chooses not to release some elementary detail of the alleged internal document when requested.  If it were to do so, it would allow us to deal with many questions posed to us in an objective manner.  Again, we call on the newspaper in question to release the document or, alternatively, to furnish us with some of the necessary detail.  If no such document exists, we call on the newspaper to state as much and withdraw the allegations.</p><p> We announced recently the appointment of six new hospital group chief executives.  These appointments are in addition to the appointment of Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, chief executive of the children's hospital group, who has been in post since last November.  The establishment of these groups is a fundamental modernisation of our health system in line with best international practice.  The six new chief executives will report to Dr. Tony O'Connell, national director, acute hospitals.  They are: Ms Mary Day, Ireland east; Mr. Bill Maher, RCSI hospitals group, also known as Dublin north-east; Dr. Susan O'Reilly, Dublin midlands group; Ms Colette Cowan, University of Limerick hospitals; Mr Gerry O'Dwyer, south and south-west hospitals group; and Mr. Maurice Power, on an acting basis, for the west and north-west hospitals group, which has recently re-styled itself as Saolta.</p><p> The hospital group chief executives will lead their respective groups through the next phase of implementation as they develop strategic plans to describe how they will provide safe, high-quality care in a cost-effective manner.  The reorganisation of public hospitals into groups is designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients.  I acknowledge in particular the willingness and commitment of each of the individuals for taking on these challenges.  I thank Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly in particular for her significant and remarkable contribution to the development of our cancer services.  I know she will bring the same determination and commitment to her new role as group chief executive.  She will be succeeded by Dr. Jerome Coffey on an interim basis.</p><p> We published the Community Healthcare Organisations report recently which sets out how health services outside of acute hospitals will be organised and managed.  Community health care services include primary care; social care, which includes services for older persons and persons with a disability; mental health; and health and well-being.  More than half of our total spend on operational services in 2014 has been in this sector.  The sector is significant and the reform of these structures will facilitate a move towards a more integrated health care system.  This will improve services for the public by providing better and easier access to services, services that are close to where people live, more local decision-making and services in which people can have confidence.</p><p> The new governance and organisation structures being put in place to enable this type of integrated care will include the establishment of nine community health care organisations, CHOs, which are the best fit to deliver an integrated model of care.  They will see the development of 90 primary care networks, averaging a 50,000 population, with each CHO having an average of ten such networks.  The reform of social care, mental health and health and well-being services will better serve local communities through this process.  Following the publication of the report, an intensive communication and engagement process has been under way, including feedback to all those who contributed to the process.  Members will be aware we provided two briefing sessions in this precinct last week.  A national steering group will oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations, the first step being the appointment of chief officers, with a view to their taking up responsibility by no later than the beginning of January.</p><p> The extensive process undertaken over the past 12 months by the HSE along with our section 38 agency colleagues to reach compliance with Government pay policy is in the final stages of nearing completion.  All recommendations made in the HSE internal audit report have been rigorously addressed and are being concluded.  A final report on the measures taken to address the issues and recommendations in the internal audit report is being finalised for consideration by me and the leadership team and, as previously advised, it will be made available to the committee, it is hoped by the end of October.</p><p> Positive Action is a section 39 agency.  It is important to emphasise that section 39 agencies are distinctly different from section 38 agencies as they are not directly bound by the Department of Health consolidation salary scales.  While employees of section 39 agencies are not members of a public sector pension scheme in the way section 38 agencies are, those agencies are expected to have due regard to overall Government pay policy in respect of their senior managers.  A process to verify and validate the remuneration templates on section 39 agencies commenced this year with a priority focus on the large agencies.  Details of the organisations in receipt of &euro;3 million annually were provided to members at a previous meeting.  We continue our work with these agencies as part of the service arrangement process to address the issues raised in the review.  A new enhanced service arrangement is being finalised and its implementation will ensure a more enhanced process from 2015 onwards.</p><p> There has been reportage concerning a finalised internal audit report on Positive Action which has been provided to me and is awaiting consideration by our management team.  I emphasise that Positive Action is a section 39 agency.  It is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In this context I will be perfectly happy, once it has been cleared legally for release, for the HSE to provide it to this committee, as requested.  Although Positive Action is no longer in existence, the community it served, those infected with hepatitis C, still have access to other agencies that we continue to fund.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing some of the meeting.  I was speaking in the D&aacute;il on water services and I imagine those present were listening to me with interest.  I read the Minister's opening address and I was present for Mr. O'Brien's presentation.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the fact he is now 100 days in office.  We wish him well in this regard.  This is my first opportunity to do so at a committee meeting with HSE representatives present as well.  They are two sides of the one coin, and I do not mean that in a disrespectful manner.</p> <p>I become concerned when I listen to the official replies to questions on the current provision of health care.  While I do not expect Health Service Executive officials to be self-critical or critically analyse their organisation, it is clear that some areas of the health service are severely deficient.  The pressure on emergency departments is one example, as is health service employees protesting outside health care facilities because patient safety is being compromised.  Front-line staff are professionals and consistently advocate on behalf of patients.  They believe patient safety is being compromised in emergency departments.  The representatives of the HSE should take into account the views expressed by their employees, rather than lightly dismiss them, as sometimes occurs. <br/>Mr. O'Brien referred to a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>which alleged manipulation of waiting lists and denied any memorandum had been issued by the Health Service Executive.  Is he satisfied that a full trawl of HSE information technology services has been carried out and all correspondence between area managers and others checked?  Is he certain that there is no such memorandum in the HSE's information technology services?  <br/>I received a large number of redacted letters from the Cavan area which were written, I presume, by a general practitioner.  While they might not have indicated official manipulation, they showed that the Health Service Executive had been referring patients from its outpatient waiting lists to private health care providers.  These patients subsequently rejoin the waiting lists.  When their names are included in a waiting list for a second time, are they placed at the bottom of the list or at the point at which they were referred initially?  It is critically important to establish the position in this regard.  If it is the case that such persons rejoin the lists as new patients, it would indicate manipulation of waiting lists.  Patients who have been waiting for a long period for an outpatient appointment are referred to a private service provider.  While I have no ideological problem with this practice, the issue is whether they subsequently rejoin the waiting list as new patients.  If that were to be the case, it would indicate that the figures were being manipulated because the person concerned would have to wait to have the same procedure carried out.  What is the official view of this practice, about which I have major concerns?<br/>There is considerable merit in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>story about waiting lists, which are a key political priority.  The Health Service Executive has been under severe pressure on this issue.  It has been consistently pointed out that the numbers waiting to have procedures carried out as outpatients are increasing.  We have been informed time and again, however, that this was not a major concern because 250,000 people attended outpatient clinics each month.  There is a crisis in waiting lists.  This continues to be a major problem.<br/>A couple of months ago I received a letter from the orthopaedic department of the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital informing me that one of my constituents who was on an urgent waiting list would, happily, be given an appointment two and a half years hence.  I will circulate the letter to the Minister and Mr. O'Brien to give them an idea of what is happening.  The lady in question is crawling around in agony.  I do not wish to be alarmist, but I am not the only Deputy who has received letters of this nature.  Many others have received similar letters.  This is a major problem and rather than dancing along the surface and pretending everything is all right, the HSE must acknowledge it and not only because we have a new Minister.  I hope the Minister will assess and address the problems in the health service in a realistic manner because what we had on some previous occasions can best be described as camouflage. <br/>Patients are waiting 15 weeks to have an assessment made under the fair deal scheme.  Why are assessments taking longer than in previous years?  Given that the scheme does not apply retrospectively, I am beginning to take the view that the reason for the delays is to kick payments into the subsequent calendar year.  The Health Service Executive is under pressure as a result of the wholly insufficient budget it received last year, as was well documented in the committee's discussions at the time.  Why is it more difficult to assess a person now than it was in previous years?  Has something changed, other than the fact that there is no money available at the end of the process?  The process is being delayed until such time as the expenditure can be moved into the subsequent accounting year. <br/>Representatives of the Mental Health Forum came before us this morning to discuss progress on mental health services, including child and adolescent services and other pressure points.  In acknowledging the work being done and advances being made in certain areas, they were highly critical of the level of progress made in some other areas.  We must address the underlying difficulties in the mental health service.  It appears that a sum of &euro;35 million which has been ring-fenced for mental health services cannot be spent because I have been hearing about it for three years.  I have also heard about difficulties in the recruitment of personnel and delays in interview processes.  These delays seem to be never ending.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to comment. <br/>The Minister boasts that the Government has frozen prescription charges, whereas the programme for Government refers to their abolition.  The Government has a long way to go to achieve its objective on prescription charges. <br/>Yesterday I received a telephone call from a councillor in County Roscommon informing me that dental surgery for children in the county had been cancelled.  Is that correct?  It would be very alarming if it were to be the case.  I am referring to cases involving children who require surgery under anaesthetic.  The councillor in question was informed that his son would not have surgery. <br/>We have been hearing for three years that addressing the problem of 700 patients staying in acute hospitals unnecessarily is a priority.  How does the Minister propose to address this issue and move patients from hospital care into community or home care settings?</p></speech>

I will prioritise a number of areas, focusing initially on maternity policy in the Health Service Executive.  In the reply to my question for this quarterly meeting the Minister indicated that the Department and the Health Service Executive were working on a new maternity strategy.  The Department commissioned a review of national and international literature on the issue, which has been completed and is informing the development of a maternity services policy paper.  The reply indicates that the Minister will establish a high level working group to assist in finalising the strategy.  When will the working group be established and when will the strategy be finalised?  Is this a priority for the Department?  If, as I hope, it is, will he indicate when he expects the strategy to be published?</p><p>  I also note that, as part of the outworking of this process, interviews and discussions will take place with staff across maternity services units, of which there are 19 in the State.  A range of site visits is also planned.  Will, as I hope, all obstetric units be visited or will only some of them be visited?  If the latter is the case, which units will be visited?  Will nurses and midwives in each obstetric setting visited be included in the engagement on the new maternity strategy?  </p><p>  The Minister stated the Health Service Executive continued to implement all recommendations in both the HIQA Galway report and the HSE Galway report.  All of the obstetric units were invited to self-assess against the recommendations contained in the HIQA reports.  The self-assessment has been completed and the HSE will shortly survey all hospitals to review progress made in responding to the initial self-assessment, which will be evaluated against the recommendations contained in both reports that followed the death of Savita Halappanavar.</p> <p>When will the surveying of all hospital sites get under way?  Is there a timeframe for its completion?<br/>As we have heard, the Health Service Executive is continuing to implement all of the recommendations made in the two Galway reports.  I submitted a question about the recommendations made in the report on the tragic loss of baby Jamie Flynn who was born in Cavan General Hospital in November 2012.  The response I have been given indicates that the Cavan-Monaghan hospital management team is in the process of commissioning a new external review team.  How long will it take before this new team is put in place to carry out a second investigation into this tragedy?  I have been told that family members are being kept updated.  That may well be the case, but I know that they are deeply distressed.  I have been given a list of measures being taken at Cavan General Hospital's obstetric unit.  It appears that five of them will address potential delays in accessing the theatre for emergency Caesarean sections and that three of them will strengthen clinical governance arrangements for women's and children's services.  Given that we had two further tragic outcomes in April this year, surely every identified improvement in systems and practices must be introduced.  Surely we do not have to wait for another report to be presented.  I seek clarity on the listed eight measures being introduced.  Are they reflective of the recommendations contained in the first report which was suppressed as a result of High Court action?  Regardless of the decision to suppress the first report, if the recommendations made in that report stand on merit and are self-evidently needed, I hope they will be implemented without question or delay.  A further report should not be needed to ensure these actions are taken.  I ask the Minister to expand on the position outlned in the response he has given.  Many women who are expecting and others who are planning to have children in the future are very concerned.  We have had three tragic outcomes, but we have had no public presentation of a report or recommendations.  We simply do not know what, if any, actions have been taken as a result of the recommendations contained in the first report.<br/>I would like to move on to the issue of mental health services.  With the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, we met representatives of Mental Health Reform earlier today.  I have commended the contribution of that organisation which has highlighted a number of serious deficiencies in mental health services.  Even though the programme for Government contains a commitment to &quot;ring fence &euro;35m annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services as outlined in A Vision for Change&quot;, just &euro;20 million was provided this year.  As I recall, it was previously indicated that this year's &euro;15 million shortfall would be added to the 2015 funding of &euro;35 million.  It has not been indicated or stated anywhere more recently that this will be done for the coming year.  I would like the position to be clarified.  Is it the case that the additional money promised in the previous commitment will not now be forthcoming?  We have been told that the &euro;20 million provided for the current year has not been and, most likely, will not be fully expended before the end of the year in the recruitment of the essential staff needed.<br/><b></b>I would like to make a final point about maternity services.  I wanted to ask several other questions.  The Minister gave me a response yesterday on the midwifery practice of a named, very well known and highly respected midwife.  I am not referring to her specific case.  I have received four e-mails this morning from some of the 29 women who have yet to have a midwife allocated to them to fill the vacancy created by the removal of cover from their first-choice midwife.  The pregnancies of some of these women is advanced and they are extremely concerned.  With respect, I do not think the suggestion made in the Minister's letter that the matter is receiving attention is enough.  The women concerned need to be advised about the availability of replacement midwives as a matter of extreme urgency.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to commit here this morning that this will be done.  There should be no further delay in having that need met.</p></speech>

It is difficult to comment sufficiently on everything covered by such a wide-ranging Department.  We have to hone it down.  </p><p>  I would like to develop some of the points raised by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I will concentrate almost exclusively on the issue of maternity care.  We have to accept that maternity care in Ireland is expensive and wasteful.  In many instances, it has proved to be damaging to maternal and foetal outcomes.  We have seen a number of tragic cases.  The approach to research in this area has not been based on evidence and we are at an absolutely critical juncture.  Some of these points have been made previously.  The country's rate of Caesarean sections is completely out of kilter with the rate in other countries.  Eight of the country's 19 maternity hospitals have recorded Caesarean rates of over 30%.  There is blanket use of electronic foetal monitoring in all units.  The level of Caesarean sections and unnecessary interventions can be attributed to the failure to deliver a nationwide strategy of midwife-led units as the best way forward.  The country's maternity practice - the combined model of ante-natal care, in which a woman gains access to a general practitioner and a consultant obstetrician - has not been reviewed for 60 years.  The GP aspect of the system alone costs approximately &euro;17 million.  If we were to stand this on its head by looking at having the service led by midwives, it would be far better for everybody.  All European and international countries came to that conclusion a long time ago and we are really behind the bar on this one.  The issue needs to be addressed now.</p><p>  While we cannot discuss the case of Philomena Canning and nobody is doing so, it has brought the issue centre-stage.  Every woman is supposed to have the right to access a home birth facility in a low-risk scenario.  The effect of the State's action - the HSE's decision to remove Philomena Canning's indemnity cover, which was made without explaining the matter to her or speaking to the two women involved - has been to leave 29 women without this option.  While we cannot discuss it, we can say that what happened next really shows the failure of the HSE in its duty of care to women.  As Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, there are 29 clients of Philomena Canning, one of whom was in touch with us this morning.  She is 35 weeks pregnant.  She was told last week, after five weeks of trying to get answers, that a replacement midwife had not been found for her and that she would, therefore, have to go to a hospital.  Another woman had to go to the Coombe Women's Hospital.  In four cases women had to privately access the British neighbourhood midwives scheme at a cost of thousands of euro to themselves.  Obviously, women who do not have private insurance cover could not envisage taking such action.</p> <p>The HSE was able to expend a huge amount of money on what, in some ways, was an unnecessary legal action.  During those court proceedings it was said that Philomena Canning would be allowed to continue under the supervision of another midwife.  Now they are saying to the people who have been left out that there are no other midwives to cater for those women.  Clearly, therefore, the evidence given in court must have been a little bit suspect, if that is the case and if no services can be provided.  We know that no services have been provided because the women have told us.</p><p> I would like the Minister to take note of the women's dossier outlining their concerns.  They wish to waive their anonymity and would be happy to have their stories told here.  I do not have enough time to do so, however, so I wish to give the Minister the dossier.  I think he will be crying at the end of it.  </p><p> Heavily pregnant women had developed a rapport with their midwives, which is the whole benefit of midwifery-led services.  It is highly traumatic for them to have their pregnancies interfered with in this way.  It is just not good enough, so I would like to see an inquiry into the HSE's handling of this matter.  I would like the Minister to tell us why the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is not involved in this matter.  It is the role of that board, rather than that of the HSE.  I am not sure why it has not been involved, but the situation is absolutely unacceptable.  I echo Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point that this matter needs to be dealt with now.  Those women are entitled to midwives.  If the State is saying they are not available here in Ireland, women should be entitled to access that service from Britain.  It should be paid for, because it is their entitlement.  The issue has not been dealt with appropriately since it emerged.</p><p> I wish to raise two other linked issues.  One is the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act, the guidelines for which we have seen since the last meeting.</p></speech>

As regards the panel of psychiatrists, what steps is the Minister taking to screen some of those people to ensure they will work within the legislation, given that about one third of psychiatrists in the State have signed a petition stating that they do not agree with the Act?  They do not agree that there are any circumstances in which a suicidal woman should be given access to an abortion.  Clearly, we could not have a situation in which those people would be involved in assessing such women.  I wonder what the Minister intends to do about that.</p><p>  Can he tell us anything more about his knowledge or involvement in the Y case, obviously in the context of information that he cannot divulge?  That case demonstrates that women do not have a right to access abortion in Ireland when their lives are in danger, so clearly the legislation is defective.</p><p>  My last point concerns the practice of symphysiotomy.  Given the fact that there is no real, meaningful oversight of clinical practice, there are a lot of discrepancies in the figures, including the number of symphysiotomies that were carried out.  The women involved have had difficulty in accessing those records.  What inquiries has the Minister made concerning allegations that a symphysiotomy was carried out in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, as recently as last year?  Has that been investigated?  It is only an allegation, but it is one that people believe to be true.  Given the abhorrent and criminal nature of the practice of symphysiotomy, an investigation is urgently required to ascertain whether this has taken place.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300016#T00700"><p>I will start with Deputy Kelleher's remarks.  The situation in emergency departments is variable.  We have roughly 50 emergency departments across the State.  In some, it is rare for patients to be on trolleys - St. Vincent's hospital is one example of that - while in others it is intermittent, but in certain hospitals it is almost always the case that there are large numbers of patients on trolleys.  It is not simply down to bed capacity; a lot of it is down to patient flow and bed management.</p><p>  Neither the Department of Health nor the HSE dismisses the concerns of staff in these emergency departments.  In fact, they are our staff and we take what they have to say seriously.  However, I do think we need to challenge the idea that it is always down to staff resources or bed capacity, because it is evidently not.  In one hospital, another 20 beds were opened quite recently and it solved the problem for a few weeks, but then all of a sudden the beds were all full again.</p><p>  I look at the numbers every day and it is a much more complex phenomenon than people make out.  It is remarkable that some hospitals seem to be capable of managing their emergency departments without having patients on trolleys, while others seem to be incapable of it no matter what supports they are given.  </p><p>  As regards the alleged manipulation of waiting lists, it is certainly the case that waiting lists are validated.  The HSE does make sure that people are not on two waiting lists for the same procedure, for example, and that people are still in the country.  Such things are done to ensure they are validated, and that is entirely appropriate in my view.  I have not seen the memo but I do understand that it may have been at regional level or at the level of a local manager.  In some ways that is reassuring, because it shows that certainly at national level in my Department and in the HSE there is no policy of manipulating waiting lists.  If we could see the memo it would allow us to take action against any manager at regional level who was clearly breaching policy.  The policy is that urgent cases are treated first and everyone else in chronological order.  I want to make that clear.</p><p>  Leaving that aside, the Deputy touched on a much more important issue - the fact that people are waiting far too long for procedures and appointments.  It is distressing that in a lot of areas - orthopaedics, for example - people are waiting for unacceptably long periods of up to two years.  That is something I hope to drill down into and understand better in the next few weeks.  While we may have great difficulty meeting the eight-month and 12-month targets, I really hope that next year we can do something to deal with those people who are waiting unbelievable lengths of time for treatment.  I think we all agree that that is unacceptable.</p><p>  On the Fair Deal scheme, there may well be delays in the assessment.  The Deputy is fundamentally correct in saying that the real problem with the Fair Deal scheme is that it is budget-capped, which is in the legislation.  It is not like medicines that have to be reimbursed or medical cards that happen to be issued if the person is entitled to them.  The entitlement to the Fair Deal scheme is budget-capped, and when the budget runs out that is part of the big problem.</p><p>  Prescription charges were introduced by the Deputy's party when it was in Government.  There is no commitment in the programme for Government to abolish prescription charges.  I would love to be able to do it, if we could - they bring in hundreds of millions of euro every year - but it is not within the current finances to be able to do that.  I certainly have not increased them, however, and do not intend to do so.</p><p>  The number of delayed discharges at the moment is 700, heading for 800, which is bad.  It is bad for the health service because it means that beds that should be used by other patients are not available.  It is also bad for the individuals whose discharge is delayed because they are more at risk of falls, infection and medication errors.  We have set aside a dedicated fund of &euro;25 million for the early part of next year to try to get a handle on delayed discharges.  There are lots of things that could be done, including step-down beds while people are waiting for the Fair Deal scheme, and enhanced home care packages to get them home with a higher level of home care than we have been used to providing.  In addition, community intervention teams can get people home and have nurses visit to provide intravenous infusions, while early supported discharge can be used in the case of stroke patients.  Many things could be done but we do not yet know how best to employ that &euro;25 million or over what period of time.  That is something that the HSE and I will be working on closely in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>  I will leave mental health questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, a bit later.</p><p>  When it comes to the national maternity strategy, as a first step the Department is currently finalising a policy paper on maternity services.  I have not yet seen the draft of that, however.  After that is finalised a working group will be established to review the policy paper and develop a comprehensive national maternity strategy.  The working group will be convened before the end of this year.  I hope to have some international involvement in that too.  With cancer services, for example, we have often brought in international views, and I would like that to be done in this case also.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the development of the strategy will be subject to wider consultation with stakeholder interests and that the strategy will be completed during 2015.</p> <p>I imagine all 19 units will be visited and I cannot see why they would not be.  I expect that to happen and I share the view of others that maternity care is too obstetric-oriented, much more so than it needs to be.  I have an open mind on midwife-led units.  In Britain, a woman makes a choice early on, in the case of a low-risk pregnancy, to go left into the midwife-led unit or right into the obstetric unit.  They tend to be beside each other in case something goes wrong.  In any pregnancy, the one thing we do not want to happen is for the woman to bleed heavily after pregnancy and be at home with one midwife.  No matter how good, one person cannot deal with a patient who is bleeding and one patient who has just been born.  That is my opinion, and international models will be studied before we come to a proper strategy in 2015.<br/>I will leave the questions on the HIQA report to Dr Tony O'Connell.  My understanding of the case in Cavan is that the court quashed the recommendations, not just the findings, and that leaves us with a dilemma.  Dr. Tony O'Connell knows more about that than I do.  I do not want to talk about the midwife in question because an investigation is starting quite soon, if it is not already under way.  Court actions have been taken and, while we have parliamentary privilege, we should not abuse it.  I do not wish to speak too much about things that are <i>sub judice</i>.  The investigation is occurring as a result of complaints made by other clinicians, not an unqualified individual with a vendetta against home births.  The complaint is from other midwives who have concerns.</p></speech>

It is a matter I inquired into this morning.  Some of them were offered an alternative community midwife while others were not and were offered hospital care instead.  Community midwives in Ireland are independent contractors and cannot be forced to take on women if they do not want to.  Where a community midwife is available and willing to take the patient, that has occurred.  It has not been possible in all cases and, as a result, they have been referred to hospital.  I am happy to allow Mr. John Hennessy to speak further on that.<br/>I also checked out the Caesarian section rates.  People are of the opinion that the rate is too high, and that is a legitimate opinion, but it is not correct to say that our Caesarian section rates are out of kilter with other countries.  We are the mid-range for the Western world when it comes to Caesarian section rates.<br/>The abortion guidelines were drawn up not by me but by an expert committee which included psychiatrists.  We can never get five doctors in a room to agree on everything, particularly in respect of ethical issues, and the fact that one third of psychiatrists do not agree with the guidelines is not that uncommon.  If there were guidelines on cardiac care, we would find one quarter or one third of doctors who do not agree with them.  That is the nature of these matters.  It was drawn up by a committee that included psychiatrists, and they were particularly involved in that aspect of the guidelines.<br/>I do not want to speak too much about the Ms Y case.  One of the most distressing things that happened to her was that her confidentiality was breached.  It is not the kind of thing that happens in other countries and it should not have happened.  She does not want to relive the experience of what happened to her, and that is why I will decline the offer to tell the Deputy more about what is happening to her or where she is now.  She is an individual and should not be treated as a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>.</p></speech>

As is the case with any patient and doctor, what happens between the patient and the doctor is not something politicians have much involvement with.</p><p>  With regard to symphisiotomy, I had not heard the allegation.  I am interested to have any information on it, but I should clarify that symphisiotomy is not a crime in Ireland and is still performed in some countries.  There have been cases in Canada and Massachusetts and in Africa.  I doubt it was carried out unless someone refused a Caesarian section or was at the point of obstructed labour.  I find it hard to believe, but I would be interested in hearing any information the Deputy has on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300017#U01700"><p>With regard to oral health, I assume Deputy Kelleher was asking about children with intellectual disabilities, which is the only group that needs to be sedated for oral health.  I do not know about the case to which he refers.  Perhaps we will find out about it afterwards and revert to the Deputy.  With the development of the new oral health policy, there is less need for full anaesthetic for people with an intellectual disability.  Mild sedation can be applied, usually by trained nurses in the local dental surgery.  We will inquire about the case, but I am not certain, so I will not say anything more.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about the additional &euro;15 million in the mental health budget, about which Deputy Kelleher also indicated, I did not go looking for the additional &euro;15 million this year.  I am normally open and frank about these things.  If we did not get the money, who is paying the salaries of more than 1,000 people who are employed with the additional development money?  It surprises me that people do not recognise the fact that people are being paid every month.  Clearly, the money has to come from somewhere.  During the year, we discovered in one of my regular meetings with the executive clinical directors, ECDs - the consultants who lead the service - that the moratorium and cutback on the numbers employed meant the administrative staff had been depleted.  Rather than using part of the &euro;35 million received in 2013, we used some of it for administrative staff.  I consider that to be as important and crucial to mental health services, so that when people are seen as outpatients or inpatients the proper notification is in front of the treating clinicians.  That was not in the original application.  I consistently check this point and seek various charts.</p><p>  At the end of August, approximately 99% of the 416 approved posts for 2012 - that is, 411 - have been filled.  Of the 477 approved posts in 2013, 75%, or 352, have been filled and the remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulty in identifying outstanding candidates.  This is for geographical or qualification reasons which I will explain further later.</p> <p>A total of 85% of people recruited for the combined two-year posts have taken up duty.  Approximately &euro;5 million of the &euro;20 million in development funding for the additional 250 posts is targeted to be spent in this quarter of 2014, with &euro;15 million meeting various broader service pressures for this year.  This will go to fund the additional 2014 posts in full in 2015.  Funding for the National Office of Suicide Prevention has more than doubled, from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;8.8 million in 2014.</p><p> Funding is included in the HSE&rsquo;s capital plan to provide for planned infrastructural development of the national forensic mental health service, for instance.  The application, as the Minister rightly said in his opening statement, is in place.  I am sure there will be some objections, but from what I hear there will be very few.  The issue is construction more so than the institution itself.  We will have to study this seriously, because within that new building we will put in place a new unit for people with intellectual disability, which we have not had before now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.671" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300018#V00300"><p>Yes.  There will also be a new children&rsquo;s unit for forensic stabilisation.  We send many children abroad, as the committee knows, and we hope to ensure these people will come back.  That is also the intention for the intensive care units that we will build around the country so that people who have mental health difficulties and need that forensic input will not have to be so remote from their families.  We will bring them back to their communities.</p><p>  In doing that we have to ensure we have the right subset for the posts.  When I meet the people who lead the service, they say they advertise through the national panel and people apply and get the posts.  If, however, a person gets a position that is vacant in Monaghan and the one he or she originally wanted, maybe in Cork, becomes available, that person has the right to move to that post.  Therefore, one is constantly trying to backfill the posts.  This is even more acute in the forensic service because the person has to go through an intensive training process and if, after doing that, the post he or she originally wanted comes up, the person moves out.  We are considering how we can best apply local specialised panels to ensure we get the right people in the right place.</p><p>  We have a difficulty in respect of psychology, as everyone knows.  We are not training enough psychologists and some of those we do train go abroad to get wider expertise, which is good because they will bring it back with them.  That is why we are seriously considering the prospect of retraining highly skilled nurses and social workers in the service in cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, which has very good outcomes for mental health. </p><p>  I hope the committee members have received the table showing the posts that have been recruited and will be filled this year.  There are 196 for this year.  This is a response to question No. 34 from Senator Marc MacSharry.  The table shows that we are putting people in place for old age psychiatry, which we had not done for the past few years, and for people with intellectual disability, which is also a highly specialised area.  It is a question of finding the gaps and determining how to fill them.  Up to now we had been paying particular attention to child and adolescent and adult psychiatry.</p><p>  The strategy A Vision for Change refers to the establishment of 99 multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams providing community-hospital liaison and day hospital services.  A total of 69 teams are in place: 62 community services, three adolescent day services and three hospital liaison health teams.  This is very important for liaising with families.</p></speech>

I am sorry; there are 20 beds in Cork.  I am sick of being beaten over the head about children going into adult mental health units when there are beds available within the CAMHS.  I know that because I have been looking into it.  We need to ensure that where there are beds available in the child and adolescent services, that is the first port of call.  We have to do this.  Serious work has been done on it.  We have put an individual in charge of that alone.  I know we all feel it is much better that people are out in the community, but why is there a waiting list for inpatient delivery of mental health services?  It does not exist in the adult service.  It is a question of ensuring that the service works in a more productive way.  I am very conscious of the fact that we are losing and will continue to lose nurses from the mental health services.  They are entitled to retire at 55 because of the onerous task they perform daily.  That is coming down the track very fast.  A workforce plan is being developed because we know it is coming.  I believe that if one knows something is happening it should not come as any big surprise.  One should plan to alleviate whatever pressures it brings.</p><p>  I am delighted that people take an interest in mental health.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in always has, as have Senator van Turnhout and Deputy Neville.  That helps and has helped to change the narrative and the perception, which is good.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300018#V01000"><p>In a moment I will ask Mr. O&rsquo;Connell to comment on the implementation of the maternity reports and Mr. Hennessy to comment on the community and midwifery aspects.  Deputy Kelleher is no longer here, but this is the first time I have ever been accused of painting an overly rosy picture of the health service.  I do not necessarily recognise myself in his description.</p><p>  I cannot say the memo does not exist.  I can say that at the moment I have a very large haystack and I am being asked to look for a very small needle.  If the newspaper that published the suggestions can do something to help me find it, that would be very helpful.  There is certainly no national-level policy that allows such a memo to exist, and if it does exist we need to find it.  If the newspaper has a copy, it would be very helpful if it were made available. </p><p>  The use of private health providers to provide first appointments for people on outpatient lists is valid.  When a doctor refers someone for an outpatient appointment, he or she initially looks for an opinion which can result in the patient&rsquo;s being maintained or cared for by his or her general practitioner, GP, on a continuing basis, with the concern having been allayed, or it can result in the patient's requiring inpatient treatment.  We have acknowledged that the process at the end of last year was flawed in that in some instances when patients were referred back into the public system for treatment there was a requirement for them to be seen again before they proceeded with treatment.  We have made a commitment that will not recur.  In principle, using private providers on that occasion was not wrong in and of itself.</p> <p> In relation to the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, there is an issue with orthopaedic surgical capacity and there are plans to address that.</p><p> In relation to Fair Deal scheme, it is not that the assessment is taking longer but the placement.  That is a simple consequence of the demand exceeding the resource available.  It is a cash-limited scheme and new placements can only be made available as funding becomes available.  Unfortunately, that means someone going out of the scheme, which, typically, is at the end of life.  That situation will not improve by itself.  All the information we have provided is around the interval to placement, not the interval to assessment.  Perhaps Dr. O'Connell would like to comment on the implementation of the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony O'Connell" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300019#W00200"><p>I wonder if I might add something to the question about outpatient departments, which the director general partially answered.  I merely want to reassure Deputy Kelleher that last year we sent out 15,000 patients who were waiting too long on the public waiting list to the private sector to be serviced.  A small percentage of those returned because they were not seen for whatever reason.  If that was the case, they rejoined the list at the place they were previously; in other words, there was no disadvantage to them.  At least they had the opportunity to see someone in the private sector.  If they came back because they had been seen in that private clinic and required a procedure which was not part of what we had contracted with the private sector to provide, they came back to the public sector.  Then, the doctors who were to perform the procedure often wanted to see the patients, which is quite reasonable from a clinical quality point of view.  When that occurs, the patients are treated as review patients because they have already had an outpatient clinic visit and they are given priority above others.  In the end, we had a system which, although it could have been improved, resulted in thousands of patients being seen sooner than they might have otherwise, with no disadvantage to themselves if they came back to the public sector.</p><p>  With regard to the maternity strategy, I thank the Minister for those clarifications about how it is running.  I merely want to add some details there.  We will visit all 19 units, each of which is quite different.  They have different caseloads and levels of complexity.  It is important to have a sense of what is going on in both the small and big units.  As the Minister stated, the Department has already done a literature review, which has only just been sent over to my office and which I have not yet had a chance to read.  It arrived only in the past 48 hours.  I will certainly look at that.</p><p>  In the acute hospitals division, we have surveyed all 19 units for high-level information about the number of obstetricians, midwives, deliveries, procedures, etc., and all of that information is back and is being collated.  Clearly, the next step is to drill down and look much more closely at the quality of service in each of these 19 units and whether there are other ways in which the service can be provided which represent a more efficient use of the mix of skills among midwives, midwife assistants and obstetricians.  That work will be done as we visit the 19 units.  We are, as was stated, setting up a guiding group which will steer this piece of work and which will also participate in the visits to the 19 institutions.</p><p>  With regard to the tragic event that occurred in Cavan, as was mentioned, the High Court has insisted that the report not be released.  I want to reassure the committee that those eight actions at Cavan and Monaghan hospital that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to in the written answer to his question have been initiated and enhanced subsequent to any adverse events which have occurred, and they are a response to the desire of the management, the obstetricians and midwives in the hospital to continue to improve the services available.  There will be a new investigation because of the quashing of the previous one.  Yesterday the college nominated two independent doctors to be involved in that investigation, which will start in November.  We are keen, for the sake of the family, to ensure the investigation is completed as soon as possible without in any way compromising thoroughness.</p><p>  With regard to the question about Caesarian section rates, as the Minister stated, these vary across countries, but Ireland is broadly in line with other OECD countries.  There is variation within Ireland: for example, Sligo has a 19% Caesarian section rate, whereas Kilkenny has a 38% Caesarian section rate.  It is for that reason that we are pleased the Health Research Board has given a grant to Professor Richard Layte from the ESRI and Professor Michael Turner from UCD, who works at the Coombe hospital and who is also the chair of the obstetric clinical programme, to look at national databases to study the issue of variance in Caesarian section rates.  Clearly, we need to put all of that together with the improving data collection that we are doing on the standard of quality in the hospitals.</p><p>  As was stated, the unfortunate events surrounding the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar in Galway have resulted in numerous recommendations.  We are implementing all of those recommendations, some of which take longer than overnight.  We have been surveying all 19 units to ensure they are implementing the recommendations and we are in the process of reviewing progress on those implementations.  Some of what we are doing is described in the answer we have given to the question, and I will not go into it in detail - for example, the implementation of the Irish maternity early warning score, which detects patients in a similar condition to the late Ms Halappanavar, who previously may not have been detected early enough.  There is excellent penetration of use of that particular tool in the maternity hospitals.  In our regular performance management process with the almost 50 hospitals in the country, we are utilising the Safer Better Healthcare standards and the recommendations that emerge from the various reports, especially the HIQA reports, to inform our conversations with the hospitals, and we are using national standards for safety and health care to ensure that hospitals are continuing to dynamically review the output of their self-assessments.  We are also establishing a quality and patient safety profile, QPSP.  This is a comprehensive, timely and reliable report which will be used by the senior and most accountable manager in each of the services, which describes the quality and safety of the health care provided within the service and the actions taken to improve those services where required.  This is being overseen by a cross-divisional HSE steering committee which is developing that framework and supporting the services to implement that QPSP.</p><p>  With regard to the question on foetal monitoring, this technique is not used in a blanket way across the system.  The use of foetal monitoring is guided based on guidelines which have been developed by clinical experts in the Irish system, and it is only used when indicated.  Overseas experience shows that electronic foetal monitoring can increase Caesarian section rates, but that is only in countries that do not concomitantly use foetal blood sampling.  That is not the case in Ireland, because foetal blood sampling is available in all maternity units here.</p></speech>

The original client list for the midwife concerned was 12 - there were 12 women notified to the HSE and registered - but I am aware that a substantial number of further clients have emerged since then who were not previously known to the HSE.  We have a team working on this to try to facilitate as many people as possible with alternative arrangements.  That is dependent on the availability of community midwives to take up this work.  To put that in context, the volume of this activity compared with the general activity level in obstetrics is tiny.</p> <p>There are approximately 200 births per annum, with approximately 20 midwives operating, but our intention is to try to facilitate as much choice as possible.  More serious questions relating to choice will be dealt with as part of the maternity strategy review, with an open mind on maximum choice.</p><p> On the legal costs mentioned, the legal proceedings were not initiated by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in this instance, and we are the respondents in that matter, but further hearings are due to take place and I would prefer not to comment on that in view of those hearings.</p><p> Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of the dental list in Roscommon.  We are checking the facts with regard to that but it appears some work is happening in the new endoscopy unit at Roscommon hospital which is disrupting theatre lists.  We will examine the detail on that and try to make alternative arrangements to minimise the disruption to service.</p></speech>

At least nine speakers have indicated their wish to contribute.  Mr. O'Brien is leaving at 2 o'clock, and the Minister has another engagement.

My question 20 was specifically on consultant vacancies and I was astonished by the reply I received in that the information has not been given to me.  I do not accept that the information is not available.  We are talking about 41 hospitals.  If I got the name of a porter in each of the hospitals, I have no doubt they would be able to give me the information I seek.  It is appalling that a manager of a hospital cannot tell a central office the posts that are currently vacant.</p><p>  I am surprised the reply refers to these changes happening over a short period.  Consultant posts do not change over a short period.  People are in a post for ten, 15 or 20 years, so I do not understand the reason for that reference.  The second part of the reply refers to the recruitment embargo.  I was not aware that the embargo applied to the recruitment of consultants.  The reply is not adequate.  If someone from the media asked the same question, I believe the information would have been furnished to that person.  I am very annoyed that I cannot get what is basic information that is available to every hospital manager.  We are talking about 41 hospital managers, and if they do not have that information, they should not be in their jobs.</p><p>  Question 22 was on the implementation of the recommendations of the McCrea report.  Again, the reply was fuzzy.  No clear indication is being given that the terms and recommendations in the McCrea report with regard to changing the structures of how we employ general doctors are being implemented.  That is something to which priority should be given.  We have a huge problem on our hands with regard to the recruitment and retention of general doctors.  Services are being affected and many consultants say that if some of the general doctors they currently employ had applied for the same jobs five years ago, they would not have been employed.  Standards are falling.  We need to address that, and the reply does not deal adequately with the question I posed.  I ask that I be given the information I have requested.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive updates which I found very useful.</p><p>  I refer to the 704 people awaiting alternative care arrangements.  I welcome the dedicated fund of &euro;25 million, but we have an ageing population and many people await home care packages.  The fair deal scheme waiting time in my area has increased to 16 weeks.  I hope that will be examined carefully when the &euro;25 million fund is being allocated.</p><p>  I posed a question with regard to the orthopaedic surgeries, which Deputy Kelleher mentioned earlier.  I noted in the reply that there was a significant reduction in so-called long waiters, at 59%.  The reply also refers to a 15% reduction in the number of patients waiting more than 12 months.  I do not know of anyone who has been waiting less than 12 months.  I have received letters from people stating that there is a two and a half year waiting list.  People tell me that from the time they go to their general practitioner, get an outpatient appointment and go on a waiting list to receive an appointment, it can take up to four years.</p><p>  Question 13 concerned the drug Daxas.  Constituents have told me it had been withdrawn under the medical card scheme but the reply, which I am sure is 100% correct, states it was never under the medical card scheme.  If I understand correctly, the manufacturers were liaising with the pharmacies and making it available free of charge.  Is that correct?  I understanding they were dispensing it free of charge over the counter but they have now withdrawn it.  It was mentioned that hospital stays have reduced for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and emphysema, but Daxas is a drug that helps people with emphysema and COPD.  One person I spoke to had an average of four hospital stays per year, but since he went on this drug three years ago he has not been in hospital.  Another person told me they were in hospital on numerous occasions, with average stays of a couple of weeks, but this drug has resulted in them not needing to be admitted to hospital.  Apparently, there is no generic substitute for Daxas.  We are dealing with people on very low incomes.  They can purchase it, but one man told me it cost him more than &euro;60.  Another man told me it cost &euro;80.  Results of clinical trials are expected later this year, but I would like the Minister to investigate that and revert to me on it because I do not believe he is aware of the answer I received on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300020#X00500"><p>I refer to the questions which I have raised with this committee and with the HSE on a number of occasions.  We are going around in circles in this regard.  We are a year on from the Higgins report when Professor Higgins established the hospital groups.  Waterford University Hospital was given an undertaking that a 24-7 cardiac catheterisation laboratory would be available to the people in the south east.  It currently operates from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a Monday to Friday basis.  Therefore, if one has a heart attack, one can get the required treatment only between those hours from Monday to Friday.</p><p>  I see from the response I received that a business case has been prepared.  There was no talk of business cases when Professor Higgins, at a meeting at which I was present along with the then Minister, Deputy Reilly, said that this was part of the deal in Waterford becoming part of the hospital group in conjunction with Cork University Hospital.  When will this service be delivered to the people of the south east?</p><p>  Regarding my second question on the palliative care unit, I note there has been a development in that this plan has gone to service design, but I am alarmed to find that in a report published by the hospice association, which is available on its website, the south east is the only part of the country in which hospice home care packages are not paid for in their entirety by the HSE.  The HSE funds a home visiting service, which is crucial to very sick people throughout the south east, to the value of approximately &euro;200,000 a year, and it costs &euro;500,000 to run.  The &euro;300,000 deficit is, therefore, made up by fund-raising by the people of the south east.</p> <p>People who fund-raise for the hospice in Cork or Kerry can buy nice added extras for people who are experiencing a difficult time in their lives.  However, the money from fund-raising in the south east goes directly to pay for the service.  How is it that we are the only region in the country that must do this?  I want to know what will be done.</p><p> Furthermore, the people of Waterford and the south east have committed to fund-raising a total of &euro;6 million for the construction of the palliative care unit in the grounds of the hospital.  If we had the use of the &euro;300,000 which we fund-raise every year to put towards that project I maintain that the project would be completed more quickly. </p><p> The Minister spoke about how HIQA has improved standards-----</p></speech>

In question No. 14 I asked about the resources for preparing staff for Children First.  It was indicative that when I submitted this question I was asked whether I had directed it to the right Minister.  I am asking about the training of more than 70,000 staff in the HSE who will deal directly with children.  I am concerned by the fact that the question was kicked back to me.  I specifically wish to know what money has been allocated to finance the training of the 70,000 relevant staff to enable the implementation of Children First.</p><p>  I refer to question No. 15 on the model of care for neurology and, in particular, to progress the patient pathway for multiple sclerosis.  The number of consultant posts has been increased by ten and it is evident that the number of out-patient appointments will increase.  There is a clear business case for the recruitment of more consultants.  What are the figures for MS nurses, physiotherapists and psychologists?</p><p>  It is expected that the fourth draft model of care should be ready for the November meeting of the clinical advisory group.  Will that be presented for public consultation and, if so, when?</p><p>  The reply to question No. 15 states that the neurology programme has been working with the national director, &Aacute;ine Carroll, on developing protocols for high-cost prescriptions.  Will these provide a national prescribing guidance for prescribing all medications available for MS or just the two medications cited?  Comprehensive guidance is needed because we need to avoid a postcode lottery type of treatment.</p><p>  My third question is about cardiac rehabilitation.  I note some progress.  Ian Carter advised us that there would be progress this year.  Is this view shared by Dr. Tony O'Connell?  I refer to the survey undertaken by the Irish Heart Foundation, IHF, and the Irish Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation, that not one hospital providing cardiac rehabilitation is meeting the minimum staffing requirements.</p><p>  On the issue of mental health, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, said that we often focus on what has gone wrong.  My difficulty in the area of mental health is that we have no report.  In 2012 the monitoring report of A Vision for Change was discontinued.  I have no report to track the strategy so I cannot applaud the Minister because I do not know when we can applaud and when we can say it is not good enough.  In particular, we need to have reports with regard to children.  I know that children are being put in adult psychiatric wards-----</p></speech>

In light of various replies I got, we are all well aware of the position on prices and the fair deal scheme.  I understand money was taken out in last year's budget.  Has the Minister any plans to address this matter?</p><p>  My second two points concern two centres in my constituency, St. Christopher's and St. Hilda's, both of which provide services to those with intellectual disabilities.  There has been ongoing consultation with these services.  They are at crisis point and have endured difficulties over and beyond the cuts that others might have endured in the effort to create efficiencies.  Comparisons are being made with similar units but they do not take into account the severe disabilities of some of the residents in these homes.  One is not comparing like with like; it is a case of apples and oranges.  People with intellectual disabilities getting on in life may require many more supports than others.</p><p>  I understand the Minister met a deputation from St. Christopher's last week.  It is disappointing that the deputation was associated with just one political party and did not represent all political parties.  Perhaps the Minister will outline his plan for supporting St. Christopher's.</p><p>  I understand St. Hilda&rsquo;s in Athlone is to endure a further cut this year.  My information from the centre is that the local HSE did not support this cut and in fact recommended against it.  Who identifies the value-for-money cuts to be implemented?  Is it the regional or local office, or is it done at national level?  Perhaps the Minister could come back to me on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-23a.698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014102300022#BB00400"><p>I welcome the Minister.</p><p>  Let me refer to question No. 27 on aftercare and individuals who have lost their medical cards.  The reply stated it is not necessary to have a medical card to avail of services in most areas.  I assure the Minister that I have come across a number of cases in which it was essential to have a medical card to avail of a service.</p><p>  The Minister spoke about community nursing homes.  It is very important to be able to continue to provide community nursing home services.  I have encountered two cases of people in their 80s who have lost their medical cards and who have genuinely sick partners.  One individual was charged &euro;50 for a nurse to come to his home to dress his arm because he had fallen.  After contacting the primary care health centre and speaking to the doctor there, circumstances were reversed.  The nurse attended a few times and helped to bring the man&rsquo;s health back to an appropriate standard.  </p><p>  I am very concerned about home help services and the effort to keep people at home.  The Minister did not mention this because it is not in the question.  In my area, where people are given half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening, the service is not adequate.  I refer to where somebody has to be got out of bed and helped to make a bit of breakfast, and attended to in the evening also for half an hour.  I am very concerned because many service providers are now telling me they are just not able to manage anymore consequent to people being given just half an hour.  An individual might be entitled to an hour, but this would mean half an hour in the morning and half an hour at night.  I do not know what can be done about it but I hope the Minister can consider it again.  The more we can keep people in their homes, the more they can be with their neighbours and family.  I hope that, through community nursing homes, we might be able to enjoy the added bonus of keeping people at home. </p><p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider favourably the cases of people whose medical cards have been removed because they were somewhat over the threshold but who might be elderly or have a very sick partner at home.</p></speech>

I will leave to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the questions on the fair deal scheme and mental health services in St. Christopher's and St. Hilda's.</p><p>  Children First, which is covered in question No. 14 by Senator van Turnhout, is in the mix for the services plan for 2015.</p> <p>I do not know why the question might have been referred to another Minister.  Children First is relevant not only to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but also to areas such as education, health, sport and others.  There are statutory obligations in this regard, and provision must be made in the service plan next year for appropriate training depending on people's jobs.</p><p> Regarding the hospice in the south east, it is the case that in other regions people engage in fund-raising for services such as nursing care.  It is not the case that fund-raising in other regions relates only to matters of capital expenditure; it can apply to service elements too.</p></speech>

Much has been done on this in the Cavan-Monaghan region and I would like to see this across the health service.  In Britain, the NHS has done much to improve hospital food.  Some people attend hospital for short periods and need energy, so I do not think desserts should be banned.  The bigger picture is about feeding people appropriately, particularly if they are in hospital for a long period.</p><p>  The national director will say more about the catheterisation laboratory in Waterford.  It is always the case that a costing is done and a business case made - ultimately, all capital investments require taxpayers' money.  Failure to carry out a cost-benefit analysis and make a business case would breach the public spending code.  This does not mean the matter is in jeopardy.</p><p>  My understanding is that the medication Daxas was offered free as a trial.  After a trial period a company must demonstrate clinical evidence that a medicine is effective and put forward a reasonable price.  We cannot always pay the price sought by drug companies, and the company is obliged to show the effectiveness of the drug and the fairness of the price.</p></speech>

Waiting lists are increasing and &euro;23 million was taken from the fair deal fund and placed in enhanced home care packages last year.  This worked extremely well, as far more people now receive enhanced home care packages and home help.  I have made inquiries relating to St. Christopher's Services and I have not met people based on their political parties - that is irrelevant, as anyone who is interested can come to a meeting.  St. Christopher's Services tendered to provide the service it does and won out in the process because it provides a good service.  The additional supports that are now being delivered were not part of the tender process and were not agreed with HSE so this presents a difficulty.  I recognise that St. Christopher's Services is delivering the service that was agreed when it won out in the tendering process, and the HSE is funding this, but there is a difficulty that cannot be ignored.  Mr. Pat Healy and his team will meet representatives of St. Christopher's Services in the coming days to see what can be worked out.  St. Christopher's Services is not the only service providing additional supports that were not originally part of a tender, and this issue has been worked out in other cases.  There will be intense engagement on overcoming these difficulties.  Everyone recognises the good work that the care centre does, but it was only asked to tender for certain services and it did so.  The HSE pays for these services and has lived up to its side of the bargain, as has St. Christopher's Services.</p></speech>

Our budget is approximately &euro;1.5 billion this year, so there has been a slight increase, but a range of services must be delivered.  We must manage the budget while providing the services that people need.</p></speech>

These are much better the existing drug treatment, interferon.  In possibly up to 95% of cases, these new antiviral drugs can clear the virus entirely.  It is really a wonderful advance in modern medicine that we can now cure many patients with hepatitis C.  The new drugs are, however, very expensive.  My counterpart in France has said she believes they are so expensive that they could - on their own - undermine the future of her country's health system.  That is saying a great deal.  Obviously, these drugs must be subject to the normal processes in order to ensure that they are cost-effective, etc.  However, there is a group of patients whose needs are exceptional.  More than 100 patients have been identified as being at risk of irreversible liver damage if they do not receive treatment soon.  It is intended to begin treatment within the next few weeks, via an early-access programme, for those patients who have been identified as being in the greatest clinical need.  This will require an agreement with the companies that supply the medicine, which are both currently offering different deals in respect of an early-access programme.  We will need to assess - very quickly - which deal is the best to accept.  The group of patients involved will be treated differently by means of the early-access programme to which I refer because they cannot wait for the normal processes to be followed.</p></speech>

I have learned in the past number of years that the structure relating to and the way in which a service is delivered are as important as the service itself.  Volumes of staff can be brought into a service but if they are not operating within a robust structure and if there is not a good team-building model in place for them, one could very well find one's self with the people filling additional posts having very little to do.  We are intent on ensuring that there is such a robust structure in place in the area of mental health.  The story with regard to mental health services is not at all as bad as it is being painted.  I meet hundreds of people every week in respect of this issue and I am aware that the position is not as bad as is perceived.</p></speech>

We took the latter step on foot of additional information and I am of the view that it will pay dividends.  Most people might not consider this to be a front-line post but I am of the view that it is vitally important that there should be such a co-ordinator.  Sometimes it is as much about the structure used to deliver a service as it is about the service itself.</p><p>  As a result of what has been said at this meeting and in the interests of doing something more positive, I will consider reinstating the monitoring report.  I am of the view that it is time this was done.</p></speech>

It is anticipated that when the group has agreed to the current draft of the model of care, it will be circulated for much wider consultation.  The outcome from that consultation process will be fed back into the final model of care.</p><p>  In conjunction with the medicines management programme, my colleagues in primary care and acute hospitals and I are in the process of developing protocols in respect of the prescription of high-cost medication.  We will be examining the position with regard to rheumatology drugs in the first instance and we will then be looking at neurology drugs.  My colleagues Chris McGuigan and Niall Tubridy have done a great deal of work in respect of high-cost neurology drugs.

We have been able to increase activity despite the budgetary restraints that apply.  However, we have only been able to increase it by 8%.  In other words, there is a gap between the levels of demand and supply, both of which are rising.  This has been a challenge for us.  Due to the effective squeezing out of scheduled elective activity in our hospitals as a result of the increases in emergency activity to which the director general referred, this year has seen a reduction in orthopaedic booked activity.  I refer here to a 2.9% decrease in inpatient numbers and a 2.1% reduction in day cases.</p> <p>Nevertheless, when one compares this year with the same time in 2010, there has been an overall increase in activity of 4.6%, which is extraordinary.  This reflects the fact that despite the financial challenges we face, we are becoming more efficient through programmes such as the productive operating theatre programme utilising lean methodologies, as well as becoming more efficient in how we manage the overdues on the lists in order that we attempt not to have too many people waiting for too long.  As for the questions about the cardiac catheterisation service at Waterford, I might just quote the exact words in the so-called Higgins report on this issue.  It is referred to in only two sentences and states:<blockquote><br />Waterford Regional Hospital will continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the South East population.  Working in collaboration with the cardiology service in Cork the current service should be extended with new joint appointments of cardiologists.</blockquote>The Higgins report is actually a description of the way in which hospitals should be arranged into groups as is not seen as a service planning exercise by the Department.  Nevertheless-----</p></speech>

As the Minister stated clearly, to make investments such as a second catheterisation laboratory at a cost of &euro;1.9 million with total revenue costs of &euro;2.7 million for a 24-7 expansion, it is appropriate to draw up a business case to examine the benefits this provides.  The service is addressing patients appropriately.  The majority of patients within the existing nine-to-five arrangements certainly were not embarrassed by the planned maintenance that occurred on 13 August.  There was no interruption to services, as additional sessions were put in place in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory to ensure patients were not disadvantaged.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout pointed out there has been a challenge in delivering cardiac rehabilitation throughout the country, and certainly a number of the rehabilitation co-ordinators believe the quality of service has been reduced.  I am concerned about that and will meet the two relevant clinical programme leads tomorrow, that is, the programme for coronary care and the programme for cardiac failure.  This is a long-standing appointment I have had with them, which will take place tomorrow, to sort out exactly what can be done about this within the current financial constraints.  One comforting point noted in the written response is that there has been a highly successful development of the primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, arrangements and, of course, one positive side-effect of this is that patients have their coronary ischaemia, that is, lack of oxygen to the muscle of the heart, corrected much faster.  This means they are much less likely to have dead heart tissue, which results in them needing cardiac rehabilitation and experiencing cardiac failure.  This is a highly positive spin-off from the great work that is being done by the clinical programmes.  This does not mean we do not need any cardiac rehabilitation, as we obviously will, and I am keen to work with those two leads to make sure we do so in a way that increases the access of patients to those services.</p></speech>

We have discussed previously the point that the idea behind establishing hospital groups was not about making patients travel to Cork but about consultants coming to Waterford.  From my understanding, this is happening on a very limited basis even where there is a huge vacancy of consultants, as Dr. O'Connell read out earlier, in University Hospital Waterford.  Why are we not seeing the throughput of consultants within the group into University Hospital Waterford?</p></speech>

Cork itself is challenged in terms of its ability to mobilise staff.  Clearly, the hospital groups give us a framework within which this is much easier to occur than previously.  One thing I did last week was to issue a directive to all hospitals in Ireland that all future consultants must be appointed not to an individual hospital but to the entire group, in order that we can make the most use of this resource and get the economies of scale that come from having people who will work across hospitals.  In practical terms, this is challenging because of distances between and limitations within hospitals.  However, the idea - certainly this manifestation of it -  is to make the most use of this resource.  Perhaps I can get Gerry O'Dwyer to provide more information to both the Deputy and me on precisely how he envisages this working over the next year.</p></speech>

By so doing we will create an environment in which our law can be better applied in respect of issues such as safety at sea and pollution.<br/>The section provides for the establishment of a new Irish register of ships.  The register will consist of different parts for the different types of ships and for the different registration purposes.  The types and particulars of ships to be registered will be registered on each part of the register and will be prescribed via regulations.<br/>Section 9(9) confirms that registration on the register may be granted for an initial period of up to five years and may be subject to ongoing compliance with registration requirements or conditions attached to registration which are provided for in section 18(10) and not in section 18(8).<br/>The amendment is designed to correct that and draws the Bill's reference to the correct subsection.</p></speech>

Section 24 deals with the issue of visitor registration; section 28 with the certificate of registry and section 64, summary penalties.<br/>Amendment No. 2 proposes technical amendments to section 23(8) and (9).  The amendment to subsection (8) makes it clear that the certificate of registry of temporary registration must be carried on board a ship to which the certificate relates.  When a vessel is temporarily in Irish waters and its owner has registered it in the register that the Bill is enabling and updating, the amendment makes it clear that the certificate must be carried on board the ship and that it must refer to the ship for which it has been granted.  The wording of subsection (9) is being revised in the interests of clarification to provide that the penalty on summary conviction is a class C fine, that is, a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500.  This approach is consistent with the provisions in relation to non-compliance with the certificate of registry requirements generally, as contained in section 28(12) of the Bill which also provides for a class C fine on summary conviction.  For all of the potential convictions in respect of the temporary registration of craft, we are ensuring a similar sanction will apply, that is, a class C fine.  <br/>Section 23 allows qualified persons who normally live on the ship and purchase a recreational craft under 24 m in length outside the State to register the recreational craft on a temporary basis for the purposes of bringing it from abroad to a port in the State.  This provides a facility for ship owners as they may be required to be registered when operating in certain waters.  Subsection (8) requires that the certificate be carried on the ship at all times.  Subsection (9) provides that where this does not happen, the owner or master of the ship will be held responsible for the offence.  <br/>Amendment No. 3 refers to section 24(6) and clarifies that the penalty for an offence in this area is a class C fine.  Amendment No. 15 amends section 64 to add references to section 20(9), section 23(9) and section 24(6) to the saver provision.  This provides that, except when provided otherwise in particular sections of the Bill, summary conviction for an offence under the Bill will result in a class A fine.  These sections listed in brackets in section 64 provide for fines other than a class A fine.  They provide for class C or D fines, &euro;2,500 or &euro;1,000, respectively, on conviction or higher fines on indictment.  Amendment No. 15 adds references to sections 23(9) and 24(6) which provides for a class C fine on summary conviction and a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 on conviction on indictment. <br/>Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment which reinforces the meaning of the word &quot;ship&quot; in section 28(2) to make it clear that it is the owner of the vessel or ship, in respect of which the certificate of registry has been granted, who may apply to the Minister for an extension of the certificate concerned.</p></speech>

Section 28 provides for the issuing of a certificate of registry by the Minister when a ship is registered in the Irish register of ships.  Provision is made for different types of certificate of registry for different purposes, as well as for duplicates and replacement certificates.  The section also imposes requirements in relation to the carriage of the certificate of registry on the ship and provides for offences relating to the use of the certificate.  I am proposing in amendment No. 5 to insert a new subsection (5) and a specific offence provision where there is a failure to comply with the general requirement in subsection (4)(a) to carry a certificate of registry on board a ship at all times.  The amendment clarifies that where this requirement is not complied with, the owner or master of the ship concerned will be held responsible for the offence.  The related amendment No. 6 amends the existing subsection (6) to ensure a specific offence provision for non-compliance with subsection (4)(b) and (c) and the renumbered subsection (6) is contained in the Bill.  <br/>Amendment No. 7 is a further consequential technical amendment to the existing subsection (12) to include a reference to the new subsection (5) which will be inserted as a consequence of amendment No. 5 and make it clear that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of the subsections listed is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine.<br/>Section 65 allows for the prosecution of both the owner and the master of a ship in the case of specified offences under the Bill where it is shown that the owner or the master, as the case may be, consented to, approved or connived in the commission of the offence.<br/>Amendment No. 16 arises from the insertion of subsection (5) in section 28 and will add a reference to an offence under section 28(5) to the list of offences for the purposes of section 65.</p> <p>The offence in section 28(5) relates to failure by the owner or master of a ship to comply with the general requirement to carry a certificate of registry on board the ship at all times.  The inclusion of a reference to section 28(5) in the list of specified offences in section 65 brings consistency to the section, which already includes a reference to sections 23(9) and 24(6) where offences relate to failure by the owner or master of a ship to carry the certificate of temporary registration or a visitor registration, respectively, on board the ship at all times.</p></speech>

It refers to the registration of ships generally.  On Second Stage, I raised the issue of being able to register maritime liens and particularly liens for judgments which have not been satisfied.  I am referring, for example, to the following: judgments for claims for wages and sums due to the master's officers and other members of the vessel's complement; claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury; claims for reward for salvage; claims for port canal and other waterway dues and pilotage dues; and claims based on tort arising out of physical loss or damage caused by the operation of the vessel.  These specific liens are listed in the International Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages 1993, which I raised on Second Stage.</p><p>  If a new register is being established, and I greatly welcome that it is, it would appear to be logical to be able to register these liens.  After all, it is merely enforcing the judgments that people would obtain for any of the above reasons, including claims for wages.  I would welcome the insertion of a section which includes the possibility to register such judgments.</p><p>  There should be a specific provision whereby a ship could not be deregistered without having satisfied those liens.  Obviously, to register a ship somewhere else, a person would have to have a certificate of deregistration from the place where it was registered previously, such as Ireland.  It would be logical that one would have to satisfy the lien before one could deregister the ship.</p><p>  I wish to raise that point at this stage because if I do not raise it now, I cannot table such amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, he raised the issue of liens and including it in this Bill on Second Stage.  Much of this relates to the International Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages 1993, which we have not ratified.  Few countries have ratified it due to its complexity.  It is such a big area that it would be difficult to contain it within the parameters of this Bill.  That said, if there is a facet of that convention or a perspective of the Deputy's that he believes could be addressed, he could share it with me as a draft amendment and I will engage with him then.</p></speech>

I am not necessarily advocating that Ireland accede to the convention at this stage but that some provision be included in the Bill whereby if there is a judgment for non-payment of wages or for any of the issues I mentioned, it could be registered as a lien on the register and that the register be public.  It is important that people be able to see what judgments are registered, just as the land registry is public.  I note from the correspondence I have received and from what the Minister said on Second Stage that it is envisaged that the register will be public.</p></speech>

It would be useful for the Minister to state the general principle that it will be publicly available, although parts of it will not be publicly available, and that people can register judgments.  My particular concern would be non-payment of wages.  To the best of my knowledge we do not have outstanding cases on this issue, but it would be horrible if Ireland became a state where people did not have to satisfy court judgments on payment of wages.  These are the aspects of the convention.  In addition, one should not be able to deregister without satisfying them.  These are the issues I will raise with the Minister and I thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to raise them now.</p></speech>

Nothing I say here prohibits him from tabling an amendment on Report Stage, but I will outline my current assessment of the issue.</p><p>  The Deputy's point about public access to the register is correct.  Many aspects of the register, which will have different sub-registers below it, will be available for public access.  It will also be possible to obtain a certified copy of particulars entered in a register book on the registry of a ship and to view or obtain copies of transcripts of registry for any registered ship at the general register and record office.  There might well be other aspects of it that are not available for public view, but many of the areas that would be of most interest to the public will be available for public access.</p><p>  The Deputy might be considering a potential amendment relating to the issue of judgments against ships and so forth.</p> <p>I draw the committee's attention to section 53 which provides the power for the High Court, on the application of an interested person, to make an order prohibiting any dealing with a registered ship or a share in a registered ship for a specific period and on terms and conditions that it decides.</p><p> Under section 53(2), a court order is binding when served on the Minister.  This means that a ship cannot be removed from the Irish register of ships while the order is in force.  I realise this does not address entirely the point the Deputy has made, but I am seeking to emphasise that, in circumstances in which an appeal is made to the High Court, the owner of the vessel is prohibited from doing certain things.</p></speech>

When a person obtains a judgment, he or she has it.  I would prefer, however, if it was automatic that a person could enter a judgment in the registry.  In that way it would be automatic that the boat could not be de-registered before the judgment was satisfied.  It is cumbersome and very expensive to go to the High Court.  While it is good that the provision is in place, I would prefer if the onus was the other way around and that a person did not have to go to the High Court to stop someone de-registering a boat without having satisfied the judgment.  I am not suggesting we get rid of the power to go to the High Court.  For example, if a case was pending, a person could seek a declaration from the High Court that a ship could not be de-registered on that basis.  However, it seems onerous that an owner, having obtained a judgment, then has to go back to the High Court at some further point to seek a further order.  I am pleased section 52 is in place, but this is an addition I am proposing by way of an amendment.</p><p>  There is also the issue of the register being public.  It is welcome that the intention is to keep it public.  I do not mean this in the case of the Minister specifically, but sometimes I wonder why Ministers say they never intend to use certain provisions.  Numerous Ministers have come before us to obtain powers in legislation and said they would never use a given provision.  If a Minister does not intend to use them, why does he or she need them in legislation?  If the intention is to have the register public, why not insert that in the legislation and say elements of the register shall be public?</p></speech>

The two key reasons are security and data protection and each requires that the information on the register not to be publicly available or instantly available to the public.  They are the core reasons certain information is not immediately available to the public.</p></speech>

I have no problem with having the capacity in legislation to provide that elements of the register will not be public.  The reasons the Minister has outlined are entirely sensible.  However, I am keen to see outlined in legislation the general principle that much of it shall be public because that much is not entirely clear, although it is implicit.  The intention is that much of it will be public, but I am advocating that this should be stated, subject to the stipulation that not all of it will be public for the reasons the Minister has outlined and any other reason which might be legislated for in secondary legislation.</p></speech>

In the case of some smaller ships, for the purposes of registration in certain parts of the register, the owner may have difficulty in producing an actual bill of sale and it is proposed to accept a declaration of ownership.  The specific requirements and detail will be set out in the regulations to be made under the Bill.<br/>Amendment No. 8, as drafted, inserts the words &quot;or by means of such other document of transfer as may be prescribed&quot;.  This means that if a given vessel is below a particular size or if, for some other reason, the owner does not have the bill of sale, the thrust of the amendments allow the Minister to say he will prescribe the details of another document to take the place of the bill of sale.  The idea is to ensure everyone who wants to participate in the register will have the ability to do so and will not be prohibited from so doing because of the absence of a bill of sale.  The amendment is proposed to recognise the fact that there will be exceptions to the requirement to have a bill of sale.  It will allow for the acceptance of alternative documents, for example, a declaration of ownership.  The details of such documents will be set out by ministerial regulations.<br/>Amendment No. 13 arises as a consequence of amendment No. 8.  To remove any doubt, it confirms that any reference in section 49 to a bill of sale includes a reference to any document of transfer prescribed under section 49(1).  If the Minister of the day states an alternative document may be used, amendment No. 13 seeks to ensure the entire section is consistent.<br/>Section 49(2) establishes requirements for a bill of sale which must contain a description of the ship that is consistent with its measurement particulars.  This usually involves consistency with the certificate of measurement for the ship.  However, it is proposed to allow for declarations of measurement in the case of some smaller ships to be registered in certain parts of the register.  This will remove the expense of a formal survey of the measurement of certain smaller ships.  As is the case with the bill of sale or a declaration of ownership, the specific detail and requirements will be set out in regulations to be issued by the Department.<br/>Amendment No. 10 amends the wording of section 49(2) to recognise that the description of a ship may, in certain prescribed circumstances, be set out in a declaration of measurement rather than in a certificate of measurement.<br/>Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 12 are technical in nature.  Amendment No. 9 amends section 49(2) to clarify that the requirements in respect of a bill of sale or other document of transfer apply equally to such documents in respect of a share in a ship.</p> <p> Amendment No. 11 corrects the placing of the last comma on line 24 of subsection (2).  Amendment No. 12 corrects the wording on line 26 at the beginning of subsection (3) by replacing the word "therein" with the words "in it" and the word "subsection" with "subsections".</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with this provision.  However, I have mentioned the issue of registering liens in respect of judgments for unpaid wages and so on.  My view is that such liens should take precedence over mortgages.  I am flagging the issue at this point and I am interested in hearing the Minister's views.</p></speech>

Under that agreement, a maritime lien has priority over a registered mortgage and is extinguished after one year, unless the ship is arrested or seized, which would lead to a forced sale.  I understand why the Deputy is raising this issue.  It emanates from the 1993 convention which is not registered in this jurisdiction.  I look forward to the Deputy's amendment on Report Stage to see how we might incorporate the convention, or even some of it, in the Bill.  I will consider any proposal he brings forward.</p></speech>

Where, for example, a person has a particular concern about a safety matter and the ship in question is registered under the Irish flag, the body of law of the State will apply.  If there is any breach of that law, it will become a matter of enforcement that must ultimately be adjudicated upon in the courts system.  To clarify, is it the Deputy's concern that this is not happening?</p></speech>

I have no doubt that the current system works, but some of the mechanisms relating to maritime law are very complex and it is very expensive to have such matters dealt with in the High Court.  It seems to be a very cumbersome procedure for something as basic as a judgment on the non-payment of wages, for instance.  In Mrs. Airey's case, when she wanted a separation and to be looked after, it was theoretically possible to take action because she had lots of money and lots of time in which to do so.  If a person does not have these advantages, he or she may find the courts system is not as accessible as those of other states.</p></speech>
