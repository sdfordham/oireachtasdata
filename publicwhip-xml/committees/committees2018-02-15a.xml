He is joined today by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  The first item on our agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 8 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  I have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  The next item on the agenda is matters arising from the minutes.  Everything referred to in the minutes is moving ahead and we can move on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  Correspondence No. 1079 is a briefing document from Dr. Brian Keegan on corporation tax.  We will discuss this in private session and there may some additions and changes as a result of this morning's meeting.  We will have a final document for next week.  I propose that we discuss it in private session but not publish it at the moment.  Obviously we will publish the final version next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up committee meetings and other items for publishing, the first item is No. 1067B received from Mr. Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, following the committee's request for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of University of Limerick's internal audit review of August 2017.  I believe we should take up Mr. Fitzgerald on his offer to provide further updates and request a copy of the Crowe Howarth review mentioned in the letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#B00400"><p>At our last meeting, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond to claims that the university or people in it may have misled his office.  He said at the time he was doing his own report.  Obviously, we must come back to it at some point because we have dealt with it in the past.  We have the internal audit report which makes 42 recommendations.  The correspondence states 17 of the recommendations have been implemented and 25 are in progress.  It also states significant changes have been made to senior management structures.  Any time there is a report where issues arise in a public institute I ask the same question, which is who is held to account.  In this instance I do not know who is held to account.  It seems there is some restructuring going on, but if individuals misled the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or if there were errors, procedural lapses, process failures or whatever by individuals, who is held to account in the university?  It does not seem on the face of it that anybody was, except there was a consolidation of positions.</p> <p>  In any event we have these 42 recommendations, and I am just looking for guidance on how we deal with it.  Perhaps this will depend on when the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes.  Is this the basis on which we will bring in the Accounting Officer?  Should we do it before that?  I do not know.  We have this internal audit review which is being implemented as we speak.  We will have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I imagine, sometime in the summer or perhaps before it.</p></speech>

I expect to get it early next week and to review it and get it out to the university for a response.  We are probably looking at a period of two months to finalise it.  I expect to have a report in May.  It will then go to the Department, of course, and we will talk to the Department about getting it submitted as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

We will seek a copy of that report in the meantime, and we will come back to the other one.  When we get the Crowe Howarth report we can discuss the matter further and we will keep this topic on the agenda.</p> <p>  Nos. 1072B and 1073B were received from the Comptroller and Auditor General and we discussed them briefly at our last meeting.  One is a note relating to audit of compliance with public procurement rules and on salary and pension overpayments in 2016.  We discussed this and we have written to the HSE seeking figures on salary and pension overpayments in that organisation.  We had a discussion on overpayments at our last meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General gave us an information note on audit of compliance with public procurement rules because it was evident at our last meeting that references of non-compliance with public procurement rules and various accounts were sample figures and not the total figure.  We asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide in due course the figure and a summary extracting the information.</p></speech>

It is a bit like the salary overpayments.  It is fine just talking about what is in front of us, but we are looking for the full picture.  We acknowledge it will take a bit of time.  We will note this correspondence even though we had a discussion on them at our last meeting, and I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to keep us informed.</p> <p>  No. 1075B was received from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE.  This is a follow up request by the committee regarding correspondence submitted to the committee concerning legal costs and open disclosure.  We mentioned it last week.  I propose we note the correspondence for now and agree to have a representative from the HSE at our meeting when we discuss this issue with the State Claims Agency.  In fairness, the letter is five pages long covering plans and procurements, but there no scintilla of an outcome on what we are talking about in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#B02500"><p>It started a pilot project in 2010 and it is now 2018.  It speaks about a culture of openness and transparency built into the HSE's governance for quality and patient safety.  Unless what we are routinely seeing coming through are very historical cases there is not a great deal of evidence it is translating into anything.</p><p>An evaluation of the pilot has been done by Dr. Jane Pillinger.  I have not looked at that document yet.  This letter tells us about international experience.  This is a very sizeable amount of money.</p></speech>

Maybe we also need to look at the evidence from that evaluation as part of it so that we would have the HSE, the State Claims Agency and perhaps Dr. Jane Pillinger before the committee first.  It would not necessarily be on a different day, but we might have a more informed discussion on how we can move it on because they are evaluating something that is of direct relevance to what we are discussing.</p></speech>

I do not know what is in it.  I have not looked at it yet.  If that is circulated, it will be on our correspondence list for the next meeting.</p></speech>

We asked for it and we got it.  It is an outline and I welcome that.  They do provide the information.  They rolled it out in a pilot project in two big cities, Cork and Dublin, and there is an evaluation of that, which was referred to and I will not repeat that.  We do not know operationally on the ground how many other hospitals it has been rolled out to and how it has been done.</p> <p>  There is a contract to solicitors, the Office of Legal Services implemented a new contract for the provision of corporate and operational legal services with nine solicitor firms.  It is on the first page of their letter or page two of the document before us.  I would like to know more about that.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General advise us on how that was done and what mechanism was used?  It is stated in the letter, "the Office of Legal Services implemented a new contract for the provision of corporate and operational legal services with nine solicitor member firms nationally".</p></speech>

It was never good practice and they never moved from that, so there was one firm advising Galway City Council for many years.

Is there scope for more?  I do not know.  It must be put in context for me so that I might understand.</p></speech>

We will also get the other draft report which she mentioned.  We all know that the vast majority of cases are in the area of obstetrics.  One would assume that 70% or 80% of all claims would be in that area.  One would assume that they would have concentrated on those maternity and obstetric hospitals in the first place.</p></speech>

Second, we will circulate the report of the pilot project by Dr. Jane Pillinger.  We will keep it on our agenda.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1076B from Mr John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation regarding follow up information requested at the meeting regarding the revaluation process in County Laois. We note that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1077B from Dr Graham Love of the Higher Education Authority, dated 9 February 2018.  Dr Love encloses the review of intellectual property and the management of conflicts of interest in relation to intellectual property.  Members may need some time to look at this.  There is a short piece and a more substantial document of 50 or 60 pages.  Members may wish to review it and return to the matter.</p></speech>

Looking back to when we first dealt with this matter and, as a committee, put a spotlight on this issue, we might remind ourselves that we were told by the HEA that there was no problem and nothing to see.  I felt there was pushback against members of this committee even asking questions.  The attitude was pretty much one that we should keep our hands off this issue, that members did not understand it, that it was very complex, that commercialising intellectual property is much more complex than we could have imagined, and so on.  That tone troubled me at the time.  Far from there being nothing to see here, we now have a report which shows that there was a lack of uniformity, to say the least, across the institutes, that the policy in some areas was quite weak, and that conflicts of interest in that area needed to be strengthened.  The report makes recommendations which I think are good and which will strengthen the ability of institutes of technology and universities to protect themselves as well as taxpayers.  All of that is to the good.</p> <p>  A separate report into Waterford is imminent.  We also sought an analysis from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others on how much money is spent by the State in supporting intellectual property and commercialising intellectual property.</p></speech>

We had a discussion on this last time and I think it was accepted that it was not as difficult as was being suggested.  We will have to come back to it at some point, maybe we should wait until the report comes from Waterford, but Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the HEA are all players in this.  We now have a report which makes changes and which came about as a result of the work of this committee.  I still have a number of questions.  I am not satisfied that all the concerns that we raised have been dealt with sufficiently in the report.</p> <p>  I will also put it on record that it is quite interesting that this report, the generic one, has been published and then we will have a Waterford report.  We cannot pre-empt what will be in that but it is somewhat similar to what has happened in other areas of the third level sector.  There was a "Prime Time" programme which highlighted issues on accountability, and the Minister published a report which said the Department was going to make changes.  Then our report came out.  The Department can point to its report and say that it is dealing with the matter already.  An element of that is going on in the HEA.</p> <p>  We have to come back to it.  We cannot merely bookend it and say that we have the reports and that is it.  Issues remain.  I propose that once we have the Waterford report and this national review of all institutes, we return to it.  I ask that Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, some of the third level institutes and the HEA would come before the committee and we would do a session on the matter because it seems to be very much geared toward the commercialisation part of it, and there seems to be a bias towards the enterprise side of it rather than protecting the institutes.  Several members have expressed concerns in that regard.  Questions remain to be asked.  That is my sense of it.</p></speech>

We stumbled across this rather than there having been forensic questioning.  The more we stumbled and asked questions, the more worried we became at its <i>ad hoc </i>nature.</p><p>However, the worst part for me was the attitude that one should not ask questions, that this was good and that we should just run with it.  I agree fully that we should put this back on our agenda and look at it because I have not looked in detail at the full report.  I have read the letters but have not read the report in detail.  I think we might need help with this as well just like we got help with the document before us today.  In due course, we might need help to tease this out.  Last week or the week before, universities were referred to under the census as market producers.  The Chairman might recall that.  </p></speech>

The attitude of the universities and other third-level institutions when they appeared before us very much ties in the view of "market good, everything good, no questions."  I will not repeat myself.  We should look at it.  We probably need help with it.</p></speech>

Very often, industry wants to locate close to universities and does that for a range of different reasons.  Much of it has to do with partnering with universities.  There is no doubt there is a benefit and there can be a two-way benefit.  A lot of that is very desirable.  However, I was less than impressed with the HEA.  I thought it was very underwhelming in terms of its contributions at the committee.  We are relying on it to evaluate something it was not great at.  I agree with Deputy Connolly in that regard.  It may well be an academic who can do this but I would like to see an international comparator about how this is handled in other countries because we need to compare it to something else or somewhere else where there is something in the same family and where there is good practice.  I am quite sure that one of the business schools will have carried out some work in that area.  It is a bit ironic to ask an academic to input into something like this but I think we might not be getting a good look at the way we should be progressing on this by relying exclusively on the HEA.</p></speech>

As one of those who asked the questions and took an active interest in this, I want to put on the record that an awful lot of good work is being done by universities and institutes of technology in research and development, co-location and commercialising intellectual property.  None of that is bad.  Legitimate questions were asked about process, conflicts of interest and how the companies are established.  The point was that I felt we were being pushed back a bit on what were genuine concerns.  We now have two reports that verify those concerns.  They are a vindication of the questions we were asking.  The HEA was asleep at the wheel when it came to this issue because it was, essentially, throwing it back to Science Foundation Ireland.  I think Knowledge Transfer Ireland is the body that looks at it.  It possibly had a role but certainly the HEA has a role from a governance perspective and it allowed a situation to arise where there were different policies in different institutes of technology and universities.  Some were good while others were not so good.  If we now have more uniformity and a strengthened policy that underpins this, that is for the good.  The HEA should reflect on the fact that the questions we put are for the good because we want to see an improvement and if we get an improvement here, that will be good.  When we raised this issue previously, I was inundated with emails from people who work in this area telling me that we do not fully understand it and are being anti-enterprise and negative.  That is not the case.  At all times, we recognised that there is huge benefit to institutes of technology and universities engaging in research and development and with the private sector and individuals within those institutions commercialising their intellectual property.  None of that was seen as bad.  Genuine concerns were raised that have been dealt with to some extent but I do not think they have been dealt with fully.</p></speech>

We received and considered the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and rejected it.  It just said it was impossible to do it.  The Revenue Commissioners expect people to do it if they are looking for tax credits.  It appears that the public service has not been on top of this.</p> <p>  No. 1077B, the note we received with this correspondence, is from the director of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, Alison Campbell.  We just asked a simple question about a spin-out project currently being considered for 2018.  It was a simple question and we received a half-page reply.  It states that it is at various stages of maturation and that any list of spin-out prospects will necessarily be larger than any number of prospects that ultimately launch spin offs.  We know that.  The note stated that the list of spin-outs being considered for 2018 is a snapshot at a point in time.  That is all we asked for.  The note said that in the timescale for response to the request from the committee, it was not possible to gather details of the number of spin-out opportunities under consideration across the 21 higher education authorities.  That is a clear admission that it does not have that information, which is shocking in its own right.  The note goes on to say that details can be included by way of a follow-on so we wait to receive that.  We will ask for that.  The note said that due to commercial sensitivity, the names of the technologies cannot be made public.  That is fine.  The note said that by way of context, the annual knowledge transfer survey showed that Ireland is creating an average of 26 to 30 new spin-out companies per annum from its 21 higher education authorities and a further five research performing organisations, RPOs.  The committee can see there is quite a bit in there.  Members can see that we asked a simple question and Knowledge Transfer Ireland said it did not have the information and would try to find it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was asked how much money was going in and it told us it did not know.  </p></speech>

It is dated 5 February 2018, was received from an individual and relates to a data breach at KBC Bank.  It is not within the remit of the committee to look at it.  I propose, therefore, that, in order to be helpful, we provide the individual with details of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will note the correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1069C which is dated 7 February 2018 and was received from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement.  He is responding to a statement made by UCD on the ability of his office to support the needs of the university.  He is clearly not in agreement with UCD on the matter.  Rather than get into it now, we will allow the correspondence to come up during our engagement with the Office of Government Procurement.  The meeting is included in our work programme and we will discuss the matter with the office on that occasion.  We should also publish the correspondence in the meantime in order that UCD can at least see the response to its criticism of the Office of Government Procurement.  We will allow both items of correspondence to be included in the public record and people can judge them accordingly because there is a disagreement.  </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1070C which is dated 7 February 2018 and was received from Ms Elizabeth Mullan, solicitor to the Charleton tribunal, acknowledging the receipt of transcripts from the Committee of Public Accounts forwarded by the secretariat.  The correspondence will be noted.  </p> <p>  For the benefit of those who wonder what the Committee of Public Accounts does, we have done a lot of important work in the past year or so.  I want to touch on an item of correspondence which is directly related to that point in order to demonstrate how important the work we have done is.  It is from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, in respect of its inquiry into matters in the Garda College in Templemore.  The commission is seeking our assistance and the documentation and correspondence with which we have dealt.  It is an issue which was highlighted here and is now the subject of a GSOC inquiry.  Prior to today we also received correspondence from the disclosures tribunal under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charleton.  We were also happy to deal with that request and supply everything which had been sought.  Matters discussed here are now the subject matter of the Charleton tribunal.  </p> <p>  We also received correspondence from the commission of investigation under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Cooke which was dealing with NAMA and Project Eagle.  We have been assisting and supporting that inquiry in dealing with all of its requests for information.  It is another item with which we have dealt extensively.  </p> <p>  We have also dealt extensively with the commission of inquiry into the Grace case and related cases under the chairmanship of Ms Marjorie Farrelly, SC.  We are assisting the commission by providing information.  I realise this is a new departure and I have been in the House a few years.  So much of what has come to us has fed into these four separate tribunals or commissions of investigation.  It shows that we are dealing with very important issues of public interest.</p></speech>

There are politicians - Members of the Houses - who say on late night television shows that we are going beyond what we should be doing and criticising us for doing so.

We now take it as routine, but it is very serious.  I have highlighted it because we are dealing with the particular item of correspondence.  We are assisting the inquiries in every way we can.  We will note the correspondence.</p> <p>  The item of correspondence is No. 1071C which is dated 7 Februrary 2018 and from Mr. Stephen Tierney, designated officer in GSOC.  It relates to a request to forward to GSOC all documentation received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the committee&rsquo;s examination of the Garda College in Templemore.  GSOC is investigating financial fraud allegations at the training college. The secretariat prepared the documentation requested which has been given to GSOC.   We will note the correspondence.  It feeds into what I said.  There was some documentation which we had received as part of our work and considered but which we chose not to publish at the time.  We have now sent all of it to GSOC to assist it in its inquiry.  We will continue to assist it in any we can.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1074C which received from Deputy Catherine Murphy requesting that the committee look for a copy of the Crowe Howarth report on the University of Limerick.  We have covered that issue and are asking for a copy of the report.</p></speech>

Members should note that, as the individual was concerned about preserving his anonymity, we have redacted identifying details.  I propose that we write to the Department and copy the letter to UCC for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When we receive a reply, we will forward it on.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1080C which is dated 8 February 2018 and was received from the Irish Council Against Blood Sports questioning the accuracy of the figures provided by Bord na gCon for attendances at greyhound tracks and the numbers employed in the industry.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.  The group has a particular point of view.  We are not required to take any particular action. </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1082C which was received from Mr. Fred McBride, chief executive of Tusla, providing a response on a matter raised by an individual about the non-publishing of a report.  I propose that we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who contacted the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item on our agenda is statements of accounts received since our last meeting.  It is a short list.  There is only one item on it today - the 2016 accounts of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner which state there was a turnover of &euro;4.7 million.  There was a clear audit opinion.  We will note the accounts.  They are available in the Oireachtas Library if any member wants to receive a copy.  </p> <p>  We will move on to-----</p></speech>

We will write to UCC and forward a copy to the Department of Education and Skills.  We will come back to the issue.  </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is our work programme.  There is a revised work programme on screen.  It was updated sometime yesterday evening.  There were earlier drafts during the course of the week.  After the public session we will go into private session to be briefed on the issue of corporation tax by Dr. Brian Keegan from Chartered Accountants Ireland.  We will also discuss the first document prepared by the secretariat for our periodic report to the end of December, a copy of which has been circulated.  I stress it is not a draft document of the committee but a working document produced by the secretariat.  Anyone who draws conclusions from it will be off the beaten track.  The committee has yet to consider it.  Next week we will meet Dr. Keegan in public session.  In the afternoon we will also meet officials of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to discuss the issue of corporation tax.  That will probably bring our discussions on that specific topic to a conclusion.  If we have time before next week's voting block, we might try to sign off on the periodic report.  We will have a discussion on it today and will have an hour to consider it next week.  We will try to sign off on it, with a view to launching it at the beginning of March.  </p> <p>  On Thursday, 1 March, we will discuss the Galway art house cinema project, on which there is a specific chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will have officials of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht before the committee on that day.</p></speech>

We will have the Appropriation Account for 2016.  The local government fund will be included as it is a substantial source of funds for local authorities.  There is a special report on motor taxation which feeds into funding of local authorities.  When dealing with central government funding of local authorities, I propose that we address the Appropriation Accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the parent Department.  We will also have at that meeting a very senior representative from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland because up to 15% of all funding to local authorities comes from that Department.</p><p> When those officials are in, we may also deal with the motor taxation account special report as a separate item.  The principal funding sources for local government are the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the local government fund, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  If we discussed funding of local government without having the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport represented or dealing with the local government fund, we would not have the complete picture.  Given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport representatives will be here - and motor taxation was generally collected through local authorities but has now gone to the Department, a matter on which a special report was issued - we will deal with all of that on one day as motor tax is the key element of the local government fund at this stage.</p><p> Will the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us who is responsible for the local government fund?</p></speech>

There have obviously been changes relating to local property tax and a phasing out of that over the last few years.  I am not sure that there is even such a thing as a local government fund now.  The Chairman has mentioned a number of different streams of funding to local authorities in addition to those generated locally.  About five years ago, the Council of Europe came to look at how Ireland funded its local authorities and went away having made no sense of it.  That speaks volumes.  How can there be transparency when one cannot make sense of who does what?  It would be useful to ask the Department to provide a note on the progression of how local authorities are funded and what elements fund them.</p></speech>

We go back to the needs and resources model for distribution and that is largely still in place with regard to the issue I have raised about baselines which are set by local authorities that do not factor in population growth at all.  There was a ring-fenced fund for motor tax receipts.  That has been phased out.  There is not really a local government fund any longer but a redistribution of the 20% that comprises the equalisation fund for the local property tax.  The more complicated something is made, the more public frustration there is with it.  One cannot then make sense of it and loses things in the middle of it that we should be picking up.

Local authorities are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  There is separate auditing.  The principal funder is the Department and then there is the local government fund.  We are dealing with the accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Within that are water, property tax and a range of other issues.  I do not want to go to do a lot of research and work from my office, have many questions to ask and then to be told that the Department cannot answer those questions and that it is a matter for local authorities.  That happened with RT&Eacute;, which I will raise again in a few minutes.  We had that with JobPath when the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was in, and it was a big chunk of their budget.  It said that it could not answer those questions, that it signed a cheque, that there was a service-level agreement and that we should go off to look at that.  What are the parameters of this?</p> <p>  As part of the briefing note that was requested, I want information on how public housing is funded.  Where does the money come from?  We have the Housing Agency and other entities.  There are questions relating to whether that will go on the balance sheet.  That is a big issue.  There are other strands in the areas of planning and community, such as grant aid.  I imagine we will be told that that is grant aid and how that money is spent is a matter for the organisations to which the money is given.  I do not want those to be stonewalled and for us to be told that those questions cannot be answered because it is not a matter for Accounting Officers in those Departments and that it is for other entities for which separate auditing is done.  I am pre-empting that possibility.  Can we get some sense of what we can or cannot ask and what we can or cannot deal with?  We will make our own minds up as to whether we can ask them.  The Chairman gets my point.  We do not want to waste our time.</p></speech>

There is clearly a day of work in this local government matter, a morning and an afternoon, not that we will separate them.  We will have to plan our work schedule for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#F02000"><p>I agree with Deputy Cullinane and Deputy Murphy about the need for a real discussion on this.  This layer of government is the most important in people's every day lives.  We deal with headline figures here.  It is this level of government that we rely on for implementation of policy relating to housing, roads - which we discussed this week - or a new strand of social policy that local government is involved in.  I agree with my colleagues that we should have clarity of thought before these witnesses came in.  The worst thing would be to get bogged down in a quagmire that would suit the witnesses down to the ground, to run down the clock all day.  I know Deputy Murphy has said that it is a complicated layer of funding to work out and she is right but at the same time there is a Houdini act going on as was mentioned with regard to the local government fund, which no longer exists.</p><p>More Houdini tricks were pulled with the introduction of the local property tax whereby aspects that had previously been funded by the Department would become self-funded, as it were, by the councils.</p><p> The Chairman and Deputy Murphy mentioned progression, but I will tell them what that progression has been.  The Chairman stated that he wanted the principal funders to appear before us and make themselves answerable.  If so, we had better invite IBEC or some business representative to attend on the same day as well, given that 36% of all local government funding comes from the business people and SMEs of this country.  The past ten years have seen a 10% increase in the income derived from rates because local government has been starved of central funding like a mangy dog.  Income from rates has increased from a percentage in the mid-20s to 36% and now amounts to &euro;1.5 billion.  The Valuation Office appeared before us a couple of weeks ago, but we might as well have had my children in answering questions, seeing as how no one would take responsibility.  The Valuation Office told us it was the Department's responsibility.  When we asked the departmental official who was sitting here at the time, we were told that it was the Minister's responsibility.  I am not spending a day doing that in a couple of weeks' time with no one taking responsibility for the questions we ask.</p><p> I agree with the Chairman.  Let us bring everyone in, but some of the chief funders of local government are businesses.  IBEC and others emailed us about the pressures they were under on the day the Valuation Office appeared before us, although it was a pity they did so a bit late.  I would like to see representatives of business owners appear before us to discuss the imposition upon them.  When one considers that rates account for 36% of overall income, the local property tax pales into insignificance.</p><p> When we put it to Mr. Paul Lemass on the day that local government structures were underfunded, I was worried when he said - members can check the record - that there would be a reappraisal of the property tax, providing an opportunity to bring in more funding.  We are entering a dangerous sphere.</p><p> This is a big day for our committee.  The Department has the most impact, not just on ordinary people's lives but on business people and employers as well.  Business representatives should be present on the day, given that they are one of the chief income suppliers of local government.  In that way, we could have a debate in the round as to how local government is funded, where the money is going and what we are doing.</p><p> Deputy Cullinane mentioned the quagmire in funding for housing.  In my county a few weeks ago, &euro;11.2 million was supplied in a grant by the Department.  There was a big announcement.  Only 40 houses are being built, though.  That works out at nearly &euro;300,000 per house for social housing.  Something is wrong, and it is that site acquisition was built into the cost of each house.  When the council applied for the site acquisition cost, it was told the amount would be given to it, but only as part of the delivery of the 40 houses.  We will have many questions for these people on the day.</p></speech>

However, inviting IBEC and businesses to attend would not be appropriate.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from, but they do not fall under our remit.  Neither do the local authorities, unfortunately.  However, the Departments and clarity on the money that is going out do fall under our remit.  That is of essence and is where we should be putting our energy.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on housing.  Like other Deputies, I hear repeatedly that there is no problem with money for housing, yet no houses are being built in Galway.  It is a serious problem on which we need clarity.  However, it should not require a full day.  As I understand it, there is no role for businesses to attend and discuss rates.</p></speech>

I will be a bit broad, since we deal with central government funding.  A part of the formula that determines how much goes to local government from central government probably includes a calculation of what the latter estimates has been raised locally via rates bills.

If a council had a staff of 2,000, that was a need that had to be resourced.  If it had four swimming pools, that was a need that had to be resourced.  If it had two swimming pools but needed four, it would never get the others because it did not already have them.  That is the kind of nonsense to be found in the needs and resources model.  It does not factor in any population change.  There have been three censuses of population and major demographic shifts since it was introduced.  Places exist now that did not even exist at the time, so they cannot be counted.  It has nothing to do with the rates base.</p></speech>

Built into the design of the local property tax system is the self-funding element, which is the Houdini trick that was mentioned.

Some of the frustrations that we have already heard will be multiplied by 50 on the day if we all go off, prepare and come back only to be told that we cannot deal with those issues.  The Accounting Officer will say that he is accountable for the money that is transferred and, after that point, the money becomes a matter for the organisations.  Consider some of the issues.  We will be told that rates are a matter for local authorities, water services are a matter for Irish Water, property tax is a matter for Revenue, local government funding is a matter for the local authorities, housing is a matter for the housing agencies and the local authorities, motor tax is now a matter for someone else and goes into Exchequer funding, and community services are grant aided via various organisations, etc.  If that happens on the day, you will have a difficult day as Chairman because we will all be frustrated.

The sector accounts for 37% of the overall contribution, having increased by 10% in the past decade, but the Department has starved one side.  Last year, for the first time in many years, many city councils increased their rates because there was a bit of buoyancy which allowed them to do so.  Populations are getting bigger and more is being demanded of councillors and officials, who are now under some pressure.  The only place they can get a bit of extra income is to increase rates.  I accept what Deputies Cullinane, Murphy and Connolly said about our remit and what can be examined, but they are getting off the hook by putting it onto this sector.  Over the past ten years it has grown from under &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion and it is only going to get worse.  We are discussing central government funding to a sector and there is scope to examine it on the day.  They say over one third has nothing to do with them and is simply contributing to running costs, but we are missing a trick.</p></speech>

They went from the Vote to the local government fund to the local authorities.  Motor tax was going into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, out to the National Roads Authority, and then on to the local authorities.

When we dealt with the education sector, we had the Department, the education and training boards, ETBs, and the HEA in the room at the one time.</p> <p>  The next item is the overview of public private partnerships, which will be after St. Patrick's Day, on 22 March.  We propose to bring in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, because it sets the policy, the Department of Education and Skills, which is one of the biggest users of PPPs, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the principal user, and the National Development Finance Agency.  I want a letter to go from this committee to each of those organisations because I know what will happen otherwise.  They will talk about commercial sensitivity so that we can discuss nothing.  I do not know how far we will get but we can certainly get farther than a response such as that.  I propose we write to each of them asking them to provide as much financial information as they can by way of a briefing note a fortnight in advance of the meeting.  In particular, we will ask them to justify their inability to give us full commercial details of any contract more than five years old.  Commercial sensitivity might be valid at a certain point in time but not for ever.  This will give us the opportunity to consider the information before we have the public meeting.</p> <p>  We are holding over 29 March for the third level sector.  There are three or four different topics but we will not come to them today.  On 19 April, it will be the Department of Finance to discuss Government debt and the Exchequer outturn for the year, which is a key ingredient of our work.  On 26 April, we have the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of its IT system, on which there is a special chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will deal with the Garda internal audit report on its IT contracts on that day too.</p> <p>  On 3 May, we have Vote 29 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, particularly in relation to RT&Eacute;, which is substantially funded.  Deputy Cullinane is keen on this but on the day the Department was here it said it was obliged to have a service level agreement in place with RT&Eacute; and that it received &euro;170 million each year, the majority of its funding.  The Department has failed in its duty to do its work so the Committee of Public Accounts will do the job.  There is widespread agreement because the majority of its funding is from public funds and it is appropriate to bring the organisation in on that basis.  We will not get into anything about its editorial content as it is not in our remit.  We are going to discuss the financial aspects of the organisation.</p></speech>

Some of those items are in the report but we will have to see how we marry the two issues.</p> <p>  The following items are all to be confirmed.  On 10 May, it is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there are several gaps in the schedule after that.  Towards the end of June we will have the National Treasury Management Agency because its 2017 accounts should be out by then.  On 28 June, we will have Revenue back to discuss chapters in the report of the Comptroller and General relating to the tax appeals office.  Before we break up, we will have the HSE's financial statement for 2017.  The HSE is normally very good and has this ready by May or June.  On 12 July, we have financial reporting in the public service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  There are issues not on the list to which we have to come back.  We might deal with the Courts Service through the Department of Justice and Equality.  There was an issue about conflicts of interest regarding the fair deal scheme but the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority has dealt specifically with the correspondence that came to us on that.  The ETBs, Cork Institute of Technology, third level spin-off companies and the Thorn report on consultants' pay are all tied into third level education.  We have mentioned RT&Eacute;, and the Office of Government Procurement is on our list.</p> <p>  That concludes our discussion on the work programme.</p><p> We have completed our public business for today.  Our next public meeting will be held on Thursday, 22 February when we will continue our consideration of chapter 20 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on corporation tax.  We will be joined for the morning session by Dr. Brian Keegan from Chartered Accountants Ireland who will be followed by officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in the afternoon.</p></speech>

It is a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputy Alan Kelly whom I welcome to the meeting.  I welcome again the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials.  We adjourned yesterday after a lengthy debate on amendment No. 1 proposed by the Minister, which is part of a group of amendments, Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive.  The amendment proposes the insertion of a new section.  As I indicated yesterday, if the amendment is agreed, amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, cannot be moved.  I believe we completed our debate on the new section.  Deputy Jack Chambers has indicated he wishes to make a point. </p></speech>

The first proposal, in amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Mick Wallace, is to extend the time during which sales will be permitted to 7 p.m.  I support this proposal and ask the Minister to consider it before the Report Stage debate.</p> <p>  A second proposal by Deputy Wallace would ensure breweries that are unable to provide guided tours are not prohibited from selling their product to customers.  This proposal should be reflected in the Bill before it is passed and I will support on Report Stage any amendment by the Minister or Deputy Wallace to give effect to it.   </p></speech>

It makes sense to allow smaller breweries and distilleries to provide off-sales.  It is reasonable to argue that such a provision would assist tourism.  I also support the amendment to extend the permissible opening time by one hour.</p></speech>

We can address these issues on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

As we heard on the news today, pubs in rural areas need to generate income of between &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 per week to stay open.  Deputy Mick Wallace stated yesterday that he comes from a rural part of County Wexford.  We should provide as much support as possible to pubs in rural areas.  I fully support breweries offering tours but, as I stated yesterday, we should take small rather than big steps.  The main reason I support the Bill is that it will encourage tourism and job creation.</p></speech>

We are united on the need to address this anomaly and the majority of us are coming to the same conclusions on two other issues.  I do not have a problem with the proposal to extend to 7 p.m. the time during which off-sales would be permitted.  One minor issue that remains to be addressed is the sale of products below the wholesale price.  We must deal with this matter on Report Stage.  I share the views expressed by other Deputies on it.  I propose that we accept the Government amendment and address the two other issues on Report Stage.  I will be willing to work with other Deputies and departmental officials on drafting amendments that would meet the requirements.</p></speech>

Diageo and Heineken account for more than 99% of the beer products sold in pubs.  We were approached by a large brewery which tried to bribe us.  It promised us X amount free per month if we included their beers and excluded Irish craft beers from the provisions.  That is the truth.  The large breweries have an incredible stranglehold on the industry.  The <i>status quo</i>is that Diageo and Heineken have complete control of the market.  They invest money, create banners and so on and get young people into drinking.  They have played a major role in alcohol becoming a serious problem in this country.  Most Deputies agree that promoting craft beer and small breweries will lead us to a better rather than a worse place in terms of our approach to alcohol.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will get a broader flavour of the disposition of Members of the House during the Report Stage debate.  However, in saying we can revisit issues on Report Stage, I do not want to raise expectations.</p><p>When Deputy Wallace talks about facilitating people who "call around", that is his terminology, that may differ somewhat from the purpose of the Bill, which Deputy Kelly described in 2016 as being to facilitate visitors on guided tours to tourist attractions.  That is a little at variance with people calling around to stock up from off-sales and treating the facility as an off-licence, I would be concerned about that but we will return to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is disingenuous of him to present the situation as if Deputy Kelly and I are in different places because we are in agreement that-----</p></speech>

I thank the Department for its help and co-operation which was always available to me on this.</p> <p>  We will deal with one or two issues on Report Stage but many craft brewers are waiting for this legislation.  In fairness to the Minister he has met several of them and supports this.  I would like everyone's help in scheduling this in as short a space of time as possible so that it can go to the Seanad.  Many of these breweries are waiting to take up investments, create jobs and develop their products when this legislation is passed.</p></speech>

For this reason amendment No. 8 inserts a commencement provision in the form of a new subsection (2) in section 3 of the Bill, which is not dissimilar to many such provisions in many Bills coming before this committee.  In moving this amendment I am mindful of the comments made by Deputy Kelly, which I am sure are echoed around the table.  It is my desire that this legislation, if enacted, will come into force on the earliest possible date and I wish to assure members of the committee of that.  Notwithstanding that, I am advised this technical amendment is necessary.  </p></speech>

I tried to identify those necessary to preserve the procedures committee, which I think is a decision we agreed.  Amendment No. 162 relates to that.  I will try to indicate those amendments I will be opposing and those I will be supporting as I go on.</p><p>In respect of amendment Nos. 157 and 160, which are related, these are amendments proposed by Dr. Patrick O'Brien, who was referred to in previous sessions.  We have had a debate recently about the Government requiring, or at least the perception that it requires, discretion in relation to appointments.  I refer to the conflict between that and the desire to have a fully transparent process with the judicial appointments commission making as much of the decision as possible.</p><p>Where the person appointed to judicial office is not a person who was recommended by the judicial appointments commission, amendment No. 157 requires that a reasoned written decision would be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il </i>explaining the reason for that person's appointment outside of the judicial appointments commission process.  Similarly, amendment No. 160 relates to the placing of a statement before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 30 days of that appointment giving a written decision as to why a person was appointed who was not nominated by the commission.  There is clear and obvious sense to it.  Whatever the arguments about constitutionality, if the committee accepts the case that the Government must have a greater degree of discretion than the judicial appointment commission provides to it, then in the exceptionally rare circumstances that people would be appointed outside this process the Oireachtas and the public deserve to have an understanding as to why this was the case.  This provides for that.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 157 would require a proposed new subsection (2), the publication in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il </i>of a reasoned written explanation of any decision.  In addition, under the proposed new subsection (3), the persons who are recommended by the commission must not be identified in such publication.  My difficulty is that the amendment would require the Government to explain in writing the hows and wherefores of why, in any particular instance, the advice given to the President in regard to an appointment may concern a candidate other than the one actually recommended by the commission.  It, therefore, puts a clear onus and responsibility on the Government to justify actions taken on foot of the exercise of what is a constitutional provision.  There is that problem but aside from that, I am not sure what the value or benefit of such an amendment might be, and what its practical impact might be in terms of fairness to all those involved in the process, be they a recommended candidate or a candidate that did not make the cut.  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said, that it is a desire on his part for increased transparency around the process of how, in what circumstances and in what way the Government would advise the President as to the appointment.  I have said this before and rather than delaying the committee's proceedings, I reiterate that my position is the same.  As a fundamental position, I cannot support any amendment that might give the impression or be perceived to undermine what is a clear constitutional prerogative on the part of the Government in the matter of judicial appointments.</p><p>Similarly, on amendment No. 160, I see it as compromising, interfering or even undermining the manner in which the constitutional position, where the Government is free to reject the recommendation of the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021500002#E00400"><p>Deputy Jack Chambers and I will support amendments Nos. 157 and 160, partly because there is a similar provision in our own legislation which has passed Second Stage.  I note the Minister says he is opposed to it because he thinks that it is constitutionally frail and could impinge on the prerogative of the Government to nominate individuals for appointment.  That point is valid in regard to amendments Nos. 150 and 151, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, which we voted down.  I am not sure that their suggestions were unconstitutional but I had concerns if the Government was told that it must select, and could only select, a person from the three names given to the Government by the commission.  That is on the borderline of constitutionality.  However, what is proposed in amendments Nos. 157 and 160 is different.  What is proposed there is that the commission gives the three names to the Government.  Under the Minister's proposal in the legislation, as drafted, all that is required is that if the Government does not select one of those three names, it must publish that fact in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;l</i>.  That is exactly the same as the current position, so there is no substantive change in the law.  It is appropriate that if the Government makes a decision that it is not going to appoint one of the three people nominated, that it should provide a reasoned explanation as to why it is not doing so.  It does not involve referring to the individuals who have not been appointed.  If, say, Jack Chambers was appointed but he was not one of the three on the list, the Minister or the Government should say that Mr. Justice Chambers was appointed, although he was not nominated by the commission, and it should explain the reason it selected him.  Maybe he has particular expertise in medical legal law and the Government needed an expert in that area to hear many cases or perhaps he has an expertise in the Irish language and there was a vacancy in the area and we needed more expertise in the Irish language.  It is not something that is difficult to do.  If we do not have that, we will have gone through all this process of putting in a new structure when, ultimately, there will be no change from the current situation.  For those reasons, we will support the amendments.</p></speech>

I ought to have acknowledged that he had included this in his original Bill, although it was brought to my attention via Dr. Patrick O'Brien.  We have had a debate around whether or not the Government could be constrained.  I am not convinced that it is unconstitutional but we have arrived at a decision in regard to that.  What this does is clearly quite different.  It tries to ensure that there is an incentive for the Government not to ride roughshod over the process, and to ensure that it is not too easy for Government to constantly go outside the process.  The process is very clear.  If the Government sees a compelling reason for appointing someone to a particular position, a person who was not considered by the judicial appointments commission, it is at liberty to do so but it is absolutely reasonable that it be required to justify that and give a reason in the process that is outlined in the amendment.  It is standard enough in legislation and in many processes for a Minister or Government to make a statement.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I have listened to both Deputies.  I am wondering what type of reason is envisaged.  What might the reason be and in what form might the publication take?  Deputy O'Callaghan gave an example of the appointment of his colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers, but what kind of reason would he see as being appropriate should Deputy Chambers not be the subject of a recommendation?  In what detail would the notice be required?  I am concerned that we will have entered constraining territory, from the Government's point of view and constitutionally.</p></speech>

Surely, if the Minister is trying to reform the process, there is a need to provide explanation and further detail.  That is in Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's drafting.  No person will be identified.  It is a case of formalising and opening up the process in the context of transparency.  Perhaps the Minister can provide further detail on how he believes this would impinge constitutionally, apart from saying that it has constitutional implications.  The committee should know what exactly these are in the Minister's view.</p> <p>  I can understand the position in respect of the previous amendment if the only recommendation has to be that someone would be appointed by Government or "the Government shall" appoint a particular person.  That certainly has constitutional implications but I am unsure how this drafting would have any constitutional implications.</p></speech>

It only happens exceptionally, although it happened recently.  This would be the position under the legislation we are discussing.  Let us suppose that the commission nominates three and the Government decides not to accept and opts to nominate another individual instead..

It has not been previously discussed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021500002#G03000"><p>I move amendment No. 174:</p><blockquote>In page 37, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&ldquo;(f) the need for each Court to have members of the judiciary who are proficient in the Irish language,&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Every person in the country is entitled to have his or her case heard through Irish if he or she so wishes.  That means that there has to be proficiency in the Irish language within each court.  It certainly does not mean that one can only be appointed a judge if one can speak Irish.  The vast majority of people appointed as judges will not be able to hear cases in Irish, but it is important that each court has within it judges proficient in the language in order that the constitutional right of citizens to have their cases heard through the national language can be vindicated.</p></speech>

I outlined my position during that discussion and it has not changed.  I am not in a position to support the amendment.  There is nothing in section 55 that would prevent the procedures committee from considering whether proficiency in the Irish language was required or needed for appointment to a particular judicial office.  I am, therefore, not inclined to accept the amendment.  Even if I was so inclined, I do not believe this is the appropriate section in which to include such a provision since the subsection deals with selection procedures in the statement.  Section 55(6), on the other hand, deals with skills and attributes, issues we discussed at length when we discussed amendments included in a previous grouping.  That might be a better fit for such a provision.  However, I am not minded to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I thank members for their contributions.  We have had a very in-depth discussion over a number of meetings, and it is clear that members have highlighted differing views on a number of important aspects of the Bill.  The committee has amended certain components, sections and parts of the Bill in a significant way.</p> <p>  Arising from our deliberations, and I am sure this will come as no surprise to the Chairman, we still have much work to do on a number of elements of the Bill in the context of looking at approaches, acknowledging amendments we have made and taking stock as to how best we might approach matters prior to and on Report Stage.  During the course of the debate, I made a number of commitments that I would, on behalf of the Government, come back with some amendments, which I will do.  Of course, I am very keen to give adequate notice, in the circumstances of the Bill, unlike in the normal course of events, having been altered quite significantly.</p> <p>  Given the fact that what may likely transpire to be an additional complement of membership on the board of the commission, we need to do some more work on the matter of the specifications for membership, in light of the changes which have been approved by the committee and on how the lay members of the commission are recruited.  I acknowledge on my part and that of my officials, that further consideration must be given to the reformulation of aspects of the Bill to determine the best approach.  On whether, on the matter of recruitment, it will be entirely a matter for the Public Appointments Service or whether we can have a nomination arrangement to the satisfaction of the Deputies as debated, I need to see how that might be designed to meet the disposition and clear wishes of the committee.  I must consider whether we have a mix of people, some chosen by the Public Appointments Service and some nominated to the commission by specified nominating bodies.  Against the background in which the committee structure has been removed, I want to examine the balance between having a manageable number of persons on the commission and ensuring there is an appropriate contribution of all court presidents, having regard to the various strands of appointment.</p> <p>  I invite members of the committee to agree with me on the following point.</p><p>Our objective must be to have a structure with a balance between having a commission that is not so large as to be unworkable or unwieldy while holding fast to the initial design of the Bill.  Specifically, the central principles of the Bill are a lay majority on the commission and an independent chairperson.  Those must be reconciled with the importance of ensuring that we have the appropriate inputs of all court precedents, including the presence of the District Court and of the Circuit Court.  That is not quite clear now under the Bill as has passed Committee Stage.  I want to give the Chairman notice of my intention to table an amendment to address a technical issue concerning advances of funds to the commission.  I am sure that will be welcome.  Likewise, depending on what the Parliamentary Counsel has to say, we may need to look at tabling further drafting amendments consequential to those that have already been made, particularly in Part 4 regarding the removal of relevant committees as was originally intended, to ensure that there is no unintended impact on other aspects of the Bill.  Even looking at the Long Title, although we have agreed it, we all consequently agreed that it would not be the final word on that.</p><p> In light of the fact that we have made a large number of amendments, I am mindful of the need to proof where we are going to ensure that the contents are legally and constitutionally acceptable and that the drafting is fully in order.  There will not be an imminent or sudden tabling of Report Stage amendments.  I have acknowledged that some work needs to be done and that will take some time.  I would be happy to keep the Chairman fully informed of developments.  If any members of the committee wish to engage with me or my officials bilaterally, I would not only be open to that but would be keen to engage in such a discussion but we will have to take our time.  Ultimately, the Bill can only benefit from the opportunity that it now presents, which is a form of breathing space between now and Report Stage.  I also thank the Chairman for the efficient way in which he managed to steer us through almost 200 amendments.</p></speech>

From time to time in the course of the parliamentary session, the media engages in the production of a league table of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the number of times they have voted.  I suggest that a record is taken of the number of times we have voted in this committee to ensure that we are well up there as the most active group of parliamentarians.</p></speech>
