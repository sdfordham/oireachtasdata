He is joined today by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  The first item on our agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 8 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  I have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  The next item on the agenda is matters arising from the minutes.  Everything referred to in the minutes is moving ahead and we can move on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  Correspondence No. 1079 is a briefing document from Dr. Brian Keegan on corporation tax.  We will discuss this in private session and there may some additions and changes as a result of this morning's meeting.  We will have a final document for next week.  I propose that we discuss it in private session but not publish it at the moment.  Obviously we will publish the final version next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up committee meetings and other items for publishing, the first item is No. 1067B received from Mr. Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, following the committee's request for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of University of Limerick's internal audit review of August 2017.  I believe we should take up Mr. Fitzgerald on his offer to provide further updates and request a copy of the Crowe Howarth review mentioned in the letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#B00400"><p>At our last meeting, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond to claims that the university or people in it may have misled his office.  He said at the time he was doing his own report.  Obviously, we must come back to it at some point because we have dealt with it in the past.  We have the internal audit report which makes 42 recommendations.  The correspondence states 17 of the recommendations have been implemented and 25 are in progress.  It also states significant changes have been made to senior management structures.  Any time there is a report where issues arise in a public institute I ask the same question, which is who is held to account.  In this instance I do not know who is held to account.  It seems there is some restructuring going on, but if individuals misled the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or if there were errors, procedural lapses, process failures or whatever by individuals, who is held to account in the university?  It does not seem on the face of it that anybody was, except there was a consolidation of positions.</p> <p>  In any event we have these 42 recommendations, and I am just looking for guidance on how we deal with it.  Perhaps this will depend on when the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes.  Is this the basis on which we will bring in the Accounting Officer?  Should we do it before that?  I do not know.  We have this internal audit review which is being implemented as we speak.  We will have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I imagine, sometime in the summer or perhaps before it.</p></speech>

I expect to get it early next week and to review it and get it out to the university for a response.  We are probably looking at a period of two months to finalise it.  I expect to have a report in May.  It will then go to the Department, of course, and we will talk to the Department about getting it submitted as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

We will seek a copy of that report in the meantime, and we will come back to the other one.  When we get the Crowe Howarth report we can discuss the matter further and we will keep this topic on the agenda.</p> <p>  Nos. 1072B and 1073B were received from the Comptroller and Auditor General and we discussed them briefly at our last meeting.  One is a note relating to audit of compliance with public procurement rules and on salary and pension overpayments in 2016.  We discussed this and we have written to the HSE seeking figures on salary and pension overpayments in that organisation.  We had a discussion on overpayments at our last meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General gave us an information note on audit of compliance with public procurement rules because it was evident at our last meeting that references of non-compliance with public procurement rules and various accounts were sample figures and not the total figure.  We asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide in due course the figure and a summary extracting the information.</p></speech>

It is a bit like the salary overpayments.  It is fine just talking about what is in front of us, but we are looking for the full picture.  We acknowledge it will take a bit of time.  We will note this correspondence even though we had a discussion on them at our last meeting, and I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to keep us informed.</p> <p>  No. 1075B was received from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE.  This is a follow up request by the committee regarding correspondence submitted to the committee concerning legal costs and open disclosure.  We mentioned it last week.  I propose we note the correspondence for now and agree to have a representative from the HSE at our meeting when we discuss this issue with the State Claims Agency.  In fairness, the letter is five pages long covering plans and procurements, but there no scintilla of an outcome on what we are talking about in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#B02500"><p>It started a pilot project in 2010 and it is now 2018.  It speaks about a culture of openness and transparency built into the HSE's governance for quality and patient safety.  Unless what we are routinely seeing coming through are very historical cases there is not a great deal of evidence it is translating into anything.</p><p>An evaluation of the pilot has been done by Dr. Jane Pillinger.  I have not looked at that document yet.  This letter tells us about international experience.  This is a very sizeable amount of money.</p></speech>

Maybe we also need to look at the evidence from that evaluation as part of it so that we would have the HSE, the State Claims Agency and perhaps Dr. Jane Pillinger before the committee first.  It would not necessarily be on a different day, but we might have a more informed discussion on how we can move it on because they are evaluating something that is of direct relevance to what we are discussing.</p></speech>

I do not know what is in it.  I have not looked at it yet.  If that is circulated, it will be on our correspondence list for the next meeting.</p></speech>

We asked for it and we got it.  It is an outline and I welcome that.  They do provide the information.  They rolled it out in a pilot project in two big cities, Cork and Dublin, and there is an evaluation of that, which was referred to and I will not repeat that.  We do not know operationally on the ground how many other hospitals it has been rolled out to and how it has been done.</p> <p>  There is a contract to solicitors, the Office of Legal Services implemented a new contract for the provision of corporate and operational legal services with nine solicitor firms.  It is on the first page of their letter or page two of the document before us.  I would like to know more about that.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General advise us on how that was done and what mechanism was used?  It is stated in the letter, "the Office of Legal Services implemented a new contract for the provision of corporate and operational legal services with nine solicitor member firms nationally".</p></speech>

It was never good practice and they never moved from that, so there was one firm advising Galway City Council for many years.

Is there scope for more?  I do not know.  It must be put in context for me so that I might understand.</p></speech>

We will also get the other draft report which she mentioned.  We all know that the vast majority of cases are in the area of obstetrics.  One would assume that 70% or 80% of all claims would be in that area.  One would assume that they would have concentrated on those maternity and obstetric hospitals in the first place.</p></speech>

Second, we will circulate the report of the pilot project by Dr. Jane Pillinger.  We will keep it on our agenda.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1076B from Mr John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation regarding follow up information requested at the meeting regarding the revaluation process in County Laois. We note that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1077B from Dr Graham Love of the Higher Education Authority, dated 9 February 2018.  Dr Love encloses the review of intellectual property and the management of conflicts of interest in relation to intellectual property.  Members may need some time to look at this.  There is a short piece and a more substantial document of 50 or 60 pages.  Members may wish to review it and return to the matter.</p></speech>

Looking back to when we first dealt with this matter and, as a committee, put a spotlight on this issue, we might remind ourselves that we were told by the HEA that there was no problem and nothing to see.  I felt there was pushback against members of this committee even asking questions.  The attitude was pretty much one that we should keep our hands off this issue, that members did not understand it, that it was very complex, that commercialising intellectual property is much more complex than we could have imagined, and so on.  That tone troubled me at the time.  Far from there being nothing to see here, we now have a report which shows that there was a lack of uniformity, to say the least, across the institutes, that the policy in some areas was quite weak, and that conflicts of interest in that area needed to be strengthened.  The report makes recommendations which I think are good and which will strengthen the ability of institutes of technology and universities to protect themselves as well as taxpayers.  All of that is to the good.</p> <p>  A separate report into Waterford is imminent.  We also sought an analysis from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others on how much money is spent by the State in supporting intellectual property and commercialising intellectual property.</p></speech>

We had a discussion on this last time and I think it was accepted that it was not as difficult as was being suggested.  We will have to come back to it at some point, maybe we should wait until the report comes from Waterford, but Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the HEA are all players in this.  We now have a report which makes changes and which came about as a result of the work of this committee.  I still have a number of questions.  I am not satisfied that all the concerns that we raised have been dealt with sufficiently in the report.</p> <p>  I will also put it on record that it is quite interesting that this report, the generic one, has been published and then we will have a Waterford report.  We cannot pre-empt what will be in that but it is somewhat similar to what has happened in other areas of the third level sector.  There was a "Prime Time" programme which highlighted issues on accountability, and the Minister published a report which said the Department was going to make changes.  Then our report came out.  The Department can point to its report and say that it is dealing with the matter already.  An element of that is going on in the HEA.</p> <p>  We have to come back to it.  We cannot merely bookend it and say that we have the reports and that is it.  Issues remain.  I propose that once we have the Waterford report and this national review of all institutes, we return to it.  I ask that Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, some of the third level institutes and the HEA would come before the committee and we would do a session on the matter because it seems to be very much geared toward the commercialisation part of it, and there seems to be a bias towards the enterprise side of it rather than protecting the institutes.  Several members have expressed concerns in that regard.  Questions remain to be asked.  That is my sense of it.</p></speech>

We stumbled across this rather than there having been forensic questioning.  The more we stumbled and asked questions, the more worried we became at its <i>ad hoc </i>nature.</p><p>However, the worst part for me was the attitude that one should not ask questions, that this was good and that we should just run with it.  I agree fully that we should put this back on our agenda and look at it because I have not looked in detail at the full report.  I have read the letters but have not read the report in detail.  I think we might need help with this as well just like we got help with the document before us today.  In due course, we might need help to tease this out.  Last week or the week before, universities were referred to under the census as market producers.  The Chairman might recall that.  </p></speech>

The attitude of the universities and other third-level institutions when they appeared before us very much ties in the view of "market good, everything good, no questions."  I will not repeat myself.  We should look at it.  We probably need help with it.</p></speech>

Very often, industry wants to locate close to universities and does that for a range of different reasons.  Much of it has to do with partnering with universities.  There is no doubt there is a benefit and there can be a two-way benefit.  A lot of that is very desirable.  However, I was less than impressed with the HEA.  I thought it was very underwhelming in terms of its contributions at the committee.  We are relying on it to evaluate something it was not great at.  I agree with Deputy Connolly in that regard.  It may well be an academic who can do this but I would like to see an international comparator about how this is handled in other countries because we need to compare it to something else or somewhere else where there is something in the same family and where there is good practice.  I am quite sure that one of the business schools will have carried out some work in that area.  It is a bit ironic to ask an academic to input into something like this but I think we might not be getting a good look at the way we should be progressing on this by relying exclusively on the HEA.</p></speech>

As one of those who asked the questions and took an active interest in this, I want to put on the record that an awful lot of good work is being done by universities and institutes of technology in research and development, co-location and commercialising intellectual property.  None of that is bad.  Legitimate questions were asked about process, conflicts of interest and how the companies are established.  The point was that I felt we were being pushed back a bit on what were genuine concerns.  We now have two reports that verify those concerns.  They are a vindication of the questions we were asking.  The HEA was asleep at the wheel when it came to this issue because it was, essentially, throwing it back to Science Foundation Ireland.  I think Knowledge Transfer Ireland is the body that looks at it.  It possibly had a role but certainly the HEA has a role from a governance perspective and it allowed a situation to arise where there were different policies in different institutes of technology and universities.  Some were good while others were not so good.  If we now have more uniformity and a strengthened policy that underpins this, that is for the good.  The HEA should reflect on the fact that the questions we put are for the good because we want to see an improvement and if we get an improvement here, that will be good.  When we raised this issue previously, I was inundated with emails from people who work in this area telling me that we do not fully understand it and are being anti-enterprise and negative.  That is not the case.  At all times, we recognised that there is huge benefit to institutes of technology and universities engaging in research and development and with the private sector and individuals within those institutions commercialising their intellectual property.  None of that was seen as bad.  Genuine concerns were raised that have been dealt with to some extent but I do not think they have been dealt with fully.</p></speech>

We received and considered the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and rejected it.  It just said it was impossible to do it.  The Revenue Commissioners expect people to do it if they are looking for tax credits.  It appears that the public service has not been on top of this.</p> <p>  No. 1077B, the note we received with this correspondence, is from the director of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, Alison Campbell.  We just asked a simple question about a spin-out project currently being considered for 2018.  It was a simple question and we received a half-page reply.  It states that it is at various stages of maturation and that any list of spin-out prospects will necessarily be larger than any number of prospects that ultimately launch spin offs.  We know that.  The note stated that the list of spin-outs being considered for 2018 is a snapshot at a point in time.  That is all we asked for.  The note said that in the timescale for response to the request from the committee, it was not possible to gather details of the number of spin-out opportunities under consideration across the 21 higher education authorities.  That is a clear admission that it does not have that information, which is shocking in its own right.  The note goes on to say that details can be included by way of a follow-on so we wait to receive that.  We will ask for that.  The note said that due to commercial sensitivity, the names of the technologies cannot be made public.  That is fine.  The note said that by way of context, the annual knowledge transfer survey showed that Ireland is creating an average of 26 to 30 new spin-out companies per annum from its 21 higher education authorities and a further five research performing organisations, RPOs.  The committee can see there is quite a bit in there.  Members can see that we asked a simple question and Knowledge Transfer Ireland said it did not have the information and would try to find it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was asked how much money was going in and it told us it did not know.  </p></speech>

It is dated 5 February 2018, was received from an individual and relates to a data breach at KBC Bank.  It is not within the remit of the committee to look at it.  I propose, therefore, that, in order to be helpful, we provide the individual with details of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will note the correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1069C which is dated 7 February 2018 and was received from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement.  He is responding to a statement made by UCD on the ability of his office to support the needs of the university.  He is clearly not in agreement with UCD on the matter.  Rather than get into it now, we will allow the correspondence to come up during our engagement with the Office of Government Procurement.  The meeting is included in our work programme and we will discuss the matter with the office on that occasion.  We should also publish the correspondence in the meantime in order that UCD can at least see the response to its criticism of the Office of Government Procurement.  We will allow both items of correspondence to be included in the public record and people can judge them accordingly because there is a disagreement.  </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1070C which is dated 7 February 2018 and was received from Ms Elizabeth Mullan, solicitor to the Charleton tribunal, acknowledging the receipt of transcripts from the Committee of Public Accounts forwarded by the secretariat.  The correspondence will be noted.  </p> <p>  For the benefit of those who wonder what the Committee of Public Accounts does, we have done a lot of important work in the past year or so.  I want to touch on an item of correspondence which is directly related to that point in order to demonstrate how important the work we have done is.  It is from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, in respect of its inquiry into matters in the Garda College in Templemore.  The commission is seeking our assistance and the documentation and correspondence with which we have dealt.  It is an issue which was highlighted here and is now the subject of a GSOC inquiry.  Prior to today we also received correspondence from the disclosures tribunal under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charleton.  We were also happy to deal with that request and supply everything which had been sought.  Matters discussed here are now the subject matter of the Charleton tribunal.  </p> <p>  We also received correspondence from the commission of investigation under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Cooke which was dealing with NAMA and Project Eagle.  We have been assisting and supporting that inquiry in dealing with all of its requests for information.  It is another item with which we have dealt extensively.  </p> <p>  We have also dealt extensively with the commission of inquiry into the Grace case and related cases under the chairmanship of Ms Marjorie Farrelly, SC.  We are assisting the commission by providing information.  I realise this is a new departure and I have been in the House a few years.  So much of what has come to us has fed into these four separate tribunals or commissions of investigation.  It shows that we are dealing with very important issues of public interest.</p></speech>

There are politicians - Members of the Houses - who say on late night television shows that we are going beyond what we should be doing and criticising us for doing so.

We now take it as routine, but it is very serious.  I have highlighted it because we are dealing with the particular item of correspondence.  We are assisting the inquiries in every way we can.  We will note the correspondence.</p> <p>  The item of correspondence is No. 1071C which is dated 7 Februrary 2018 and from Mr. Stephen Tierney, designated officer in GSOC.  It relates to a request to forward to GSOC all documentation received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the committee&rsquo;s examination of the Garda College in Templemore.  GSOC is investigating financial fraud allegations at the training college. The secretariat prepared the documentation requested which has been given to GSOC.   We will note the correspondence.  It feeds into what I said.  There was some documentation which we had received as part of our work and considered but which we chose not to publish at the time.  We have now sent all of it to GSOC to assist it in its inquiry.  We will continue to assist it in any we can.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1074C which received from Deputy Catherine Murphy requesting that the committee look for a copy of the Crowe Howarth report on the University of Limerick.  We have covered that issue and are asking for a copy of the report.</p></speech>

Members should note that, as the individual was concerned about preserving his anonymity, we have redacted identifying details.  I propose that we write to the Department and copy the letter to UCC for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When we receive a reply, we will forward it on.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1080C which is dated 8 February 2018 and was received from the Irish Council Against Blood Sports questioning the accuracy of the figures provided by Bord na gCon for attendances at greyhound tracks and the numbers employed in the industry.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.  The group has a particular point of view.  We are not required to take any particular action. </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1082C which was received from Mr. Fred McBride, chief executive of Tusla, providing a response on a matter raised by an individual about the non-publishing of a report.  I propose that we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who contacted the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item on our agenda is statements of accounts received since our last meeting.  It is a short list.  There is only one item on it today - the 2016 accounts of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner which state there was a turnover of &euro;4.7 million.  There was a clear audit opinion.  We will note the accounts.  They are available in the Oireachtas Library if any member wants to receive a copy.  </p> <p>  We will move on to-----</p></speech>

We will write to UCC and forward a copy to the Department of Education and Skills.  We will come back to the issue.  </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is our work programme.  There is a revised work programme on screen.  It was updated sometime yesterday evening.  There were earlier drafts during the course of the week.  After the public session we will go into private session to be briefed on the issue of corporation tax by Dr. Brian Keegan from Chartered Accountants Ireland.  We will also discuss the first document prepared by the secretariat for our periodic report to the end of December, a copy of which has been circulated.  I stress it is not a draft document of the committee but a working document produced by the secretariat.  Anyone who draws conclusions from it will be off the beaten track.  The committee has yet to consider it.  Next week we will meet Dr. Keegan in public session.  In the afternoon we will also meet officials of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to discuss the issue of corporation tax.  That will probably bring our discussions on that specific topic to a conclusion.  If we have time before next week's voting block, we might try to sign off on the periodic report.  We will have a discussion on it today and will have an hour to consider it next week.  We will try to sign off on it, with a view to launching it at the beginning of March.  </p> <p>  On Thursday, 1 March, we will discuss the Galway art house cinema project, on which there is a specific chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will have officials of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht before the committee on that day.</p></speech>

We will have the Appropriation Account for 2016.  The local government fund will be included as it is a substantial source of funds for local authorities.  There is a special report on motor taxation which feeds into funding of local authorities.  When dealing with central government funding of local authorities, I propose that we address the Appropriation Accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the parent Department.  We will also have at that meeting a very senior representative from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland because up to 15% of all funding to local authorities comes from that Department.</p><p> When those officials are in, we may also deal with the motor taxation account special report as a separate item.  The principal funding sources for local government are the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the local government fund, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  If we discussed funding of local government without having the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport represented or dealing with the local government fund, we would not have the complete picture.  Given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport representatives will be here - and motor taxation was generally collected through local authorities but has now gone to the Department, a matter on which a special report was issued - we will deal with all of that on one day as motor tax is the key element of the local government fund at this stage.</p><p> Will the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us who is responsible for the local government fund?</p></speech>

There have obviously been changes relating to local property tax and a phasing out of that over the last few years.  I am not sure that there is even such a thing as a local government fund now.  The Chairman has mentioned a number of different streams of funding to local authorities in addition to those generated locally.  About five years ago, the Council of Europe came to look at how Ireland funded its local authorities and went away having made no sense of it.  That speaks volumes.  How can there be transparency when one cannot make sense of who does what?  It would be useful to ask the Department to provide a note on the progression of how local authorities are funded and what elements fund them.</p></speech>

We go back to the needs and resources model for distribution and that is largely still in place with regard to the issue I have raised about baselines which are set by local authorities that do not factor in population growth at all.  There was a ring-fenced fund for motor tax receipts.  That has been phased out.  There is not really a local government fund any longer but a redistribution of the 20% that comprises the equalisation fund for the local property tax.  The more complicated something is made, the more public frustration there is with it.  One cannot then make sense of it and loses things in the middle of it that we should be picking up.

Local authorities are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  There is separate auditing.  The principal funder is the Department and then there is the local government fund.  We are dealing with the accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Within that are water, property tax and a range of other issues.  I do not want to go to do a lot of research and work from my office, have many questions to ask and then to be told that the Department cannot answer those questions and that it is a matter for local authorities.  That happened with RT&Eacute;, which I will raise again in a few minutes.  We had that with JobPath when the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was in, and it was a big chunk of their budget.  It said that it could not answer those questions, that it signed a cheque, that there was a service-level agreement and that we should go off to look at that.  What are the parameters of this?</p> <p>  As part of the briefing note that was requested, I want information on how public housing is funded.  Where does the money come from?  We have the Housing Agency and other entities.  There are questions relating to whether that will go on the balance sheet.  That is a big issue.  There are other strands in the areas of planning and community, such as grant aid.  I imagine we will be told that that is grant aid and how that money is spent is a matter for the organisations to which the money is given.  I do not want those to be stonewalled and for us to be told that those questions cannot be answered because it is not a matter for Accounting Officers in those Departments and that it is for other entities for which separate auditing is done.  I am pre-empting that possibility.  Can we get some sense of what we can or cannot ask and what we can or cannot deal with?  We will make our own minds up as to whether we can ask them.  The Chairman gets my point.  We do not want to waste our time.</p></speech>

There is clearly a day of work in this local government matter, a morning and an afternoon, not that we will separate them.  We will have to plan our work schedule for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018021500002#F02000"><p>I agree with Deputy Cullinane and Deputy Murphy about the need for a real discussion on this.  This layer of government is the most important in people's every day lives.  We deal with headline figures here.  It is this level of government that we rely on for implementation of policy relating to housing, roads - which we discussed this week - or a new strand of social policy that local government is involved in.  I agree with my colleagues that we should have clarity of thought before these witnesses came in.  The worst thing would be to get bogged down in a quagmire that would suit the witnesses down to the ground, to run down the clock all day.  I know Deputy Murphy has said that it is a complicated layer of funding to work out and she is right but at the same time there is a Houdini act going on as was mentioned with regard to the local government fund, which no longer exists.</p><p>More Houdini tricks were pulled with the introduction of the local property tax whereby aspects that had previously been funded by the Department would become self-funded, as it were, by the councils.</p><p> The Chairman and Deputy Murphy mentioned progression, but I will tell them what that progression has been.  The Chairman stated that he wanted the principal funders to appear before us and make themselves answerable.  If so, we had better invite IBEC or some business representative to attend on the same day as well, given that 36% of all local government funding comes from the business people and SMEs of this country.  The past ten years have seen a 10% increase in the income derived from rates because local government has been starved of central funding like a mangy dog.  Income from rates has increased from a percentage in the mid-20s to 36% and now amounts to &euro;1.5 billion.  The Valuation Office appeared before us a couple of weeks ago, but we might as well have had my children in answering questions, seeing as how no one would take responsibility.  The Valuation Office told us it was the Department's responsibility.  When we asked the departmental official who was sitting here at the time, we were told that it was the Minister's responsibility.  I am not spending a day doing that in a couple of weeks' time with no one taking responsibility for the questions we ask.</p><p> I agree with the Chairman.  Let us bring everyone in, but some of the chief funders of local government are businesses.  IBEC and others emailed us about the pressures they were under on the day the Valuation Office appeared before us, although it was a pity they did so a bit late.  I would like to see representatives of business owners appear before us to discuss the imposition upon them.  When one considers that rates account for 36% of overall income, the local property tax pales into insignificance.</p><p> When we put it to Mr. Paul Lemass on the day that local government structures were underfunded, I was worried when he said - members can check the record - that there would be a reappraisal of the property tax, providing an opportunity to bring in more funding.  We are entering a dangerous sphere.</p><p> This is a big day for our committee.  The Department has the most impact, not just on ordinary people's lives but on business people and employers as well.  Business representatives should be present on the day, given that they are one of the chief income suppliers of local government.  In that way, we could have a debate in the round as to how local government is funded, where the money is going and what we are doing.</p><p> Deputy Cullinane mentioned the quagmire in funding for housing.  In my county a few weeks ago, &euro;11.2 million was supplied in a grant by the Department.  There was a big announcement.  Only 40 houses are being built, though.  That works out at nearly &euro;300,000 per house for social housing.  Something is wrong, and it is that site acquisition was built into the cost of each house.  When the council applied for the site acquisition cost, it was told the amount would be given to it, but only as part of the delivery of the 40 houses.  We will have many questions for these people on the day.</p></speech>

However, inviting IBEC and businesses to attend would not be appropriate.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from, but they do not fall under our remit.  Neither do the local authorities, unfortunately.  However, the Departments and clarity on the money that is going out do fall under our remit.  That is of essence and is where we should be putting our energy.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on housing.  Like other Deputies, I hear repeatedly that there is no problem with money for housing, yet no houses are being built in Galway.  It is a serious problem on which we need clarity.  However, it should not require a full day.  As I understand it, there is no role for businesses to attend and discuss rates.</p></speech>

I will be a bit broad, since we deal with central government funding.  A part of the formula that determines how much goes to local government from central government probably includes a calculation of what the latter estimates has been raised locally via rates bills.

If a council had a staff of 2,000, that was a need that had to be resourced.  If it had four swimming pools, that was a need that had to be resourced.  If it had two swimming pools but needed four, it would never get the others because it did not already have them.  That is the kind of nonsense to be found in the needs and resources model.  It does not factor in any population change.  There have been three censuses of population and major demographic shifts since it was introduced.  Places exist now that did not even exist at the time, so they cannot be counted.  It has nothing to do with the rates base.</p></speech>

Built into the design of the local property tax system is the self-funding element, which is the Houdini trick that was mentioned.

Some of the frustrations that we have already heard will be multiplied by 50 on the day if we all go off, prepare and come back only to be told that we cannot deal with those issues.  The Accounting Officer will say that he is accountable for the money that is transferred and, after that point, the money becomes a matter for the organisations.  Consider some of the issues.  We will be told that rates are a matter for local authorities, water services are a matter for Irish Water, property tax is a matter for Revenue, local government funding is a matter for the local authorities, housing is a matter for the housing agencies and the local authorities, motor tax is now a matter for someone else and goes into Exchequer funding, and community services are grant aided via various organisations, etc.  If that happens on the day, you will have a difficult day as Chairman because we will all be frustrated.

The sector accounts for 37% of the overall contribution, having increased by 10% in the past decade, but the Department has starved one side.  Last year, for the first time in many years, many city councils increased their rates because there was a bit of buoyancy which allowed them to do so.  Populations are getting bigger and more is being demanded of councillors and officials, who are now under some pressure.  The only place they can get a bit of extra income is to increase rates.  I accept what Deputies Cullinane, Murphy and Connolly said about our remit and what can be examined, but they are getting off the hook by putting it onto this sector.  Over the past ten years it has grown from under &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion and it is only going to get worse.  We are discussing central government funding to a sector and there is scope to examine it on the day.  They say over one third has nothing to do with them and is simply contributing to running costs, but we are missing a trick.</p></speech>

They went from the Vote to the local government fund to the local authorities.  Motor tax was going into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, out to the National Roads Authority, and then on to the local authorities.

When we dealt with the education sector, we had the Department, the education and training boards, ETBs, and the HEA in the room at the one time.</p> <p>  The next item is the overview of public private partnerships, which will be after St. Patrick's Day, on 22 March.  We propose to bring in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, because it sets the policy, the Department of Education and Skills, which is one of the biggest users of PPPs, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the principal user, and the National Development Finance Agency.  I want a letter to go from this committee to each of those organisations because I know what will happen otherwise.  They will talk about commercial sensitivity so that we can discuss nothing.  I do not know how far we will get but we can certainly get farther than a response such as that.  I propose we write to each of them asking them to provide as much financial information as they can by way of a briefing note a fortnight in advance of the meeting.  In particular, we will ask them to justify their inability to give us full commercial details of any contract more than five years old.  Commercial sensitivity might be valid at a certain point in time but not for ever.  This will give us the opportunity to consider the information before we have the public meeting.</p> <p>  We are holding over 29 March for the third level sector.  There are three or four different topics but we will not come to them today.  On 19 April, it will be the Department of Finance to discuss Government debt and the Exchequer outturn for the year, which is a key ingredient of our work.  On 26 April, we have the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of its IT system, on which there is a special chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will deal with the Garda internal audit report on its IT contracts on that day too.</p> <p>  On 3 May, we have Vote 29 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, particularly in relation to RT&Eacute;, which is substantially funded.  Deputy Cullinane is keen on this but on the day the Department was here it said it was obliged to have a service level agreement in place with RT&Eacute; and that it received &euro;170 million each year, the majority of its funding.  The Department has failed in its duty to do its work so the Committee of Public Accounts will do the job.  There is widespread agreement because the majority of its funding is from public funds and it is appropriate to bring the organisation in on that basis.  We will not get into anything about its editorial content as it is not in our remit.  We are going to discuss the financial aspects of the organisation.</p></speech>

Some of those items are in the report but we will have to see how we marry the two issues.</p> <p>  The following items are all to be confirmed.  On 10 May, it is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there are several gaps in the schedule after that.  Towards the end of June we will have the National Treasury Management Agency because its 2017 accounts should be out by then.  On 28 June, we will have Revenue back to discuss chapters in the report of the Comptroller and General relating to the tax appeals office.  Before we break up, we will have the HSE's financial statement for 2017.  The HSE is normally very good and has this ready by May or June.  On 12 July, we have financial reporting in the public service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  There are issues not on the list to which we have to come back.  We might deal with the Courts Service through the Department of Justice and Equality.  There was an issue about conflicts of interest regarding the fair deal scheme but the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority has dealt specifically with the correspondence that came to us on that.  The ETBs, Cork Institute of Technology, third level spin-off companies and the Thorn report on consultants' pay are all tied into third level education.  We have mentioned RT&Eacute;, and the Office of Government Procurement is on our list.</p> <p>  That concludes our discussion on the work programme.</p><p> We have completed our public business for today.  Our next public meeting will be held on Thursday, 22 February when we will continue our consideration of chapter 20 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on corporation tax.  We will be joined for the morning session by Dr. Brian Keegan from Chartered Accountants Ireland who will be followed by officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in the afternoon.</p></speech>

The team from the Department includes Ms Orla Ryan, principal officer for the national broadband plan, NBP, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, programme director for the national broadband plan and Mr. Patrick Neary, chief technology officer of the Department.  I am the assistant secretary in the area of communications.  As the Chair outlined, we have provided the clerk with a slide presentation.  We do not propose to speak to the presentation but may refer to individual slides in the context of replies and, for that reason, have numbered the slides for ease of reference.  The slide presentation covers the objectives of the national broadband plan, the mapping process, the procurement timeline from the outset of the process through to preferred bidder, value for money issues and next steps.</p> <p>  With the agreement of the Chair, I will turn to the remaining questions from last week.  For efficiency, I propose that we deal with them in three groups.  Mr. Mulligan will address the questions dealing with the three lots, wholesale contracts and State aid issues, followed by Mr. Neary addressing questions on the NBP mapping process and the Eir contract to provide broadband to 300,000 premises and, lastly, Mr. Mulligan will address questions on value for money, pricing structure and technical solutions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018021500002#B00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to go through the background to the project, which has been in the offing since we published the draft intervention strategy in July 2015 and the final intervention strategy that went through Government and significant stakeholder engagement in 2015.  It is important to be aware of that backdrop and what was agreed in 2015 before we launched the procurement process because that set the stage for our current position.  The fundamental objective then and now is to deliver high-speed broadband to every premises in Ireland, regardless of how remote or rural they are.  That is in keeping with the mission statement of the overall 2012 national broadband plan.</p> <p>  One of the key tenets of the national broadband plan is to stimulate and extract as much commercial investment from the market as possible without the need for market intervention by the State, which is an essential requirement of State aid guidelines and must be followed by every member state.  Broadband is nationally available from a number of operators.  There are probably up to 100 operators selling broadband across the country and, therefore, the key prerogative for us is to ensure we only intervene in areas where we will deliver high-speed broadband.  A key area on which we had to decide in 2015 is what we meant by high-speed broadband.  In that context, in December 2015 we concluded that we would only intervene in areas where we would deliver at least 30 MB download speed and 6 MB upload speed and published seven expert documents that set out what that meant.  Analysys Mason, our technical adviser, set out in great detail what is meant by 30 MB down and 6 MB up.  It does not mean service providing up to those speeds, rather minimum speeds of 30 MB down and 6 MB up, along with several other technical characteristics.  That will ensure that the network is resilient, of high quality and will stand the test of time.  In addition to criteria on the 30 MB and 6 MB speeds set out in 2015, a key requirement is that the network would be future proofed over the 25 years of the contract.  It is not a question of whether a download speed of 30 MB will be sufficient in 2030 or 2040 because it will not.  The network to be built will stand the test of time, which is true to the 2015 statement and our current position.  That gives an assurance to commercial operators offering low-speed or basic broadband that we will not intervene in areas where they are delivering 10 or 15 MB but will only do so if there is a need to deliver step change to consumers.  That is a key tenet of the State aid guidelines.</p> <p>   Another key tenet of the 2015 strategy and the State aid guidelines that every member state must follow is that one must maximise the reuse of existing infrastructure.  As all members know, there are many networks across the country that deliver telecoms, involving poles, ducts, towers, masts and, with the advent of the legislation, the electricity network.  There are many demands in this area.  There is the rail and many other networks.  Coillte is in the telecom space.  Those networks must be leveraged to minimise the cost to the State and commercial operators of building this rural network.  That is being worked on with any company that is willing to offer up its network.  In terms of any regulated company, the regulator is part of the process to ensure the relevant access obligations are in place and appropriate prices are set.  In the telecom space, the Eircom poles and ducts are regulated and ComReg has a very clear role in that regard.  The ultimate objective of the strategy is to stimulate growth and jobs and to ensure that any Government strategy such as e-education, ehealth and etourism is facilitated through the nationwide availability of high-speed broadband.  That was our starting point in December 2015.</p> <p>  Another key prerogative is that it is an open access wholesale network.  We are not subsidising a retail network or retail service providers but, rather, are subsidising and the commercial sector is investing in a wholesale network.  The metropolitan area networks are currently being sold by Enet on a wholesale basis and Open Eir, the wholesale arm of Eir group, offers wholesale services.  The entity to which we are referring in notional terms as the NBPCo until it has formally been named will only sell open access wholesale services, probably to 50, 60 or 80 retailers.  Ultimately, consumers will have absolute choice in terms of broadband and other services the network will allow to be delivered, such as television, voice telecommunications, high-speed lease line services for businesses and so on, which is typical in the market.  It is an open access wholesale network and will deliver consumer choice and competition at the retail level. </p> <p>  In July 2015, we began work on our draft strategy, a process informed by experts from economists across Europe.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was our main adviser on strategy and KPMG also advised on ownership, funding and so on.   Analysys Mason was the technical expert.  These experts came together and we concluded in December 2015 on a number of facets to which I have referred.  It was decided that we would tender for three lots.  In July, it was intended to tender for four lots but, following consultation, over 60 responses to our July 2015 consultation were received, one of which included approximately 50 operators.  We engaged with more than 150 stakeholders in 2015 to arrive at our strategy in December 2015.</p><p>We landed on having three lots.  Essentially, that was the north and the south of the country and there was the option to win lot C, which was both lots together.  That is what all the five consortiums that came forward in March 2016 said they would be willing to bid for.  Three of those consortiums qualified in July or June 2016.  The three remaining bidders in September and the remaining bidder today all had subscribed to bidding for all three lots, therefore, none of them had ever opted for any one particular lot.  As to the reason one would opt for the lots, up to now it was seen as a key driver of competition and possibly allowing smaller networks an opportunity to bid.  In France, for example, where one area of the country might have 500,000 premises, they would have 40 or 50 equivalent lots, because it is done by municipality.  In Germany, there would be many different lots because it is done on the basis of geographic area.  In the UK, Broadband Delivery UK would have split the UK, Scotland and Wales into many different areas and in that way different companies would have the opportunity to bid.  That is the way it is done in every member state.  One divides it up rather than having one big procurement process and one big lot.  That is the history of the lots.</p><p> In terms of state aid, since 2014 we have had many visits to Brussels to meet the DG COMM unit, which is responsible for overseeing our process and, ultimately, it will be responsible for delivering a state aid approval letter before we issue a final tender.  It is responsible, as set out in the state aid guidelines, to ensure that each member state only intervenes where it absolutely has to and that no taxpayer moneys go into geographic areas, cities, towns or counties where commercial operators have already delivered, or have concrete plans to deliver.</p><p> Mr. Patrick Neary will go through the mapping process with the members shortly, which involves how one decides or confirms if there is a concrete plan from a commercial operator or whether plans that were promised three years ago are happening on the ground.  That is an intricate, complicated and detailed process because we are talking about every road, street, house and business in the country that we must analyse and examine.  We started that process in 2013 when we issued many questionnaires to every single commercial operator in the country asking them to outline their plans, if they will deliver high speed broadband and, if they will, to submit their plans in order that we could examine them.  Mr. Patrick Neary will go through all that detail shortly.  Under the state aid guidelines, that is a key tenet, namely, to identify the areas of market failure and decide on what way to intervene, which is what is in our strategy.  We did all that in 2015.  The map is dynamic and it must remain so as any commercial operator can at any time decide it will invest money in this particular area.  Over the course of 2015, we engaged with the European Commission and consulted it on the map we published in 2015, along with our strategy and the procurement launch in December 2015, and it was very satisfied with our mapping process.  To date, it has not raised any issues.  We have gone through the whole pre-notification process.  We issued the first one in 2015.  We reissued an updated pre-notification in August 2016 just to bring it up to date.  We intend to move to the final notification process in the coming weeks.  At that stage the European Commission will engage in reviewing the overall process in a little more detail and give us a final letter of approval before we would have a preferred bidder or a contract awarded.  From a state aid perspective, we have gone through a great deal of detail with the European Commission, ComReg has been consulted and we believe we are in a very good place in that regard.  That is the general process.  I will now hand over to Mr. Patrick Neary who will talk the members through the mapping process.</p></speech>

It was useful for us to get the correspondence today on the communications between Eir and the Department.  Regarding the 300,000 additional rural homes to which Eir is delivering broadband directly, I understand Eir had originally approached the Department in 2014 or 2015 - Mr. Neary might be able to confirm the year -  for those to be excluded from any national broadband plan and that the then Minister, Alex White, ruled that out.  I was interested in the correspondence between Eir and the current Minister, Deputy Naughten, to find out when that changed.  It is not clear from the correspondence.  The only meeting it seems where it could have been discussed was in the summer of 2016.  What is difficult to understand, in the context of Eir's presentation at a later meeting, is that it started that programme in the first quarter of 2017 - in other words, it already had 10,000 houses done in the first quarter.  Therefore, it must have started in January or February 2017.  In the context of the commitment assigned in 2017, that must have been agreed with the Minister the previous summer.  When was it decided to change the approach whereby the Department and the previous Minister said that we would not do that, when was it changed?  When was it signalled to Eir that the Department would allow this different approach?  That is not insignificant.  It only became apparent obviously in April 2017 but the bidding process must have been proceeding for at least six, eight, nine or ten months during which time the other parties would not have known that the whole terms of the process were changing.  When was it decided to switch tack in that regard?</p></speech>

I will start at the beginning and members will note as the map has developed, the way in which operators have come forward with their plans.  Our first engagement with the industry started in 2013 when we wrote to all the operators and asked them for submissions relating to high-speed broadband and their intent to roll out it out.  That resulted in us publishing a first iteration of the map in November 2014.  That was sent out for public consultation, following that extensive engagement with the industry in 2013 and 2014.</p> <p>  We received 27 responses representing more than 60 stakeholders in that consultation, therefore, we got quite a healthy response particularly from the industry.  That resulted in us republishing the map in February 2014.  We then issued a supplementary information request to the industry inviting operators to come forward with any detail of any further high-speed broadband plans they had out to 2020.  It was very much a future-looking request for information.  In that year, June 2015, Eir came forward with, and announced publicly, a 300,000 roll-out.  At that point it would have submitted its submissions to the Department.  Along with that, in response to that information request, six operator plans were submitted to us.  Therefore, Eir had made a submission, along with five others.  At the end of 2015 we concluded that no operator had met the technical deployment or financial criteria or was willing to sign a commitment agreement at that point.  On that basis, we republished the map in December 2015 and at that point we launched the procurement.  In 2016 Eir re-engaged with the Department.  It had updated its 300,000 plan, come forward with more robust and committed finance for the project and revised its deployment profile, which had started or was planned to start during 2016.  In fact, it started towards the end of 2016.</p><p>Throughout 2016 we reassessed that updated plan from Eir.  During that year we also continued to monitor and assess the anticipated commercial developments in what, at that time, was the blue area on the map.</p><p> To complete the picture, through our analysis of the blue area we identified a further 84,500 premises which we had anticipated would get high-speed broadband but the plans were not forthcoming as anticipated.  We decided at the time that those 84,500 premises should revert to the intervention area.  We continued engagement with Eir, and in April 2017 we signed a commitment agreement which underpinned its plan to deliver high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises.  Eir had started the roll-out at the end of 2016 and had already completed the first quarter of roll-outs during 2017, so it was well down the road of actually implementing the deployment.  This supported the credibility of its plan, along with the fact it underpinned the commitment through an agreement with the Minister and the Department.  In April 2017, this resulted in us updating the map, which now included the further 84,500 premises we had identified through analysing the blue areas.  The intervention area was reduced by 300,000 premises as a result of the commitment agreement with Eir.  This gave us an intervention area of approximately 540,000 premises.  As has been pointed out, April 2017 was during the ongoing procurement process and I will come back to this.</p><p> We continually analyse issues regarding accuracy of the map and issues in the blue areas.  As recently as January we asked for further observations on the map through a public consultation, which concluded last week.  We received nine responses directly on the mapping and we are reviewing and assessing those respondents.  The point I want to make is the mapping process is extremely complex.  We are attempting to map high-speed broadband nationally to every house in every eircode in the country.  In many cases, this information is based on the legacy copper network and the information is quite old.  We have had to do a lot of analysis and work with various operators to try to improve the accuracy of what is there.  There are many difficulties in identifying the performance of high-speed broadband at individual premises level.  At the point a premises orders and connects to the service it becomes more measurable.  We have had cases where one would expect that houses built close to a cabinet would receive high performance high-speed broadband direct from that cabinet, but when they connect it is identified they are not connected to that cabinet but to an exchange several kilometres away.  As a result, they do not receive the expected performance levels.  There are difficulties such as these.</p><p> Various technology is involved and there are different ways of measuring the performance dependent on the technology.  It is a very complex process.  We have developed the map to be dynamic and to respond to our analysis as we develop it over a period of time.  We have been doing it for quite a long time and it is getting better and better.  As people connect to it, we get better insight into the performance they receive.  We are continually updating and reassessing the accuracy of the map.  We have allowed for this within the procurement process, and from the outset we very much flagged the dynamic nature of the map.  When we updated the map in April 2017, it was not something unflagged to bidders at the start of the procurement process.  It was catered for in the procurement process.</p></speech>

The approach was fully understood by those operators who had engaged with the process to date, including Eir.  It knew the test it had to pass for its infrastructure to be accepted on the map.  It knew why it had not passed that test in 2015 and it knew what the tests continued to be in 2016 and onwards.  There was absolute clarity for the operator as to what it had to do, the hurdles it had to go over and the process it would have to follow.  There was no need to communicate it.</p></speech>

Did it have some sort of timeframe at that point to get shovels into the ground?  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in has overall responsibility for the tender process.  Given that it started in the middle of 2014 and procurement was launched in December 2015, but that it will now be the end of 2018 before we get a preferred bidder and a contract, does he think the process is fit for purpose?  It has taken three years, if not longer.  As an assistant secretary of a Department, is Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in happy with the process from the perspective of the overall delivery of a State policy?</p> <p>  Is an overall price included in the details submitted by the one remaining bidder?  How much will the State have to provide, by way of an intervention, to make sure it is rolled out?  Is there a technical solution?  I assume one has been provided.  Has the contractor provided the Department with a timeline by reference to T+, "T" being the date of the signing of the contract?

The pace at which this project has been managed by the team, including in its engagement with builders, has been intensive but the complexity of the process and the obligations on the State to get it right are onerous.  One can understand the timelines in this context and I believe the project is being managed in an effective manner.  The team has the capacity to deliver it.  In a competitive dialogue process, the timelines will be influenced by the two sides and the multiple bidders.  We have already discussed the mapping of that but issues such as revisiting the map, to provide certainty to bidders in the process, impact on timelines.  This project is being well managed.</p></speech>

The Department may be dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's but it does not seem to me to be an efficient process.  I am sure there is no wrongdoing by any staff member and I am sure everybody is working really hard but it is bit like the hamster on the wheel, working hard to keep it spinning but delivering nothing visible.  Is the bidder intervention action the best way to do this?  Might there be a better way to deliver, particularly in view of the fact that the Department can quickly sign an arrangement with Eir that sets timelines regarding the deployment in 300,000 homes?  It is very hard to comprehend how this can be the best way to do it.</p></speech>

The competitive dialogue process is absolutely appropriate to a project such as this on account of its uniqueness.  We understand the frustration of people who are waiting for high-speed broadband and one of the members of the team is in the amber area and reminds us of it on a daily basis.  It is an effective methodology for the project and we have learned that it is impossible to deliver a project of this sort on the basis of the standard tender process.  For the State to define the outcome, it has to engage with industry.  I am happy to talk the Deputy through the stages of the timeline, if that is helpful.</p></speech>

In 2015, before we entered the procurement process, we asked all stakeholders if they thought this was the right way to do it.  The process is big and complex and there is a lot of taxpayers' money at stake.  We identified exactly the technical and financial solutions we wanted from bidders following that engagement and our engagement with international experts.  There was no other way of doing this and, having benchmarked against other projects in other sectors in Ireland and other broadband projects in Europe, we can say that no one has done such a project more quickly.  The majority of PPP and other projects in this State take years because they are big and complex.</p><p>When one gets it wrong, it stalls it for many more years when cases are dragged through the courts.  As the Deputy is aware, there are all those things to factor in when one is doing this.  However,  when one examines the information shown on slide 18 and when one reflects on what we have done in the past two years, I am personally confident that we could not have done anything any more quickly.  We started out with 840,000 premises in 2014 that were not going to get high-speed broadband from the commercial sector.  We are now at 540,000.  I live in an amber area myself but I now see in my area of rural Wicklow that many people are now getting 500 Mbps from the 300,000 homes to which Eircom is now delivering.  That is great news for them but it is not good news for me.  I accept that, but where we are on this trajectory is at the top end of the curve, thank God.  The scars of where we have been for the past two years are over us and we see the prize at the end of this coming by September.  We have moved mountains to get to where we are.  I hope there are not many more mountains to move.  As programme director, I am absolutely confident that we have done everything possible.  I agree that it was done by the book, but we have to do it by the book in order to ensure that it happens and that it does not get dragged through some other process down the line.  We will deliver.  That is the ultimate aim here.  We will deliver by the end of September.<br/><br/>In terms of the other more detailed questions on procurement, without going into the procurement process and what the bidder is or is not doing - because there is a lot of confidential and commercially sensitive information in all of that so we could not disclose it - in the context of whether we have a detailed price, we must go back to the process here and what we got in September.  In any procurement process with competitive dialogue, bidders give us what they call a dummy bid.  We got that in September.  It included more than 3,000 pages of stuff with huge models and everything else and our experts have spent October, November and December going through that.  The bid included technical, financial and all the network information Mr. Neary and his engineers have been looking at for three months.  The way the process works is that we have now given them substantial reports, although not as much in paper, from financial, technical and legal advisers in terms of what we would like to see them do better, where we think they could be more efficient and all those sorts of things one goes through in competitive dialogue in order to ensure the State gets the best outcome.  They have only got that in the past couple of weeks.  They now need to go and recalibrate those models, recalibrate their solutions and then come back into us.<br/><br/>There will not be a final price until we are happy that we have the right solution, namely, the right solution for the State, and that it will be done as fast as possible, which brings me back to the timeline and whether it has a timeline.  We might have been given a timeline and we might have gone back and said we are not happy with it and that we want it done faster and we want it to look at that.  That is what one does in competitive dialogue.  For example, we ask how one<b></b>can get a faster provision in County Clare or County Wicklow or what else could be done more quickly, even if it costs a bit more money.  We are going through all that with the consortium to see how we can get the job done as quickly as possible between 2019 and whatever end date.  Our time plus is time plus minus because we want to get the work done as quickly as possible.  That is product we are dealing with.</p></speech>

Does he not accept then that just having one bidder puts the Department on the back foot?  If Mr. Mulligan were negotiating with two or three bidders, it would be clear that everybody was going to make the best effort.  With one company on its own, it can say that is the best timeline or that is the best price it can do or this is the earliest it can start the roll out.  In effect, it holds all the aces.</p></speech>

Their  prerogative is to make a rate return and to get bums on seats, as I said.  They need to get people to buying the ICP broadband service from them.  They are not here just to get State aid because then they lose their money.  Their prerogative is that they are still in an environment where every part of Ireland has broadband and there is the Eircom provision to 300,000 homes, and there are other operators out there that are spending their own money on certain networks.  This company is going into a highly competitive and highly changeable environment in terms of technology and it needs to hit the ground running.  We are giving any international shareholders that are coming into our process to talk to us and get an investment from the State - because that is what a gap-funded model involves - a grant and they then need to absolutely build this as quick as they can to get people buying the service so that they can get revenue in.  Their revenue model is completely dependent on getting people on board and, as we know, the demand is out there.  They know they will be hit the minute this has started and launched by thousands of orders.  Their prerogative is to get people on board because they need happy customers.  They need people to spend money on the bundles they will set up.  I think there is fundamental pressure on the consortium to deliver for its shareholders, as well as us, and the State is a key shareholder in that.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Deputy Dooley's questions.  Mr. Mulligan referred to value for money.  Deputy Dooley was correct in saying that there is only one bidder in the process now so what are the actual risks to the State in respect, first, of value for money and, second, for the entire project if it goes belly-up?  In terms of the intervention areas, if this plan, which we will call plan B, fails, in my area of Cork alone there will be more than 74,000 premises, which could possibly involve 200,000 individuals, that might not get any broadband.  That is very worrying.</p> <p>  Has a public ownership model, based on existing State infrastructure, such as that owned by the ESB, been considered?  I recently met the Chamber of Commerce in Cork and a number of stakeholders to discuss the Celtic interconnector.  They spoke about utilising existing State infrastructure.  We are talking about very complex operations and bids.</p> <p>  I looked at the metropolitan area networks, MANs, in my area in Cork and in Midleton, Cobh, Cork city, Ballincollig and as far away as Youghal and the points seemed to be there.  If deflectors were used, could we not utilise them and tap into the national network?  Surely 99% of people have electricity in their homes?  Reference was also made to data and tracking in terms of Eircodes and addresses.  If 99% of people have an electricity connection and each person gets a bill, we already have the data and the mapping done.  I am a bit lost in that regard and would welcome some clarification from the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018021500002#F00500"><p>I will start.  As I said at the outset, every piece of infrastructure that can be used will be used.  Going back to the consortium and the State, as shareholders, we need to minimise the cost.  The MANs are in Cork and in approximately 80 places across the country and where they represent the most efficient way to utilise the networks, they will be used.  In some cases, it might be more efficient to use the electricity or Eircom network.  All of those networks are in front of the consortium as options at the moment.  What is being considered is what is the most cost-efficient way of doing it.  The reason areas of the country have not served to date is because while those networks are there, it still costs a lot of money to bring them to the door of the house.  While the electricity or any other network might be there, one still needs to get fibre on poles and through ducts and back to a point of presence in Cork, Wicklow, Dublin or wherever else.  That is why an area has been designated as amber because it is not commercially feasible for anybody to spend their capital to get it from the house back to those points of presence.  That is why we are doing this.  That will happen as part of this process.  We are reducing the amount of any overbuild here where possible but if something needs to be built, it will be built.</p> <p>  In terms of a public ownership model, the Government decided in July 2016 that we would use the commercial gap-funded model, which is a typical model used across member states whereby we offer a grant to the winning consortium.  The fact that an Eircom network, the ESB network or a MANs network might be used as a subcontractor or rented will not make any difference to that ownership model because those networks are owned by the semi-State company, be it, for example, the ESB, or by Eircom or the MANs are owned by the county councils.  Those ownership models are there across the board with the actual infrastructure already, some of which is in State ownership, for example, the ESB, public ownership for the MANs or private ownership such as Eircom and towers and masts are owned by Coillte, for example, a semi-State organisation which may be part of the solution.  A multitude of infrastructure is involved in terms of the solution to deliver in the most cost-efficient way, whether it is predominantly fibre to the home or even fixed wireless or whatever other solution and those will all be leveraged to minimise the cost.</p><p>In Cork, there are potentially 74,000 unconnected premises.  Every county in Ireland has that problem and that is why it is amber.  Our target for Cork and other counties is that we address the problem as soon as possible through 2019 and onwards.  The target now is to turn all of those areas blue.  That is the ultimate objective here.  </p></speech>

They are areas which should be served by commercial operators.  It should not be the case that the State has to intervene to support a commercial operator in a densely populated area.  We are continuing to monitor the plans that have been presented to us that are reaching fruition in the blue areas.  There have been particular barriers or issues that operators encounter, primarily local issues, that, if unlocked, would allow the commercial operators to deploy to those areas.</p> <p>  One of the major initiatives launched to alleviate that has been the mobile phone and broadband task force and 40 actions have been identified through that task force.  It was updated this year with further initiatives, including the appointment of a broadband officer to look at alleviating local issues and updating the planning exemptions for the deployment of telecoms infrastructure.  We have come across premises in the centre of Dublin - one-off premises which are quite close to the building we are in at the moment - where the operator is willing to deploy but has found it cannot get through the planning process.  By bringing people together we found a solution for those premises where they can locate a new cabinet or address an existing cabinet.  </p> <p>  These issues arise as the operator tries to deploy.  On the example I gave, where there is a premises that is very close to a cabinet - this is based on very old legacy data - the operator expects that the premises will receive high-speed broadband but it does not because it is connected to an exchange many kilometres away.  We want to see if we can alleviate problems such as that.  It is not the case that these are suitable for intervention because they are in such densely populated areas.  In saying that, the contract and the initial strategy which was published provide that in the event that there are premises left behind, they could be added to the intervention area in due course.  We have the ability, after the contract is awarded, to increase the number of premises.  Our main tool, however, is to try to address the issues.  We provided an email address at which the Deputies, or indeed the public, can highlight issues to us and we will continue to investigate them.  We then engage with the industry and see how the issue might be alleviated.</p></speech>

I was unavoidably late for this meeting because of another commitment and therefore have not heard all of the questions.  Despite that, I am going to ask questions to which the people I meet seek answers.</p> <p>  There are three specific allegations in the letter from Eir to the Minister of 30 January 2018.  The first concerns the regulatory and governance issues that have been repeatedly highlighted over the past 18 months.  Implicit in that is the suggestion that Eir had flagged its difficulties and that in some way those problems were not adequately responded to.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  The second problem mentioned in the letter is that Eir had grave and growing concerns about the current regulatory environment.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  Is the regulatory environment too oppressive?  If so, will this also be a difficulty for Enet?  If Eir had legitimate difficulties, will Enet face them as well?  </p> <p>  The third issue in the letter from Eir is that there were well-communicated, red-line issues over the period.  Implicit in that is that Eir was very clear about what it wanted and that there was not an adequate response to that and that there was too much tardiness in dealing with the issues.  The people watching and listening to us today or those who will read the Official Report of the meeting would want assurances and a response on those three implicit suggestions in the letter from Eir, namely, a certain tardiness, a failure to deal with red-line issues and an oppressive regulatory environment, as well as the fact that each of those issues had been flagged.  Was enough done?  Was there inflexibility in the witnesses' dealing with Eir during the process?  Was there an unused flexibility in the system?  </p> <p>  There are a few simple basic questions about Enet to which people would like answers.  Can the witnesses explain why Enet will not cost more than it would have cost?  In other words, how will we avoid a situation where it exploits its position as the only bidder?  An assurance around the cost issue would be appreciated, as well an explanation as to why the witnesses are confident about that issue.  There will be some doubting Thomases on this issue; apt terminology given the season we are in at the moment.  </p> <p>  How will the process with Enet work?  How will the process be managed to ensure the kind of objectives the witnesses have are met?  People are wondering about the capacity of Enet to do the job - I acknowledge we have had assurances - but can the witnesses pad that out a little?  The big issue is the timeframe.  Will deadlines be met and when will shovels be in the ground?  When do the witnesses see the whole process completing?  </p> <p>  When the Minister was in the House on the last occasion, I mentioned there are three simple questions that people on the streets are asking.  Will they get the broadband, and when?  Will it be cost-effective?  Will it be efficient?  In essence that is what the questions amount to.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could address the specifics I raised.  </p></speech>

It is not unusual for an operator to be critical of the regulatory environment in the market in which it is operating, as will, I am sure, other operators from time to time.  In saying that, I do not wish to reflect in any way, by way of commentary, on the regulatory environment, which is very much a matter for the independent regulator, ComReg.  The Minister made that point clearly last week when he also suggested the joint committee may wish to consider having a meeting with the regulator to discuss the wider issues.</p><p> We have made clear we will not go into the specifics of the procurement process.  We showed members a timeline.  I will not and cannot discuss red line issues and it would be wrong to do so.  However, I point to the timeline in this regard.  It is a matter of record that in this process the detailed solutions stage was about to complete at the point at which Eir withdrew.  By the end of January 2018, bidders had to provide the Department with their final red line issues.  The Department would consider these and the aim was that over the coming weeks, the final contract would be settled on for the tender stage.  It was clear the engagement with bidders in the process around their views on the contract had not concluded at that point and there was still space for that. </p><p> All I can say on the issue of flexibility is that I am confident, having been there and seen it, that the team is acting in an appropriate manner in approaching this project on the basis that there is a strategy to be delivered and the team is acting on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland in delivering that strategy.  The bidders will act on behalf of their stakeholders.  While a certain amount of tension is to be anticipated in the process, it was being managed effectively.  Mr. Mulligan will respond to the remaining questions. </p></speech>

By the end of this year, that figure will have increased to 1.8 million.  The momentum on the delivery of broadband is significant and we will ensure it is maintained and accelerated.  That is our prerogative.  There is no question that we will get 100% of the country covered.  In terms of timelines, the question is when this will be achieved.  By the end of this year, we will have a detailed timeline from the consortium for when it will be able to achieve this.  We will not know what the timeline will be until then because we are working through the detail.  As I indicated, part of the detail is that the Department will apply as much pressure as possible to ensure the process is concluded as quickly as possible.  With the competitive dialogue process we are running, we can engage with the consortium to identify what can be done to have the process completed quicker before we get a final tender.</p> <p>  In terms of the ability of Enet to do this, one fundamental point is that one must qualify to be included in a tender process.  In 2016, five consortiums applied to be part of our tender process and three consortiums, including Enet, qualified.  The company went through a very robust qualification process which demonstrated that it had the experience, understanding and projects to prove it could do a large-scale project.  We have no doubt it can do it. </p></speech>

The two areas I wish to talk about are flood risk management and estate management, including our heritage estate.</p> <p>  Members are aware that flooding is a natural event that can cause widespread damage and have a devastating effect on communities, property and infrastructure.  It is well known that I have a keen interest in ensuring that the correct actions are taken to prevent and decrease flood risk.  Where flooding is likely to occur, the State must provide protection and a speedy response to assist communities and properties.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, I welcome the additional &euro;25 million in funding made available in the Revised Estimates to continue to address this challenging issue.  Effective flood risk management is a long-term commitment that involves adopting capital infrastructural and non-infrastructural measures.  I am pleased to say how my office has produced detailed analysis of flood risk in 300 identified communities, including 19 coastal areas throughout the OPW catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  This programme has proposed a number of measures to be undertaken as outlined within the 29 flood risk management plans across the State and it also established the prioritisation of our resources in order to deliver maximum benefit to the State.</p> <p>  In addition to the flood defence schemes already completed, eight major schemes are now under construction and 2018 will see the substantial completion of another four schemes in Dublin, Galway, Louth and Clare.  Subject to planning approval I expect that eight further schemes will commence in the coming year, including five within the Cork region.  I have also worked with my office to develop a range of other measures to tackle flood risk, which include the OPW minor flood mitigation and coastal protection schemes in partnership with local authorities, a pilot scheme in County Mayo of individual property protection measures, flood forecasting in conjunction with the Met &Eacute;ireann and a number of community resilience initiatives.</p> <p>  The second main area of funding in the OPW Vote relates to estate management.  The estate managed by the OPW is made up of more than 2,000 properties and is a critical part of the State's economic, operational and cultural infrastructure.  Being very conscious of the current improved economic outlook and anticipating an increase in Ireland's population over the next 20 years, I am planning for the future with the OPW for a similar increase in required public services.  As such, my office is continually reviewing the accommodation needs to deliver current and future effective public services which is a key priority within A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p> <p>  From 2008 to 2016, the OPW restructured State office accommodation with the surrender of more than 2 million sq. ft and a reduction in the annual State rent bill of &euro;43 million per annum.  Given the evidence in 2017 of an increase requirement for Civil Service accommodation and upward trends in the rental market, this will be difficult to sustain into the future.  My office will, however, continue to seek value for money within the State rental portfolio and focus especially on continued effective use of State-owned property.  The funding provided in the Revised Estimate supports a continuation of this efficiency drive by providing &euro;3.5 million to buy sites and properties where they are considered to provide the greatest value for money.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the heritage estate.  The good news is the significant increase in visitor numbers and the revenue received by the Exchequer in 2017 is expected to be sustained in 2018.  The not so good news is that the condition of a number of these properties is poor and worsening with the additional pressure created by these increased visitor numbers.  It has been demonstrated in recent years at sites such as Kilmainham Gaol that there is a link between revenue and reinvestment.  It is now critical for us to consider reinvesting some of the income received in the heritage estate in order to sustain and develop a highly important and crucial economic asset.</p> <p>  My office is currently working in tandem with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and others to develop and improve these areas with many projects scheduled to start on visitor sites in 2018.  Overall, my office works extremely hard at a time of budgetary pressures to ensure appropriate works are prioritised and measures undertaken to complement those already in place.  The office is now well positioned to invest any additional resources to be allocated by the Government in the coming years in these two very important areas of State investment; flood risk management and estate management.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the time allotted to my opening address.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware I am very much to the fore in trying to deliver schemes across the State.  My priority is to really deliver on those schemes, and at a faster pace if I can, by which I mean I have a number of areas I want to look at in terms of planning to see if I can speed up the process.  I have meetings with the planning section and the heritage section.  Where we find difficulties I hope to make some progress.</p></speech>

I brought one such scheme to the Minister of State's attention.  Huge money seems to be spent on consultants and design and it can take years before a relatively minor project actually starts work under construction.  Does the Minister of State believe that system is working well or can it be improved?</p></speech>

We made a big improvement around the minor works scheme and we changed the criteria to allow local authorities to come back in where schemes have failed in the past.  It also made it easier for them to get more funding to deal with minor works schemes.</p><p>However, there is also room for improvement in the planning process where we can make gains.  A flood defence scheme is not easy to design.  One cannot just tell an engineer that this is the design.  A scheme must take climate change and, if it on the coast, rising sea levels into account, to make sure it is built to the highest standard and protects people in the future.  I have seen housing developments where developers put in a flood relief scheme that did not live up to the task.  I am dealing with one in County Donegal currently.  The Deputy can see where I am coming from.  We have to allow the consultants to come up with the design.  I acknowledge there is toing and froing but I am examining that.</p></speech>

It is one of the largest schemes to be taken on.  The Deputy lives in the area and there are issues.  People are objecting but we are all working together.  I give great credit to the local councillors in Cork whom I have met.  I am happy that they are working with my Department and with the people of Cork, which is more important.</p></speech>

One of the group's tweets states:</p><blockquote>The Little Island Tidal Barrier has been studied by world experts and would cost &euro;140m. Walls would cost over &euro;300m and protect much less of #Cork city. The best solution for Cork is the tidal barrier because it benefits everyone. We need an independent and transparent review.</blockquote> <p>What is his response to that?</p></speech>

A great deal of work and consulting has taken place.  The Save Cork City campaign has come up these figures and it has brought in external experts.  According to the best advice available to us, we are doing the right thing.  The officials who visited from Holland also recognised that what we are doing is the best option for the people of Cork.  The campaign says that we have not looked at tidal barriers.  Of course, we have looked at them.  We have examined all options available to us but my job is to deliver a scheme as fast as possible for the people of Cork.  When owners are in their shops in Cork and the water is up to their ankles while jewellery is floating around or customers cannot get to the butcher or the hairdresser, the business owners are roaring at me about what I am doing.  I have taken the views of the Save Cork City campaign on board but, like all schemes, when people see the work starting on the ground, they will buy into it.  I assure the Deputy that it will be the best money spent on behalf of the people of Cork.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the devastating flooding events in the past but people expect the scheme to be implemented in the best possible way to minimise intrusiveness and physical barriers and to make it as attractive and as aesthetically pleasing as possible.  Has the tidal barrier option been assessed by the OPW or has the Minister of State had it independently examined?</p></speech>

The important issue to note with a tidal barrier is it will protect against tidal flooding.  We still have a major problem with the discharge from the hydroelectric dam and such a barrier would not solve that problem.  Both issues need to be addressed.  As part of our preliminary assessment, we did quite a body of analysis on a tidal barrier and what it would cost.  We estimated it would cost in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Following the public consultation exercise, we conducted a more detailed analysis of the barrier.  The Save Cork City campaign uses a high level costing for a possible solution in a particular location.  Our assessment, done by our own engineers who are international experts, looked at where a barrier would be located and it is important to note that the OPW has never said that a tidal barrier would not be an appropriate solution.  It would work; it is just not cost efficient.</p> <p>  With regard to assessing it, there are navigation and location issues.  We would not recommend the same location.  Equally, we have to be careful because of special areas of conservation and habitats within the harbour area.  They would result in a greater cost in addition to the construction cost of tidal barrier.  Looking at everything in considerable detail, we concluded that while a barrier is a potential solution, the cost would be prohibitive.</p></speech>

While Mr. Syndenham said the figure the Save Cork City Campaign has come up with may be realistic if the barrier could be constructed wherever we wanted, there are many difficulties relating to navigation, conservation areas and so on, which would push up the cost.  Will the Minister of State confirm that a tidal barrier could be built for the figure being quoted but not in the most effective location because of the additional costs, and that is why there is such a huge disparity in the figures being quoted by the OPW and the Save Cork City campaign?</p><p>The plans for the Morrison's Island works have now gone on public show at City Hall.  If one goes down to Cork City Hall there is a full-scale replica of the proposed works.  One can see the width of the footpaths and the heights of the walls.  When people look at it, they see it is not what this campaign group has told them will be in place.  I personally welcome the fact that the Morrison's Island works have gone out to Part 8 public consultation.  I hope we can move ahead with it very quickly and continue the works.  In my opinion the issue of the tidal barrier is a red herring.  We need to move forward with the OPW project as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State might comment on the differences in process.</p></speech>

As the commissioner, Mr. Sydenham, said we did look at the tidal barrier but it was not cost-efficient.  On my visit to Cork I met with people, including people from the Save Cork City group.  The idea of the model at City Hall is one I have used.  I have seen, in a number of areas, that people have observations on the heights of walls.  I do the ordinary thing, which is to cut an election poster to the height of the wall, paint it grey and put lines on it.  That shows the height of the wall.  People then say that is not what they are being told and that they are being told quite the opposite.  That is similar to what has been going on in Cork.  I am not saying that the people of the Save Cork City group do not have the best interests of Cork at heart, but this has been going on for eight years and Save Cork City has only come out with these waves, as I would call them, in the past 12 months or so.  The first complaint was that we were not putting enough money into heritage.  We are putting a considerable amount of money - &euro;20 million - into the heritage of Cork, its quay walls and the infrastructure that is there.  It is badly needed.</p> <p>  The widening of the footpaths at Morrison's Island, which the Deputy mentioned, is something that the people want.  We have done nothing without consultation.  We had quite a number of public consultation meetings.  We even had them up here in the audiovisual room of Leinster House.  The Deputies themselves did not take part in it.  When people say that we did not engage, I would say that we engaged quite widely with all groups involved.  As I said we are breaking the works up into different cells.  People can see the model of the Morrison's Island works which is on show and they will see that we intend to get in and get out without much disruption to traffic or business.  That is what we want to see.</p></speech>

The campaign group itself also appeared before a committee of the Oireachtas.  As I said, as somebody from Cork I want to see the project pushed ahead as quickly as possible from the OPW side.  Can the Minister of State give us any update on the issue of insurance?  Has he met with any members of the insurance industry around reworking the memorandum of understanding?  That might be more the Minister of Finance's area.  Does the Minister of State have any comment on that issue?</p> <p>  On the sale of properties by the OPW, why are so many sold by private treaty rather than by auction?  Obviously with private treaty sales it is very difficult to get the names of the people who are buying the properties.  I have the reply to an interesting parliamentary question which my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, tabled.  He asked how many building were licensed by the OPW for community use in each of the past five years.  Only 12 have been transferred for community use.  Would the Minister of State agree that is on the low side?  Could we be doing more to transfer those properties for community use?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and I did meet with Insurance Ireland.  We had an open meeting with all the members of Insurance Ireland.  I laid down a few criteria or things that I wanted to see happen.  In fairness to Insurance Ireland, in terms of the memorandum of understanding my Department has with it, we are working very well together.  Wherever we are building defences the industry is coming in behind us and offering insurance.  There are issues in respect of insurance and that is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but as I said I work closely with all those involved for the interests of the public.  I do believe more needs to be done but in order for more to be done it is up to us to deliver on the defences to allow people to get insurance.  That is the most important thing.  Any other issue in that regard would lie with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I might ask Mr. Bourke to speak on the sale of properties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Bourke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018021500002#C00500"><p>On the question of community use, 12 properties have been licensed.  On the process that the Office of Public Works uses, we have approximately 2,200 properties that we manage, own or lease.  Of those, approximately 90 to 100 would be considered vacant and would be available, whether for community use or any other use.  Over 50% of those properties are Garda stations that were closed under the 2012 to 2013 Government plan.  They are being held subject to a review being conducted by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority so they are not available for ourselves or anybody else until the outcome of that review is known.  That is right and proper.</p> <p>  Under certain circumstances we will consider community use if a viable business plan is presented and if the community in question can sustain the building under a licence arrangement.   As the Deputy can imagine, over the years we would have had a number of inquiries about the use of properties, although not a huge amount of them.  It tends to fall down when the community groups start doing their business plans and realise that if the roof gets blown off in a storm tomorrow, if the property gets flooded or if it would have to take out insurance, they often could not afford to deal with it.  If a property is licensed to a group, it must look after it.  It must sustain it and it must pay for the electricity and all the utilities that would go with the property.  Often when groups confront themselves with that reality the idea becomes problematic for them.  </p> <p>  I have been involved with property for a year and a half or two years and in that time we have had the keys of properties handed back to us on a number of occasions.  People tell us that they had a very good concept and very good intentions but that the person who was involved has moved on.  Things dissipate as they go on.  The intention is often very good but we have to be careful that a property which is being used is being protected and cared for.  Other than that, often the only logical thing to do with these properties is to sell them.  The money then goes back into the Exchequer for use by community groups or other Departments to help communities through the normal funding arrangements.</p></speech>

If there is a hold on transferring Garda stations because of the review, there is probably very little likelihood of further properties being transferred for community use given that the previous 12 were former Garda stations.</p></speech>

While the review is ongoing we must be honest with ourselves that a number of the properties we have are Garda stations which may never come back into use.  I am bringing in the Minister, Deputy Ring's Department in terms of looking at some community involvement in that regard.  While this review is going on an awful lot of State properties are lying idle that might be put to good use.  Based on what Mr. Bourke has said, we need to give comfort to the communities that do get these properties that money will be given from a different Departments to help them in terms of infrastructure, or the development or protection of those buildings and to make them livable or occupiable for the use in question.  I am looking at that personally and I have met with the two Ministers in that regard.  It is something we are working on.</p></speech>

Is there a reason some go to auction and some are sold by private treaty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Bourke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018021500002#C00900"><p>The vast majority of properties we have disposed of over the years - and the number is diminishing at this time because there are just fewer to dispose of - have gone to auction.</p><p>If there is a special interest on a property, for instance if there is a garden adjoining somebody's house, entering into an arrangement with the person might be considered because there would almost be a moral obligation to do some class of business with the person, subject to an independent valuation.  At present, the majority of action taking place on the disposal of properties is actually with regard to other State agencies, particularly local authorities.  Before any property is disposed of, either through private treaty or at auction, a protocol is in place and there is a circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that requires the property would first be offered to State bodies, such as local authorities, the Department of Education and Skills or the HSE, to see whether they require the property.  This was part of the OPW's reform agenda on property and we now do this as a matter of course.  As a result of this, particularly in the context of the housing and homelessness issue, there has been an amount of interest in vacant properties.  Some local authorities have taken an interest, particularly Dublin City Council, and we have worked with it to transfer those properties under the protocol.  We also have similar arrangements in Limerick, Cork and Tipperary.  It is a fluid situation and we are trying to make sure the properties are used to their optimum.  As a general rule, if they have to be disposed of we advertise them.  We get an auctioneer and advertise them so everyone would have a fair chance to get them.</p></speech>

In 2015 that changed to ten by public auction and 19 by private treaty, and in 2016 there was only one by public auction and 18 by private treaty.  There has certainly been a shift away, based on the information I have, from public auction to private treaty.  Is this a policy decision or is it just the way things have panned out?</p></speech>

It tends to be the circumstances of the particular property, and without me having the absolute detail in front of me I suggest that quite a number of properties sold by private treaty related to residences attached to Garda stations.  Often, a former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was already resident there and possibly had been there for many years.  There is an almost moral obligation not to put out these people, but they would still have to pay the market value, as independently valued by a body such as the Valuation Office.  Often this is the reason.  It is that somebody is already in the house, and we cannot really get involved in an eviction situation as it would not be right.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues in my constituency, and I presume around the country, where people have suffered flooding.  The local authority has engaged in flood prevention work, which apparently is to a 100 year standard, but the people are still unable to access insurance because the OPW does not include it in the memorandum of understanding with the insurance companies.  I think this is because it is at too low a level and involves relatively small technical work.  It leaves these people, as far as I can understand it and presumably it affects quite a few people around the country, still in a position whereby flood prevention work has been carried out, which may or may not be to the required standard as I cannot speak to that, but they are still unable to access insurance.  Is there any plan to deal with this?</p></speech>

In recent years, we have worked on a memorandum of understanding with insurance companies.  Now, where we build flood defences 70% and, in some cases, 78% of the properties are insured.  Investment by the Government and the good work done by the OPW - throughout the country anywhere we have built fences none of them has ever failed thank God - means insurers are helping people to insure their homes.</p></speech>

I had thought that scheme would have resolved the insurance issues but in the past two weeks I have discovered a number of properties along John's Quay in Kilkenny city are having difficulty in getting insurance.  That was an area that was constantly flooded before the scheme.  Where do they go with that query?  Is the Department involved in any way in investigating one-off issues such as this, where residents are affected but the Government has spent so much money on a scheme?</p></speech>

Recently, I submitted a matter for a Topical Issue debate to the Ceann Comhairle's office, which ended up in the office of the Minister of State.  The intention was to ask the OPW whether it would take the lead role from among a number of agencies.  It was to do with works that are required at Tinnahinch in Carlow and Graiguenamanagh in Kilkenny.  I received a reply from the Minister of State, and I appreciate it, but I wanted to raise as a Topical Issue rather than a parliamentary question.  I want to explain to the Minister of State the reason for this is that a considerable amount of work must be done on both sides of the river at that point.  This work will involve a number of agencies, including Kilkenny County Council, Carlow County Council, Waterways Ireland, Irish Water and, I presume, the OPW, because there is still a flooding issue at one point along that section of river.  There is also the issue of the removal of sandbags that were put there to prevent flooding.  Those sandbags cannot be removed because of the fact the flooding continues, and there is a fear that a house or two would be flooded.  I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister of State again whether he will look at the possibility of the OPW taking a lead role in bringing these agencies together so that an overall plan can be put in place to deliver all of the work required under supervision.  The river must be cleaned along there as must the eyelets of the bridges.</p></speech>

However, when all of those other agencies are involved I will gladly mediate and sit with the Chairman to see if he can get a positive outcome for the people inquiring, but the Department would have very little say with regard to what the Chairman is asking me to do.  If a local authority came in for a minor works scheme that is where I would fit in and I am glad to help wherever I can.</p><p>I know it is difficult and frustrating when many agencies are involved and it is hard to know who is taking the lead role.  The OPW has 10% to 20% responsibility for that.  I am offering my support, as a mediator, to bring the agencies together.  I will do that with a heart and a half but I cannot engage with Irish Water and all of those other entities that do not come under my remit.</p></speech>

The Minister of State touched on maintenance generally in his opening remarks.  I tabled a parliamentary question about it but I am raising it here because I believe it is an issue.  There is significant work to be done to the outside of the castle.  I can see it and visitors to the castle can also see it.  I want to ask again if that work will be undertaken.</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of work to be done at Kilkenny Castle and I have spoken to my officials on the heritage side about it.  Where we can make improvements we are making them.  It comes down to funding.  Heritage has been starved of funding for a number of years but where we can invest money, we are doing so.  I have spoken to my officials about Kilkenny Castle, and I will come back to the Chairman about it.  Some ongoing works are taking place in respect of the windows in the castle.  There are a great number of windows to be replaced and that is something at which we are looking.</p></speech>

A significant number of tourists visit the castle, even outside of the main tourist season.  It is a big economic generator for Kilkenny city and it is important that it is maintained.  The staffing at the castle and the promotion of the parade tower concern me as well.  It has been brought to my attention that security on the castle grounds needs to be improved.  While there are significant numbers of tourists, there are occasions when the security presence is not what it should be.  I have asked for that to be reviewed a number of times, in the interest of the protection of the castle and its grounds.  I have not received a response that is in any way encouraging.</p></speech>

At one stage, it was transferred into the ownership of the castle restoration committee and later it was transferred onwards by that committee.  The OPW arranged for a plaque to be unveiled at the castle.  I understood that this was to be a temporary measure.  However, I believe that the history of the transfer of that castle should be celebrated publicly.  I stand by my views on that and encourage the Minister of State to look at it again.  I raised the mater last year and I am raising it again now.</p></speech>

As a result of his raising the issue last year, we initiated a conversation with the Butler family.  There were two transfers.  The first transfer was made to the Butler trust in 1967 and two years later the State became involved.  It is our intention to celebrate the involvement of the State in Kilkenny Castle on the 50 year anniversary of that, in 2019.  At the Chairman's request, we made contact with the Butler family last year when it was organising a gathering.  Matters were a little bit rushed and a bit last-minute but we did succeed in getting a plaque to commemorate that event.  The family, the foundation and the committee involved in the castle were very appreciative of that.</p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that there is a possibility of bringing that celebration of ownership to the community.  Kilkenny Castle is very much appreciated in the town and there is an opportunity to celebrate the fact that it is in State ownership and is a tremendous benefit to the town.  Our plan is that we will have a bigger celebration on the occasion of the 50-year anniversary of the transfer to the State.</p></speech>

I have listened to what Mr. Buckley has said.  I look forward to 2019 and to acknowledging the people who participated in that event.</p> <p>  At a meeting on 15 February last year, I raised an issue about a business in Kilkenny, namely Brett's Mills, which had been in operation for 100 years.  The mill is located just outside the city.  The OPW spent some flood protection money on it.  I understand that some money was given to the business-owner to assist with flood protection.  The flooding that occurred before the last major flood destroyed the house again and put the man out of business.  He spent his money, restored the premises and got on with it, but the same thing happened again.  Is there any relief for someone like him?  The house were his son and family had lived is now destroyed and is uninhabitable.  The man moved out of his own property because of the flooding issue and his business has been destroyed.  The business had existed for 100 years.  It is a mill which had wheels driven by the river.  It cannot exactly be moved elsewhere.</p></speech>

I have come across similar situations in a number of areas.  I am looking at individual home protection.  The Chairman can imagine all that has happened in the eight months since I took up my role.  This is an area on which I wish to focus.  We have people whose properties have been flooded and finding an engineering solution is key.  Such a solution can be found to protect a number of properties but incidents such as the Chairman has mentioned would require the help of an individual home protection scheme.  I am in favour of such a scheme and I am looking at helping people to get individual protection.</p><p>I say that with great interest because I know many people who it affects.  With regard to the house relocation scheme, there are many people who do not want to relocate; they want to find a solution.  It is something I am working on but it will be later in the year before I will be able to come back to the committee on it.</p></speech>

That was in the context of a preliminary assessment looking at both these areas which concluded there was no viable major flood scheme for either area.  On a pilot basis, we looked at whether individual property protection would work.  The conclusion was it could work but the downside of the scheme is it would give protection for a one in 15 year event.  The Chairman will be familiar with the level of damage from the 2015 floods, which was extensive.  They were one in 100 year floods so individual property protection would give no defence against the consequences of a flooding event of that magnitude.  We have subsequently looked at both areas again and concluded there are viable CFRAM schemes for both areas.  Technically, they are doable.  Our colleagues had an engagement with the local authority to go through these issues.  What has been identified, given the nature of the adjoining rivers, is that the fixed defences, the embankments and the walls would be very high.  In Thomastown, we could be looking at in excess of 2 m so visually there is a potential impact which we have discussed with the local authority.  There may be an option to put Perspex inserts into them to lessen the visual impact.  If we go that route, the cost of the scheme will start to increase rapidly and then it will have to be assessed against the benefit.  We are in the process of working our way through what the optimum approach is.  The important thing is we have now identified technically viable schemes for both those areas.</p></speech>

Where the OPW does a large scheme, in most instances it will do the maintenance on the scheme.  Our primary responsibility would be in the drainage districts where we have arterial drainage.

It has been formally transferred to the State.  The OPW was the key trustee.  I was the trustee on the estate.  We accepted on behalf of the State the formal handover of Mount Congreve and that is being transferred through the trust to Waterford City and County Council.  That was finalised last Friday.  As we speak it is now being run by Waterford City and County Council.</p></speech>

In 2016, the then Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, wrote to me on the Arts for Peace Foundation and Durrow Abbey.  He welcomed the fact that he had written and proposed a meeting and that both parties were going to focus to mutually resolve the current impasse, recognising the issue faced by all and agreeing a way forward.</p> <p>  I met the then Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and some of the officials on two if not three occasions and I felt the issue was being moved forward in a positive way and that a resolution would be found.  I am deeply disappointed that effort was not brought over the line.  My feeling is that while there was reluctance on both sides to find a resolution, the greater reluctance was on the side of the OPW.</p> <p>  In spite of the papers being served, both the Minister of State and his officials know, that papers can be served and deals can be done even after that.  Papers can be served at times, and I believe this is one of them, when the client on the other side is pushed to the point where if they do not serve the papers before a particular date, they lose.  To protect their position, they serve the papers.</p> <p>  I believe that the  Arts for Peace Foundation as a project is an excellent project.  I have visited Durrow Abbey and looked at the building.  It is in good shape and I think it should be in the ownership of the State as it was.  I firmly believe that with an effort, with both sides sitting down without being tied by legal process and without prejudice, they could reach a resolution, rather than spend unnecessary funds and scarce resources on a case when in my opinion the Arts for Peace Foundation has a good case.  Going to court is a step beyond common sense in my opinion in this instance.</p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to do as Deputy Canney did, and bring the client and the officials back to the table and make a last effort.  It does not harm the court case.  I have seen instances where this was done in commercial cases.  I have seen it done through mediation.  I have seen it done in my ways.  I think the State has an obligation to protect Durrow Abbey, not to damage the Arts for Peace Foundation any further and to be careful with taxpayers' money.  </p> <p>  I am asking the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, and the chairman at least to make some effort, without putting this case into question, to try to resolve it. </p></speech>

Once papers are served, I have to protect the OPW.  The OPW did not want to go to court but once papers were served we had to take that course.</p> <p>  I have no problem meeting the Chairman and other people involved at a later date.  Once papers were served I have to be careful about what I have to say.</p></speech>

However, if each side has a jot of common sense, they will not end up in court.  I am not a spokesperson for the Arts for Peace Foundation.  I am not involved at all in it, it is not in my constituency and I have no personal connection, but when I saw the building and came to an understanding of how the building was leased, there is an obligation on the OPW and on the Arts for Peace Foundation to make an effort to resolve the issue before it goes to court.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State and the Chairman of the OPW to talk to their officials.   I encourage them to find a way to have a meeting, without jeopardising their own position.    </p></speech>

The first proposal, in amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Mick Wallace, is to extend the time during which sales will be permitted to 7 p.m.  I support this proposal and ask the Minister to consider it before the Report Stage debate.</p> <p>  A second proposal by Deputy Wallace would ensure breweries that are unable to provide guided tours are not prohibited from selling their product to customers.  This proposal should be reflected in the Bill before it is passed and I will support on Report Stage any amendment by the Minister or Deputy Wallace to give effect to it.   </p></speech>

It makes sense to allow smaller breweries and distilleries to provide off-sales.  It is reasonable to argue that such a provision would assist tourism.  I also support the amendment to extend the permissible opening time by one hour.</p></speech>

As we heard on the news today, pubs in rural areas need to generate income of between &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 per week to stay open.  Deputy Mick Wallace stated yesterday that he comes from a rural part of County Wexford.  We should provide as much support as possible to pubs in rural areas.  I fully support breweries offering tours but, as I stated yesterday, we should take small rather than big steps.  The main reason I support the Bill is that it will encourage tourism and job creation.</p></speech>

We are united on the need to address this anomaly and the majority of us are coming to the same conclusions on two other issues.  I do not have a problem with the proposal to extend to 7 p.m. the time during which off-sales would be permitted.  One minor issue that remains to be addressed is the sale of products below the wholesale price.  We must deal with this matter on Report Stage.  I share the views expressed by other Deputies on it.  I propose that we accept the Government amendment and address the two other issues on Report Stage.  I will be willing to work with other Deputies and departmental officials on drafting amendments that would meet the requirements.</p></speech>

Diageo and Heineken account for more than 99% of the beer products sold in pubs.  We were approached by a large brewery which tried to bribe us.  It promised us X amount free per month if we included their beers and excluded Irish craft beers from the provisions.  That is the truth.  The large breweries have an incredible stranglehold on the industry.  The <i>status quo</i>is that Diageo and Heineken have complete control of the market.  They invest money, create banners and so on and get young people into drinking.  They have played a major role in alcohol becoming a serious problem in this country.  Most Deputies agree that promoting craft beer and small breweries will lead us to a better rather than a worse place in terms of our approach to alcohol.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will get a broader flavour of the disposition of Members of the House during the Report Stage debate.  However, in saying we can revisit issues on Report Stage, I do not want to raise expectations.</p><p>When Deputy Wallace talks about facilitating people who "call around", that is his terminology, that may differ somewhat from the purpose of the Bill, which Deputy Kelly described in 2016 as being to facilitate visitors on guided tours to tourist attractions.  That is a little at variance with people calling around to stock up from off-sales and treating the facility as an off-licence, I would be concerned about that but we will return to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Without this amendment the provisions of section 1 that we have just inserted might well be open to legal challenge.

I bring it forward at the request of the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 1094(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 deals with tax clearance requirements.  This amendment is required to bring the tax clearance conditions attaching to the licence created under this legislation for the new licence into line with the conditions which are applicable to the other licences in the code of intoxicating liquor licences. </p></speech>

For this reason amendment No. 8 inserts a commencement provision in the form of a new subsection (2) in section 3 of the Bill, which is not dissimilar to many such provisions in many Bills coming before this committee.  In moving this amendment I am mindful of the comments made by Deputy Kelly, which I am sure are echoed around the table.  It is my desire that this legislation, if enacted, will come into force on the earliest possible date and I wish to assure members of the committee of that.

If amendment No. 157 is agreed, then amendments Nos. 158 and 159 cannot be moved.  This represents a new section and acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 50.</p></speech>

I tried to identify those necessary to preserve the procedures committee, which I think is a decision we agreed.  Amendment No. 162 relates to that.  I will try to indicate those amendments I will be opposing and those I will be supporting as I go on.</p><p>In respect of amendment Nos. 157 and 160, which are related, these are amendments proposed by Dr. Patrick O'Brien, who was referred to in previous sessions.  We have had a debate recently about the Government requiring, or at least the perception that it requires, discretion in relation to appointments.  I refer to the conflict between that and the desire to have a fully transparent process with the judicial appointments commission making as much of the decision as possible.</p><p>Where the person appointed to judicial office is not a person who was recommended by the judicial appointments commission, amendment No. 157 requires that a reasoned written decision would be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il </i>explaining the reason for that person's appointment outside of the judicial appointments commission process.  Similarly, amendment No. 160 relates to the placing of a statement before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 30 days of that appointment giving a written decision as to why a person was appointed who was not nominated by the commission.  There is clear and obvious sense to it.  Whatever the arguments about constitutionality, if the committee accepts the case that the Government must have a greater degree of discretion than the judicial appointment commission provides to it, then in the exceptionally rare circumstances that people would be appointed outside this process the Oireachtas and the public deserve to have an understanding as to why this was the case.  This provides for that.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 157 would require a proposed new subsection (2), the publication in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il </i>of a reasoned written explanation of any decision.  In addition, under the proposed new subsection (3), the persons who are recommended by the commission must not be identified in such publication.  My difficulty is that the amendment would require the Government to explain in writing the hows and wherefores of why, in any particular instance, the advice given to the President in regard to an appointment may concern a candidate other than the one actually recommended by the commission.  It, therefore, puts a clear onus and responsibility on the Government to justify actions taken on foot of the exercise of what is a constitutional provision.  There is that problem but aside from that, I am not sure what the value or benefit of such an amendment might be, and what its practical impact might be in terms of fairness to all those involved in the process, be they a recommended candidate or a candidate that did not make the cut.  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said, that it is a desire on his part for increased transparency around the process of how, in what circumstances and in what way the Government would advise the President as to the appointment.  I have said this before and rather than delaying the committee's proceedings, I reiterate that my position is the same.  As a fundamental position, I cannot support any amendment that might give the impression or be perceived to undermine what is a clear constitutional prerogative on the part of the Government in the matter of judicial appointments.</p><p>Similarly, on amendment No. 160, I see it as compromising, interfering or even undermining the manner in which the constitutional position, where the Government is free to reject the recommendation of the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-15a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021500002#E00400"><p>Deputy Jack Chambers and I will support amendments Nos. 157 and 160, partly because there is a similar provision in our own legislation which has passed Second Stage.  I note the Minister says he is opposed to it because he thinks that it is constitutionally frail and could impinge on the prerogative of the Government to nominate individuals for appointment.  That point is valid in regard to amendments Nos. 150 and 151, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, which we voted down.  I am not sure that their suggestions were unconstitutional but I had concerns if the Government was told that it must select, and could only select, a person from the three names given to the Government by the commission.  That is on the borderline of constitutionality.  However, what is proposed in amendments Nos. 157 and 160 is different.  What is proposed there is that the commission gives the three names to the Government.  Under the Minister's proposal in the legislation, as drafted, all that is required is that if the Government does not select one of those three names, it must publish that fact in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;l</i>.  That is exactly the same as the current position, so there is no substantive change in the law.  It is appropriate that if the Government makes a decision that it is not going to appoint one of the three people nominated, that it should provide a reasoned explanation as to why it is not doing so.  It does not involve referring to the individuals who have not been appointed.  If, say, Jack Chambers was appointed but he was not one of the three on the list, the Minister or the Government should say that Mr. Justice Chambers was appointed, although he was not nominated by the commission, and it should explain the reason it selected him.  Maybe he has particular expertise in medical legal law and the Government needed an expert in that area to hear many cases or perhaps he has an expertise in the Irish language and there was a vacancy in the area and we needed more expertise in the Irish language.  It is not something that is difficult to do.  If we do not have that, we will have gone through all this process of putting in a new structure when, ultimately, there will be no change from the current situation.  For those reasons, we will support the amendments.</p></speech>

I ought to have acknowledged that he had included this in his original Bill, although it was brought to my attention via Dr. Patrick O'Brien.  We have had a debate around whether or not the Government could be constrained.  I am not convinced that it is unconstitutional but we have arrived at a decision in regard to that.  What this does is clearly quite different.  It tries to ensure that there is an incentive for the Government not to ride roughshod over the process, and to ensure that it is not too easy for Government to constantly go outside the process.  The process is very clear.  If the Government sees a compelling reason for appointing someone to a particular position, a person who was not considered by the judicial appointments commission, it is at liberty to do so but it is absolutely reasonable that it be required to justify that and give a reason in the process that is outlined in the amendment.  It is standard enough in legislation and in many processes for a Minister or Government to make a statement.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I have listened to both Deputies.  I am wondering what type of reason is envisaged.  What might the reason be and in what form might the publication take?  Deputy O'Callaghan gave an example of the appointment of his colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers, but what kind of reason would he see as being appropriate should Deputy Chambers not be the subject of a recommendation?  In what detail would the notice be required?  I am concerned that we will have entered constraining territory, from the Government's point of view and constitutionally.</p></speech>

Surely, if the Minister is trying to reform the process, there is a need to provide explanation and further detail.  That is in Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's drafting.  No person will be identified.  It is a case of formalising and opening up the process in the context of transparency.  Perhaps the Minister can provide further detail on how he believes this would impinge constitutionally, apart from saying that it has constitutional implications.  The committee should know what exactly these are in the Minister's view.</p> <p>  I can understand the position in respect of the previous amendment if the only recommendation has to be that someone would be appointed by Government or "the Government shall" appoint a particular person.  That certainly has constitutional implications but I am unsure how this drafting would have any constitutional implications.</p></speech>

It only happens exceptionally, although it happened recently.  This would be the position under the legislation we are discussing.  Let us suppose that the commission nominates three and the Government decides not to accept and opts to nominate another individual instead..  Then, under what is proposed, all that would happen would be that the Government would have to say that the person appointed was not recommended by the commission.  There is no change.</p></speech>

It is perfectly reasonable to provide an explanation and justification.</p> <p>  It is the case that this has not happened often.  I hope it would be the case that it would not happen often.  However, if there was a Government that was minded to appoint multiple judges outside the standard process on several occasions, this measure would act as a disincentive.

That means that there has to be proficiency in the Irish language within each court.  It certainly does not mean that one can only be appointed a judge if one can speak Irish.  The vast majority of people appointed as judges will not be able to hear cases in Irish, but it is important that each court has within it judges proficient in the language in order that the constitutional right of citizens to have their cases heard through the national language can be vindicated.</p></speech>

I outlined my position during that discussion and it has not changed.  I am not in a position to support the amendment.  There is nothing in section 55 that would prevent the procedures committee from considering whether proficiency in the Irish language was required or needed for appointment to a particular judicial office.  I am, therefore, not inclined to accept the amendment.  Even if I was so inclined, I do not believe this is the appropriate section in which to include such a provision since the subsection deals with selection procedures in the statement.  Section 55(6), on the other hand, deals with skills and attributes, issues we discussed at length when we discussed amendments included in a previous grouping.  That might be a better fit for such a provision.  However, I am not minded to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I thank members for their contributions.  We have had a very in-depth discussion over a number of meetings, and it is clear that members have highlighted differing views on a number of important aspects of the Bill.  The committee has amended certain components, sections and parts of the Bill in a significant way.</p> <p>  Arising from our deliberations, and I am sure this will come as no surprise to the Chairman, we still have much work to do on a number of elements of the Bill in the context of looking at approaches, acknowledging amendments we have made and taking stock as to how best we might approach matters prior to and on Report Stage.  During the course of the debate, I made a number of commitments that I would, on behalf of the Government, come back with some amendments, which I will do.  Of course, I am very keen to give adequate notice, in the circumstances of the Bill, unlike in the normal course of events, having been altered quite significantly.</p> <p>  Given the fact that what may likely transpire to be an additional complement of membership on the board of the commission, we need to do some more work on the matter of the specifications for membership, in light of the changes which have been approved by the committee and on how the lay members of the commission are recruited.  I acknowledge on my part and that of my officials, that further consideration must be given to the reformulation of aspects of the Bill to determine the best approach.  On whether, on the matter of recruitment, it will be entirely a matter for the Public Appointments Service or whether we can have a nomination arrangement to the satisfaction of the Deputies as debated, I need to see how that might be designed to meet the disposition and clear wishes of the committee.  I must consider whether we have a mix of people, some chosen by the Public Appointments Service and some nominated to the commission by specified nominating bodies.  Against the background in which the committee structure has been removed, I want to examine the balance between having a manageable number of persons on the commission and ensuring there is an appropriate contribution of all court presidents, having regard to the various strands of appointment.</p> <p>  I invite members of the committee to agree with me on the following point.</p><p>Our objective must be to have a structure with a balance between having a commission that is not so large as to be unworkable or unwieldy while holding fast to the initial design of the Bill.  Specifically, the central principles of the Bill are a lay majority on the commission and an independent chairperson.  Those must be reconciled with the importance of ensuring that we have the appropriate inputs of all court precedents, including the presence of the District Court and of the Circuit Court.  That is not quite clear now under the Bill as has passed Committee Stage.  I want to give the Chairman notice of my intention to table an amendment to address a technical issue concerning advances of funds to the commission.  I am sure that will be welcome.  Likewise, depending on what the Parliamentary Counsel has to say, we may need to look at tabling further drafting amendments consequential to those that have already been made, particularly in Part 4 regarding the removal of relevant committees as was originally intended, to ensure that there is no unintended impact on other aspects of the Bill.  Even looking at the Long Title, although we have agreed it, we all consequently agreed that it would not be the final word on that.</p><p> In light of the fact that we have made a large number of amendments, I am mindful of the need to proof where we are going to ensure that the contents are legally and constitutionally acceptable and that the drafting is fully in order.  There will not be an imminent or sudden tabling of Report Stage amendments.  I have acknowledged that some work needs to be done and that will take some time.  I would be happy to keep the Chairman fully informed of developments.  If any members of the committee wish to engage with me or my officials bilaterally, I would not only be open to that but would be keen to engage in such a discussion but we will have to take our time.  Ultimately, the Bill can only benefit from the opportunity that it now presents, which is a form of breathing space between now and Report Stage.  I also thank the Chairman for the efficient way in which he managed to steer us through almost 200 amendments.</p></speech>

From time to time in the course of the parliamentary session, the media engages in the production of a league table of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the number of times they have voted.  I suggest that a record is taken of the number of times we have voted in this committee to ensure that we are well up there as the most active group of parliamentarians.</p></speech>
