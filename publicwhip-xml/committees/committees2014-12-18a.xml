I asked before about the Dublin Docklands Developments Authority.  After representatives from the authority appeared before the committee a number of items needed to be addressed urgently.  Do we have any information on that, Chairman?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B01400"><p>The up-to-date information I have is that the 2013 accounts were signed off by the authority this week.  They will go to the Comptroller and Auditor General for signing.  We should be in a position to call representatives from the authority in after Christmas.  Once the accounts are signed off they should be available to us.  I will schedule an early meeting with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B01500"><p>I have no wish to cut across either you, Chairman, or the clerk but I am calling for this to be scheduled for January and I will explain why.  NAMA and Dublin City Council have moved to take over the strategic development zone area in the docklands.  Nevertheless, it appears that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is still disposing of property.  It would seem those in the organisation are using the dying days of their authority to dispose of prime property sites.  It is a matter of consideration as to how and why that should be happening.  Before any further sales goes through it would be appropriate to have them before the committee to explain what exactly is going on in respect of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B01600"><p>Are there any other matters?  No.</p><p>  I will set out correspondence since our meeting on Thursday, 11 December 2014.  First we will deal with correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 10 December 2014 received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Department of Education and Skills, re follow-up to our meeting of 15 May.  This is to be noted and published.  Next is correspondence dated 9 December from Brendan Ryan, Accounting Officer of the Courts Service regarding follow-up to our meeting of 23 October.  This is to be noted and published.  This correspondence is relevant to our forthcoming report on wards of court.  Deputy Deasy has queried the cost of cancelled court sittings.  I suggest we write to the Courts Service and ask for a detailed analysis of those costs.  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 10 December from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health.  This is a follow-up to our meeting on 6 November 2014.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  Individual correspondence is next.  No. 3B.1 relates to terms and conditions of employment at UCC.  This to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the matters raised.  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received from the Department of Finance regarding liability for local property tax.  This is to be noted and a copy forward to Ms Naughton, who raised the original query.  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received from a HSE employee, who wants to remain anonymous, regarding the extent to which many staff of the HSE have received upgrades.  This is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Health and the HSE for a note on the matters raised.  No. 3B.4 is correspondence received from the Institute of Technology, Tralee regarding money spent on the design of Kerry sports academy.  This is to be noted.  Is this to be published?</p></speech>

That is no problem.</p></speech>

This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3C is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 17 December 2014 from Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of NAMA, regarding opening statement.  This is to be noted.</p><p>  No. 4 relates to reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting of 11 December 2014.  They are listed from 4.1 to 4.8 and there is a clear audit in each case.  All of these accounts are to be noted.</p><p>  Our work programme is now on the screen.  Our next meeting is on 22 January.  It will deal with the financial statements of the HEA and the Comptroller and Auditor General Special Report No. 85, relating to accountability and governance at the National College of Art and Design.  The part of the meeting dealing with the financial statements of the HEA will include the various institutes of technology.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The issues in respect of the various colleges brought to our attention through correspondence will be raised with them on the day.  Will representatives from the Department of Education and Skills be present?</p></speech>

I will check that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B02400"><p>We should ask the Accounting Officer about it because there are several issues that still have not been dealt with.  It is like the issue raised by members earlier in respect of the paediatric hospital and Bord na gCon.  There are outstanding matters to be dealt with by the Department of Education and Skills.  First, we should agree the work programme for the next meeting.  We have already agreed to Deputy Costello's proposal for an early meeting with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We will fit that in sometime in January, if we can, depending on the availability of the DDDA.  Is there any comment on the work programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B02500"><p>My query is not on the work programme but on other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B02600"><p>Let us deal with the work programme first.  Any other business is the next item.  Is the work programme agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B02700"><p>My first point relates to the correspondence from an anonymous member of the HSE.  It would be useful to look at the response that we get from the health authorities when it comes back, because many of us suspect that more is spent on administration than front-line services in the HSE.  If true, this affects the quality of service people get.</p><p>  The second matter relates to the meeting last week.  I was most unhappy with the response of the representatives of the Central Bank to the questions I put to them.  I understand we have written to them to get a proper response.  I am going to hold on this for a while, but if we do not get a satisfactory response I will ask that we write a letter of complaint to the Governor of the Central Back.  The unwillingness or inability, whichever it was, of the representatives to answer questions was absolutely unacceptable as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800003#B02800"><p>I am going to ask the clerk to check this by way of writing to the officials that were before the committee.  In the case of some of the questions asked of them they were simply unable to answer, reluctant to answer or did not want to answer.  I am unsure which it was.  In any event, there was a question in respect of their role in the Central Bank.</p> <p>I understand one of the officials knew about the background of the Newbridge Credit Union issue that was raised.  We need to find out more about it because of the lack of information that was coming forward.  We should first write and clarify and then we can take it from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800004#C00200"><p>The issue I was most frustrated by was their unwillingness to discuss why there were so many restrictions on credit union lending, which is a very important issue because it holds back our economy by making it difficult for people who want small loans to get on with their business.  I felt it was an important question and an obvious question that they might have expected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800004#C00300"><p>Because we were dealing with a particular fund on that day, the relevant officials to the question were here.  We may need to clarify the issues the Deputy raised by writing to the Central Bank and determining the answers.  Then, we can take it up at our January meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800004#C00400"><p>Thank you.</p></speech>

It may relate to functions that are proper to the normal business of the Central Bank rather than to the credit institutions resolution fund.  The Deputy may need to examine it before he phrases a letter.</p></speech>

It is related to lending matters and perhaps it could be included in the question as to how it envisaged this enormous amount of money, considering there are great restrictions on small and medium enterprises in terms of the lending practices.</p></speech>

The committee will probably follow up on it in due course.  There is a need to safeguard the funds of the credit unions so they can get a return and the money is not just sitting in banks.  This matter arose last week.  The Department of Finance has an involvement in it and we will raise it with both the Department and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Before the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, comes in today, I ask that the committee consider bringing in some developers who have exited NAMA to discuss their experience and see the value or loss to the economy it has caused.  I am not naming anybody in particular; several developers have exited NAMA.  I would like that to go ahead in the new year.</p></speech>

Although some of them have nothing to do with the Committee of Public Accounts, they are addressed to us and the clerk will have to write back.  Last week, we received a reply from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills about doing a report into Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and the audit committee.  It will go before the governing body in early December, after which the HEA will be appraised of the position.  It is close to Christmas, and I would like to find out from the Department whether the investigation or report has been completed and whether it was conducted by independent people.  Today, I received a registered letter containing another document relating to CIT.  I ask the clerk of the committee to publish or circulate it.  It raises very serious issues with which we will have to deal in the new year.</p></speech>

We received another letter today by registered post from HL Commodity Foods on an issue with which we were dealing and which Deputy Costello raised.  We will circulate it to members.  We dealt with the Irish Sports Council, ISC, and a letter arrived by courier yesterday evening.  It is a detail of a reply to issues raised regarding Millstreet.  At our meeting with the ISC, I felt it was agreed that an effort would be made, again, to mediate between the parties involved because there is an exposure to the State.  This did not happen.  In this correspondence, I am told that the people we asked to do it were busy with other matters.  The committee asked that some form of mediation would take place and it is not good enough to send this letter by registered post the day before a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts because it was raised at a previous meeting.  I ask the committee to agree to get in touch immediately and insist that the mediation we requested be encouraged, requested and done as soon as possible.</p><p>  We have agreed our agenda for 22 January 2015, when we will deal with Special Report No. 85 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on accountability and governance of the National College of Art and Design and the financial statements of the Higher Education Authority.  Today, we are dealing with No. 7, the 2013 financial statements of NAMA.  I remind members that we can deal in a general way with NAMA, its accounts, activities, processes and procedures but not with individual cases.</p></speech>

Taking into account the &euro;500 million in senior debt that was redeemed yesterday, NAMA has now redeemed &euro;9.1 billion in senior bonds this year and a total of &euro;16.6 billion to date, equivalent to 55% of the senior debt we initially issued to the banks.  This means that we are more than half way towards repaying our total debt of &euro;31.8 billion, comprising &euro;30.2 billion of senior debt and &euro;1.6 billion of subordinated debt.  We are two years ahead of our strategic plan debt redemption targets.  To put the progress made this year into perspective, we had redeemed a cumulative 25% of our senior debt by the end of 2013.  In 2014 alone we have redeemed another 30% of that debt.  Our aim is to redeem a cumulative 80%, equivalent to &euro;24 billion, of senior debt by the end of 2016 and we hope we will have redeemed all of it by the end of 2018.  This target is predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio.<br/>Our faster than anticipated progress on debt redemption has been made possible by the major improvement in conditions in the Irish commercial property market in the past 18 months and the depth of investor capital being deployed towards Ireland.  The volume of direct investment activity in the Irish commercial property market is likely to exceed &euro;4 billion in 2014, but this does not tell the full story.  When all activity, including loan sales, is taken into account, it is estimated that the aggregate value of all Irish market transactions in 2014 will be well in excess of &euro;12 billion.  The much improved market conditions have given us a strategic opportunity to de-risk our portfolio and reduce the Government-guaranteed contingent liability exposure of Irish taxpayers.  At the start of 2013 taxpayers had a total contingent liability of close to &euro;40 billion to IBRC and NAMA.  Following loan sales by the IBRC special liquidators and asset and loan sales by NAMA, particularly in the past year, taxpayers' contingent liability has been reduced to &euro;13.6 billion.  This very substantial reduction in taxpayers' contingent liability exposure deserves to be highlighted as we approach the end of 2014.  It may be noted that Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s, when upgrading Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating to an A rating just two weeks ago, referred to the significant contribution of NAMA's deleveraging activity on the sovereign's enhanced creditworthiness.<br/>We have been before the committee and others in the past and have had to defend ourselves against the view that perhaps we have been too soft on debtors by allowing them to retain part of the income from their asset cashflows as salaries.  More recently, there seems to have been a suggestion we have been too demanding of some debtors.  We disagree with both assertions.  Our approach is very clear, consistent and straightforward.  We look for settlements with debtors which are fair and reasonable by reference to the assets available and to the interests of all parties, including taxpayers.  Our approach to dealing with any debtor - large or small, co-operative or unco-operative &ndash; is to be resolute but fair.  We seek the course of action which will deliver the best return for taxpayers but which is also within the debtor&rsquo;s capacity to deliver, given our knowledge of his or her assets and the remaining assets available to him or her to meet his or her debt obligations.  The NAMA board has a statutory obligation to pursue debtors so as to secure the best achievable outcome for taxpayers.  Most debtors work consensually with us, but, unfortunately, in some cases litigation is the only feasible option available.  For instance, this can arise in cases in which debtors refuse to acknowledge they are liable for their debts, where they fail to declare assets or where there is evidence of the transfer of assets.<br/>NAMA is prohibited by law from discussing any individual debtor&rsquo;s confidential business in the same way as a bank would be.  When there is litigation, with cases usually due for hearing before the High Court or the Commercial Court, we are faced with additional obligations not to discuss matters which are <i>sub judice</i>.  We are not, therefore, in a position to comment on coverage by the media of cases which are due before the courts, no matter how much the current coverage may fail to indicate the true position.  The rationale for our actions only becomes evident when the full facts of the case emerge during court hearings.  We leave it to the courts to determine any matter of fact and law which is in dispute between parties.  I contend that NAMA has been far more patient in its dealings with debtors than many corresponding private sector commercial banks or private equity entities would be in similar circumstances.  However, as a commercial entity itself, it cannot allow negotiations to continue indefinitely in circumstances where there appears to be no meaningful prospect of reaching a settlement which is fair and reasonable to all parties, including the interests of taxpayers.<br/>When we last appeared before the committee in May this year, following publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s section 226 review of NAMA, there was some discussion of possible performance measures for NAMA.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report had included recommendations to the effect that the NAMA board should set an expected or target rate of return to measure its overall performance and that it should also measure its performance by reference to targets for the return on disposals and property held by debtors and insolvency practitioners.  The board has further reviewed these recommendations and last week approved a number of rate of return measures which it considers appropriate for its business.  We have issued an invitation to staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to meet us to discuss the approach we propose to adopt and after these discussions we intend to report on these new measures in our 2014 annual report.<br/>In addition to the progress made on debt reduction, we are also pleased with the progress which has been made in facilitating the development of the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.  I reiterate what I have stated before: NAMA is not a developer and has no ambitions in this regard.  However, with a number of important strategic sites in the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock areas of the Dublin docklands under the control of our receivers, we are well placed to co-ordinate and drive the potential and delivery of viable commercial and residential projects in this area.  What NAMA can provide is the oversight, funding and co-ordination to ensure these sites which are of national importance will be developed in a phased and cohesive manner in order that office and other accommodation will come on stream in line with market demand.</p> <p>Clearly, this cohesiveness would be much more difficult to achieve if the sites were controlled by numerous different owners.  We have prepared a detailed business plan which includes strategies for each of the sites within the SDZ in which we have an interest.  These comprise 75% of the 22 ha of developable land in the area and our initial appraisal suggests that up to 3.4 million sq. ft. of commercial space and 1,848 apartments could potentially be delivered if all these sites were to be fully developed over the next five to seven years.</p><p> Over recent weeks, we have announced a number of initiatives which will kickstart the docklands development.  We will provide funding to the site receivers to initiate the planning process for the development of the landmark Boland's Mills site in Dublin's south docklands.  The planning application submitted by the receivers includes proposed office, residential, cultural and retail development totalling almost 400,000 sq. ft.  </p><p> NAMA is a minority shareholder in a qualifying investor fund, QIF, with Oaktree Capital, known as the south docks fund, which has recently submitted a planning application to Dublin City Council for the development of over 450,000 sq. ft. of office and residential accommodation at 5 Hanover Quay and 76 Sir John Rogerson's Quay in the docklands.  Subject to planning approval by Dublin City Council, construction is likely to begin during the first quarter of 2015 and the new developments are expected to accommodate up to 2,400 workers and 158 apartments.</p><p> We are also a minority shareholder in another QIF with Oaktree Capital, the city development fund, which will begin the construction of a new building comprising 50,000 sq. ft. of office space at 6-8 Hanover Quay.  When completed, the building will accommodate 300 staff in the European headquarters of a major US-based corporation.</p><p> Yesterday, we announced that Oxley Holdings limited, a company which is quoted on the Singapore stock exchange, is our preferred bidder for a key site at 72-80 North Wall Quay, next to the proposed new headquarters of the Central Bank of Ireland.  Subject to completion of the transaction, Oxley will acquire a long leasehold interest with the right to develop, manage and realise the site.  NAMA will retain the freehold interest and will receive a secure income stream, in addition to a percentage of any future sales proceeds.</p><p> Oxley was selected as preferred bidder after the completion of a competitive tendering process that was launched in June 2014.  In its proposal, Oxley envisaged a development of more than 645,000 sq. ft. of grade A office space, with capacity for up to 5,500 employees, and the delivery of over 200 apartments.  The planning application is likely to be submitted in early 2015 and, subject to this, it is envisaged that construction will begin in late 2015 or early 2016.</p><p> In total, these initiatives are expected to provide over 1.5 million sq. ft. of office, retail, residential and cultural accommodation in the docklands.  This will make a major contribution to addressing the shortage of high-quality grade A office space in the Dublin central business area where vacancy levels are just below 3% and, by so doing, will facilitate IDA Ireland in continuing to attract and grow FDl activity and employment in Ireland.  It is estimated that the new offices, when completed, will accommodate over 10,000 workers.  We estimate that these initiatives will result in the creation of over 10,000 jobs in the construction sector and another 2,500 jobs in ancillary sectors.</p><p> We are not wedded to any particular approach when setting strategy for individual SDZ sites.  We have made it clear that we are in a position to fund all of the development if that is required, but we are also conscious of the need to ensure that not all of the risk falls on taxpayers.  For that reason, we see substantial scope for private investors to provide the necessary funding for at least some of the sites.  For each site, it will be a matter of which strategy offers the best risk-adjusted return for NAMA.  We also see the docklands being developed on a phased basis, with new construction being funded in line with proven prospective demand rather than on a purely speculative basis.</p><p> It is worth pointing out also that NAMA is making its contribution to addressing residential supply shortages in the greater Dublin area.  In April of this year, we established a dedicated in-house residential delivery team to co-ordinate and drive the delivery of our commitment to facilitate the completion of 4,500 residential units in the period to the end of 2016 and to assess the scope for delivery of additional units thereafter.  We have exceeded our end-2014 target of funding the delivery of 1,000 residential units and we expect that another 1,500 residential units will be delivered in 2015 with the residual to be delivered in 2016.  </p><p> In addition, we are facilitating preparatory work on a second group of sites in the greater Dublin area which are currently in the planning process or where additional planning work is required.  If all of these sites achieved planning permission and were to be developed, it is estimated that they could deliver over 27,000 residential units in the years after 2016.</p><p> We are also contributing, to the greatest extent that we can, to the provision of social housing.  Local authorities have confirmed demand for just over 2,000 of the 5,500 houses and apartments that we made available to them for social housing.  By the end of this year, we will have exceeded the target of delivering 1,000 of these units for social housing and expect to deliver the remaining social housing units over the course of 2015.  This is based on the assumption that local authorities and approved housing bodies confirm their intention to buy or lease the properties.  We have no role in that. </p><p> In addition, we have committed, through our special purpose vehicle, to delivering Part V social housing on all new housing developments that NAMA will fund.  This means that NAMA will bear the up-front capital cost of constructing these units and local authorities will not have to seek off-site solutions due to financial constraints, as was the case in the past.</p><p> As regards the provision of accommodation to homeless people, we responded positively to the recent request from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to identify potentially suitable accommodation.  We identified four unoccupied office buildings in central Dublin and a former hotel in Tallaght which might be suitable, if appropriately modified, as accommodation for homeless people.  We understand the Department does not consider the office buildings to be suitable, but is currently assessing the suitability of the hotel.  We have indicated our willingness to provide a loan to one of the local authorities for the purchase of the hotel if it is deemed to be suitable.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for their time and attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any issues that they may now wish to discuss.</p></speech>

One is that when we did the impairment exercise for 2010 to 2012, the board had a policy of looking two years out in terms of what the values of assets would sell for.</p> <p>For the year ended 2013 the board decided to extend the exercise and to look three years out.  That meant a technical adjustment and looking at today's values three years out rather than two years out.  That contributed to an adjustment of &euro;500 million.  We also had over 500 smaller debtors, which were managed by the participating institutions.  We assessed them on what is termed a collective assessment basis rather than by individual assessment.  This was subject to some comment in the Comptroller and Auditor General section 226 report.  We delved into the matter in more detail and we increased the impairment on that book.  Those debtors have smaller and more regional assets and we increased the impairment by &euro;300 million on that book.</p></speech>

We go through a detailed exercise on 31 December each year.  That is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We carry out a detailed assessment - as does the Comptroller and Auditor General - of what the impairment figure should be, taking account of all the circumstances and given the size of our portfolio.  We started off with 60,000 individual property units.  We produce a representative sample of the valuations and that is why the exercise throws out a particular figure.  At the end of the day, the board must accept that figure.  Furthermore, to get our accounts signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General, he must be satisfied that it is a reasonable figure.</p></speech>

The asset was put up for sale by the receiver between March and May 2012.  The best price achieved at the time was &euro;7.5 million.  There were 30 expressions of interest in the site.  The next best bid on the site was &euro;5 million.  Clearly, after open market bidding the offer of &euro;7.5 million was deemed to be the price to take.  The people who bought the site did so for a particular purpose.  They bought it for student accommodation.  They sought planning permission and ultimately were refused planning permission.  They decided to sell on the site in late 2013, almost a year and a half after buying it.  The market had completed improved in that time.  They sold it and it was bought by a special purchaser who had acquired all the other sites around it and needed it for strategic site acquisition purposes to carry out commercial developments.  These are the circumstances relating to the site.  It was not a year later; it was <i>de facto</i>a year and a half or almost two years later.</p></speech>

Given the size and the value of the NAMA portfolio it is probably a small matter in one regard, but it does give rise to concerns, I believe, notwithstanding the time lag of a year and a half years or two years.  The fact that NAMA sold it at one price and it subsequently changed hands for more than double that price raises questions for people in terms of the broader portfolio and its management and whether this is a feature of NAMA transactions.</p></speech>

We are not in the privileged position - nor is anyone I know - of knowing the optimal time to sell an asset.  Since the Irish property market was in such a state of distress we took a tactical or strategic decision to sell very little property in the period from 2010 to 2013 and rather to concentrate on overseas sales where the market was more buoyant.  We also had to generate cashflow in the meantime.  The committee will recall that as part of the troika obligations we had to pay off &euro;7.5 billion of our debt.  We got the money to pay off that debt mainly by selling overseas assets.  Certainly, where assets were sold they were openly marketed.  As I said to Deputy McDonald, a total of 30 bidders looked at the site in question.  The best bid was &euro;7.5 million and the next best bid was &euro;5 million.</p></speech>

That is what we are told and that is the position set out by NAMA.  I am citing this instance and raising a concern around it.</p><p>  Perhaps Mr. McDonagh could leave off his NAMA hat for a moment.  It does not look great from the taxpayers' point of view, does it?  NAMA sells on a site, albeit in the circumstances described by Mr. McDonagh, then, less than two years later, it is sold on at double the previous value.  I put it to Mr. McDonagh that this does not inspire confidence to the average five eighths looking on.</p></speech>

His first assertion is that in the past NAMA had to defend itself against the view that it was being too soft on debtors.

I agree with Mr. McDonagh that such is the way to sort these matters out.  It is more cost effective in the first instance but also, arguably, the fairer and sane way of doing things.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aideen O'Reilly" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800009#H00800"><p>There is ongoing engagement with debtors at all levels and across the book by case managers supported by legal advice from my team.  I think the Deputy's question is very much focused on cases that are in litigation or pre-litigation.  One of the characteristics of the litigation that we or any other bank is involved in is that we tend to seek judgment for fixed sums.  Quite a few cases are resolved speedily through the summary procedures in the Commercial Court and do not, therefore, go to plenary hearing.  The issues can be quite net.  In quite a number of cases judgment is granted on consent, so the defendants consent to the entry of judgment in a fixed sum.  That tends to deal with quite a number of cases.</p><p>  In relation to mediation, in some cases the court will suggest mediation and in other cases one or other party will suggest it.  As Mr. McDonagh noted, we have never refused an offer of mediation and in certain cases we have suggested it.  Mediation is quite a structured process.  There are at least two professional mediation bodies and we would always choose an accredited mediator in consultation with the other party.  The rules of the mediation are governed by a mediation agreement which both parties enter into with the mediator.  It is the mediator who sets the rules and parameters of the mediation and both parties comply with these rules.</p></speech>

The mediation can take place at various stages of the litigation.  It may take place before or after pleadings are closed or before or after discovery.  It is an absolute principle that the appointed mediator will have read all the pleadings and supporting documentation.</p></speech>

It is important also to state that it is the mediator who has control over the process.  It is, therefore, the mediator who facilitates the flow of information between both parties and also the flow of positions taken by the parties.  When the parties submit to mediation they very much put the whole process in the hands of the mediator.</p></speech>

If one side wanted to put forward a valuation, it is free to put it in front of the mediator.  What the mediator then does with that valuation is very much a matter for the mediator.  The mediator may share that information in various ways with the opposing side, whether that is NAMA or the other party to the litigation.</p></speech>

I will ask one slightly off-topic question and contribute again later if that is alright.  My question relates to the property of a NAMA debtor on Leeson Street, namely, the premises of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The organisation, with which I am sure Mr. McDonagh is familiar, is in dire financial straits.  It has made a financial offer for the property.  I know Mr. McDonagh will inform me that he cannot comment on the matter and it will be subject to normal procedure.  However, I raise with him the fact that in addition to its section 10 responsibilities, which we discussed, NAMA must also take broader social considerations into account.</p> <p>Certainly nobody in this city or beyond would wish to see the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre without a premises.</p></speech>

Connaughton, I ask the witnesses to clarify the position on a question asked by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald about the mechanics of the mediation process.  Is it the case that NAMA has its representatives in one room, that the client has his or her representatives in another and that somebody is going to and fro between both parties, or do all parties sit around a table to discuss the matter?  How does the process work?</p></speech>

They are separate, but the mediator may sometimes bring some or all of them together.  There may be side meetings, but the point I wish to stress is that once the parties submit to mediation, it is the mediator who controls the process.  It is his or her professional judgment as to what is the best process to follow in a particular dispute.</p></speech>

It often depends on the nature of the dispute.  Certain highly technical disputes draw most of their mediators from the disciplines of engineering, science, biochemistry and pharmacy.  Quite a number of mediators have a legal background as solicitors or barristers; therefore, the skills set very much depends on the nature of the dispute.  It is fair to say many of the mediators I have come across in my current practice have been lawyers.</p></speech>

We have stated publicly on a number of occasions that any complaint about NAMA will be investigated by the chief executive officer and the chairman and that is what we do.  Obviously, there is a response to whoever complains to us.  Let me be very clear that this is what will happen.  To again go back to the mediation process, I know that the Chairman says he is quoting reports, but it is very difficult for me to accept that NAMA approaches mediation in a heavy handed way.  We do not; we enter the process on the same basis that we approach all issues to do with debtors, as outlined in Mr. McDonagh's statement.  It is robust but fair.  At the end of the day, as far as I am aware, mediators in any mediation process are very conscious of the fact that both sides have to receive an open and full hearing and have to have full access to all of the facts.  If somebody has a complaint to make about NAMA, he or she should and is encouraged to write to it about it, with the undertaking that the chief executive officer and I, as chairman, will investigate it and respond to him or her.</p></speech>

Any such complaint should be treated carefully because the welfare and wellbeing of individuals are at stake.</p> <p>Of course NAMA has to do a job for the taxpayer.  If you did not do it you would probably be in here for another reason, but we have to have some humanity, compassion and understanding of what is going on.</p></speech>

The first loans transferred to NAMA at the end of March 2010.  The evidence shows that we try to find a workable solution.  It may not always be a solution that is comfortable for NAMA - let us be frank - but it would be one we believe is the best outcome in terms of getting the maximum value for the assets through working with debtors.  The evidence shows that we had situations at the start when people were absolutely opposed to working with NAMA but they are now productively working with NAMA and helping us to maximise the value of the assets.  Debtors who have 70% of the assets by value are working with NAMA.  That is a strong indication that we do our best to work with them and to try to find a solution.  When NAMA started off, the deal was that all 800 debtors would be put into insolvency straight away.  The view was that was the best way to deal with it, but we never saw that as the best way to deal with it.  We took the view it was the best solution to try to work with debtors wherever possible.</p></speech>

We engage at a senior level with other banks.  We talk generally about what is going on in terms of how to deal with debtors and case management here and internationally.  Many of the people we meet maintain that they cannot believe we are five years down the road and that we still might have a debtor with whom we are suddenly in litigation after five years.  Their view is that people should know after 30 days whether a debtor will work with them.  The evidence shows we are doing our best to work with the majority of the debtors.</p></speech>

I am keen to respect that because the office has made the recommendation.  Our view is that NAMA bought the assets from their banks.  We overpaid for the assets.  That was the conclusion of the European Commission, which recently signed off on the NAMA process.  The Commission said we overpaid by &euro;5.6 billion compared to anyone else.  We bought assets costing &euro;74 billion for &euro;31.8 billion.  The question is how much cash of the &euro;31.8 billion or more over the life of NAMA we can recover.  We have designed an entity-rated return because no one will know how NAMA has done until the agency sells its last asset.  However, an entity-rated return takes account of our performance in terms of the cash we have realised to date and the value of the residual portfolio.  We will fully explain it in our report.  We have considered this a good deal.  We came up with a proposal that went through our board finance committee.  Then it went forward to the board last week.  The recommendation of the board was that while they accepted it, they would prefer for the executive to discuss it with the Comptroller and Auditor General with a view to publishing it with our 2014 performance and audit figures.  It will be a market standard measure.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh's belief is that because the property market has picked up NAMA is beginning to realise more money and it is coming in now.

At grade A office space level rents have gone from a high of &euro;55 per sq. ft. at the peak in 2007 down to &euro;27 per sq. ft. and now they are up towards &euro;45 per sq. ft.  That is because there is such a short shortage of grade A office space available.  Rents are probably heading higher towards &euro;50 per sq. ft.  That is why we are getting in there.  We are involved in four planning applications in respect of 1.5 million sq. ft. of office space in Dublin to try to stop rents getting out of control altogether.  We want to ensure offices are available at reasonable prices.</p><p>  The retail sector has made a remarkable recovery.  It is a function of the improving economy.  We have several portfolios on the market at present.  There are bids on them which are encouraging not only in Dublin but in other parts of Ireland as well.</p> <p>In terms of the residential sector, it went down about 55% in general.  It is now down to about 38% from its peak.  The residential sector in Dublin is probably under pressure because there is not enough of a supply.  We are trying to address the supply issue.  Supply is a key element to unlocking the rise in prices.  In terms of the sector outside of Dublin, we have seen price improvements in Cork, Limerick, Galway and the rest of Ireland where NAMA in terms of its portfolio has a limited exposure.  There is a graph in the briefing pack we sent to committee yesterday which shows where our portfolio is.  We would not see there being a huge recovery in that market to date.  We have limited exposure, I admit, but with what we see it is still quite difficult.  </p></speech>

We would see the biggest movement in terms of family homes in residential properties in the &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000 bracket.  We are involved in funding new developments in Dublin and for first-time buyers there is a pinch point that they cannot go above; once prices go above &euro;280,000, even if there is a nicer house for &euro;290,000 in the same development, people cannot get to that level.  There are multiple sub-markets involved in this but supply is an issue and the availability of credit is also an issue in the residential market.</p></speech>

We have come from a place where prices went down 55% and now there has been a recovery.  We know there has been quite a strong recovery but if we look at the evidence of what has happened in other countries when they introduced measures - the Central Bank has its own job to do - they were probably introduced on a more phased basis than by way of a once-off implementation.</p></speech>

I ask him to share his thoughts on NAMA and the challenging job it has been since its inception.  What is his sense of the manner in which NAMA discharged its responsibilities and its mandate since its inception?  Everybody has challenges and it is said "no problem, no business", but looking back retrospectively, what would he have done differently with regard to the board of NAMA and the people with which it deals?  I seek Mr. Daly's thoughts on NAMA at this point in time.</p></speech>

As for my thoughts on NAMA right now, let us start where we are, which is in a reasonably good place.  In terms of our strategic objectives, we are well ahead of target.  In respect of the debt repayment, we are approximately two years ahead of target.  As noted in the opening statement, we have redeemed 55% of our debt as of yesterday and our clear objective now is to redeem 80% of our debt by the end of 2016.  While we are confident of that, it is not without its challenges and the two major challenges are keeping the staff we need with the expertise and obviously that the economy and the property market continue to move in the right direction.  As of now, however, the primary objective of debt reduction is important both for NAMA and, in the wider scheme of things, for the country.  It is vital with regard to its access to the markets, its standing with ratings agencies and in terms of its standing with the European Union, the European Central Bank and all of that.</p><p>  Along the way, we also have been given two additional tasks, one involving the strategic development zone in Dublin's docklands.  Again, we have gone into detail on this and again, we are very positive about it.  The most important factor there is that Dublin City Council, not NAMA, is the development agency for the docklands but NAMA has been given a role in respect of co-ordination, cohesion and financing.  We are the backstop with regard to financing as in effect, there is a &euro;1.9 billion gross development cost there.  We could finance that although we do not really want to be the ones financing it all and consequently are very open to joint ventures and to others coming in with us on that.  Again, we are very confident about building out down there in a coherent way in response to demand, rather than in a speculative way and falling into the traps that perhaps were fallen into in the past decade.</p><p>  On residential housing, including social housing, again the Deputy will see the figures in the opening report.  We really are ahead of target on all of those with a mandate to deliver 4,500 houses in Dublin by 2016 and the possibility of up to 25,000 to 27,000 more in the years after that.  On social housing, again NAMA is ahead of target in respect of the actual units delivered as of now to social housing bodies.  This is important because while there is much talk about doing things in respect of social housing, NAMA actually has delivered.  That is our present position across those three strands of debt redemption, the docklands and housing, including social housing, and I think we are in a good place.  All of this, every bit of it, is facilitated by cash generation and we have had very good cash generation to date - including this year - probably generating more than &euro;8 billion in cash.  In some ways, this is an extraordinary performance, given where we were this time last year and given the targets we had for this year.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me to carry out a retrospective review of the last five years.  It has been very tough at times and has been highly challenging.  NAMA has been obliged to deal with nearly 800 debtor connections.  We are glad of the fact that we now have ended up working so positively with a high proportion, comprising 70% of them by value.  Obviously, we wish to continue with that type of approach.</p><p>  Looking back, it is hard to say what we would have done differently.  If one goes back earlier, one might talk about acquiring the loans earlier but then we were in a process directed by the European Commission and the Government in that regard.  I think we called the market right looking back over the past five years.  As we were obliged to repay our debt, we had to generate cash.  We also were obliged to pay for ourselves as we did not wish to be a drain on the Exchequer.  Consequently, we were obliged to sell assets in the early years but I think we made the correct strategic decision to concentrate on selling in the United Kingdom market and to leave the Irish market pretty much alone because it was pretty fragile and damaged and any wholesale replacement of assets on the Irish market just would have make things worse.</p><p>  Last year, we were able to rebalance that and got into the Irish market at the right time to get the market moving and now with the objective of providing office and residential accommodation.  That is where we are strategically, with 80% of the debt gone by 2016.  Right now, it looks as though that element of NAMA's work, the total debt repayment, will be finished by 2018.  Obviously, the docklands and the housing are somewhat longer projects but I suppose they really are a different type of NAMA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800013#M00300"><p>I reiterate my compliments to NAMA on what has been an extraordinary achievement when one looks back to the time of the board's appointment and when one considers that NAMA is two years ahead of its targets.  While I compliment the chairman on the leadership given in this regard, I have one or two queries.</p><p>  In the context of the present position with regard to small businesspeople, I refer to the consortia comprised of small businesses and professionals.  Is it correct that they have been left until last, after NAMA has dealt with all the major debtors and portfolios?  We now are down to such consortia, which are to be found nationwide and which were made up of legal figures, doctors and similar professionals.  Does NAMA have an estimated number of small business owners and professionals involved in such consortiums at present?  Up to now, NAMA has not been dealing with that sector aggressively, as it dealt with large portfolios.</p><p>  Second, I refer to the perspective of large construction companies, many of which went out of business over the period on foot of the wrong decisions that were made.  At present there is a conundrum, if one is talking about igniting the economy, with regard to the aforementioned consortia of small businesses and those professional developers or construction companies that are out of business.  Perhaps Mr. McDonagh might deal with two questions.  How will NAMA deal with the consortia of small businesses who are to be found in every town or village?  I note that 200,000 companies employ 700,000 people.  I listened closely to what he said about quantifying the best interests of the taxpayer.  How does NAMA quantify the best interests of the taxpayer when dealing with these consortia of small business people?  Second, how does NAMA propose to ignite the construction economy, which is cash-strapped at present and cannot get the money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121800013#M00400"><p>In terms of the profile of NAMA debtors that we acquired, the top 180 debtors held the lion's share of debt and accounted for &euro;61 billion of the &euro;74 billion of debt.  We dealt with those bigger debtors in-house and then we probably had almost 600 smaller debtors that generally had debts of &euro;75 million or less.  We allowed those to be managed by the banks from which we acquired the loans.  We did that at the outset because we had to build up the organisation and get the necessary skills in-house.  Within the last two and a half years, we have been dealing as much with the smaller debtors as with the bigger debtors.  We have redeployed teams in-house to deal with them and have taken the view that sometimes these people got into property speculation and it was not their main daily business.</p> <p>A lot of people have told us that they do not really have any expertise in property development and have agreed to us appointing a receiver to the assets.  We have seen many cases where a consortium got together and paid &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million for a small strip of land outside a small town which is now only worth &euro;500,000 or less.  We have taken a pragmatic view in such cases.  If the debtor is co-operating with us, has no expertise and consents to a receiver then that makes it easier for everyone and if the debtor then makes a reasonable proposal to us in terms of trying to cover some part of the debt shortfall, we accept that.  We try to be pragmatic and we also take the legal costs involved into account.  We have been working quite well with people when they engage with us in a positive way.  Our bottom line is that a debtor must give us full disclosure.  If the debtor gives full disclosure and makes a reasonable proposal then we will do a deal because we recognise that everyone has to move on.  </p><p> In terms of construction companies, the reality is that the levels of unemployment in the construction industry are very high and we are very conscious of that fact.  A lot of construction companies got involved in speculative development which brought down their normal construction business.  There have been a number of high profile casualties but there are also a large number of small and medium-sized construction companies who are NAMA debtors and whom we are supporting.  We are giving them funding to build out developments - ten houses here, five houses there and so forth.  It is below-the-radar stuff and not the big office blocks in Dublin and so forth.  If something will work commercially, we will provide funding.</p><p> Ironically, the complaint now from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is that non-NAMA debtors wish they were in NAMA because of the availability of funding to build out commercially viable developments.  Many such debtors also have commercially sound proposals but because they are not in NAMA they cannot get any money to build them out, even though it would make sense to do so.  In terms of the debtors we deal with, if the proposal makes commercial sense, we will provide the necessary funding.  That said, we must always be mindful of the fact that we must justify everything we do and all developments must make commercial sense.  NAMA will not be around for ever but while we are around we will certainly provide funding if it will improve the value of any asset.  That generates economic activity, not just in Dublin, but elsewhere.  We have provided funding for developments in numerous locations once it made commercial sense to do so.  In terms of the current NAMA portfolio, approximately &euro;17 billion is remaining but less than &euro;1 billion of that would be outside Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The majority of our portfolio is in Dublin.  However, if it makes commercial sense to develop assets in regional Ireland, we are very happy to fund it.  </p></speech>

The commercial realities in Dublin are very different to those in the west of Ireland and in smaller towns and villages all over the country.  Many people joined property consortia outside of their main business interests and they are finding it very difficult now.  Looking back, perhaps things should have been done differently.</p><p>  Mr. McDonagh made reference to the fact that 620 NAMA clients are working with the intermediary banks.  While those banks may have the files and may be liaising with NAMA in terms of reaching an agreement on how to work out the debt, are they co-operating well with NAMA?  A lot of NAMA's portfolio consists of loans that it took over from other banks.  How is that being dealt with?</p></speech>

We have in the region of 560 smaller debtors as of today.  We have a deep involvement with approximately 400 of those because they were former customers of IBRC.  We have also just recently moved to take over the Bank of Ireland portfolio directly.  We have approximately 160 small debtors who are still with AIB.  We have a team dedicated to working with those debtors and our plan is to become more actively involved in those AIB cases in 2015.  We are five years on now and we need to find solutions.  We need to determine if something can be done that resolves the difficulties for both sides on a commercial basis.</p></speech>

Many of them got involved in ill-conceived investments that were not connected to their main businesses.  We need to revitalise that engine of job creation.  I would be very interested in receiving a report on the NAMA discussions with AIB.  In questioning NAMA about its operations, we must also incorporate AIB.</p><p>  I wish to ask about US vulture funds from the perspective of job creation.  What is the role of such funds in job creation?  This is a very critical time for NAMA and I wish to compliment the board on what it has achieved to date.  However, in terms of reaching a final outturn by 2018, the period ahead could be particularly difficult.  NAMA will be dealing mainly with residual debt, much of which involves the smaller consortia to which we have referred.  While I know NAMA is doing its job well, I hope the intermediary banks will fulfil their mandate too.  The US vulture funds have played an important role in the property market in Dublin but they will not invest in the regions.  There is a judgment call to be made in that respect.</p></speech>

However, they know that there is not going to be quick turnaround here.  Most of the funds that we have had discussions with take a medium-term view.  While they will not be here for ever, they are looking at a five-year timeframe at least.  As the economy recovers, they expect to be re-financed out of the positions they have bought by the recovered banking system.  They take the view that the Irish economy will recover strongly over the next five years and that is how they will make a return.</p></speech>

It is good to see that interest and to see investors coming in, not all of whom are US venture funds.  The fact is that once these assets are sold, further investment is made.  Many of the places in question have not seen any investment for quite some time.</p> <p>It is good to see them being sold and even better that, when they are sold, the new owners put in investment.  That means construction jobs and down the line, obviously, there will be better shopping centres and better hotels and so on.</p></speech>

I welcome also the clear vision with which they have been remanaged.  I have spoken to a number of developers who got a second chance, which is very important.  These are Irish people who have made mistakes but are getting a second chance.  That up to 80,000 jobs are being created a certain amount of credit is due to NAMA with its visionary approach towards investment.  I am glad to hear it has a vision for the remainder of residual debt within the NAMA portfolio that will ignite social enterprise and social housing, and that it will support developers as we are talking about building 25,000 to 30,000 houses per year.  There is a real difficulty in igniting the economy to give developers the necessary funds and the working capital to develop those houses.  Therefore, the agency has a critical role to play with its intermediary banks whose loans it is managing to ensure they are given the working capital to start the five, ten or 20 houses.  I thank the delegates for that clarification.</p></speech>

Five years ago this month when we were debating the legislation in the House many had reservations as to whether NAMA would be a success and if it could achieve what was intended.  Its presentation and the work that has been done indicates that it has achieved much in the past five years.  Its approach was probably right that it would start with the UK market which was still buoyant and then come back to the Irish market later on.  Does NAMA think, therefore, when it got a haircut of 55% that it was getting a good deal, despite the opinion of the Central Bank at the time?</p></speech>

This is a new departure.  NAMA will be embarking on joint ventures in the context of development.  The witnesses have referred to the fact that there are 3.5 million sq. ft. of property and office space in the SDZ.  They have provided an outline of how &euro;1.5 million has been channelled into various developments.  Hanover Quay is located within the SDZ, but the site on Sir John Rogerson's Quay, to which Deputy Mary Lou McDonald referred, was dealt with prior to the establishment of the zone.  Between 2012 and 2014, the site increased in value from &euro;7.5 million - the amount for which it was sold - to &euro;17.75 million.  Surely the value of properties located within the SDZ is going to increase dramatically as a result of the fact that they are to be developed by NAMA in a coherent fashion.  It is very desirable that there is going to be such development.  Are the witnesses in a position to explain how 16 Hanover Quay, located in the SDZ and the total area of which is 6,000 sq. ft., is in the process of being sold by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for &euro;450,000?  An insurance company recently placed a value of &euro;600,000 on this site which is probably worth millions.  Does NAMA have any control over matters of this nature?  It is taking over from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and will be carrying out the developments to which I refer in conjunction with Dublin City Council.  However, the property on Hanover Quay which is smack bang in the middle of the SDZ and which was not sold in 2012 is now being sold.  Is there not something very unusual about this process?</p></speech>

The reality is that we now have control over 75% of the developable land in the SDZ and we will work very closely with Dublin City Council in developing it.  There are 13 defined sites in the SDZ which come within NAMA's ambit and we have plans to develop all of them at various stages.  We have submitted a planning permission application in respect of the Boland's Mill site.  We announced yesterday how we intended to proceed in the case of the Project Wave site on the northside of the city adjacent to the infamous Anglo building.  The tender for the project was won by Oxley, a company that is listed on the main Singapore Stock Exchange.  The developer with Oxley will be the Ballymore Group.  This brings us back to a point mentioned about construction companies and developers that survived the crash and have worked well with NAMA.  From our point of view, it is good to see one of them involved in a project of this significance in Dublin.  Some of the other sites are being developed in co-operation with other entities.  In his opening contribution Mr. McDonagh referred to the City Quay Fund and the South Docks Fund in this regard.  For the others, we are in the process of applying for planning permission-----</p></speech>

NAMA is obliged to obtain on behalf of the State the best economic return on the impaired assets for which it is responsible.  However, in the context of the social dimension, there is an expectation that there will be a social dividend from the work in which it is engaged.  The witnesses have indicated that NAMA has contributed substantially to ameliorating the position on housing and homelessness.  I accept that I raised this matter with Mr. Daly previously at a different forum, but will he indicate if NAMA is in a position to agree to the use of a local labour clause whereby 20% of workers on a project would be locals?  Such a clause obtains in the massive DIT development at Grangegorman.  Is NAMA in a position to engage with the companies with which it is involved in joint ventures in order to ensure members of local communities will be able to obtain some of the 10,000 construction and 3,000 to 4,000 ancillary jobs that will eventually be created?  There is huge potential in this regard in the area under discussion which straddles the River Liffey and is deprived in many ways.</p></speech>

We are not in a position to dictate to companies on the people they should employ, etc.  However, we would be supportive of the model used for the DIT project in terms of the Grangegorman employment charter.  In so far as we can support the use of similar charters and influence that type of approach, we are open to doing so.  In the model in question the Grangegorman Development Agency is responsible for overseeing and monitoring matters.  The corresponding body for the docklands is Dublin City Council.  I understand the council is examining the possibility of using the Grangegorman employment charter model within the SDZ.  While we would be supportive of this, we are very conscious of the social dimension of our work.  However, I am ultimately continually obliged to remind people that under the Act our primary remit is commercial in nature.</p> <p>It is to get the best financial return we can for the State which, as I said before, is in itself an indirect social dividend.  Other things we can do and which we have been doing involve engaging with Departments and other public bodies on their requirements in any development we are undertaking, be it in the SDZ or elsewhere.  Again, we are open to doing this in the SDZ and engaging with the Department of Education and Skills, for example, on schools.  We have had some dealings with some cultural bodies in the docklands in relation to the docklands preservation society and its need for a premises.  We are positively disposed to this, but we cannot sit down and dictate to a joint venture partner that it must do this or that.  At the end of the day we have to be sure we will get the best commercial return.</p></speech>

Much of the apprenticeship and training element is encompassed by the Grangegorman model.  That is why I like it and why it is a model to which we can subscribe.

How proactive are the other four local authorities in Dublin and its hinterland regarding assessing NAMA's asset base to see what else it might have?  Mr. McDonagh mentioned a hotel that was offered to them a few years ago, priced at &euro;3 million, and which is probably now worth &euro;4 million.

We try to engage constructively with the local authorities and the Housing Agency which is affiliated to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to tell them what we have.  Everybody thinks NAMA has a huge pool of assets.  We do not.  We had approximately 14,000 completed units in our portfolio and offered up approximately 5,500 of them.  The market is very strong.  There is demand from the private sector as much as anything and we cannot hold them out forever.  Whatever we have, we have a very open door policy with local authorities and we ask them if we can help them, or they approach us through the Housing Agency.  We have never failed to engage in the right way on that front.</p></speech>

First, as I said earlier, we lost a number of senior staff and, given that they are difficult to replace, we have had to replace them with more junior staff.  Second, we have decided to get more directly involved in case management in terms of smaller debtors, which I mentioned to Deputy Perry.  For the first two years, we concentrated on the top 180 debtors.  Then, we decided we also needed to deal with the 500 to 600 debtors below that level and to put more resources into it.  The liquidation of IBRC meant our whole infrastructure disappeared, and we had to replace it.</p></speech>

I do not have an issue with whether NAMA is doing it or not.  I have an issue with the fact Mr. McDonagh states NAMA is not a developer, but NAMA appointed the receiver to Bolands Mills and this receiver will build.  This is absolutely fine and it makes proper sense, but I am concerned as to why Mr. McDonagh is making such a strong statement about not being a developer when the practices in which NAMA is engaged is a developer process to make the most from a particular asset and to sweat it to get it out the other end.</p></speech>

The trigger for his appointment was that when the process of selling off IBRC commenced and NAMA was the backstop, the intention was if the loans were not sold we would take them on.

The IBRC board had been dissolved and it seemed a good match or mix to have somebody from the former IBRC board who had been on it for a relatively short time.

As a public representative the Deputy will know that we have put in place a mechanism through a dedicated e-mail service whereby public representatives can draw matters to our attention.  However, it must be said that we do not see public representatives generally step over the line into lobbying.  Ours is a State body so we believe there must be an engagement with public representatives.  If a public representative wishes to bring an issue to our attention, that is one thing but if a public representative seeks to influence us in coming to a particular decision, then clearly they will fall into lobbying.</p></speech>

The worrying matter is that from the perspective of an individual who might have a complaint in respect of NAMA, there is no independent stream or system to arbitrate that.  I accept that the witnesses receive the complaints, examine them and have the relationship manager investigate them.  I do not gainsay that.  However, is there not a disparity between the person making the complaint and NAMA, through the witnesses, receiving it, investigating it themselves and writing back to the person, with the only other recourse for the person being to go to the Garda or to a public representative who, by definition, is limited in what they can do?</p></speech>

NAMA is a State body and Mr. McDonagh said his job is to protect the organisation, the taxpayer and the integrity of the organisation.  However, is it not problematic that there is no independent form of arbitration for those who might have a complaint with NAMA, short of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or recourse to lawyers?  I believe there is a problem with that.  We have had this conversation previously.</p> <p>I know it does not accept this analysis but there is a sense that NAMA is almost in splendid isolation with a vast portfolio, with the cover of commercial sensitivity and with a commercial mandate and all that entails.  If one is outside that, in particular if one has had reason to have had dealings with NAMA and if one has a complaint, are the scales not weighed very heavily against the individual?</p></speech>

We will probably never agree on it.  We have a very strong view to the contrary about the accountability we have here and elsewhere, not least the oversight we have by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In relation to the complaints, we are saying here - I suppose we would value our own integrity as much as anything else - that complaints which come to NAMA are investigated thoroughly and objectively and are responded to.</p><p>  I do not know what the Deputy has in mind as a sort of appeal mechanism but one is really then talking about getting into the realm of having another body that effectively would be directing NAMA on what to do in particular cases.  I am not sure how that would work in a very practical sense.</p></speech>

However, that is probably a matter for Government.</p><p>  Deputy Costello raised the issue of the docklands, as perhaps did others.  This comes down to NAMA as an entity, the scale of it and obviously the scale of the plans conceived for the docklands and the reality that, in its former incarnation, the development of that part of town fell short of many of the social expectations of the communities which live there.  There are very grand plans to develop commercial units and increase residential space but NAMA will accept that these are very long-established and bedded in residential communities, some of which have experienced very severe inter-generational poverty.  Parts of these areas have very high levels of long-term unemployment.  Many of the young people in the areas, who are full of potential and so on, have not been afforded access to all of the educational opportunities which would assist them.</p><p>  How conscious is NAMA of this idea of a social dividend in respect of this development?  What influence will NAMA have on that?  What kind of access will local communities and their representatives have to NAMA in the course of this development?  Speaking quite parochially, as one of the representatives of those communities, it would be an absolute disaster if one had shiny commercial development, including new residential development, on the one hand and the established communities left behind again on the other, because this has been the experience of these communities.  I would like an assurance from NAMA that there will be considerable access.  I would like to extend an offer to NAMA to meet local people.  I know there has been some contact but it should continue.  Those at the highest level in NAMA should make themselves available to listen and respond to the needs of the communities.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the social dividend element of what we do everywhere, not least in the docklands.  We have no wish to create a kind of sterile environment there where every place closes at 5 p.m. and there is no life after that.</p><p>  In regard to access for local communities to talk to us, we are absolutely committed to that and we have already done it.  Last week I met about 30 people from the communities around the North Wall and we have engaged on the same level in relation to the south side.  </p><p>  On disadvantage in terms of employment, education or whatever, again, as I said earlier, we are very open to listening to any requirements from the Department of Education and Skills or anybody else in regard to facilities they need there, or to local cultural bodies.  We have engaged with the Docklands Preservation Society in relation to its requirements.  </p><p>  On  the employment piece, we talked earlier about the Grangegorman employment charter, which seems to be a good model for the type of approach that should be taken and which seeks to encourage employment of local people in the first instance.  I made the important point that we are not the development agency for the docklands or for the SDZ and we are not the successor to the DDDA.  Dublin City Council is the development agency.</p><p>  If one takes the Grangegorman model, where the Grangegorman Development Authority oversees and monitors the employment charter in Grangegorman, Dublin City Council would have the same role here.  From our point of view in NAMA, while we cannot force anybody to employ local people or anything like that, one can be sure we will absolutely encourage it in whatever dealings we have.  We have no problem meeting people.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the Grangegorman model and it is not a perfect one by any stretch.  Mr. Daly will be aware there are new EU procurement rules.  There is consultation underway at the moment which will allow enormous scope to create social clauses and local employment clauses that actually work and actually deliver.  I welcome the fact NAMA has an open ear to that.</p></speech>

It might be in many cases.  However, in some of the cases we have heard, there are serious doubts about it being a fair and balanced process.  It does cost the citizen an enormous amount of money to pursue any action.  There are not many who could have gone to battle with the agency and pay &euro;2 million for a court case.  That is relative all the way down the line.</p><p>  The agency&rsquo;s relationship manager is present and does a fine job.  However, the process described earlier is not the one Deputy McDonald and I am looking for.  We are looking for more engagement from senior levels in NAMA with specific cases.  There are cases that NAMA does not get right all the time.  Mr. Brendan McDonagh said he has a job to protect the organisation.  I respect that too.  Sometimes, protecting the organisation means listening to the odd voice that says there is something wrong with the agency&rsquo;s system or, as I heard recently about some of the agents that act on NAMA&rsquo;s behalf, that they approach the client in an aggressive way.  I would like to feel that in protecting NAMA Mr. Brendan McDonagh would see these complaints as way of understanding the plight of the citizen - sometimes a family - not a big developer with much property, money or know-how that the agency usually deals with.  It would be good to listen not just to those who say Mr. Brendan McDonagh is a great fellow but to those who might say he is not so great and has brought much sadness into their lives.  That is a point on which he will have to ponder.  That is what the members are talking about.  It is respecting what Mr. Brendan McDonagh does but also the rights of the citizen and what was said in the Dellway case.  One will find any organisation that has a complaints department and stands over the thorough examination of every single complaint is successful and understood.  I am not sure NAMA&rsquo;s structure is correct in that regard.  Will Mr. Brendan McDonagh look at it?</p><p>  It was said earlier to Deputy Perry that if it is a reasonable proposal, NAMA will do a deal with a client as everyone has to move on.  That is a fact.  The meditation process that I learned about yesterday does not facilitate that very well.  Court is not an option for some people.  It saddens me to be part of a Parliament that created legislation that has brought about the type of grief that I had explained to me yesterday.  How as parliamentarians and legislators can we correct that?  Maybe what people are saying is that they need an action from all political parties that will review legislation to put the citizen first and understand humanity and compassion.  It is Christmas.  I reiterate the appeal I made privately to Mr. Brendan McDonagh earlier.  It is nothing personal to those present but I find it deeply upsetting.</p><p>  I have several other questions which I cannot put now as we have gone through much.  Will members agree to leave the financial statements of NAMA for 2013 open?</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Rob Wright to discuss the report of the independent review panel on the Department of Finance.  Mr. Wright has 35 years of economic policy management experience in the public service in Canada, over 20 years of which were at Deputy Minister level.  Most recently Deputy Minister of Finance, he began his federal Government career as an economist with the Department of External Affairs.  Over the next 12 years, he held various positions at the National Energy Board, the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Department of Finance.  In 1987, he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet in the areas of priorities and planning at the Privy Council Office.  Between 1989 and 2009, Mr. Wright held a number of positions at Deputy Minister level, including High Commissioner for Canada to New Zealand, Deputy Minister of Revenue Canada and the first Commissioner of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, CCRA.  He was also Associate Secretary to the Cabinet, Deputy Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and national security adviser to the Prime Minister.  Mr. Wright retired from his position as Deputy Minister of Finance in 2009, the 35th anniversary of his employment in the public service of Canada.<br/>The report of the independent review panel, &quot;Strengthening the Capacity of the Department of Finance&quot;, was commissioned in September 2010 by the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, following his commitment at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to the effect that a review would be carried out to assess the Department's policy advice and performance in the previous ten years and to make recommendations on how best the Department might adapt to meet the challenges of the future.  Mr. Wright was chairman of the independent review panel.<br/>Before beginning and to deal with the formalities of today's meeting, I wish to advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If he is directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As he has been informed, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from naming individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>With that, I welcome Mr. Wright again and invite him to make some opening comments.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  It is a pleasure to be here.  I do not have a formal opening comment, but I would like to refer to page 4 and the executive summary.  I will walk through a little bit to give members a brief overview of the report.  It has been four years.</p><p>  As the Chairman reported, we were appointed as a panel.  The other panel members included Mr. John Malone, a very experienced Secretary General from the Irish public service, and Dr. Hans Borstlap, a senior official from the Dutch civil service and very experienced in the EU bureaucracy.  Not a panel member, but Mr. Pat McArdle served as a senior economic adviser to the panel and was very active as well.</p><p>  I was approached for this job by the Secretary General of the day.  The guidelines for the panel were approved by a parliamentary committee and really heartily embraced by the Minister of the day, Brian Lenihan, who was very impressive and made the point it was time to take an honest look - a serious look - at, given the circumstance, what would we do looking forward to improve the Department of Finance.  That is something I was interested in and I was certainly willing to devote the three-month timeline that we had to complete this report.</p><p>  When we started the process, we had enormous support for the review.  There was a great public interest in what we were doing.  We asked for submissions.  We offered to meet with a large number of participants.  We did that over a period of months.  It included stakeholders from the private sector, partners in the social partnership process and Members of this Parliament from all parties.  I met a great number of people from within the Department.  Again, the Secretary General of the day heartily embraced what we were doing and devoted a great deal of his resources to make sure it happened.  We met people from the ground floor of the Department and then prepared our report.</p><p>  I presume a number of members have read the report.  We start with an overview of the Irish economy.  It was a fascinating history of Irish economic history in which I took a particular interest and was eager to play a part, but members know that history.</p> <p>The economy was transformed in the early 1990s by some real structural changes that dramatically improved Ireland's international competitiveness.  That spurred a period of real growth, a very important growth, in the 1990s, further activated by Ireland's entry into the EU.  Whereas people outside of Ireland, and probably in Ireland, anticipated that the pace of growth would cool somewhat at the turn of the century, it did not.</p><p> The second phase of growth in the first decade of the 2000s was very different from the 1990s growth.  Ireland saw a deterioration of its international competitiveness but, buoyed by increased infrastructure investments, in part funded by the EU, and by joining a monetary union that clearly had at that time and throughout the early first decade of this century interest rates that were far too low for the circumstances of the Irish economy, growth was spurred, particularly in building.  So, there was a deterioration of international competitiveness, yet there was still a very active economy.</p><p> Mr. Peter Nyberg's advice and recommendations yesterday were noted in this report.  Interest rates were far too low for the macroeconomic environment in Ireland.  There was a pressure, an economic case, for spending restraint.  That did not happen.  The construction boom further overheated the economy.  It was aggravated by the financial sector which expanded, funded largely by short-term borrowings in Europe.  At the same time, there was a very large increase in Government spending here.  It averaged almost 12% per year for a decade between 1998 and 2008.  That was an extraordinary expansionary process.  All of that led to the crash in 2006-2007 particularly, which was severely aggravated by the failure of the Irish banking system when there was a very serious international climate, including in Canada.  It caused a serious challenge here of which members are well aware.</p><p> Since then, Ireland has been working hard to re-establish the credentials and strength of the economy.  I must say, there is a very different environment walking around the city now than there was four years, so I think there has been progress.</p><p> The Government acted with two scoping reviews on what to do.  There was the first Honohan report and Regling and Watson did a report on various issues.  Of course, there was a banking inquiry established with Mr. Nyberg and the review of the Department of Finance.  We were quite deliberate in not wanting to overlap with the work on the banking sector, but we did draw from some observations in the Watson-Regling report that focused our review.  There was one part of the mandate that we got from Parliament that was a little troubling, namely, to look at the policy processes of the Department of Finance for the last ten years.  Having been a Deputy Minister of Finance, that is a massive amount of information, so we used the core observations from the Regling report to help focus our work.</p><p> We looked at three questions - how appropriate was the Department's advice on the risk of pro-cyclical fiscal policy, which was the No. 1 issue of our focus; secondly-----</p></speech>

The term "pro-cyclical fiscal policy" arises a number of times in the report.  In layman's terms and because people are viewing these proceedings, could Mr. Wright explain what it means?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.728" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="00:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800004#E00700"><p>Yes.  If one has a monetary policy that is perhaps providing too much incentive for growth and there is evidence of overheating in the economy, fiscal policy, which is what one spends or how much one varies tax rates, should not aggravate that overheating.  It should pull back; one should show restraint.  I will get into the substance later but, over that period when Ireland had incentives for building that added to the enthusiasm rather than pulled back from that enthusiasm, it was a big problem.</p> <p>That was a big problem.  That was called pro-cyclical, in other words one is working up the curve of activity when one should be monitoring that activity.      Second, to have spending going up by 12% a year when one already has an overheating economy is not good.  That is pro-cyclical activity and in fiscal policy terms the international observers, the IMF, EU, OECD, did report on Ireland over that period.  It was pretty scarce on issues of financial regulation.  I think there were some real gaps in what the international agencies did.  Similarly it was varied somewhat for pro-cyclical fiscal policy but the OECD did provide a pretty consistent pattern of concern about that.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman for that question and prompt because it is a vital issue.  When Ireland joined the European Union, essentially you lost your own independent monetary policy.  So if your economy was overheating, an independent Central Bank would increase interest rates to have a more restrictive monetary policy to reign in growth.  That could not happen in a monetary union.  So you had overall interest rates and other financial markets over-stimulating activity in Ireland at the time.  Again, access to the cheap short-term money to fund long-term mortgages was a key factor but what was needed at that time, given that fact, was a more restrictive spending pattern and that did not happen.  So that is what we looked at.  Did the Government receive advice to be very careful about what it spent or how it activated its tax reductions at that period?  </p><p> The second thing we looked at was whether the Department provided appropriate advice on the risks of an overheating property sector, particularly construction activity.  Third, whether the Department gave appropriate tax policy advice on the extent to which the Government's own resources were tied to one overheated sector of the economy.  Those were the three things we looked at.</p><p> On the first matter we reviewed in particular the advice on pro-cyclical fiscal policy.  We reviewed annual memoranda to Cabinet setting out the fiscal framework that was recommended by the Department for moving forward.  One of the other observations that is pretty stark in the report is that there was very little other consistent stream of written advice that we could access.  This was a major concern to the panel but we did use that pattern of regular memoranda to Cabinet to get a sense of whether the Department was actively advising against pro-cyclical fiscal policy, which was a significant contributor to the problems in 2007 and 2008.</p><p> We found that the Department had provided clear warnings, had recommended a level of spending and tax measures that was substantially more moderate than what the Government ended up doing.  Some of this advice was certainly more direct than the people of the country knew about; it is private advice because advice to governments are so.  With very few exceptions this advice was substantially exceeded.  There was a more active spending and tax agenda coming out of Government than was recommended early in that budget process.  We examined the reasons that was the case, the first reason being just the exuberance in this country at the time.  There was great success in the 1990s and there was chatter around the world about the Celtic tiger, the Irish miracle and people believed that.  They saw the growth that was happening and they wanted a share of that, they wanted to catch up.  That fairness issue overwhelmed decisions and in fact, any casual observation of economic reality would show you had a very well managed debt pattern in that there was not excessive debt, you were meeting your targets, revenues were coming in higher than anticipated and so the layman would not see a screaming issue of concern there.  </p><p> That was our first observation, that it was hard to restrain when things just always kept going well.  Second, from a Canadian perspective, I found that the fiscal framework that the Government establishes for managing itself is a core of government management and in Ireland over that period this process was overwhelmed with two other extremely important processes, one being the programmes for Government.  We have had some coalition governments in Canada on very limited occasions and that has put a lot pressure on accommodating and spending the coalition.</p> <p>I understand that pressure and Canadian governments are susceptible to the same but that was a more ready part of everyday regular management here and in many cases it completely overwhelmed the fiscal framework that was established by Government.  Second, the social partnership process was a very well-established process at that point.  It initially started by helping the country make very important structural changes that were win-win for labour and Government and enhanced substantially the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  That was really the circumstance in the 1990s.  By the turn of the century that process was dominated by "Where is our piece of this prosperity?".  That prompted substantial expansion of wages within the public sector that worked to keep up with an overheated private sector.</p><p> With reference to salaries in the public sector there is an example in the report where the average salary for the Irish teaching profession moved from being ranked seventh out of ten in an EU comparable group to third out of ten within six years.  That is a remarkable pace of growth.  The social programme was evolved at the turn of the century into a process for broadening the fairness of what was seen as broad-based prosperity.  It helped to fuel the 12% a year growth in spending and made it much harder to stick with appropriate fiscal policy.</p><p> Third, we found some serious deficiencies in the quality of finance advice.  Advice existed and if it had been embraced one could see where that could have helped facilitate the chance of a soft landing from the boom, if there had been a real engagement on that, but there was no real engagement.  Our advice was pretty blunt on this, namely, that the Department should have strengthened its advice in several respects.  It should have highlighted the concerns as it went forward.  It is one issue to express a concern on one year of expansionary fiscal policy that was putting the country at risk but after five years there should have been extraordinarily strong concerns expressed.</p><p> Over that period the OECD and others had made a number of observations that the construction sector in particular was really overheated.  At that point it became too late to say, "How can we unwind this without a hard landing rather than a soft landing?"  I am sure there were also some broader political issues on reining in an economy with great expectations.  We provided a number of recommendations on this policy function and it is one that I think is the most vital going forward.  It would require a change in culture but we asked the Department to consider not holding back on its mandate.  The Department of Finance is uniquely positioned to provide regular advice on the total macro-economic risk environment facing the Government.  We did not see evidence, for example, of building in the very reality that the monetary policy was inappropriately loose at that time because Ireland was driven by the interest rates out of the broader economic European Union.  We thought they should have had that advice in the Department and that they should have been more active in looking at the financial sector.  They focused in a more limited way on the breadths and we recommended again a number of areas where they should annually report to the Government on the broader set of macro-economic risks.</p><p> We provided recommendations on a need to strengthen the Department's written record of advice.  I will speak to that later in the question and answer session.  We recommended on a number of other issues relating to strengthening its capacity to provide this sort of advice.</p><p> We then turned to issues of the management of the Department, including the structure and the staffing of the Department based on what we heard from others in the public service, political observers, politicians and from people in the Department itself.  We felt the management framework for the Department was quite weak and needed to be strengthened substantially.  In particular, we said it did not have a critical mass in vital technical skills, including economics and financial sector expertise, taxation policy expertise - which it should strengthen.  It had too many generalists.</p> <p>It had too many generalists.  Observers from outside said it was more numbers-driven rather than strategic.  I agree with that.  It did not have a strong enough engagement with the broader economic community in Ireland.  It operated in silos, even within the Department.  It really did not have a modern management.  It did not connect to its full team and there was some very good people in the Department of Finance that were not being fully utilised because of this management challenge.  This was a sort of candour and assessment that the Secretary General of the day was seeking from us and we delivered it and really called it.  We made a number of recommendations that dealt with strengthening the human resource management at the Department.</p><p> It is very easy to make these observations in hindsight, on the economic crisis and on the management regime.  That was core to our mandate from Government and it is what was embraced by the Minister of the day and his Secretary General.  We did go out of our way to acknowledge that there were some very gifted people there and now members have been exposed to those people.  They have worked very hard over the last four years.</p><p> I will very briefly go over the range of recommendations we had on management.  First of all, it had a very broad Department.  It included public service management, it included senior executive management, it included expenditure management and it included classic macroeconomic management.</p><p> Our first piece of advice, we recommended to the Government that the Department should sharpen its focus of activities on the core business of the economy and strengthen its capacity to manage that core business.  Our advice was that they should spin-off public service management.  We did advise that the Department retain sectoral analysis.  The Government of the day moved that out as well.  There is, I think, appropriate connections between the two Departments to make things work, but the Department has been sharply focused from where it was and it is more definitively focused on the core economic issues of the day.</p><p> We had a number of other recommendations on public service management, and I think those would not be within the Department of Finance now but with the expenditure management Department.  I note that given the focus on restraint, there probably continues to be less progress on public service modernisation than should be seen.  Canadian public service management is not stellar.  The pace of change and modernisation in government seems to be hard, slower paced and more restrained.  The Irish system, in particular, needs to be energised to help public servants cope with extraordinary demands for service in a time of restraint.  I think not as much progress has happened on that front on the broader public service.</p><p> Going back to focusing on the other recommendations we had for the Department of Finance, to strengthen the remaining core structure, we suggested a number of things.  We suggested de-layering the executive management team so that there were more appropriate direct reports to the Secretary General.  If one thinks of what the management objective is for a world-class Department of Finance, one would say one has to have the right people and manage those people well.  It is a knowledge institution where all those people should be connected to the objectives.  One has to ensure that those people have a real sense of purpose in providing the necessary advice to the Minister.  Their best advice, regardless of what the Minister wants to hear, you get their best advice and then you implement the Minister's decisions.  Those three steps - the right people, the right management systems and a focus on professional policy advice.  We saw a lot of very good people in the Department.  We thought they should substantially increase the number of economists and other financial and tax experts where they were very low by international standards.</p><p> We saw a real need to modernise the management regime in basic things such as structuring, communicating and connecting all the members of this team.  There are now only 300 people in the Department of Finance.  They have to be connected to the sense of purpose the senior executives have and what the Government wants.  There is a whole range of issues that should be done to improve that.</p> <p> Finally, on policy advice I mentioned we had some very important advices on how to formulise some of the policy processes.  I am happy to speak to these individual pieces of advice.  In the four years since - although I am here to talk about this report which is four years old - there has been a great deal of progress.  There has been a much stronger engagement with the EU that has covered off some of our advice for particular fiscal councils and one exists now.  Ireland's relationship with the EU has provided greater rigour that has changed the timing of the budgetary process and strengthened that.  </p><p> I am also aware, from my contacts from Canada and with meetings I have had over the last few days, that the Department has made some very important progress in implementing the ideas we had in place.  The Secretary General of the day is better equipped, and the Minister, to talk about that progress.  There has been some real progress there.  </p><p> I also note that there has been a very important step made on repatriating economic sovereignty with early withdrawal from the process and with the troika, which I commend Ireland for.  It is driven by economic growth that I hope continues.  That is the last comment I shall make.</p><p> Canada had major fiscal challenges in the 1990s which lasted for several years.  We went through a lot of restraint of spending and tax increases to deal with the challenges but it was economic growth that really delivered us out of that.  I really support the additional observation we had in here, that the Minister has clearly run with, which is looking at a medium-term economic plan to get back to the competitiveness focus that Ireland had in the 1990s.  It is something that Canada should be doing more of.  It certainly is a very important element of what is going to get Ireland through to the sort of economic activity it is looking for.  </p><p> I have given a brief but complete overview and I welcome questions and comments.</p></speech>

We did not hold back on advice.  There are some very good people in the Department.  I mean one did not have to start from scratch.  In the whole Department there were people who wanted to make themselves in the face of this.  There was a full engagement with everyone in the Department.  I met with people at the working level right through the Department who knew they were doing something important to help Ireland get out of this.  Since the crisis those people have worked their hearts out to get there.</p><p>  Our advice is based on how to broaden and deepen that engagement.  I think John Moran made some comments to this Parliament a few weeks ago that it was a pretty glum place to be and the finance Department was getting a real beating.  There are some real important questions one should ask of public officials that were being asked.  They really were not getting credit for some of the work they had done.  There was advice and one did not have to start from scratch.  </p><p>  That said, we gave some very direct advice.  If the Department had not embraced that level of advice, or is not embracing that level of advice, I would say it is not fit for purpose.  It has to be ready to engage, modernise and strengthen its capacity to serve Ireland.  That is what public servants are in this for - to work on issues that they know are important.  They are working with a good team and are  making a difference for their country.  They stepped up to the plate when this crisis hit.  They need to be better organised and supplemented for longer effect.  I wanted to have something constructive to say about the people here as well.</p></speech>

In your opening statement, Mr. Wright, you say that in the 1990s, the economy would appear to have been structured in a way from a fiscal base to be more sound than what it was when it progressed into the 2000s.  Also, in your opening statement, you said that because of Ireland being part of the eurozone, we did not have control over our interest rates.  Can you explain the difficulties that arose from the 1990s into the noughties?  Were they difficulties arising because of advice coming from the Department of Finance, or were those difficulties arising from Government policy that was not in line with advice coming from the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

First of all, in the 1990s, the most important change was a breakthrough, through the social partnership, to say "let's reduce wages substantially and reduce taxes", so it is a net win.  It is win for people who are working and a huge win for a more competitive Ireland.  That became less dominant at the turn of the century.  I think, as I mentioned, there is no single culprit.  There was advice that should have been followed and I can envisage a scenario where that advice could have been very helpful, if followed, on a more restrictive fiscal policy - spending less money.  If the finance advice was taken, it would have helped enormously because when the crisis hit, you saw a real impact on the business sector, but Government resources were severely strained.  Typically, you would want the Government to step up to the plate and to do more at that period, yet their tax resources withered away and they had already ramped up spending by 12% a year, so there was very little room for the type of fiscal action you had in mind.</p><p>  Maybe I went through that summary too quickly.  I did see some evidence of some good advice - some advice that should have been taken from the Department and was not, whether that was because of political judgments or these other processes and, in part, because of the expectations you still face, actually.  There are expectations in Ireland in the next election that you will be able to solve a lot of problems with resources that you will not have to solve those problems with.  Unless you are ready to restrain that expectation, you will have the same challenge.</p></speech>

When the Irish economy came to that sudden stop, there was a deficit of about &euro;30 billion in tax revenue coming in to meet the daily outgoings of running the country on a day-to-day basis which meant the Irish nation was short &euro;30 billion to manage its house, and that was because of a tax shortfall and not because of banking debts or anything else, which is what the focus of the inquiry is about.  Coming back to the change between the 1990s and the 2000s, was there an observational change in taxation in the area of property and in development, that there were particular taxation policies that changed between the 1990s and the 2000s that actually had a specific impact in the property and development sector that were creating the sort of overheating in the economy that you are talking about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="00:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800009#K00400"><p>The dynamic that is important, Chairman, is there were existing tax instruments - stamp duty and revenue flows from the property sector.  When the property sector was overheating, those revenues were flowing even greater.  It was not that there was a tax policy to enhance all of that but that those that existed, once the sector grew very substantially, revenues grew and the higher the revenues, the higher the surpluses that were evident, which fuelled more spending.  That was the question, whether the tax authorities in the Department of Finance were aware of just how vulnerable the overall Government finances were to that stream of revenues, and they were.</p><p>  The question in that sector as well was, as is now, how do you manage the potential for another overheating of the sector?  I think you have done a number of things by restraining some of the incentives that were in place at the time, including interest deductibility.  There is more that will be done, I am sure, on the level of mortgage coverage.  There are other options in terms of broad-based 100% mortgages to deal with new home buyers that you can incent through targeted tax agreements.</p> <p>That was a very important element of the dynamic that took place but it was not as if the Government was adding dramatically new incentives for the housing sector but basically not restraining some of the elements that were there.  In fact, some of the elements that were there were creating more expectations for spending, not unlike in any other country.  In Canada, we had a period of time where we were targeting to reach a certain point on deficit and surplus and there was pressure to spend to meet needs across the country.  If there was a surprise to the upside on revenues or whatever, where there was an increased pile of money in one year, there was enormous frustration about why we did not know about that earlier.  I think you face the same pressures here from all parties to meet real needs of the economy.  That fuelled the fiscal spending.  </p><p> I did not answer the Chairman as completely as I should have.  What has changed very dramatically now is that years ago, countries like Ireland and Canada devolved very tough economic decisions to our central bankers.  If the economy was growing too fast, you needed some cold-hearted economist in a senior position to say, "We're going to have to pull back now, folks.  Hopefully, we will be open in why we are doing it, but that is what we're going to do.  We're going to pull back now."  They do that and people may not like it.  They will gripe to the central banker but politicians will not be making the final choice on when and how to pull back.  Central bankers are much better at pulling back.</p><p> Now you do not have a central banker who will deal with the unique monetary policy needs of this country.  You are part of a broader economic European Union.  It puts a lot more pressure on you, as politicians, to help the people of Ireland to restrain expectations about what you can do and to explain why there is a danger to over-incenting the economy.  That is not obvious to people out there yet.</p></speech>

You might give us an indication as to some areas with which we might deal with it.  I will return to that at the end of today's session, when we have completed proceedings, and maybe drawn upon those comments a bit further.</p><p>  That said, I invite Senator Sean D. Barrett to open up the lead questions. </p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Wright and thank him for his report in the first instance, for being here today and, indeed, for keeping up with what has been happening in the Irish economy.  I think we have a friend in Ottawa looking out for us.  As a student in Canada, I remember that we used to go to western Ontario to the great seminars on public policy.  That was Mr. Wright's department.</p><p>  I have admired Canada for not having a banking crisis, when the United States had a huge one, and for having control of the public finances.  There is a lot of Irish DNA in there with Jim Flaherty, Canada's former federal Minister of Finance, and the former governor of the Bank of Canada, who is now the governor of the Bank of England.  This can be a very fruitful dialogue and, as the Chairman said, if you can give us any hints on how we might improve matters further, it would be valuable.</p><p>  You have explained in great detail the reforms in the Department of Finance but it had only 39 economists out of 542 staff, which is 7%.  The Canadian figure was 60 and the Dutch figure was 40.  Can I put it to you, that must be an essential, that is, we cannot have untrained people so prominent?  Does it explain part of the Canadian success?</p></speech>

I was really surprised at the limited numbers of senior economists - I mean masters level economists.  That was at a very low level.  We were quite direct about the need in that regard and I talked a lot about that with everybody in the Department.  Some felt threatened by it.  Again, people are very good and they are doing a good job but we gave a lot of specific advice on what to do.  One of the best things the Department of Finance in Ottawa in Canada does is it has a regular inflow of economists.  There is a great deal of interest in working in the Department of Finance there.  If you are a senior economist - if you are taking a graduate programme in economics - the Irish Department of Finance would be a fantastic place to work, so open up to that process.  Despite some restraints, have a regular influx.</p> <p>We recommended doubling the number of economists at a master's level within two years.  They have not quite done that.  We also recommended urgently seconding in expertise from around Ireland and abroad and I think they have acted on that.</p><p> The Department of Finance is now focused around almost 300 people.  There has been a lot of churn in the Department.  That is always a good thing.  In fact, it now has over 100 employees with an economics background, almost half of them at master's level.  There has been important progress.  Very importantly, there have been a number of secondees from the NTMA, Bank of Ireland and other partners around the world that have an interest in this and can add to the immediate bench strength.  The core, going forward, is a regular influx and an outreach.  The Department now has a full-time human resources expert with a five-year plan.  That is not enough - the Secretary General will have to tie himself personally to management objectives for that group - but significant progress has been made and yes, I was very surprised at how little bench strength the Department had.</p></speech>

I would reinforce a couple of observations we made at the time we produced the report, four years ago.  On the financial sector, one of the big differences I saw was that treasury operations in the Department of Finance, with some highly trained and skilled economists, was moved out to set up the NTMA in early 2002 or around that time.  In Canada, the treasury operations are an integral part of our Department.  They are in the same branch that manages financial sector policies, so during some troubling times in the financial sector, with a global meltdown, I was able to draw on great strength in that sector to get us through that.  The Canadian regulatory framework was a much more active financial regulatory framework.  It was not principles-based or light-touch, it was regulation.  That was tracked very closely.</p><p>  The Department of Finance had expertise, where I was told whether within the Department members of staff agreed with all decisions being made and they could tell the Minister whether they agreed, and they were expected to do that.  Without that expertise from the NTMA, the Department really did not have the capacity to seriously question some of the regulatory decisions that were being made.  One does not want to duplicate effort, but here is a broad area of economic risk.  Much has happened since then.  They have seconded people into the Department and, most importantly, there is a much more integrated effort with the great expertise in the NTMA and the Department.  There was a real gap there and they have made a number of changes to improve it. </p></speech>

In Ireland it is called the "green jersey", that one must keep the image of Ireland high and if that meant ignoring what was happening in banking, that was a price we may have been willing to pay.</p></speech>

That is not all bad.  I think some of the tightening of financial regulatory requirements in the United States led the UK to compete for a greater portion of the global financial market activity through principles-based regulation.  Some of the sentiment in that way was probably rewarded in the Davos comparators of where is the best place to do business if one is a businessman.  Canada has a strong financial regulatory sector.  Our banks have talked about how important it was through the crisis to have that, but people do not like being regulated.  The banking sector is extremely important in Canada and Canadian bank leaders are very strong leaders in the business community and so one must have this sector that is attentive to what they are saying, but does not stray from one's regulatory needs.</p></speech>

I think the move to 100% mortgages was about helping first home buyers in Ireland.  In Canada, we had limited mortgage insurance, up to 85% of the value of a home.  There were private sector insurance providers which helped move that up to 90% or 95% and in Canada there was a concern that this might overheat the economy.  We approached the Minister with advice on restraining that limit and some of his political advisers had real concerns about the impact on the housing market, but the Minister did not.   It was not even in Minister Flaherty's Department but he took action to restrain it because he did not want a bubble.  In that particular circumstance there was strong evidence of an overheated construction sector, so to do something expansionary at that point was a real concern.  The Department questioned it somewhat.  I think a Minister in Government had raised some questions about it but in the end, particularly once the regulator said it could support 100%, it was very hard to resist.  It should have been.  At that point in time, what the country needed was a strategy for how to manage a soft landing in the construction sector.</p></speech>

Spending was not about just low interest rates, but one could have moderated the coverage for mortgage rates.  One could have taken some actions, which have now been taken, on tax-deductability for mortgages.  One could have intervened with the banks in terms of their eagerness.  The regulatory authority would have a menu of things it could do but clearly it would have to be part of a framework the Government was comfortable with and if it were to be of the magnitude that was needed one would have had to have a strategic framework that would say, "Look, here is the growth rate we have seen in construction, here is an objective assessment of how excessive that might be.  We will see how these work, but we are going to restrain it".</p> <p>One would have needed a strategic framework that would have a common effort between the Government, the Department - including instruments on the tax side - and also the regulator.  One start would have been the coverage on the percentage covered for mortgages.  That would have been a useful start.</p></speech>

I have spoken with three Secretaries General about how important it is.  If I can, I will comment at some length on that.  We did focus on those three core questions and I wanted to see the advice on the risks of pro-cyclical fiscal policy.  There was just very little written advice.  One could get snippets here and there, but in something as vital as that, particularly when one has regular engagement with international institutions like the IMF, the OECD and the European Union where concerns have been expressed, one would have anticipated a consistent flow of advice through that period.  We really could not find much of that.</p><p>  There were several reasons for that.  The most dominant reason we were given was that under the Freedom of Information Act the Department would be at risk if its advice was truly blunt to a Minister.  Advice has to be blunt to a Minister in terms of saying, "This is the Department of Finance's view.  We're not saying it's your view.  Here's what might guide your decision", or, "Here's what you committed to do, but here is why you should look at a different variant."</p><p>  If one is sending a message to one's Minister that is suggesting a different path than he has already stated in public, it is very damaging to relationships and that is not how public servants in Canada and in Ireland see our role.  Our role is to inform decisions.  When I was briefing my Minister, Jim Flaherty, in Canada, I gave very direct advice on what the department's view was and he would usually take it.  However, occasionally - on a number of occasions - he would say, "No, I don't agree with it.  So I need an option of something that is more practical."  These were areas where the Minister was right to have options.  This was the right thing to do.</p><p>  On some occasions, I would not have thought it was the right thing to do for the economy, but it was a broader political need for him, the Prime Minister or his party.  However, once the decision is made, we will go and implement it.  That engagement informs the Minister of a balanced professional view of the right thing for the economy.  He makes his decision and he is accountable for it, and again it is a good interchange.</p><p>  If one has a piece of advice that is not totally consistent with what the Minister has said in public, it is controversial.  On the guidelines for my appearance here, there is an element of the committee's guidelines that I was struck by, that clearly state that public servants are not expected and cannot be asked to contradict what their Ministers say.</p></speech>

That particular Minister wanted more limited options that he did not agree with - well, that constrained the process.  I think that is only one example.</p><p>  So I expressed some concern about freedom of information to the extent that one does not want anything to restrain Secretaries General of the future from pushing the button when they have to push the button.  So one has to be sure one has that outlet.</p><p>  I think the Department overreacted on that.  I think there are provisions.  I understand Ireland does not have a Freedom of Information Act like in Canada.  It is not accessible.  My advice to my Minister is not accessible; that is a blanket exemption.  It is vital in my view.</p></speech>

We had also heard from the former Comptroller and Auditor General, who has now retired but is a very impressive man, that indeed there is a systemic issue of written record in government about which he is concerned.</p><p>  So we made that observation and I have reinforced it with the Department in an important way because an important part of how a professional, world-class Department of Finance works is to say, "Here is our advice.  You know what it is.  We're on the record."  A Minister does not want casual observations.  Some Ministers operate in different ways.  I have worked with Ministers who really wanted to sit down and talk with the team about options and everything.  I have worked with other Ministers who might say, "Put yourself on the spot, Deputy Minister.  You give me written advice on what you think and if I agree with it we'll do it.  I don't want to waste time.  If I don't agree with it, we'll come and talk about it."  There is a great discipline to writing down.  It is also very important to the overall enterprise of this knowledge institution.  The Department of Finance officials should know what one is trying to achieve and should know where one stands on these issues and written records help everyone know that.</p></speech>

He has said that the Department of Finance is unique in that assistant secretaries do not report directly to the Secretary General.  Would that have meant the 58 people who were in charge of financial services had no way of relating to the other 542 members of staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.768" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="01:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800014#P00500"><p>No.  At the time we did the report, there were three Deputy Secretaries General.  All the assistant secretaries reported to those people and through them to the Secretary General.  What I was saying there is that I think best practice is that if somebody has a line responsibility as an executive managing the financial sector, he or she should have connection to the Secretary General.</p><p>  There are other models that could work.  Very senior members of the Department wanted the more direct connection to their Secretary General, and we thought that was a good thing, particularly in a streamlined and focused enterprise like we have now.  Given the magnitude of the financial sector restructuring, NAMA, the NTMA relationship, I think the current Secretary General will explain his structure and why that worked for him.  What is vital in the core reform needed is having clear structures and using a much greater degree of information flow - communication within the Department.  Again that is one of the reasons we wanted to see a more detailed written record.</p><p>  I want to expand on that point a bit because I have a couple more observations on the written record.  If one is going to give advice to the Minister in writing about what one thinks is important, one will articulate the rationale for it.  If one does not have the capacity to give the Minister advice on the financial sector, because one does not have the bench strength to advise one on that, one is going to know it.  One is not going to be comfortable signing a piece of advice that either one does not understand or one fears someone else does not understand.  So it is an important discipline on rigour that grows a stronger Department.</p><p>  It is not enough to say, "I had a conversation with the Minister of the day."  Does the rest of the Department know that is a conversation?  It should not be a personal matter.  In Canada if advice has gone to the Minister, it is from the Department of Finance.  People in the Department know what it is and they are all connected to it.  That helps strengthen the team and understand better the directions of the Government, but they understand their role is to give their best possible advice.</p></speech>

I wish to follow up on the second last question put by Senator Barrett.  Mr. Wright spoke of his engagement with the Canadian Minister for Finance and he referred to it as a balanced professional view that might exist between a Secretary General and a Minister at the time.  Did he find in the ten year period that he investigated that such a balanced professional view existed between the senior officials in the Department of Finance and the Minister of the day?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="01:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800015#Q00600"><p>I think there was a strong public service ethos.  People were not seen as the executive assistant to the Minister.  They had a capacity to do more and they did more.  I know that on the day when I was engaged I was impressed by the commitment of the then Secretary General to public service and to renewal.  I have been impressed by a number of the senior players who had frustrations within that system and wanted to improve it, but when it came to giving the Minister advice, I thought that relationship was professional.  What I have recommended are ways to make it more rigorous in ways that are more important and would lead the Department to be capable.</p><p>  I know we have all got the knock on the noggin.  I do not think senior officials in the Department of Finance will be comfortable giving casual advice.  I think they have embraced this notion of increased formality of the written record and the discipline associated with that.  How to regulate a risk is learned from it.  The question of how to sustain it is something that is worthy of being part of the review.  In Canada, advice to the Minister is clearly restricted.  Under the former Freedom of Information Act, which is an Australian model, there is no blanket exemption.  I did take the time to talk to a few Australians about whether that restrained them from giving advice when it had to be blunt.  Australian reaction to that question was typically Australian: I was left in no doubt that the advice would be delivered in a bloody clear fashion.</p><p>  There are areas to get the job done in that framework.  In the current framework, I would want to be reassured that if there is a red button that has to be pushed in no uncertain terms, there are enough exemptions for that type of national financial market advice to go uncensored through the system to the Minister.  I think that is a vital aspect.  There is scope in the current system but I think the committee should be mindful of that.</p></speech>

I wish to put a number of quotations by the people who commented after the publication of Mr. Wright's report.  Mr. Dave Thomas, the then General Secretary of the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants, AHCPS, said in the aftermath of the publication of Mr. Wright's report, "This report clearly states that the actions of politicians, rather than civil servants, were the primary factors ... that led to economic collapse".  Does Mr. Wright think that is a fair characterisation of his report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.778" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="01:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800015#Q00800"><p>I did not think I should limit my aim that much.  When we have something this important everybody should front up to say what can we do differently going forward.  This is not a question of looking to blame people but is asking what they have to do better.  That is what drew me to this work.  It is what really impressed me about my engagement with the Department and others.  There are things that they have to do better.  There are a lot of things that members as politicians will have to do better.  I can talk about it at any time members want to - it is not just in Ireland, there are issues everywhere.</p> <p>Again in Canada we have drifted away from a medium-term economic agenda that enhances future growth.  It is very hard to sell politically concepts of building a stronger future when one knows there is an immediate risk for something that has to be resolved.  That is something that is going to have to focus one's mind here.</p><p> There is going to be an election now.  Again, another example, if there is a programme of government - and there will be coming out of this election - in Canada because we went through this grief in the 1990s, Canadians do not want an ongoing deficit.  There was an enhanced deficit to deal with the financial crisis in Canada.  The Government in power now in the last election said, "We have some ideas to spend more money on tax relief and other relief, but we're not going to do that till we balance the budget."  Other parties did not attack that principle.  Even if this may not be the best fiscal policy at the current time, it is an important guideline going forward.</p><p> So in Canada we will have an election in the coming year and I think people will be saying, "If you're going to offer tax relief, where are you going to get the revenue from?  If you're going to offer spending, where are you going to get the revenue from then?"  I think if one has an engagement now on a programme of government that is very ambitious on spending the question should be, "Where are you going to get the money for that?"</p><p> I would think that given the current climate, with the fiscal council and the Department of Finance, one of the most important questions of the coming year or two is, "Do you have some fiscal parameters that are important to guide the people of Ireland and its politicians in knowing what they should be doing?"  If there is a surprise to the upside in revenue, it is because the economy is doing quite a bit better than one had anticipated and perhaps there are some sectors that are overheating.  The last thing one wants to do in economic terms may well be to spend that money.  If one has a menu of actions that people want and an unanticipated surplus, should one spend that on those needs or should one pay down the debt?  There is a very strong case that one should pay down the debt.  Again that is something that should be developed, otherwise it is back to the same old game and I do not think that is going to work.</p><p> Similarly in Canada, a piece of advice we had was that the Government and the Department have to have the strength to give advice on a medium-term economic plan, which is what does one do that can regain some of the magic from the early 1990s to say that we are going to enhance the competitiveness of Ireland.  The Minister did put out a medium-term economic plan.  It is a very high-level document, but there are some really important new ideas in there, such as expanded financial framework funding for small business.  There are other areas one can talk about, which is a more efficient tax regime rather than just a fair tax regime and further investments that enhance one's competitiveness.  So it is not all just the wage levels.</p><p> I think the way forward to focus on initiatives should be on areas that enhance the prospects of economic growth in Ireland and areas that respect this very challenging new world, members will face as politicians, when they do not have a monetary policy or a bank governor who is going to restrain monetary policy when it is needed.  The members are going to have to help restrain the ambitions of the Irish people - 12% a year in spending.  Of course, I am a Canadian so I can come here and say that - the committee probably will not have other Secretaries General but that is what is needed.</p></speech>

I think the economist in him was coming out when the bar chart was published showing the period 1999-2008, including the June fiscal framework proposal from the Department of Finance and the final actual budget figures announced in December of those particular years.  Looking at the differences between the advice offered in June and the final outcome in December, is it fair to say that the Department of Finance's advice was largely ignored?  With the exception of 2003 which conveniently enough was just after a general election, is it fair to say that in the other years that advice in June was not replicated in the final outcome when the budget was announced in December?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.787" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="01:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800017#SSS00200"><p>"Ignored" is very strong, but it certainly was not followed.  In the text of that report we explain a number of reasons why, that could explain a year or two of it.  First of all, the timing of the budget was out of line with the timing of some of the revenue receipts if revenues came in higher.  There was a tendency to think - not in the Department of Finance - that if there is a surprise to the upside on revenues, let us spend it.  That is what happened.  There was a menu of ideas from programmes for Government or the social process that had real demand from the people of Ireland.  Politicians did not resist all of that; they may have resisted some.</p></speech>

There is a consistent situation whereby the advice and what happens are quite different.</p></speech>

I would say - a little variant of that - this does not show what the Department advised its Minister the framework should be.  It may be the same, but I would make a distinction.  It shows what the Minister brought to Cabinet as the framework, I think upon the advice of the Department, but the Department may well have recommended something different than that.  That is what the Minister took to Cabinet based on the advice of the Department.</p></speech>

He also said that this was enforced by senior managers.  Does Mr. Wright feel that is an accurate reflection of how the Department operated at that particular period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="01:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800017#SSS00600"><p>I was here for three months, or not even that.  I was here on four trips over three months.  I cannot say that.  What I can say is that members of the Department - the staff of the Department - were not connected clearly enough to the sense of purpose of senior managers.  In an informal process, one could interpret that.  Certainly once any Minister makes his decision, one is going to implement that Minister's decision.  The qualm I had was whether, at the time, the Minister had very clear advice from the Department on what was appropriate to the circumstance.  If he overruled that and went on, that is his prerogative - he is the Minister.  That observation really underscores something else that we observed that said one has to modernise the management regime in this Department so people are connected.</p><p>  One of the times I was here was a budget night.  People in the Department went home to see what was in the budget.  I found that incredible.  Why did they not know what was in the budget?  They are in the Department of Finance.  There was not a connection to these core pieces.  </p><p>  I am not advocating Canadianising your service, but in Canada-----</p></speech>

I had a very strong department to help me through that - some of the best economists in Canada, a number of them, to talk through key issues.  One of the things I am proudest of concerns the processes in that Department, and they existed before I arrived but I hope they may be a little more reinforced.  There are 750 people in the Department of Finance.  This was one of the biggest and most important budgets we had put together.  We did it on a very short timeframe for a great Minister who was the leading candidate through this.  Every one of those 750 people were connected to those outcomes.  They knew what we were doing, knew their role in it, and were actively engaged.</p><p> That connection to the policy agenda, and the objectives of the Secretary General and the Minister, had to be substantially strengthened.  I think it is.  I think what has been accomplished in the last couple of years has been tremendous.  I saw the Minister briefly yesterday.  To repatriate economic sovereignty is pretty big.  To see the progress that is being made in the economy here is pretty big.</p><p> I think the Department feels a part of that, very strongly, and they are more connected to it throughout.  At that time, however, there really was not the sort of connection I would like to have seen.  That led to a whole set of advice on how to strengthen the communication and connection within the Department.  </p><p> I did not think that senior managers were on a leash.  I think they would have given advice and do give advice.  I thought they should have given more advice in writing.  I thought they should have taken more initiative.  In Canada, and I would say in Australia or the Dutch finance department, if there was any - and this is term I have used directly with the Secretaries General here - issue that affects the economy or the fiscal standing of Canada, the Minister for Finance is going to get a view from the department.  If it is in somebody else's turf and they have already made a decision, it does not matter.  That is the ambition they have to have.  They have to have the capacity to do that.  </p><p> That is where this Minister expects them to be as well, so I am pleased to see that progress.  At that time, I can understand a comment like that but it would not necessarily be that that was what was happening.  It is that they did not know what was happening.  It could be a mixture of both.  They were professional public servants who were giving advice, but I thought it should have been more rigorous.  That was a very fair observation but beyond that I would not have thought it fair.</p></speech>

At several points in his report, Mr. Wright referred to the two dominant processes.  He touched on them briefly already - the programmes for Government and the social partnership.  After the publication of Mr. Wright's report, the secretary general of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at the time, Mr. David Begg, described Mr. Wright's criticism of social partnership as a facile exercise of scapegoating designed to obscure the true cause of the collapse, which was the banks, builders and toxic Government policy.  Does Mr. Wright have any views on that particular comment by Mr. Begg?</p></speech>

I was not trying to.  I think the social partnership achieved a great deal for Ireland.  Even though it led to massive excess spending, it overwhelmed the fiscal framework of government.  It certainly enhanced the cohesion and outreach, and connected with the people very strongly, but I was not looking for a scapegoat.  I do not think that it is.  I think it is a reality and it is something that you will all have to deal with.

Was the warning ignored?</p></speech>

We did not expect to find advice on that.  That warning perhaps overreached a little bit.  That was where everybody, of all parties, put on the green jersey and pushed back very hard at the political level.  There were real questions about the capacity for Ireland to adapt to the pressures that were building on the IT challenges of that period.  It turns out that, in fact, there was a pretty full response to it, so it did seem to be overreaching.  I would say that experience and the reaction probably moderated some of the advice you might have had from the European Union.  However, I did not see the specific advice on that issue from the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

There was a common view, which is an observation that has been made in a number of areas, that what you were doing was good, it was making progress and you did not need a directive.  Now it turns out that, in fact, the Minister of the day, and the Minister of the day was a very forceful gentleman on that matter, but it was an Irish view and it took offence to some elements of that warning, and that probably moderated the sort of advice you got from the EU, although some of it was still pretty good.</p></speech>

It seems there was not anymore the dialogue that ought to have been there, that when they left, they left and took their advice with them.

It is an important question.  There was not enough contact.  There was not enough integrated effort between the two organisations.  There was great expertise over there.  They were focused, they did good work for the Minister of the day, and they grew into something that is really quite distinct and impressive.  However, that was a large body of expertise to lose.  It was one of the reasons we were reluctant to see the sectoral analysis unit leave the Department as well.  It was affecting the critical mass of trained economists.</p> <p>At the same time, what I think the previous Secretary General has done, importantly, and the current deputy Secretary General, is ensure a truly integrated effort with that group, which is needed, including complete interchange of staff.  Yes, my advice to Secretaries General now would be to use the more effective staffing and other processes of the NTMA, the bank of Ireland and anyone else you can to get the expertise in, but to build stronger partnerships.  There is no room for divorce.</p></speech>

I think there was a collective problem here.  I think the Department should have done a better job in presenting advice and done it in a rigorous way and should not have held a calm view of that period.</p> <p>It is one thing - Senator O'Keefe referred to the chart - to say that early advice was there, but my God, after seven or eight years of it should there not be more concern than there was at first?  Should things not have been stepped up?  In retrospect, they should have been.  There are a lot of things and the real issue is if we asked people who were there at the time what they should have done differently, they would probably have a longer list.  There are lessons there.  However, the question is, should both parties have done more?  Yes, if the Minister of the day received a very clear and coherent piece of advice and still did not follow it.  Would he have followed it?  Perhaps or perhaps not, but I must say I think this was received by the Minister of the day as a tough, fair and balanced report.  I think it is fair and balanced.</p></speech>

I made this comment generally.  If I had to come over from the Canadian Department to the Irish Department, yes.  Of the people who came up through that system, maybe there was some built in complacency in that process.  I do not know.  However, of course I would have.  I would have provided written advice on the risks and had a team tracking those risks over that period.  I would have made sure that advice was not just from me personally.  In Canada, they do not see our advice, but they know it exists.  It is not Rob Wright's advice.  When I was a deputy Minister for Finance, I was a very strong economist because I was relying on an entire Department that supported me.  I would have made sure that advice had a broad base of support within the Department.  Everyone who knew that advice would be using any engagement that they had to reinforce it.</p></speech>

However, if I were just dropped in, for a moment, from Canada, absolutely.  At that point, Ireland had a major economic problem and then a crisis on the financial sector.  These were challenging times in Canada and I had a full squad of outstanding, world-class economists with great integrity - strong integrity I knew about - on the financial regulatory side, and it was still challenging.  It would have been extraordinarily challenging for the senior advisers in Ireland at that time.  The pressures and the demands on them would have been extraordinary.</p></speech>

Mr. Wright mentioned the NTMA being sectioned off, and he used the term "silo" on a number of occasions.  In this jurisdiction, a silo stores agricultural produce.  However, should the NTMA be put back under the remit of the Department of Finance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="02:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800022#AA01500"><p>First, on silos, that observation was not just my personal opinion.  It was the opinion of some people - senior managers - in the Department.  It was the opinion of John Malone and a number of Secretaries General that were trying to get different views from different parts of the variance.  When I arrived I did think about and ask what is different from Canada and why.  Ireland now has the current structure that the Minister has implemented - the Government has implemented - for the Departments and it is identical to the Canadian structure except for the treasury function.</p><p>  However, Ireland is different to Canada.  The NTMA has grown very important because it had this capacity, the ambition to expand that capacity and it has been able to deliver the goods on a full range of issues.  Right now, it manages Ireland's pension funds.  We have a completely separate federal provincial institution that runs the Canada pensions system, invests its wherewithal and earns the returns quite separate from that.</p> <p>It has a range of other activities.  It is more than twice as big as the Department of Finance.  One could not just do something as simple as that.</p><p> What the Department has now done is entirely appropriate.  It has strengthened its relationship with the NTMA and seconded 18 people within the Department from the NTMA.  There is scope to do more and as long as they are joined up in this analysis, that is the way it could work.  Over time, some of those in the NTMA should stay as permanent financial sector and independent advisers within the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

As the witness knows, it would have been a useful tool available to the Department of Finance in the event of an economic crash.  Should the Department of Finance have been stronger in standing up the Central Bank and financial regulator to ensure the legislative tool could have been available?</p></speech>

The Secretary General sits on the board of the bank and would therefore be apprised of the overall direction but I know, being a former Secretary General, that it is not enough.  With the working level engagement, there would need to be a stronger idea of what is happening and an ability to advise going forward.  That was not done enough.  There was a line where the Department was often reluctant to second-guess decisions, whereas the Department of Finance should really second-guess anything it wants to.  It should have that ambition.  That is a lesson going forward, although these systems evolve, and it has been heeded.</p></speech>

Yesterday, in evidence, we had a conversation regarding contrarian views among staff.  Did Mr. Wright see any evidence of potential for somebody with an alternative view that was not of the mainstream?  Could that have had an impact on promotion within the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="02:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800023#BB00500"><p>I did not see a lot of written advice.  I did not see contrarian views that were not pursued.  Nor did I see the notion that these views were being squelched.  There has been a broader range of evidence of a gap that is sometimes evident between working-level expertise and decision makers.  I was very sensitive to it.  It affected some of the management role advice.</p><p>  Finance in Canada is quite unique in terms of institutions and I know people have left it.  When I get briefed on an area, the working-level person is in the room.  When there is a crisis and I am getting ready to brief a Minister, the working-level person is in the room when we decide what is our advice to the Minister.  None of those working-level people in Canada is reluctant to tell me when I am wrong, which is an essential attribute.  If a person is in that position, he or she is a mile wide and an inch deep.  If somebody is giving the Minister for Finance some advice, he will act on it, so that person wants to be sure the people most in tune with the expertise are giving the correct information.  That is not the level of engagement at the working level that existed four years ago; these people should work together.</p><p>  I am happy to hear contrarian views and the current Secretary General would be happy to hear such views.  They would be discussed, and it might be the wrong view.  They should engage on it.</p></speech>

Not all contrarian views are good views.  If somebody is pursuing a view that one does not feel is well established or well-thought out, that probably should affect his or her way forward.  However, I have not seen any evidence that those who just had a different judgment were persecuted in terms of their path.  I have not seen that.</p></speech>

That is what they would have done.  They would have said, "Rein in the spending, take some actions to rein in the construction sector".  If one would have made those decisions by 2005 instead of increasing spending - or even perhaps 2006, but by 2006-07 it was probably too late - when one had the spending ramped up that dramatically in an obviously overheated economy, that is a dangerous point.</p></speech>

In that chapter, I quote, &quot;Based on departmental advice, the Government took some limited action to moderate tax incentives for construction early in the decade and again eventually in 2006/2007.&quot;  Did Mr. Wright get any evidence that any further proposals were discussed inside the Department, much stronger than moderating some tax incentives, to curb what Mr. Nyberg yesterday called speculation?  For example, was there discussion of any measures to disincentivise speculators in the market who were driving up the prices, or to control the price of building land?</p></speech>

It was not just the construction sector that was overheating the Irish economy; it was the fact that Government spending was growing by 12% a year for a decade on top of that.  All these things could have been reined in.  There is an element in this report that notes there was advice - it should have been coherent - but what was needed was a strategic plan of how to deal with that.  A snippet of advice is not enough, there needs to be a plan to deal with it, and that did not exist.</p></speech>

In this country, there was a debate for decades on building land prices and how they increased massively at various times, thus pushing up the price of a home, etc.  There has been a debate on whether there should be measures to control that, or measures to control people who buy up large numbers of houses to rent and compete with the ordinary workers and first-time buyers.

In this committee we are so circumscribed by legislation we are almost afraid to admit we are human at times, but I must confess to a certain frustration, having read four or five reports, that although Mr. Wright and other distinguished authors have spoken to bankers, developers, regulators, senior public officials, and senior political establishment figures, I do not hear the voice of the victims in the reports.  The young workers who had to go to 40-year mortgages, for example, at unsustainable levels - I do not hear their voices.  They were the victims of forces that were way above them and outside their control.  Does Mr. Wright agree that is perhaps missing in these reports?</p></speech>

The people who were incentivised to enter the Dublin market on the verge of this collapse, using all of their savings and their family savings, this is a real human tragedy.  That is why I am here saying we should learn from it and make sure it does not happen again.  In a recession people lose their jobs, their cars, their houses - this is extremely negative.  Again, there is a limit to what governments can do in terms of solving all problems, but establishing a framework for stable, ongoing growth is the most important thing they can do.</p> <p>We had ten years of growth in Canada.  People talk about the fairness in the system.  This was a great period.  Between the mid-1990s and 2005 we had an extraordinary period for advancement in terms of people on lower income, women in the workplace and disadvantage people because there were opportunities in the workplace.</p><p> The Deputy is welcome to his perspective.</p></speech>

Does he have a view on whether it is healthy for society or the economy that there is unrestrained profit taking, for example in the housing industry; that this does not seem to be a problem for the political establishment or others and that no proposals to curb that have come forward?</p></speech>

What we are looking at is the capacity of government to advise on when to pull back, so that one does not have an overheated economy with those outcomes.  A lot of negatives happen when one does not manage sustainable growth.  The Deputy is naming some of them.  That is why I have a passion for that enterprise.</p></speech>

I have a related question in respect of tax incentives, based on a quotation from page 31 of his report which states: <blockquote>However, there were countervailing views at the time and even demands for substantial additional tax incentives for construction which, thankfully, were rejected by the Government.</blockquote>From where did the demands for further incentives for the construction industry come?  Did he find evidence of who was lobbying and how the very powerful interests lobbied?</p></speech>

There was probably some pressures from this body, in terms of people who were hearing about what was not happening for constituents, who wanted more of some of these things.

Does Mr. Wright see the contradiction in that?</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that the question arises as to whether people were preoccupied with growth when they should have been preoccupied with prudent management in the financial services sector.  It is a fair point.  Again, one of the most interesting and potentially useful competitiveness items going forward is the Minister's notion of expanding the availability of credit to a European or German standard for small and medium enterprises.  One of the reasons there was a crisis and one of the reasons the Government did act when it had to act is that financial services are absolutely vital to an economy.  They have to be well managed and well integrated.  I do not think it is one or the other; it is about having a coherent approach that balances those issues.</p></speech>

For example, on page 23 he states:<blockquote><br />[A] very poor budgetary process obscured ministerial and Government accountability to Parliament, and was overwhelmed by other spending processes &ndash; Programmes for Government and<br />Social Partnership.</blockquote>On page 25, he goes on to state:<blockquote>Over the ten year period of review, the Programme for Government and Social Partnership Processes helped overwhelm the Budget process.  Instead of providing an appropriate fiscal framework for prioritisation of competing demands on the Government's overall agenda, the Budget essentially paid the bills for these dominant processes.</blockquote>Looking at the table on page 22, which shows the difference between what was set out in budgets compared with what was proposed earlier in the fiscal year, is it fair to say that Mr. Wright's view is that Government economic policy over that period was really about electoral cycles and social partnership as distinct from prudent government?  Does he not believe that social partnership contributed to cohesion within the economy?</p></speech>

The amazing potential of it was realised in the 1990s.  This was a forum for social cohesion on what the country needed to do to move forward together.  It was extraordinary and powerful.  Even when it was not moving forward in terms of the framework for enhanced competitiveness, it was still a valuable forum for social cohesion.  I would say this is a strength of our two countries, that we listen rather than just talk.</p><p>  The point I was making in the report is that, particularly after the turn of the century, there were some real risks from that process.  It stopped building a stronger economy and became an effective forum to engage on spending more money.  Looking back, which is always helpful, it created some real challenges.  I think it led to a huge increase in the public sector payroll that went beyond what could reasonably have been expected under any other scenario, when pay was benchmarked to private sector wages in an overheated economy.  It contributed to that overheating.</p></speech>

On page 28, the report states:<blockquote><br />Had departmental and ministerial advice to Cabinet at the start of the budgetary cycle been accepted and sustained, Ireland would have been better positioned to deal with the current economic challenges.</blockquote>At the same time, however, Mr. Wright criticises the Department on numerous levels.  While he states on page 6 that he does not accept the notion that the Department was not fit for purpose, he also refers to technical deficiencies in terms of economic skills, there being too many generalists among the staff and the approach being numbers driven rather strategically driven.  On the other hand, in his letter to the Minister of the time, the late Brian Lenihan, he spoke about how impressed he was with the staff and the broad base of understanding within the Department.</p> <p>Was social partnership used, in a way, as a scapegoat?  I find some of the views within the report contradictory.  In one breath, it is said that it is fit for purpose, but in another numerous other situations are outlined, such as the fact that the expansionary monetary policy was not highlighted and there was no proper strategic analysis of construction.  It is not stated explicitly in the report, but it is fair to say that the Department was devoid of skills in terms of any understanding of banking and the credit bubble.  Yet, the table on page 22 which refers to the difference between what was provided by the fiscal framework by the officials and the Minister in June every year to the Cabinet-----</p></speech>

It is a very important question.  Social partnership worked, in the main, over that period.  There were certain issues.  Was Mr. Wright scapegoating social partnership in order to overlook the deficiencies within the Department in terms of proper advice?</p></speech>

I thought it was a very useful process and will be in the future.  However, a process like that has to know the limits and ambitions on spending pressures, and it did not.  It was used to leverage public sector pay in a way that was overdone.</p><p>  An honest read of the report would find that we did not pick favourites.  We examined anything that was an issue.  We had a number of observations which were critical of the Department in the areas in which they should have been.  There are some great people who should have been better energised, but they understand there are some things they should do better.  The Government and Minister of the day should perhaps have taken some advice and that would have helped the landing.</p><p>  On the processes in play, I had the temerity to talk about programmes for Government, which is probably the most sensitive issue to raise in this room.  In the future there will have to be some limits on them.  In the array of observations, I have not singled out an objective view of the social partnership process, but I mentioned that the process has to be managed in a fiscally responsible way.  It is an important process and had a significant impact when it started out.  It has to return to the process of building consensus on the way forward.  That is all I am saying, and if I have said it in a way that troubles people, I am sorry for that.</p></speech>

That relates to dealing with a banking crisis.</p></speech>

I made observations about the NTMA and the loss of vital expertise.  The Department could do better in relating to the agency.  There was not one issue in any of this that we could say is the key.  I am saying that we should look, going forward, at an entire set of improvements.  That involves the way the country works, how the Department provides advice and the way key elements, such as programmes for Government and social partnership, work.  Would it all have been better if one thing did not happen?  I not believe so.  As Mr. Nyberg observed yesterday, there was a confluence of issues.  One should not pick one thing in focusing on solutions and one must address all the elements in a coherent way.</p></speech>

Much of the advice we gave on restructuring the public service renewal part of the Department has been dealt with by the Government in a way that is different from what is in the report, but it is important.  That is resolved.  Over the past four years there has been much initiative with the European Union on terms that affect the timing of budgets in a more coherent way and deal with that part of the report.</p><p>  There has been important progress on everything else.  Are we there yet?  No, but progress has been made in the midst of this reorganisation on the number of professional economists and the strength of the Department's resources on the financial institution side.  There has been some restructuring that deals with some of the management issues we have in mind.  There is now a full-time human resource co-ordinator, which has been in place for several years.  The Department is ahead of the rest of government in having a performance management regime in place that assesses vital issues such as how to manage people.</p> <p>It asks if you are identifying those who are higher in capability and those who are challenged, and if you are dealing with both.  The Department is ahead of the curve on that.  The Department is not as far ahead as its own staff want it to be on performance management, but it is ahead of Government.  Therefore, important progress has been made.</p><p> I would say the one change that is a harder change, and it is a cultural change - I see signs that I am encouraged by - is the more active formal engagement on policy advice to the Minister.  That is a cultural change and that is probably one of the most important changes we have to see.  I see progress there too, but that is one the committee-----</p></speech>

Mr. Wright made a lot of recommendations about opening up the process, having a consultation period, setting out options well in advance, and setting out the risks and the economic outlook.  That, to my mind, has not happened, and that is central to Mr. Wright.  We still have a big bang announcement of a budget on one day.</p></speech>

There is progress there too.  I am very encouraged.  There is a series of outreach initiatives.  I killed some time yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon with some colleagues to see what is happening.  I have an interest, and they were happy to inform me of progress.</p><p>  There is a more active outward engagement on the economic side.  The Department now has a senior economist.  He relates to the broader interests of economists in the country.  There is an engagement by the co-ordinator of management issues in the Department.  There are now some short-term exchanges of students from universities around Ireland to get some exposure to the Department.  In the Minister's medium-term economic agenda, which admittedly is high level, there was an outward engagement.</p><p>  It is a very important point the Deputy makes.  I see some progress there but, as the Chairman had pointed out at the start, I have only been here a half a day or so to engage on that.  I feel there has been some progress.  The committee will want to hold them to account, if there is enough or if my advice has been wrong for them.</p></speech>

We stated there was a body of advice.  It is so easy to say this from now.  If, when I was the head of a department in Canada, we would get an auditor general report on something and people would pick up on one or two observations but they were not there when it happened, I would get my back up.  Saying it that bluntly, people who were there at the time were overwhelmed by a whole set of issues.</p><p>  But, objectively speaking, this report, which is not my advice but is the panel's advice, is very clear that although advice existed, it should have been better.  It should have been clearer.  It should have evolved over time to be more focused.  They should have looked at alternative ways to make that advice known, and it should have been written.  It should have been known in the Department that advice existed and there was a broader engagement for the whole Department in championing that advice.</p></speech>

It states: "These pressures were reflected in the political debate of the day where all political parties were eager to meet public expectations for more and better services."  My question is did Mr. Wright encounter any evidence that the then Government was being challenged on a sustained basis by the Opposition parties, for example, in Parliament?  Were those parties telling Government that it was not being cautious enough and more prudent fiscal management was required?  Did he find any evidence of that or was there a national political consensus?  What is Mr. Wright's view?</p></speech>

Honestly, that is how the political debate will have to mature going forward.  How it happens is really important.  I do not doubt it will happen but I have not seen it.  I have seen a lot of focus on fairness and if one is going to do this, one should try to ease it.  These are all important engagements.</p> <p>I think the most vital engagement is if we are going to do that how are we going to pay for it, or it is fine to do this rebalancing within the framework that is established, but how are we going to enhance a more balanced sustainable growth?  What are the things we can do together in that right?</p><p> It has been a tumultuous time and the members have made collectively some really important progress.  The next phase of this engagement is going to change a lot of what they are doing.  I really think that is what members should be focusing on.  I think there is so much work to do there.  Looking forward, where to from here and how do we maintain the cohesion of some really important processes like social partnership?  What I personally think is going to happen over the next few years is that one is going to establish some fiscal anchors in which the debate will take place.  That should be a focus of the Department of Finance and the fiscal council.  It helps channel the real debate about different ways of getting things done but in a framework that is sustainable. </p></speech>

So there was a collective view that things are working fine, we are moving forward and let us all share in this collective future.  There were few brakes put on and that is not typically what one would see in any country from that political debate unless somebody is putting out, saying, "Here's why we have to be cautious."  I think the onus is on Government, appropriately so at that time.</p></speech>

I do not see us being beyond that in Canada.</p><p>  I should not digress, but I digress a little bit.  When I was a student, economics was proudly the dismal science.  Political science was not even a science; it was kind of modern history of political processes, but political science is now a science and it has been led by activities in the US and Canadian politicians.  It is very easy to say, "What do people want?  I'm going to give more of it than my competitors here in this vote."  It is much harder to say, "Let's look forward.  What do you need going forward?  Here is my advice on how to lead your way through with some sacrifice for greater benefit."  That is full of risk in the modern political science.  The short answer is that one is going to have to get over this and get into a new world of it.</p></speech>

On banking policy and interaction between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, did he find any evidence of the Department of Finance raising concerns consistently with the Central Bank about unsustainable lending to one sector of the economy - construction and property - with the risks that were being built up?  Did he find any evidence of the Department of Finance giving those warnings to the Central Bank?</p></speech>

What I did not see was the integrated economic assessment.  One has monetary policy; one has fiscal policy.

I welcome him to the committee.  I have a couple of questions.  His report deals with the Department of Finance over a ten year period and he focused on three areas.  The terms of reference of this inquiry is to look at specific areas, particularly the nexus between property, banking and the State.  I wish to focus on that area, that his report covers.  He mentions and he has had a discussion with the committee on the verbalisation of advice to the Minister but the lack of written records.  Mr. Wright's view from his recommendation, and he might correct me if I am wrong, is that more written advice should be given, but the public should not be given access to that written advice for at least five years in relation to budgetary matters</p></speech>

However, the public should not have access to that advice despite the fact that Government or a Government in the future could override that advice, and therefore the consequences could be dire.</p></speech>

There are many outlets to safeguard the public interest the Deputy is raising.  If our auditor general in Canada, and I am sure Ireland's too, has the capacity to go through and make observations on where things could be improved and if advice is not taken, that is one of the things on which he will make observations.  What we have identified here is a paradox.  I believe the concern about access to information was probably an overreaction by the Department, in some good degree.  We say in here, and I believe, that it is really important to get more information out there.  In some areas, one should get policy options out there for the broader public.  That is something that should be developed.  My focus in particular was on whether clearer, more blunt advice would be given if it was protected.  It would.  The paradox is that if one is saying advice to the Minister should be made public, one will not see a lot publicised to the public.  The balance struck in Ireland's previous Freedom of Information Act allows advice to be protected if it is a matter that could affect markets, trading or international relationships.  I think there is a remit broad enough to be assured that if one pushes the button, even in bluntest terms, and if it were inconsistent with what the Government and Minister said, if it is a matter of national importance, and why we referred to Cabinet - I heard from an earlier secretary general that there was a renewed process of the macro-economic risk assessment, and budgetary reports to cabinet on a regular basis - it would be unreleasable, so that would deal with that concern.</p> <p>The vital issue for the committee to consider and to be assured of, and for the Minister for Finance to be assured of, is that there is no impediment to somebody pushing a red button and giving blunt advice when it is needed.</p></speech>

I put that forward in the report.  I will have private chats with my Ministers as well.  Every Deputy Minister or Secretary General will do that.  Is that enough?  No.  Important in that particular case is whether other senior officials in the Department know that happened.  The answer is "no".  There is more coherence needed on these things.</p></speech>

Was advice coming through the Department that was suppressed within the Department?  Does Mr. Wright know whether people on the ground floor were giving advice about the overheating of the construction sector, the potential for a property collapse, and that Department officials either excluded that advice or deleted it from statements, replies to parliamentary questions, speeches by Ministers and so on?</p></speech>

As these went up the chain in the Department of Finance, the suggestion was that those responses and the language were neutered and some language was deleted.  She was told to use the phrase "a soft landing" and so on.  When questioned by a national newspaper at the time, the Department of Finance responded that Mr. Wright was carrying out a report and he had access to all staff members in the Department of Finance.  Did Mr. Wright interview the person in question to whom I refer?</p></speech>

There were some ideas generated.  Parliamentary questions are usually a somewhat different stream than advice.  On something this important one would see a coherent piece of analysis that had the background and economic analysis and suggested further steps.  It would have engaged the entire system.  I did not see that nor did I see any evidence of repressing that from anyone I talked to in the Department.</p></speech>

If that view was, rather than getting proactive on engineering a landing, that we are going to hope for a soft landing, that is what his questions - even if they were not written - would have said.  Again, I know when people explored options to form our active engagement, I did not see a coherent process for that going forward and I did not see a body of written thought on alternative approaches.</p></speech>

As has been remarked earlier, it is quite brief.</p> <p>It is less than one page.</p><p> Mr Wright in his report states that as far back as 1999 the Department provided advice on the overheating of the construction sector.  He mentioned there were assessments of risks from the Irish housing bubble.  He went on to state that "the Government took limited action to moderate tax incentives for construction early in the decade and ... eventually in 2006 ...  However this action was not sustained".  What he did not include was the amount of property related construction tax incentives that were extended during that period early in that decade and in 2006.  Did he investigate that or examine that area?  The urban renewal scheme was extended twice over the period of the scheme, the living over the shop scheme was extended twice over the period of that scheme, the rural renewal scheme was extended twice up to 2006, there was also the park and ride scheme, the town renewal scheme and the student accommodation scheme, and the multistorey car park scheme was extended twice over the period of that scheme.  There were all supposed to conclude in either 2002 or 2004 and they were extended up to 2006 or 2008.</p></speech>

It was quite limited.  We saw that some of that advice was followed.  Some policies that should have been "grandfathered" or ended were not but to be honest, and I should be, I do not recall that deep level of detail from four years ago.</p></speech>

The purpose of this inquiry is in regard to that nexus.  With regard to those property related schemes, was there advice from the Department not to extend those schemes?  There were public statements from the Government that some were not going to be extended and that position was reversed.  Was sound solid advice given one way or another in regard to those extensions?</p></speech>

Was there a conflict between two divisions in regard to that?  He said that this came from other sectors of Government.  We know that is the Department of the Environment from previous reports, but he mentioned it also came from the banking sector.  Can he elaborate on which part of the banking sector was concerned with 100% mortgages?</p></speech>

There were some people in the Department who wanted to be actively supportive of some restraint on that and there were others who were not.  That debate did not see itself through and in the process of it the Office of the Financial Regulator announced it was comfortable with that with the result that it withered away.  I stated it was an opportunity lost.  I commend the Minister of State who raised this as an important issue and people in the banking sector who would have raised it as an important issue but, sadly, it was not pursued.</p></speech>

He called for a good deal of engagement with the private sector on various matters in his report.</p> <p>He indicates that there was a reluctance by the Department to second guess the Central Bank if advices were coming in and so on.  To what extent does Mr. Wright believe that the lack of  internal expertise within the Department on banking, with only 39 economists and so forth, allowed the bankers to have overdue influence over it when it came to banking regulation?</p></speech>

I would not say it led to this undue influence; it just meant people in the Department were not perhaps as fully engaged in that area as they should have been.  My evidence would say they were not.  It was not just that, however.  What I saw more surprised me was that there was not as active an engagement with the Financial Regulator as I would have expected on some key elements.  Going back to our focus on written advice, it is very hard to sign a piece of advice if one is not comfortable it is correct.  One needs to be sure one has the right people helping one prepare that advice.  I do not think there was the capacity for people in the Department to engage actively, so they did not do so.</p></speech>

I should not comment in detail on his report but I think he has the right tierage.  The banks should have done a lot more.  The evidence that they did not know what they were doing is pretty shocking.  The regulator should have known enough of where the issues of concern were.  The international system that tracks regulators should have done more, but they seem to have spent more time reviewing the Canadian financial regulatory oversight than the Irish one.  The Central Bank should have done more.  The Department of Finance did not have the ambition to engage as actively as it should have done, certainly as actively as I would have done in Canada.  I had an outstanding team in that sector.</p></speech>

Does he feel that how the euro is structured and how the ECB does its business in terms of deciding where interest rates need to be and focusing more on inflation rather than economic performance in member states is a flawed approach for a small, open economy like Ireland which makes up 1% of the eurozone?</p></speech>

It is a vast market, which is probably the most important upside for Ireland's economy.</p></speech>

On whether it is there today, I am very cautious about terms and terminology.  That is not the mandate of this analysis.  Ireland is focused on the right thing, namely an engagement with the European Union.  It will strengthen Ireland's capacity to gauge these risks.  There is scope for an active policy agenda that deals with potential overheating and issues like that.  That is what it has to be ready to do.  It will be a challenge to manage the expectations of what it can deliver within that framework.  It is the challenge of any monetary union.  It is a challenge in Canada for one region of our vast country which has very different bases.  Often the monetary policy for the country as a whole is very challenging for particular areas.  The management of that has to be considered.  I will not say it is not positive for Ireland.</p></speech>

At the beginning of his contribution he mentioned the cost of the banking crisis and the engagement between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  Given that the cost of the banking crisis ended up affecting the fiscal position of the State and, as we know, the day-to-day lives of Irish citizens, what is Mr. Wright's assessment of the ability of the Department Of Finance to engage with the Central Bank on a financial stability analysis or plan for dealing with a banking crisis prior to the crisis of the bank guarantee in 2008?  What conjoined elements existed between the two agencies in preparation for the crisis period and, in particular, before the bank guarantee?</p></speech>

I made some general observations about the engagement not being as strong as I would have expected, but I did not explore that process.  We have processes for that co-ordination in Canada which are much like that.  They are very well established where there is an engagement at deputy Minister or associate deputy Minister level.  There is also a working group level that really gets into the detail of what is happening.</p> <p>I did not see that secondary process at all.  There is a process there.  I think it has been renewed and is actually working practically now.</p></speech>

As we know - and separate to the banking crisis - when the economy crashed, there was a &euro;30 billion deficit.  That was a Department of Finance problem.  The Central Bank was responsible for monitoring what was happening in the banks.  The activities in which the latter were involved ultimately gave rise to another a crisis and the State was lumbered with a debt of &euro;64 billion as a result.  This means that, in financial terms, the extent of the problem for the State is approaching &euro;100 billion.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is on the board of the bank.  There was an engagement with the regulator which was not as fulsome as it should have been, in part because of the resourcing issues.  It is why we specifically recommend that the Department of Finance be legislatively obliged to report on the broadest possible macroeconomic risks, which include, perhaps, inappropriate policy and other fiscal risks.  I know the Department has been working on a broader, risk-based assessment of issues.  I agree that this was previously inadequate and we proposed some very specific things to strengthen it.</p></speech>

I have had two runs through the Department of Finance in Canada.  On the first occasion I was a director.  That was 30 years ago and old-fashioned management was involved then too.  If one had a problem, one threw people at it.  When I came in to brief the Minister at the weekend, I would be item No. 4 on a list of ten.  I would wait all day and be obliged to return the next day because our item was not reached.  There was not a modern human resource management model in place.  There were strong people but that really was not modern human resource management.</p><p>  When I returned to the Department 20 years later, there had been enormous progress.  I hope I left the institution in a slightly better position than it was in when I arrived.  Now it has a very modern management system that focuses on people and manages them properly in place.  There is a regular intake of bright people every year and there is a great interest in that work.  Every year - I advocated this to the Department here and it is following my advice - we would sit down, assess everyone on the staff and analyse whether we had identified the people who are on a fast track to success and those who are not getting it done, who require assistance or who should, perhaps, pursue another vocation.  We did all of that.</p></speech>

Actually, it is about leadership and it is also just management.  There is a management advisory committee that meets weekly, which does not involve all of the assistant secretaries, so not all of them know.  Key to modern management is communicating within and the internal communications were not adequate.  It is not that hard.  There is a full exchange of what is happening and why, and right after that management meeting the people go back and brief their teams.  When they come to the team they are connected to what is really happening on the ground and it is no more complicated than that.  What is more complicated is looking at having a five-year plan on human resource management, which is modern and should happen.  It is not rocket science.  Someone has been brought in and has been on board for three years now, I think, who is trying to work all that through.  The key is not the guru management stuff, the key is to have a secretary general who is going to stand up and say, "Okay, here is my commitment to making this a better place to work."  It is a vital tool.  If all of this expertise can be connected to the agenda of serving the Government, capacity will improve.</p></speech>

No, I have not seen any evidence of that.  I would have thought that, when decisions were being made coming out of other processes such as the social partnership or the programmes for Government, if there was a surprise to the upside, that was then spent.  I would hope - but I know it did not exist in writing - that there was a repeat of the advice that was given earlier and perhaps heightened concerns.  I did not see it.  It did not exist.</p></speech>

I would not expect that would be supported by the Department.</p><p>  Let me be clear on this because the Deputy is making a really important point.  There is an annex to the report about comments from international agencies and I think it is a very fair point, but the international agencies should have done a better job in prompting Ireland to be more sensitive to the financial market risks and the financial sector regulatory world.  It was not picked up, but there was a lot of concern expressed over that whole period by the OECD in particular, about an overheated economy and the need to be cautious.  That should have been fitted into those issues.</p></speech>

He notes, for example, that while the economy continued to expand after 2000, the dynamic changed with growth being less export-led and depending more on domestic factors.  From Mr. Wright's understanding, was this dynamic change an intentional change?</p></speech>

Members were here for the ride; I was on the other side of the pond.  There was a real sense of dynamism in this country about a great decade of growth, catching up with the rest of the European Union and, in early 2000, surpassing it in terms of income and every barometer there was.  The revenue kept coming in.  Was there a conscious change?  Probably not.  The early driver of change was enhanced competitiveness.  The second dynamic of change was low interest rates from the European Union, massive infrastructure spending by the Union and a focus on sharing the benefits that did not really exist at the time.  These factors overwhelmed the situation.  It was not just the construction sector that was expanding; the average rate of growth of spending was 11.8% over the ten-year period.  That is extraordinary.</p></speech>

It is not a warning if one does not make someone aware of it.

When we gave up our monetary independence, it should have meant a recognition within the Department of Finance that there would be an enhanced role for fiscal policy.  Did Mr. Wright come across any documentation preparing the Department for that context?</p></speech>

Did Mr. Wright come across any evidence of doubts in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.1070" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rob Wright" time="03:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2014121800039#SS01500"><p>No, I did not see anything on that specifically.  I think Professor Honohan made an observation in his report in this regard.  For a small, open economy like Ireland with a major trading partner like the UK, there was a particular context.  The capacity for an independent monetary policy to truly rein Ireland in as much as possible was more limited than in the case of some other major countries.  Ireland did not perhaps have that much to give up.  On the other hand, in joining economic and monetary union, Ireland did lose capacity and I am sure the Department of Finance focused on that.  As to whether people said to the Minister, "Here is how we need to enhance our co-ordination policy in light of this change", I did not see evidence of it.  That is the issue we flagged as recommending very clearly that the Department be mandated to have that overall macroeconomic view.</p></speech>

How do we manage this?</p></speech>

That is a regulated sector.  You have ways to manage the liquidity in your country, which are still important.  The Central Bank of Ireland and the regulator have an important role, in co-ordination with the Minister, and the trade-off is not that stark.  I think the point I was making was simply that it puts a great deal of onus on restraining spending ambitions and tax initiatives.  You have to do it in an overall macroeconomic framework.</p></speech>

Is that a good idea, given Mr. Wright's knowledge of it?  How is the Governor of the Bank of Canada appointed?</p></speech>

We have had very strong bank governors come up through the system in the Bank of Canada.  A former Deputy Minister of Finance, David Dodge, become Governor of the Bank of Canada.  My associate, a former Deputy Minister of Finance, Mark Carney, become Governor of the Bank of Canada and now he is Governor of the Bank of England.  Our experience has been that there is not a natural conduit through the Department of Finance.  Probably more than half of the governors in recent history have come from within the central bank, but it is something that is not an unhelpful experience in a Department of Finance.  However, it should not be a "crown princing", I would think.</p></speech>

I would not say I saw anything that supports that judgment.</p></speech>

I think on page 45, and in other places, he referred to the lack of certain expertise and he compared it to Canada and the Netherlands.  Was there an in-depth analysis of the recruitment practices of the Department?</p></speech>

I think there was some frustration at the timelines of that process.  I did not get into it in detail, other than urging the Department to be more proactive in the sorts of public service modernisation that were talked about.  I did talk about the Canadian model, where we do have an engagement annually to hire university graduates not just to an economic analysis unit, but to the whole policy needs of the department.  I advocated that because I thought particularly - it has been a very challenging environment - for an economist graduating from university in Ireland or anywhere, it would be an extraordinary opportunity to see some fascinating times and so, I think, that is something that, over the long-term, should be done every year.  You should hire some people.</p><p>  I do not have a lot more to say on the Government-wide staffing process other than certainly for promotions and even perhaps hiring from outside, it is hard to do in a period of severe restraints.  There was little intake for a year or two and they are now looking forward to doing more of it.  The real question is whether there is an appropriate dynamic for hiring throughout the public service that is a more modern approach and that deals with the performance issues.</p> <p>The Department has gone through a performance management process and identified areas already, and some people that needed some support, but if one went to the rank and file of the Department, people have said not enough has been done.  People feel that one must be more conscious of problems with performance.  They do not want to sit next to someone who is not doing as much work or working as effectively as they are, without any variation in their level of compensation.  That dynamic has started but I do not have the details in terms of the detailed Irish Government staffing process.</p></speech>

Senator Barrett referred to the movement from the Department of Finance across to the Central Bank.  There is a strongly held perception that in Ireland traditionally senior managers in the Department of Finance come from a very set background.  I know Mr. Wright was limited in terms of having only three months and there is only so much one can do in such time, but in terms of strengthening the capacity of the Department of Finance, there is more to the Department than just banking or even the construction sector.  Is it representative of the economy as a whole and is the perception that exists correct, that it might not be?</p></speech>

In the new dynamic, where there is a very clear focus on macroeconomic advice and management for the country, over time we will see a pool of people who are equipped for that position come from the economic advice stream.  That is not a bad thing.</p><p>  I myself am not a lifer in the Department of Finance in Canada.  I should say that I moved around.  I worked there for a couple of years and then I was in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Department and I worked for other Departments.  I think there is some value to every track.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Wright elaborate on what he meant by &ldquo;effective political messages&rdquo; as briefly as he can?</p></speech>

I forgot my vote.  Do I hear 90%?  I should not say that.  In Canada, at tax time people file their taxes not just to pay taxes but to receive important tax credits for lower income families and people with ability needs.  More than half of Canadians do not pay income taxes, net of those benefits.  This is a good thing.  I do not say that getting people off that roll is a bad thing but one needs to be fair and efficient.  The tax system can be a very important tool for growth.</p><p>  What we have done in Canada is &ndash; as I mentioned earlier we have stopped doing it &ndash; we have looked at removing barriers to growth by barriers to entry.  We have made it easier for people on lower income to get off welfare and support systems onto the payroll without paying a huge tax.  There are barriers to work at the lower levels.  We have looked at incentivising people at the higher levels to get ahead in life without hitting a big wall of large tax increases.  Reform of the tax system was one of the things we recommended and some steps have been taken.  I do not know what they are in terms of removing some special benefits, and going forward looking at the tax regime as an instrument for growth gives one some options.  I am eating up Deputy Phelan&rsquo;s time.  I am enjoying it very much.</p></speech>

One should fit into a broader view of the tax system that says yes it is fair but does one have a higher priority in terms of creating jobs for the future than just that benchmark?  I believe one should have.  I mean it respectfully for that process, but one can engage on how to do that.</p></speech>

It is there for the Irish Government to use and to take stock of how it is working and how it can be improved.  It is a great thing to even look at.  However, all of that is going forward.  The Senator asked if the inquiry is going to find out more than what Mr. Nyberg said.  I do not know what he said.

Mr. Nyberg stated yesterday that people who give advice give advice and that those who make decisions make decisions.  Would it have made any difference if suitably qualified people had been in place in the Department of Finance and had given alternative advice to those who made the decisions?  Is it not the case that regardless of whether they were qualified, those people would have been ignored?</p></speech>

It could and should make a difference.  Given that reasonable advice was ignored, the Senator is also asking whether good advice would also have been ignored.  It could have been.  The dynamic of this set of advice is that there should be a broader engagement with people, that there should be more disciplined advice on offer and there are ways, through that outer engagement, for there to be wider interest in the risks.  The vast majority of Ministers I have met look for proper advice on which to make decisions that will be good for their countries.  They need to be well served in order to make informed decisions.  I cannot provide an answer in respect of one smoking gun.</p></speech>

Is he saying that the pro-cyclical fiscal policy was more responsible for the crash than the property bubble and all that went with it?  The report is also very critical of the decision to remove the lowest paid workers - who are really on poverty wages - from the tax net and of Government spending.  According to EUROSTAT, in the period leading up to the crash, Government spending in Ireland, as a percentage of GDP, was the second lowest in the entire EU.  What else would young nurses, teachers and public servants - many of whom are on low or middle incomes - have done but seek wage increases when their accommodation costs were going through the roof?  It was a case of their seeking wage increases or living in tents.  However, Mr. Wright, in his report, appears to be very critical of what happened in this regard.</p></speech>

I am just saying that this should not be the only dynamic in terms of what one stands for, particularly on a go-forward basis.  Half of Canadians do not pay taxes and I do not think all Irish people should pay taxes.</p> <p>That is fine, and if I sounded too strident on it, I meant no offence.  I think in this country, you really do have an outstanding social engagement, as Canadians do, so I do not think we are that far apart as countries.  In fact, I just made some comments on removing barriers to entry into the workforce, which is something that is extremely important in Canada and we made some great strides on that when I was in government.</p></speech>

As I said at the outset, I think in terms of what advice you would expect, the bread and butter of a Department of Finance, is fiscal policy.  It also includes the overspent construction so it is actually included in that dynamic as well.  It is not picking winners.  I think it is the right weighting and I think the report deals appropriately with both of them.</p></speech>

There was the other issue with Mr. Nyberg yesterday regarding the banks.  I suppose the question Deputy Higgins is asking, and I think it is the critical one to put to you this morning, Mr. Wright, is that there was a structural deficit in the tax base of this country when the economy crashed, besides the bank debt that was there.  That was &euro;60 billion, as a lump sum one could say, but there is a &euro;30 billion deficit, which is on a roll-over year after year.  It is not that one is worse than the other, as both are bad, but in terms of trying to correct something, which do you see as the more difficult?  Which do you see as the more problematic over a period of time, a legacy banking debt or a major structural hole in one's finances?</p></speech>

I think they are all connected in what you have to dig yourself through.  I think you have got the right the processes and ways to minimise the legacy burden of the bank decision and you have got the right people focused on that.  On the structural deficit, you have got a medium-term plan that you are going to deal with.</p><p>  I mentioned this point - I should be more emphatic, perhaps - but I think you should look at everything you can to enhance the growth prospects of the country.  It is not just a question of reallocating spending in the community at large but it is a question of how you can allocate to enhance your capacity for balanced growth beyond the construction sector and see yourself through on that.  That is the key to the growth.</p></speech>

That was basically disallowed for the years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.  Then in the 2002 budget and the Finance Act 2002, it was reintroduced at 100%.  That obviously fuelled a further bubble, and it just so happened to coincide with an election year.  Did you get the opportunity to look at what exactly filled that wedge?

Clearly, that is the critical element.  His report states that what was brought by the officials was relatively prudent and then every year, apart from 2003, over a ten-year period, the budget was far in excess of what was being proposed by officials.  Looking over that ten year period, does Mr. Wright believe the way the economy was being run was based around electoral cycles as distinct from economic prudent cycles?</p></speech>

Frankly, I think there was a broader concern that was not just driven by fear.  There are ways to do business, meet the real interests of freedom of information and yet give clear, strong advice to the Minister, and that was not done.  A number of people raised that with me, I was preoccupied by it and I have looked at in detail since then.  I would say, and have said to the Secretary General, that he should be sure there is a process that meets the needs of the law and lets somebody push the right button if there is a problem, or go back to Parliament.</p></speech>

The crisis a few years ago was a combination of things which I do not think will repeat itself here.  The real test will be when the economy is getting stronger and there is pressure on key sectors, whether fiscal policy is used to restrain those expectations and, when a surplus appears, whether there is agreement that it should be most appropriately dedicated to paying down this extraordinary debt that has been raised rather than adding to the fuel.  That would be the test.</p></speech>

Politicians are part of the solution and it is not an easy solution.  Based on the classic demands from their constituencies, it has to be put in a context where people understand what they are striving for and the values of it.  Interest has fallen from 14% to 2.8% on outstanding debt, unemployment has dropped by four percentage points, and there is a vision for the future that is going to sustain growth long enough for Irish families to settle and not worry about looking abroad for jobs - those are really powerful points.</p></speech>

The dry issues are far less interesting - I do not think we will see the same crowd as we saw yesterday from the press - but they are vitally important----</p></speech>

In my opinion there are a few issues in the future and one is the medium-term agenda.  The Ministers identified a couple of key instruments and there are others that the committee should note.</p><p>  I refer to a model to consider.  I had the good fortune to be the high commissioner to New Zealand for two and a half years.  I have not been back in 20 years but after their crisis they were very bloody-minded in terms of the process of dealing with policy and getting a very effective streamlined tax system and other systems that yield efficiencies in a small open economy.  The Ministers hooked on to the financing instruments for small and medium enterprises.  Anything that expands on removing barriers to entry for those on lower income to get higher paying jobs and training, these are all investments in the future.  On fiscal management I imagine when Ireland gets its fiscal council, some of the things it will be engaged in will be some fiscal anchors over the short and medium term - which for Ireland are perhaps quite different - and more issues that Ireland can manage to ensure it meets the broader objectives of the European Union.  If there was a common view in this Parliament that given the framework going forward and the obligations of the country, should the programme for Government identify or be committed to reallocating to meet any additional spend or should it be more focused on medium term instruments that enhance the economic prospects enough to pay for some of these initiatives?  That would be a big issue politically for the political parties to consider.  I just throw it out there.  I do not think there are many Secretaries General in the Irish system that would do that.</p><p>  On the focus on the limited options if there is a surprise to the upside and the committee's engagement on what would the Minister for Finance want from his colleagues in government, and what are the real limits on the spend if there is something to the upside, I would say, medium-term economic agenda, what are the fiscal parameters over the short term and how to be very specific in terms of the programme for Government, whether it is self-financing or some commitment to the fiscal necessities in that framework.  Maybe there is some work the committee should do on the right and most constructive re-engagement on the social partnership to ask what are we going to do together and to have a very open dialogue about not just the limits of what we can do but the potential of what we can do in this new world.  It is a question of building balanced growth for the future and ensuring a broad participation in that growth.</p></speech>

Patients are being harmed.  If one gets into a taxi, one expects the driver to have passed a driving test, and to hold a licence.  Yet a patient undergoing cosmetic surgery may be operated upon by a doctor with no professional surgical qualifications.</p><p>  Perhaps I should begin by clarifying what is surgery and what is non-surgery.  Surgery means operations, such as breast implants, tummy tucks or liposuction.  Non-surgery usually means injection treatment, such as botox, fillers and laser treatments.  Done properly, these treatments can give a very high quality of satisfaction to the patient and improvement in their quality of life.  These treatments are offered by a wide variety of practitioners - not just surgeons and doctors, but also nurses, beauty therapists and possibly others - but there is no register of practitioners, there is no licence and standards vary hugely.  A vast number of treatments are being offered, many without any scientific proof that they work.  Non-surgical and non-invasive does not mean safe.  Many of these treatments can and do cause harm.</p><p>  We have been asked to give some examples.  Groupon has had an online discount deal offering "laser removal" of moles in a beauty salon.  There was no mention of medical assessment and lasering of moles could be potentially fatal if a melanoma, a type of skin cancer, were inadvertently removed. The normal practice is that any mole that is removed should be analysed in a laboratory, but if one removes or destroys a mole by laser, there is nothing to analyse.  Other laser treatments are being offered to patients at huge cost, with no proof that they work.  They are being offered to under-age patients.  Recently a 15 year old was offered something at the cost of &euro;850, despite being under the age of consent.  Plastic surgeons are seeing patients who have had treatments in beauty salons.  I have had two patients in recent months who have had skin cancers treated in beauty salons.  Having said that, there are some excellent beauty therapists who pick up on things and send people to their GP or other practitioners.</p><p>  We are concerned that the incidence of purchasing prescription medication online for use on the purchaser or on others is rising.  We are also concerned that doctors with no postgraduate surgical qualifications and only a basic medical degree are operating on patients.  We are also concerned about misleading and false advertising.  There are many examples of this, including the use of unrealistic models in ads - these are not patients who have had any surgery - photos that are airbrushed, stock photos being used as examples of a practitioner's own practice, prices stated as "from" when there is no realistic expectation of that price being offered, and so on.  We are also concerned about doctors who describe themselves as "qualified surgeons" or "leading experts".</p> <p>In one specific case, a doctor who is described as a qualified surgeon is not on any specialist register as a surgeon and appears on a general register only in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p><p> The use of the terms "cosmetic doctor" and "cosmetic surgeon" is also a matter of concern as these are unregulated terms that are not recognised by the Medical Council.  There is no syllabus, training or examinations in place for persons who describe themselves as cosmetic doctors or surgeons.</p><p> The use of the term "fully registered" is misleading.  Practitioners often describe themselves as being fully registered with the Medical Council to suggest that they are specialists.  Every doctor practising in Ireland must be fully registered.  The issue is one of breaking down the register to determine whether he or she is a trainee doctor, doctor on the general register or specialist.</p><p> Many other countries have legislated in this area.  The PIP implant case in France, which affected approximately 100,000 women, caused a major public outcry about the lack of regulation in this area.  France and Denmark subsequently introduced legislation to ensure surgery is carried out only by those who are trained to do so.  Consumer groups have called for a ban on cosmetic surgery advertising on the basis that it is often misleading.  Legislation proposed in the United Kingdom includes measures to ban such advertising and provide for a register of practitioners.</p><p> Safety is a key concern of the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons and could be addressed in the areas of patients, practitioners, procedures and premises.  The patient should be a good candidate, be informed and have realistic expectations.  The practitioner must be properly trained.  Surgeons, for example, must be trained and possess the appropriate credentials, and non-surgical practitioners must be trained and possess credentials for the level at which they work.  The procedures should be appropriate for the patient and of proven effectiveness.  The premises should be an accredited and safe venue, with properly trained staff and provision for emergency treatment should such be necessary.</p><p> The Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons calls for the implementation of a number of solutions, which are detailed in the document we have circulated.  Some or all of the European standard developed and passed this year should be implemented in legislation.  The standard is currently voluntary and will only become mandatory if it is implemented in legislation.  Some countries have already done so.  A regulatory or umbrella body should be established to oversee and co-ordinate the activities of bodies such as the Medical Council, the Irish Medicines Board, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  These are all very good organisations but they act in isolation and without an overarching body to co-ordinate their activities in this area.</p><p> A register of practitioners should be established for those working in this field.  The register should contain divisions indicating the level at which each practitioner operates, for example, whether he or she is a therapist, nurse, dentist, specialist doctor, etc.  Members of the public must have confidence that surgery will be carried out by a surgeon who is trained to perform the procedures in question.  In addition, procedures must be assessed and medical devices should be only FDA or CE approved.  Consideration should also be given to introducing a national breast implant registry.  Many of those affected in the PIP case still find it difficult to determine if they had PIP implants.</p><p> Premises should be fit for purpose and accredited and systems should be in place to look after patients during surgery and afterwards, particularly in the event of an emergency.  Cooling off periods should be recommended and good data protection measures followed.  It should be mandatory to follow what would be considered normal guidelines.</p><p> We are aware that the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland is reviewing its guidelines for medical advertising.  This review presents an opportunity to examine specifically cosmetic surgery advertising, as has been done in other countries.  It is necessary to strike a balance between providing information and avoiding manipulation of those who are vulnerable.  The experience of other European Union countries should be considered, for example, steps to prohibit practices such as advertising to those aged under 18 years, placing advertisements in public places, including radio and television, and using incentives such as two-for-one deals or discounts where purchases are made before a certain date.  These practices have been shown not to be in the best interests of patients.</p><p> While I have tried to keep the presentation brief, I will be pleased to provide details of cases, without naming individuals, involving the types of treatments about which we are concerned.</p></speech>

The ICO is the training and professional body for eye doctors in Ireland.  One of our key concerns is to ensure that members of the public are educated about and aware of good eye care practices.</p><p>  To reiterate Mrs. O'Donnell's point, the decision to have a medical or surgical procedure can have a profound impact on the health and well-being of patients and their families.  While there is little doubt that a medical or cosmetic procedure can be positive for patients when undertaken by trained specialists with appropriate aftercare, it is essential that patients receive balanced information.  Advertising is a legitimate and important source of information for members of the public and can help to inform patients of services and treatment options.  However, important questions arise in this regard.  For example, given the potential significance of the decisions involved, is regulation in the area of direct advertising to patients required to ensure they receive unbiased information?</p><p>  Providers use advertising and marketing to compete for consumers.  While advertising can play a positive role, it can also have a negative effect, particularly if it trivialises the risks of procedures, targets vulnerable consumers or misleads by portraying an outcome that may not be attainable for all.  For some people, cost is more likely to influence their decision than the qualifications of the person doing the procedure and the quality of care he or she provides.  Trivialising surgery to the point that the decision to proceed is solely based on cost is not compatible with the prioritising of patient safety and quality outcomes.</p><p>  Ireland does not have specific legislation in place governing direct-to-patient advertising.  There are no requirements that advertisements or marketing material provide any information on the health risks of procedures.  Both surgical and non-surgical interventions can have a serious impact on an individual&rsquo;s health and well-being, yet questionable advertising trivialises the procedures and presents them as a desirable commodity.</p><p>  As cost is the key deciding factor for some people choosing a procedure or provider, financial inducements are likely to have an impact on purchasing behaviour.  Discounts for procedures or offering procedures as competition prizes may impair an individual's ability to give proper thought to what is being offered.  Time-limited deals, which offer discounts within a certain timeframe, allow little or no opportunity for proper consideration of the risks involved.</p><p>  The current regulatory system needs to be updated to provide clearer rules through which to hold advertisers to account and which reflect the changing market, particularly the significant growth in non-surgical procedures and increasing use of digital marketing.  Standards must ensure that advertising is conducted in a socially responsible manner.  Advertising and marketing practices should not trivialise the seriousness of procedures or encourage people to undergo them hastily.  Any claims must be based on high-quality evidence and should not raise unrealistic expectations.</p><p>  The Irish College of Ophthalmologists proposes that statutory restrictions be imposed on the advertising of medical and surgical procedures.  The advertising regulations which apply to solicitors are an appropriate framework and one that should be considered.</p></speech>

The written submissions contain an extensive expos&eacute; - that is the appropriate description - of the issues and areas the witnesses have addressed.  It would be appropriate to refer both of the documents on unregistered practitioners of cosmetic surgery and the document prepared by the Irish College of Ophthalmologists directly to the Minister for Health.  It is important that the substantial detail provided in these documents should not be parked at this point for the joint committee to edit before submission.  My first proposition is that they be submitted urgently and in their entirety.</p><p>  Some time ago, several of the so-called PIP women appeared before the joint committee.  They will not take offence at my use of that term to describe them as it is one they themselves have used.</p> <p>The reason I am particularly anxious that both submissions be forwarded to the Minister and his Department is because I do not want to see another group of women being exploited in this way or being placed in the most dangerous of situations.  That is not an exaggeration.  The examples cited by Mrs O'Donnell in her submission are horrendous.  I can understand the pressures that can apply and how people can feel compelled to take particular actions, but they are doing so without any proper advice of the possible consequences and, what is worse, are placing themselves in the hands of people who are not qualified to do what they suggest they can do.  That laser treatment of skin cancer is being undertaken by beauty therapists with no medical or nursing training is horrendous.  It is also crazy that qualified doctors are carrying out particular procedures despite their having no surgical qualification.</p><p> On the breast implant issue, I am aware, the representatives of PIP having appeared before this committee, that there is no breast implant registry in Ireland, which is a serious deficiency.  One would think, given the rounded assessment of all that happened in this area, that the lessons would have been learned.  What happened occurred not only because the implants used were deficient but also because there were serious deficiencies in the provider sector in this country, even to the point that they could close their doors and walk away, leaving people high and dry, and they have done so.  That this period of time has elapsed and we still do not have a registry or any signalled intent of the imposition of such restriction is a serious matter.</p><p> I have no specific questions for the delegates as this is not a question issue.  What the organisations have done is, once again, alerted this committee to a situation that should not maintain in Ireland today.  Women are the target.  It is unacceptable that despite this issue having been addressed, although I acknowledge not in the same detailed and focused way, the problem areas continue.  As I said, the committee should forward both submissions to the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and urge that he and his Department take appropriate action and engage with the HSE post haste.</p></speech>

It is important that people understand exactly what it is that plastic surgeons do.  There is a tendency based on popular literature to trivialise facelifts and cosmesis etc..  Plastic surgeons are also the doctors who deal with the substantial chunk, if not the majority, of serious skin cancer cases, who play a critical role in managing breast cancer and who do unbelievably heroic work dealing with people with severe and life-threatening burns.  All of my colleagues here who are involved in plastic surgery will have had the experience of dealing with people who have suffered horrific burns and managing them through severe illnesses.  Despite their youth, these are people who over the past ten or 15 years will have seen extraordinary improvements in the outcomes for patients with terrible injuries.  The issue of who plastic surgeons are is very important in this country.</p><p>  I am sure some of my colleagues will raise their eyes to heaven when I ask the following question because it is one I ask of every medical specialty group that appears before the committee.  What is the number of plastic surgeons per head of population in Ireland?  How do we compare in this regard with the UK and, in general, to continental Europe and North America?  The need for regulation in this area is striking.  There are few areas in medicine in respect of which there are direct appeals made over the heads of general practitioners by alleged specialists in non-professional literature to encourage people to come for treatments which range from the unproven to the dangerous to the inappropriately applied.  There is a problem here.  To put this in context, and I obviously have a particular axe to grind because of my interest in cancer, particularly melanoma, we have a melanoma emergency in this country that people are not twigging.  The incidence of potentially fatal melanoma in this country has approximately tripled over a 14-year period.  Dr. Ormond may correct me if I am wrong but I believe the figures in this regard are 400 in 1998 to 800 in 2008 to approximately 1,200 in 2012.  This is a uniquely Irish problem because as we are designed by providence to be under grey misty skies we do not have the same natural protection that other ethnic groups have against the sun, yet for various cultural reasons we very unwisely expose ourselves to the sun.  It is critically important that we get the panoply of issues around dermatology and plastic surgery correct.  We need more dermatologists to ensure quicker access by GPs in terms of referral of patients who have a spot which potentially could be serious or life threatening.  We do not have this right now.  While there has been an improvement in terms of rapid access, we still have far too few people in these areas.</p><p>  For several months last year there was no dermatologist in the sunny south east of Ireland.  I am not suggesting there was not one in Dunmore East, Dungarvan or Enniscorthy, rather that there was no dermatologist in the whole of the south east, which is emblematic perhaps of a more profound problem in terms of how health care in this country is planned.  I warmly welcome the attendance of my colleagues at this meeting.  I am not, in terms of my remarks, being disrespectful of the critical role of the ophthalmologists in this area.  That is another day's work.  I believe there is also a need to invest in ophthalmic and ophthalmological services in this country.  I ask that my colleagues take the issue under discussion today very seriously.</p><p>  I would welcome if Mrs O'Donnell could when replying say if the European standard has been translated into law in any country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.1158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121800005#E00300"><p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.  In August 2013, when drafting legislation requiring that it be compulsory that all medical practitioners have insurance, I met the secretary of the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons.  Some of the stories the secretary told me were quite frightening, including how the association regularly has to pick up the pieces when people come to its members to have rectified cosmetic surgery that was carried out in Ireland by a person from abroad who was not qualified and had left the country.  Since that meeting I have published the Private Members' Bill requiring that it be compulsory for all medical practitioners to have insurance.  A person wishing to drive a car must have insurance.  As a solicitor, before practising, I am required to have insurance, yet medical practitioners are not required to have insurance.  I know that the Government recently signed off on a new Bill in this area.</p><p>  I would like to hear from the delegates if they believe making it compulsory for all medical practitioners to have insurance will solve some of the problems in this area.  I accept it will not resolve all of the problems but would it be of help in addressing this issue?  Are the delegates satisfied that the penalties that can be imposed where a person does not comply with current legislation are adequate?  Have the delegates examined the proposed legislation to make it compulsory that every person providing medical care has insurance and, if so, is there in their view anything further that can be done to improve it?</p> <p> The second issue to which I wish to refer falls slightly outside our guests' area of expertise.  One of the matters that has come to my attention in recent months relates to the number of people who are engaged in providing services which are beyond their levels of competence.  It appears that everyone is buying scanning machines.  In that context, I understand the insurance currently offered to general practitioners does not cover the use of such machines.  I heard an entertaining story recently about a person who had a pacemaker fitted and who had attended a medical practitioner's practice for a routine check-up.  During the check-up the medical practitioner in question decided to scan the pacemaker.  I do not know what was the point of doing so.  It is odd - this is not just happening in the area of cosmetic surgery - that people are offering certain additional services.  How can we ensure that, even though individuals may be qualified and competent in providing particular services, they cannot just automatically expand the range of services they offer without first undergoing the necessary training and that they have adequate insurance cover in the event that any service they provide proves inadequate?</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that our guests' presentations were very clear and that they should be forwarded, unedited, to the Minister and his Department.  I become very concerned when people refer to Groupon offers and patient safety issues.  Our guests have clearly indicated that if a mole is removed by means of laser treatment in a beauty salon, it cannot be checked there to see if it is cancerous.  </p><p>  I am also concerned about advertising.  I did a quick search on Google in respect of plastic or reconstructive surgery and discovered that it was all focused on beauty.  Senator John Crown correctly highlighted the importance of reconstructive surgery in particular instances.  However, I am concerned by the focus on beauty and the two-for-one offers to which Ms Kelly referred.  Even having listened to our guests' presentations, I would not be able to distinguish which of the various websites are legitimate and which are not.  This is another major cause of concern, as is the liberal use of the terms "our specialists" or "our consultants" on the websites in question.  I agree, therefore, that there is a need for regulation.</p><p>  I again thank our guests for bringing this matter to our attention.  It is unusual that members do not have further questions to ask, but this is because our guests have outlined the position so well for us.</p></speech>

I do not know which one of them was on my local radio station this morning, but I heard it stated that, after being involved in his practice for one year, he could call himself a surgeon.  That is a scary thought, particularly as such a doctor does not have to have his name included in the list of specialists.  What type of insurance is required for someone to open a cosmetic surgery clinic?  Has anyone been found guilty of malpractice in this country in recent times?  I refer to therapists, nurses, dentists and doctors in this regard.  </p><p>  How many breast implant procedures are carried out in this country each year?  Are complaints made and, if so, to whom are they made?  If a particular procedure is botched, is there anywhere to which the person involved can go for emergency surgery?  </p><p>  I am really concerned about the fitting of gastric bands which people seem to think can provide a quick fix in dealing with weight issues.  They are high-risk devices which could result in people dying.  Are many such operations carried out in Ireland?</p><p>  I accept that many of the procedures under discussion relate to the lifestyle choices people make.  For example, there are many individuals who may wish to have cosmetic surgery performed on their eyes, forehead, chin, nose, etc.  However, the stories one hears about such procedures are frightening and we must alert people to what is happening.  The sooner we get things up and running the better.</p></speech>

It is sometimes difficult to pose appropriate questions.  Every day of the week people are bombarded with images and advertisements via television, radio and the Internet.  Regardless of whether we like it, this has become our reality.  I recently met a lady who was over 90 years of age.  I asked her why she had such lovely skin and she informed me that she used a drop of rainwater and Oil of Olay on it each day and that she ate good food.  If that is an advertisement, we should print copies of it.  I have young daughters and image is very important to them.  They watch many what I would term "mad" shows on television - I will not name them because I do not wish to give them free advertising - and they are all about image, clothing, make-up and looks.  I recently watched a film on television with two of my daughters and discovered that a person whom I had always thought was a very attractive young actress had become a different woman.  When I said her name, my daughters informed me that I was wrong, but it turned out that I was correct.  The botched job done on this woman's face and lips is absolutely appalling and she looks like a different person.  She has been a movie icon for many young people for the past 20 years.</p><p>  Matters become very difficult for young people when they are bombarded with the images and advertisements to which I refer.  One of my daughters recently completed a course on cosmetics at the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.  She thought that she would immediately break into films as a make-up artist, but the reality has hit home that this is not going to happen.  She has a temporary job at a make-up counter in a particular store.  I asked her in recent days whether this was what she wanted to do for the remainder of her life.  She informed me that it was but that she wanted to do it right.  Even though young people are bombarded with advertising images, they are still very clever when it comes to what they want to do and how they want to do it.  When we were talking, my daughter came to the realisation that so many people had cosmetic surgery which they either did not need or which - if it was necessary - was a complete failure.</p><p>  I absolutely agree with what Senator John Crown said about reconstructive surgery.  A young man I have come to know very well in recent years contracted very bad cancer of the face and the wonderful job done by doctors to allow him to live his life from day to day is amazing.</p><p>  Ms Kelly referred to buy-one-get-one-free offers.  People can go into their local euro shops or pharmacies and try on non-prescription spectacles.  When they discover they can read the little card on the stand in front of them, they suddenly become eye experts.  How can pharmacists who operate legitimate businesses allow such stands to be placed on their premises?  The people who buy such glasses are deciding for themselves whether they are short sighted or far sighted.  I do not know whether it is to such matters that Ms Kelly is referring, but I have a real issue with this behaviour.  I know many young people who wear glasses for image purposes.  There is nothing wrong with their eyes and they buy glasses simply because they think they look great wearing them.  Will Ms Kelly indicate whether this is the type of thing to which she is referring?</p></speech>

I read the material provided last night and, to be honest, came across things which would never have previously come to mind.  If one were to walk into one of these surgeries or beauty salons and see certificates on the wall, which indicate the relevant individual is fully registered with the Irish Medical Council, etc., rightly or wrongly, one would presume that the person in question was qualified to do the job one wanted him or her to do.</p> <p>They have highlighted everything in great detail.  The one that came to mind was moles being zapped without any analysis being done on them, with a knock-on effect further down the road in terms of skin cancer.  One presumes, if one goes to a surgeon to have cosmetic surgery performed, that one is going to a qualified surgeon, not a medical doctor who is not a surgeon.  Rightly or wrongly, I would have presumed that the people in question were qualified and I am sure many in the general population think the same and fail to take on board the bad practices and consequences waiting for them down the road.</p><p> What happens with complaints and where surgery goes wrong if we do not have databases and records?  How are these things followed up?  Have there been deaths attributable to bad practice?  What happens in that instance?  Is there an age of consent?  Can young children undergo this surgery and are there consequences in that regard?  I am interested in our guests' opinions on these issues.  I thank them, as I have learned a great deal from their comprehensive presentations.</p></speech>

Coming from south Tipperary, I am very aware of the inadequate service in the south east, particularly south Tipperary, which has always been less than adequately served by way of an outreach service from what is now Waterford University Hospital.  Does Dr. Ormond have any comment to make on developments in the last while in the south east in dermatology services?</p><p>  Have there been consultations with our guests in the context of the new Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland guidelines?  Is there a need for the joint committee to consult and make recommendations to the authority in this area?</p></speech>

Their use was confined to commercial clinics and the biggest user has gone out of business.  I have seen patients with this problem find their way to me.  I have other patients who do not know what implants they received, only that they were operated on in that clinic.  It is a big concern and a registry would have been useful in tracking down the type of implant used in these cases.  The Australians have set up a database which they are willing to share with other countries; therefore, there is a model offered free of charge which is something that could be looked into here.</p><p>  Two members asked about deaths.  A women died in Dublin in 2007 after gastric banding surgery.  That was despite her GP having recommended that she not undergo the procedure owing to other health problems.  We do not know if there have been other deaths; that one was highly publicised.  As there are no statistics, we cannot tell the joint committee how many breast implants are provided in the country.  There is no registry and no database indicating the amount of cosmetic surgeries or other procedures undertaken.  The evidence from other countries is that the number of non-surgical cases is rising massively and that such procedures are being performed across the board by all sorts of practitioner.  It is correct to say services are being provided beyond the competence of the people providing them.  People can set up with any kind of machine or device without restriction.  That is where a register of practitioners would help to clarify matters, as one would know if one was seeing a beauty therapist or a plastic surgeon trained to treat X, Y or Z condition.  An ophthalmologist should not be providing breast implants but performing eye surgery.  This has been done in other countries.  In France and Denmark legislation has been enacted to identify the procedures that can be undertaken by each category of practitioner.</p></speech>

Often they will pick up on something and send a person to his or her GP.  There is a European standard and code of practice for beauty therapy, but it is one of these grey areas.  If we look at whether something is medical or consumer-led, somebody mentioned lifestyle choices.  I agree.  If somebody is seeking medical treatment, a doctor is obliged to treat him or her in his or her best interests.  Therefore, one cannot sell the person the thing that is most expensive.  One treats the patient in his or her best interests.  If someone comes for a lifestyle choice as a consumer, the gates are open.  That is the problem.  The more one can sell, the more money one can make.  There is a blurring between what is medical and what is consumer-led and, with a little thought, people could declare themselves to be one or the other.  Patients come to me saying they had conducted all their research and were surprised that X, Y or Z happened.  One is looking at them and thinking the research just involved looking at the biggest and glossiest website.  It is very difficult for someone who does not understand the nuances of the qualifications of practitioners to make a clear decision.</p></speech>

Certainly, we have one of the lowest rates of dermatologists in Europe and probably in the developed world.  That is an ongoing problem and many European countries are trying to train sufficient dermatologists quickly enough to meet the growing demand, in particular to treat skin cancer, given our genetic skin types.</p><p>  With regard to dermatology services in Waterford, there was an unfortunate and long-term problem where an unsupported single dermatologist managed a huge population of over 250,000 people and eventually I suppose broke under the pressure of trying to cope with the potential risk to patients.  The only way he could be taken seriously was to resign which, unfortunately, he did.  A second dermatologist who was appointed at the time is on maternity leave.  There was no dermatology service in Waterford.  The patients have since been taken up by spreading them throughout the functioning departments in Cork and St. James's, Tallaght and Vincent's hospitals.  However, these are departments that are already understaffed.</p></speech>

It is unclear whether beauty therapies such as fillers, injections and laser treatments come under medical treatment or a consumer purchase.  Our association has a guideline that 18 should be the age of consent for somebody considering breast implants and most of us would be slow to consider it for a patient aged 18.  In my practice, if somebody aged 18 or 20 comes in, he or she would usually bring a parent, more for advice rather than consent, and one tries to encourage this.  I have had patients who have decided to have implants removed.  One young woman said she went to a hotel where a clinic was doing a promotion with her friend who wanted implants.  She ended up having implants too because she felt she was getting a good deal.</p></speech>

Can somebody tell me what a facelift is?  It is to do with stressing one's skin.  Does the skin get all dry and wrinkly?  How long does a facelift last?  Hip replacements last only a certain number of years and one is allowed only so many hips.  Is one allowed only a limited number of facelifts?</p></speech>

One does not need qualifications to make a cut on somebody's skin.</p></speech>

Earlier, the Deputy asked to whom patients complain.  A patient who has a complaint about any doctor takes it to the Irish Medical Council, IMC.  Previously, the fly-in-fly-out doctors - they fly in to do an operation and fly out again - did not have to be registered with the IMC.  Although they are now registered with the IMC, in our experience they do not always come back to address complaints.</p></speech>

For example, in St. James's Hospital we have treated people who have had a tummy tuck operation after which the skin has opened up and broken down.

Has this been considered?  There is no point in bringing forward legislation if somebody can ignore it and continue to provide a service without adequate insurance.  What does the standard insurance provided to GP practices cover?  Does it cover cosmetic surgery and scanning?  The public needs to know.  The standard GP has a comprehensive policy for a GP but there are limits to what it will cover.  If one has car insurance, one is not covered to drive an articulated lorry; likewise, a GP policy covers a doctor for general practice only.  This issue must be clarified because people seem to be happy to accept the service being offered without fully understanding that the person offering it does not have adequate insurance.</p></speech>

Every member of the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons, IAPS, has personal professional indemnity insurance.  If a commercial clinic has doctors, nurses or therapists, I do not know whether those people have professional indemnity in addition to the enterprise insurance.  If I were to laser a patient to erase red veins or brown marks, it would come under my professional indemnity as a plastic surgeon, which costs a phenomenal amount of money.  A therapist doing a laser treatment on the same lesion does not pay anything like the same amount.  The Senator is correct, in that separate insurance is required for a truck or a car.  While the Medical Protection Society, MPS, which insures most surgeons, asks for one's range of practice, it is a bit blurred in cases where people are working outside their level of competence, as the Deputy described.  I can see where the problems are, if that helps us find the answers.</p></speech>

The beauty therapists would have a code of practice; I do not know to what extent it is enforced.  A dermal filler is also administered by injection and is put under the skin to get rid of wrinkles.</p> <p>A filler is classified as a device because it is not an active agent.  Although it is injected, it is a device.  It is open to anybody to use because it does not require a doctor.  Fillers are of great concern in the United Kingdom, where the authorities have said there is more regulation for a ballpoint pen that for dermal fillers.  That is a problem.</p><p> A concern associated with people spending vast amounts of money is a condition called body dismorphic disorder.  Perhaps 2% or 3% of the population have a condition whereby they do not see themselves in the way others see them, and they are attracted to more and more procedures.  A number of them have body dismorphic disorder.  It is part of a surgeon's training to be aware not only of the technical and academic aspects but also of the moral and ethical aspects.  It involves identifying patients who give rise to concern and in respect of whom a procedure may be more harmful than good.</p></speech>

It is a major procedure, with a high risk of complications, including serious permanent complications.  It is not to be done lightly and it takes a number of weeks to recover.  Done well, a facelift can have lovely and very natural looking results.  It is frustrating that some of these kinds of procedures are sometimes touted as being all bad.  If carried out properly, one can look natural and good.</p><p>  The non-surgical facelift is becoming more common.  It is not an operation.  A wide variety of practitioners are offering this, using the name "facelift".  What they are doing is giving injections and laser treatments.  Botox gets rid of some of the wrinkle lines, and fillers are used to get rid of others.  Lasers are used to get rid of fine lines or discolouration.   All sorts of names are used to describe the combination of these treatments.  There is a facelift called the "Dracula facelift" whereby some blood from the system is aspirated and spun around in a centrifuge, after which one re-injects the serum from it.  There is no proof that it works but it is being offered for vast amounts of money.  With a catchy name, it captures the public imagination.</p></speech>

The constituent was badly burnt as a consequence of what happened.</p></speech>

However, there is always a subset of people to whom the procedures will cause damage.  It is important to have properly qualified practitioners because they know what is abnormal before they start.  We are trained to recognise disease and what is abnormal so we will know not to treat such conditions.  Dermatologists, plastic surgeons and ophthalmologists go through such a long period of training to learn what is abnormal and when a problem will develop so they will not laser a potential skin cancer or carry out a surgical procedure on somebody with a bleeding disorder.</p><p>  Microdermabrasion, which is widely available in salons and beauticians' practices, and procedures right up to full plastic surgery have benefits for patients, both psychologically and cosmetically, but they can also have an adverse effect, like everything in life.  To return to the points of Deputy Sandra McLellan and Senator Jillian van Turnhout, it is a question of knowing the facts.  When one sees the website or glossy magazine, one does not know what one is getting; it is not clear.  Consumers and patients need clarity so that if they see a dermatologist or beautician, he or she will be qualified.  If they are seeing an ophthalmologist or plastic surgeon, they should know what they are getting.  It is a matter of the correct usage of wording and not playing around.  That is so important.  As always, the well educated and well connected will be sent to the right people.  However, it is perhaps the most vulnerable, because they are seeing the advertising, who will not know who to talk to or where to go for advice when thinking of having a breast lift or Botox.  They will be targeted by advertising.  Monitoring advertising and ensuring it does not mislead are important.  It is not only the actresses and soap stars who are having these procedures; people on the street are having them as perfectly normal procedures.  It is trivialised in our everyday life, yet it is potentially life threatening.</p><p>  I was asked whether there have been deaths.  Within the last four years of my practice, there have been two deaths from mismanaged moles in young men.</p></speech>

I had occasion recently to make inquiries on behalf of somebody whose child had suffered a severe burn injury abroad.  Do we have enough burn beds?  Do we have enough paediatric and adult burn beds?  Is the unit adequately staffed and resourced?</p><p>  I have received a number of distressing items of correspondence from a few people with respect to the failure of insurance companies to cover them for reconstructive breast surgery when they have not had cancer but a clear-cut genetic syndrome meaning a very high likelihood of getting cancer.  Sadly, one of the most standard treatments is to recommend to the women that they have their breasts removed preventively before they could develop cancer.  An incredibly integral component of cancer care is the making available of genetic testing, prophylactic surgery and reconstruction.</p> <p>Does Ms O'Donnell care to comment on the current situation in that respect?</p></speech>

We do not have a paediatric burns unit.  Crumlin hospital takes paediatric burns greater than 10% of the body surface area, but we will pretty much take all burns.  We have had a major issue there in that we have a 20% reduction in our theatre space.  Recently we sent two burns cases to the United Kingdom because we felt we did not have the safe facilities to look after them here.  I refer to the paediatric burns.  It was because we do not have adequate theatre space.  We do not have a paediatric burns surgeon, despite having an application in for one for quite a number of years.</p></speech>

It would start from the top in that we would need a lead surgeon around whom we would build the burns centre or unit.

It has deficiencies.  We have a burns surgeon there who took over from Mrs. O'Donnell who was in the job previously.  He has major submissions in as well to try to upgrade that centre.  We have problems with the fact we can only have three intensive care unit beds there.

There are a lot of advertisements for having things done in different countries.  There is one big commercial group which advertises in Ireland but takes the patients to the United Kingdom for the surgery, and then they come back to Ireland.  That is not terribly clear from the beginning and patients will see somebody locally in a clinic here, but the surgery is done elsewhere.  Those patients are not necessarily choosing to have their surgery elsewhere.  It happens that way.  Then there is a separate group who decide they will go on the cosmetic surgery tourism holiday and go for a beach trip after their treatment.  I have seen a couple of patients who have come back with problems.  That is not to say everybody will be treated badly but it makes it difficult for a patient coming back whenever he or she has a problem to seek follow-up.</p></speech>

I welcome to the meeting Dr. Colette Bonner, deputy chief medical officer and head of the health protection unit in the Department of Health, Dr. Darina O'Flanagan, director of the health protection surveillance centre in the Department of Health, Dr. Paul McKeown, specialist in public health medicine at the health protection surveillance centre in the Department of Health, and Dr. Bartley Cryan, consultant microbiologist at Cork University Hospital.  I also welcome the Lyme disease patient advocates and supporters in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for their presence.  Apologies have been received from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who must attend another meeting.   Deputy McLellan, who is a member of the committee in her own right, will be an able stand-in.  Apologies also have been received from Seanad Members who have been obliged to go to a vote.</p><p>  At the outset, I remind people to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or are in aeroplane mode as otherwise they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings and cause difficulties for staff.  Were people to do that, I would be most appreciative.  I remind people about privilege that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and the witness continues to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I reiterate that our second session today pertains to the microbiology of Lyme disease and I again thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I invite Dr. Bonner to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

My two colleagues already have been introduced, namely, Dr. Darina O&rsquo;Flanagan and Dr. Paul McKeown, director of and specialist in public health medicine, respectively, at the health protection surveillance centre.<br/>Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borelliosis, is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called <i>borrelia burgdorferi</i>.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  Lyme borelliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland in 2011 by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011.  The notifiable entity is the more severe neurological form known as Lyme neuroborreliosis.  In 2012, there were nine cases of neuroborreliosis and, in 2013, there were 13 cases.  Up to December of 2014, we have had 20 reported cases that have been provisionally notified in 2014.  However, it is expected that this number is likely to fall following validation of the numbers.  Due to the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms, a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to an under-reporting of cases.  Recent estimates suggest there may be up to 50 to 100 cases in Ireland per year.  The infection is generally mild, affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  Complications following Lyme borelliosis, while uncommon, do occur, though less frequently in Europe than in North America.</p> <p>They tend to occur sometimes after initial infection and are more common in people who did not realise they had been infected or who were not initially treated.</p><p> Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  It can be difficult if there has been no rash.  The rash is known as erythema migrans.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests, which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stage of disease.</p><p> Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be required.  In order to produce a harmonised approach to the testing and treatment of Lyme borelliosis in Ireland, a consensus statement on the clinical management of Lyme borelliosis has been issued jointly from the scientific advisory committee of the health protection surveillance centre, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The purpose of the consensus is to ensure that patients in Ireland are clinically managed in a harmonised fashion using guidance produced with the most up-to-date evidence.</p><p> The health protection surveillance centre is establishing a Lyme borreliosis sub-committee with the primary aim of examining best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme disease and developing strategies to undertake primary prevention to minimise harm caused by Lyme borreliosis in Ireland.  This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the public.  I hope the sub-committee will have its inaugural meeting during 2015.</p><p> Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising about Lyme disease and methods of prevention or minimising potential exposure through tick bites, the health protection surveillance centre holds a Lyme disease awareness week, in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages.  This year as part of the Lyme disease awareness week information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a tick-borne disease toolkit, developed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  This is available on the centre's website.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has informed the health protection surveillance centre that Ireland is the first European Union member state to make such extensive use of this material.  I will hand over to my colleagues, who may answer any queries from committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.1283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bartley Cryan" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121800012#O00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me in to discuss the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease.  I will outline a little about medical microbiologists, what we are and what we do.  There are approximately 40 of us in the country fulfilling approximately 30 whole time equivalent posts.  There are two or three of us in most of the major teaching hospitals scattered throughout the country.</p><p>  Generally speaking, our job is to manage the laboratories in conjunction with the senior scientists, to develop the service and to engage in clinical liaison with our users.  They are largely hospital physicians and surgeons as well as general practitioners.  We are involved in infection control, antibiotic stewardship and teaching.  Our main function is to ensure that the right tests are done and are available for our catchment population, that they are interpreted correctly and that we are available to advise the clinicians on putting the patients on the correct treatment as well as monitoring that treatment and any further investigations that are required.</p><p>  I work as a consultant medical microbiologist in Cork University Hospital.  I have been there since 1991.  Of significance, my prior position was as a lecturer in the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, where I was associated with the Lyme disease reference facility.  I wrote several publications there which I have referenced in my submission.  The publication of most significance is Lyme disease in Ireland.  Under the study we reviewed the available Irish data from 1986.  It is of significance that several specialties and physicians in Ireland were actively searching for and investigating the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis at that time.  In total, 484 samples were sent to us.  A total of 14% of these were positive by the initial screening assays but only 13% were formally confirmed by the western blot.  These were spread throughout several specialties, largely neurology, rheumatology and dermatology.  People were actively searching for diagnoses for Lyme disease at the time and continue to do so.</p><p>  The Cork University Hospital medical microbiology laboratory is one of the largest in the country.  We deal with almost 500,000 samples a year.  Approximately 50% of our work comes from general practitioners and approximately 50% comes from the hospitals under what used to be the southern health board.  We cater for a population of approximately 500,000.</p><p>  We get many types of samples.  One point of significance to the committee is that we deal with approximately 180,000 serology or virology samples per year.  We run at approximately 1,000 Lyme disease serologies per year.  Our testing tends to be seasonal, as is the nature of the illness.  We tend to get most of these in the autumn.  Of the 1,000 serologies that we examined in 2013 some 30 were confirmed positive cases.  We send all our positive enzyme immunoassay tests, which we carry out in-house, to the rare and imported pathogens laboratory, which is the United Kingdom reference laboratory for Lyme disease.  That laboratory carries out an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test.  Then it does the western blots and report back to us.</p><p>  As previously mentioned by Dr. Bonner, Lyme disease results from the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi by hard bodies, Ixodes ticks.  The ticks need to be attached to the patient for over 24 hours for transmission to occur.  The disease was first identified by Steere et al in 1975 and the organism was identified by Willi Burgdorfer, who died recently, in 1981.</p><p>  In the United States, where the disease is more numerous and of more significance, between 10% and 20% of untreated patients will go on to develop nervous system symptoms.  Arthritis will develop in approximately half of those cases.  Arthritis is far more common in the United States than in Europe and this is related to the different species.  The common species in Ireland is Borrelia garinii, which tends to give rise to skin and neurological signs but rarely arthritis.  Generally speaking, the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the specific strain which occurs in the United States, is more pathogenic.</p><p>  Traditionally, infections and all illnesses are diagnosed by eliciting the appropriate clinical signs and characteristic symptoms.  Then, the diagnosis is confirmed by detecting or growing the implicated organism in the infected tissue.  When we can do that, we can make a firm diagnosis of an illness.  Unfortunately, organisms like Borrelia burgdorferi and spirochetes in general are difficult to grow.  Therefore, we cannot apply the normal standards that we would apply in diagnosing infections.  Instead, we must resort to looking for antibodies or activated cells to counteract these infections.  This means we are looking for evidence of previous contact with the organism rather than actual disease.  One of the other problems associated with serology is that it takes time for people to develop antibodies.  In the case of Lyme disease it may take up to 30 days before antibodies are detectable in blood.  Moreover, there may be cross-reactions, which is a common problem in spirochetal illnesses.  There may be false positive results as well as results that may be true positive but which are not related to the actual symptoms that the patients are suffering from.  Another problem with antibody-associated diagnoses is that the antibodies tend to remain positive for life.  Generally speaking, we cannot use them as an indicator for adequate treatment and it is difficult to determine relapse or reinfection because the antibody levels will still be present.</p><p>  The earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme is the pathognomonic erythema migrans.  This is a circular red rash which spreads out from the area of the tick bite.  Generally, it occurs within seven or eight days of the bite, but it can take up to 30 days to occur and it lasts for approximately a month.</p> <p>It is seen in most infections, but if it is not in an obvious body site, the patient might not be aware of it.  Approximately 30% of people who display chronic signs of Lyme infection have no evidence of having had erythema migrans.  We see quite a lot of these cases in west Cork and County Kerry.  General practitioners regularly send us serology which turns out to be negative.  If we are told when we telephone them that the characteristic rash is present, a repeat serology is carried out approximately one month later.  If the serology is positive at this point, a diagnosis can be made.  Approximately 30% of patients with the rash will have a negative serology.  Those who are well aware of this problem get over it by repeating the serology.  People can have flu-like symptoms at the same time.</p><p> The guidelines we follow when diagnosing Lyme disease were proposed by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the UK Health Protection Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  They are probably the most widely applied guidelines, certainly in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.  In the two-pronged approach taken we initially do an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA, test which, if positive, we follow with an immunoblot test.  I ask members of the committee to bear in mind the caveat that in early infections people may have a negative serology.  If the clinical syndrome is suggestive, we always go back and recommend that a repeat serology be done.</p><p> When we get a positive result in the initial ELISA test, we telephone the doctor involved to discuss the case and make him or her aware that it will take approximately three weeks for the western blot results to come back from the reference laboratory in the United Kingdom.  If the clinical syndrome at that stage is very suggestive of Lyme disease, a decision will frequently be made to treat the patient to eradicate the organism as quickly as possible and avoid long-term complications.  When the western blot results are available, we contact the clinician again to discuss the case with him or her.  As I mentioned, we might suggest a further serology at that stage.  I reiterate that just 30 of the 1,000 samples we examined in 2013 were actually confirmed.  We tend to see a peak of samples late in the summer.</p><p> Anecdotally, having spoken to clinicians, it seems that most Lyme infections tend to occur in Ireland.  However, we also see many cases that originated in central Europe, Scandinavia and the west coast of the United States.  We have an active neurological centre within the hospital.  The neurologists regularly test patients for Lyme disease.  If there is any suggestion of a positive Lyme disease serology in a neurological patient, we will always also examine his or her cerebral spinal fluid to confirm the diagnosis.  Where Lyme arthritis is an issue, joint fluid may also be taken to confirm the diagnosis.  </p><p> I will stop there.  I will be happy to answer questions members might have.</p></speech>

We have met people who have Lyme disease and they often claim that traditional medical science seems to be resistant to believing there is something wrong with them in the first place.  They have suggested medical professionals can be slow and reluctant to test for Lyme disease.  Very often there are contradictory views-----</p></speech>

I will ask a few questions.  </p><p>  Why are there such disparities between the varying views held?  I refer, for example, to the view within traditional medical science on testing for Lyme disease.  Why is there not a more uniform opinion on the efficiency of the serologies of the western blot and ELISA test methods?  Is there still a doubt within traditional medicine about people contracting Lyme disease?  We often hear claims about chronic Lyme disease, for example.  We understand the initial testing will identify the pathogens.  Many people have longer term concerns about the chronic Lyme disease element.</p><p>  According to people who have contracted Lyme disease, there is a lack of understanding of their plight within traditional medicine.  Why is that the case?  In the light of all the advances in microbiology and testing, why have we not reached a point at which we can definitively identify whether there is such a thing as chronic Lyme disease?  I have met many patients, some of whom have appeared before the committee, who say they have met a huge well of resistance.  They often have to travel to Germany for tests.  Why is that the case?  Do the delegates have any view on this?</p><p>  On the broader issue, we have heard that of the 1,000 samples taken, approximately 30 were confirmed.  Why is the test carried out in the microbiology unit not as accurate as it should be?  What are the real reasons for this?  Reference was made to the use of lumbar puncture to take samples.  What is the most common method of taking samples to be assessed and analysed for Lyme disease?  </p><p>  I will leave it at that because other members will have questions, too.</p></speech>

I also welcome the advocates and some patients who are in the public gallery.  It appears Lyme disease affects a small number of people, although the numbers have been growing during the past number of years.  For the people affected, it is a very significant illness and it can be very severe and chronic.  I know from contact I have had with sufferers in the south Tipperary area that there is confusion and difficulty in diagnosing the disease and patients suffering from the disease are often not diagnosed with it or only diagnosed with it after a prolonged period.  It appears there is a question over the accuracy of the various testing that takes place to identify the disease.  Some people have said that the tests are 70% inaccurate and only 30% accurate.  Is that correct?  Are different tests that are more specific and accurate done in other European countries, for instance, in the UK or Germany?  That has been suggested.</p><p>  The disease can be very debilitating, severe and chronic for people who are affected by it.  There is a general unease that there are probably no specialists in this area in the country.  A number of general practitioners have a specific interest in this disease.  Can I establish if there are any specialists in this field in the country and, if not, are there any proposals to appoint a specialist here, or to have a specialist from another European country come here as an interim measure?  </p><p>  Is there any indication that specific age groups or categories in the population are affected by this disease?  It has been suggested the disease can be linked to redwater in animals or ticks in sheep.  I seek more information on the disease from our guests and I hope it can be dealt with.  Even though it affects only a small group of people, it is very debilitating and severe.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being here for their presentations as I was a little over-booked for parts of the morning.</p><p>  Lyme disease is a very real and potentially very serious condition.  I am not an expert in this area but having lived for many years in New York I was well aware of the people who had it.  I had the tragic experience of seeing my closest professional colleague and mentor from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center when we were both speaking at a meeting develop heart block and become extremely unwell.  I do not want to bore everyone here who is not used to looking at cardiac tracing, but I saw longer and longer gaps emerging between his cardiac complexes and he had reached the stage technically of cardiac arrest and had to have a pacemaker put in.  The diagnosis of Lyme disease was only made thereafter but that is what it was.  I am under no illusions about what a terrible illness this can be.  </p><p>  I would like to amplify what my colleague, Deputy Healy, said by throwing in more question, which I have already put to other groups this morning and which I will put to our guests here.  We are in general extraordinarily understaffed in every medical specialty in Ireland by international standards.  I understand we have people here who do this analysis through a microbiology background and through an infectious disease background and I ask them what is the number of consultants per head of population here in this respect compared to those in the UK, to continental Europe and to North America?  </p><p>  A specific issue in regard to Lyme disease arose with respect to our previous hearings.  Evidence was presented by another doctor who came here that there was an entity of chronic Lyme inflection which could occur wholly in the absence of any blood test evidence of Lyme infection.  In other words, everything could be negative but the diagnosis could still be Lyme disease.  As a result a certain number of substantive suggestions were made as to how patients who presented with this clinical syndrome should be dealt with and a clear suggestion was made that they were not being dealt with appropriately in Ireland because of our failure to recognise this entity.  I thought for the sake of balance it was important that it we would have people in before the committee who could tell us exactly where the evidence stacks up on that.  If there is no doubt there is Lyme disease, I am sure there is chronic Lyme disease, but is there a chronic Lyme disease which occurs wholly in absence of any blood test evidence of Lyme infection?</p></speech>

I was struck by the differences between the figures provided by Dr. Bonner and Dr. Cryan on the number of patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease last year.  Will the witnesses explain the difference between their figures?  Both Dr. Bonner and Dr. Cryan suggested that Lyme disease is underdiagnosed.  Why is that the case?  Is it related to the use in Ireland of a test that may be less specific that the tests used elsewhere?  Does the test used here correspond with international best practice?  Why do we not use the test that is used in the United States, Canada and Germany given that it yields different results?  While my observations may be anecdotal, they are based on the information we have received.</p><p>  Dr. Cryan suggested that in some undiagnosed or misdiagnosed cases, the outcome can be more severe than in cases where the disease is detected and treated in a timely manner.  Will he describe the outcomes for such patients and what is the effect on their lives?  Dr. Cryan referred to nine cases in 2012, 13 cases in 2013 and 30 cases this year.  In how many of these cases have the patients shown symptoms other than the general symptoms that occur when the disease is detected on time?</p></speech>

Redwater disease in cattle is caused by an organism called babesia, which is common in this country and is spread by the same tick that causes Lyme disease.  A different version of the disease found in New England is much more serious.  Humans can contract babesiosis and the literature records in the order of five or six cases in the past 20 years or thereabouts.  People whose spleen is absent or malfunctioning can get babesiosis.  In the past ten years, there have been three cases in Galway and one case in Cork.  The infection is relatively common in New England.</p><p>  I recently discussed Lyme disease serology with a general practitioner.  The GP's patient, who is a lady from County Kerry, got the infection in Nantucket and was admitted to hospital with babesiosis, which to all intents and purposes is similar to malaria.  She was also treated for Lyme disease. </p><p>  A number of members asked about testing.  The ELISA test that we do is exactly the same as the test performed by the UK reference laboratory.  The two-tier, two-pronged method of doing an ELISA and a western blot test is the most validated and studied approach to Lyme disease and the one recommended in the United Kingdom by the authoritative bodies, as well as in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.  </p></speech>

An activated lymphocyte test is available and is performed by some laboratories, particularly in Germany.  One of the previous speakers set great store by this test but much of the medical literature does not concur with his conclusions.  In some of the literature it is found to be much less sensitive and specific when compared to ELISA testing.  In any case, the activated lymphocyte test looks at different versions of the same thing.  One is not directly looking for the organism, which is what one would like to do, but at the body's response.  The activated lymphocyte test looks at a cellular response, whereas the ELISA test looks at an antibody response.  The latter approach is a very common way of dealing with infections, usually viral infections because they are hard to grow.</p></speech>

In Cork University Hospital, we use the most internationally validated test available.   Our laboratory was accredited by a UK body, Clinical Pathology Accreditation or CPA, until recently when we changed over to Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, accreditation.  The laboratory was visited recently by INAB.  All the medical microbiology laboratories in the country had INAB visitations last year or will have them this year and all are being accredited.  As part of this accreditation, they must all have in place a quality system that includes the use of a CE marked assay system and must be validated internationally and locally to ensure international standards apply.  We are also part of a quality control system under which we receive anonymised specimens from a central laboratory in the United Kingdom.  These are tested and the results compared.  This is done on an ongoing basis in all areas.</p><p>  All the medical staff in the department undergo full continuing medical education and so forth.  Teaching and knowledge of Lyme disease are widespread in medicine.  As I stated, I work in an area where there are four highly active neurologists for adults and one for children.  In many cases, they want to find a diagnosis of Lyme disease because it is a treatable condition, whereas many neurological conditions are difficult to treat or can be treated inadequately.  As many of them are relapsing-remitting and autoimmune, they are hard to treat.  Lyme disease is a diagnosis that is sought because it can be treated.</p><p>  The condition is generally treated with antibiotics, either tetracycline in the early stages or intravenous antibiotics in the later stages.  Three weeks of treatment is generally adequate.  There are no studies showing benefit beyond that period.  For instance, if people are treated for six months on intravenous antibiotics, it is necessary to have intravenous access for the entire period, which brings its own pathologies.  There have been cases of people acquiring candida bloodstream infections from which some have died.  Long-term use of cephalosporins can result in C. diff infections, which are serious and increasing in number.  People can also experience gallbladder problems from the build-up of biliary sludge as a complication of using these antibiotics.  For this reason, the use of antibiotics is not a trivial matter.</p><p>  The reason we use validated tests is obvious.  Our main goal is obtain the correct diagnosis.  The same circumstance used to arise in respect of brucella which, thankfully, is no longer a problem.  In north County Cork, half the farmers and all of the veterinarians had antibodies to brucellosis 20 years ago.  If a farmer or vet experienced depression or backache, his or her condition was not necessarily caused by the brucella, however.  They had antibodies to brucella in their blood all the time.  One must take this into consideration when diagnosing any infection. </p><p>  In New England, where there is a high incidence of Lyme disease, one would have to say that a background population - it is probably between 9% to 10% in this country, depending on the area - will have antibodies to borrelia that are probably not causing any problems and may not be the cause of any current symptoms.  For instance, if we obtain positive serology in a patient who has a neurological condition, we will do a lumbar puncture to look for the presence of antibodies in the cerebral spinal fluid which would go with neurological Lyme disease.  We will then do some further testing on it to make sure it is being produced in the cerebral spinal fluid.  We also do this in other scenarios.</p><p>  Generally speaking, one has a list of differentials with different priorities.  If one has a list of illnesses causing a neurological condition, including Lyme disease, and nothing is becoming obvious, the patient will be retested several times and may even be treated to ensure Lyme disease is ruled out of the diagnosis.  There is, therefore, a bias towards having treatable conditions ruled out. </p><p>  We were asked whether chronic Lyme disease exists.  It is definitely the case that people who are not treated for Lyme disease can develop chronic complications.  People who have been treated for Lyme disease can get what is called a post-Lyme syndrome.  Post-infective syndromes are relatively common.  For example, Epstein-Barr virus is tremendously common among teenagers at the moment and many of them will experience a protracted period of fatigue post having the infection.  This is well described after a number of viral and bacterial infections.  </p><p>  There is a syndrome, so-called chronic Lyme disease, which is described in the literature I have been reading as causing excessive fatigue, neurocognitive issues, aches, pains, joint pains and muscle weaknesses.  It is a relatively weak syndrome in terms of clinical syndromes.  Senator Crown asked whether it could be associated with Lyme disease and the absence of antibodies.  I do not believe there is evidence in the literature to support such a position. </p><p>  What would be the etymology of the condition if Lyme disease were associated with it?  Is it persistent infection?  If a person had persistent infection, antibodies would be produced.  </p> <p>The problems with the antibodies and false negatives are early in the infection, within the first two months where somebody has the rash.  When they are tested, 30% are found to be negative.  The rash is so characteristic that there is very little else it can be.  In New England such people get tetracycline and the person may repeat the serology in a month to confirm that it has become positive.  </p><p> As I said, there is a drive towards getting treatable diagnoses on an ongoing basis with the clinician we are dealing with, and Lyme disease is one of those.  On education, all the GPs in our area are very well aware of Lyme disease, as are all the neurologists in our area.  Most have trained in the United States.  Generally speaking, most of the physicians in the country will have trained in the United States.  They will be very cognisant of Lyme disease. </p><p> We do not have specific Lyme disease specialists in the country.  We have infectious disease consultants, although not very many, and neurologists who will deal with the vast majority of Lyme disease cases.  Rheumatologists are involved to a lesser extent, but that would usually be an American associated Lyme disease.</p></speech>

The difference to the diagnosis Dr. Cryan referred to relates to the total number of cases of Lyme disease, whereas I am discussing notifications which relate to neuroborreliosis, a very specific neurological complication of it.  Dr. O'Flanagen will talk to that.  Dr. McKeown will explain the toolkit and other educational material that has been available from HPSC for a long time for clinicians and the public.</p></speech>

I will discuss the toolkit first.  It was an initiative developed between the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, which is the equivalent of the CDC in the United States of America.  It is an overarching infectious control forum for the member states in managing infectious diseases.  Across Europe there are a range of vector borne diseases, that is, diseases carried largely by insects or insect-like creatures.  Lyme disease is carried by ticks, which are not insects.  They are like beetles.  Tick borne diseases are very common across Europe.  Lyme disease is the most common, but there are other diseases such as tick borne encephalitis which is extremely common in eastern Europe but not in central Europe.  We do not see any cases unless they are imported.</p><p>  I refer to these diseases because whenever we examine them we try to take a holistic approach because what will prevent one disease may reduce the incidence of a number of diseases.  The ECDC has always had an interest in this, as has HPSC, and in 2012 a notifiable entity of neuroborreliosis was introduced.  In doing so we followed ECDC advice that it was best to count those forms of diseases of which one is very sure.  We know from evidence that about 10% of cases of Lyme disease end up as neuroborreliosis.  We have been seeing about ten cases, on average, a year since we started collecting the figures in a systematic way.  That would suggest we have ten or 15 times that number of erythema migrans Lyme disease, which is the milder form.  I will return to the toolkit.</p><p>  Chronic Lyme disease exists.  As a locum GP 25 years ago I worked in Bristol which is, I understand, quite near the New Forest.  Deputy McLellan referred to it.  I saw it very regularly.  Lyme disease is extremely interesting.  Dr. Cyran referred to serology.  We know from studies undertaken in different countries and Ireland that blood tests will show up Lyme disease.  One will be left with a ghost of Lyme disease in one's blood if one was infected in the past.  Studies would suggest that urban areas have relatively low levels of people with these antibodies, whereas rural areas have quite high levels.  One study in Ireland showed that about 1% of a sample of the Dublin population had antibodies to Lyme disease, whereas parts of the west had 15%.</p><p>  That indicates that many people are bitten by ticks and exposed to the Lyme bug which is carried in the saliva of these ticks.  Whenever they feed they have a blood feast.  Only a small proportion go on to develop erythema migrans, and an even smaller percentage go on to develop the more serious forms.  The more serious forms are very debilitating and difficult to live with.  </p><p>  We consider it extremely important to raise awareness of this issue.  We were very happy to become deeply involved with the ECDC initiative, namely, the development of its toolkit which has material that was pre-prepared.  We made it relevant for GPs, other clinicians and the general public in Ireland.  In previous years we produced material for national parks and linked with support groups that contacted us.  We identified which organisations could provide literature, material and advice on what to do.  HPSC has a lot of information on its website.  We are in the process of bringing together a group of the scientific advisory committee which will extend and carry on this work.</p><p>  The toolkit was designed to raise awareness, and the awareness raising for Lyme disease has to take place across a spectrum.  It is something of which we can all be aware.  There is quite a high degree of awareness of Lyme disease among our GPs and clinicians, but that can be continued.  </p><p>  I was also asked about specific age groups.  We know from our cases and serological studies that individuals who are most likely to be bitten by a tick and have a positive Lyme disease test or go on to develop Lyme disease are those who come in close contact with ticks in their habitat.  Ticks live outside in woodland and heathland and people who are in those areas, because of their job or leisure interests, are those most likely to come into contact with them.  </p><p>  We see about ten cases of neuroborreliosis a year.  We have a pretty good idea of the number of cases.  Our departments of public health are keenly aware of the condition, link closely with GPs and report back data from their areas to GPs.  One step I was very pleased to see and which I am grateful to the department for was that Lyme disease as neuroborreliosis became notifiable.  The act of making something notifiable brings it to people's attention.</p><p>  We were asked whether the general public was aware of Lyme disease.  I do not think we can ever be totally happy with our awareness of many diseases.  The awareness raising we have undertaken in HPSC will continue because it is important for people to have the information at the back of their heads, in particular since it is seasonal.  Lyme disease can be contracted throughout the year, but whenever people are out more and in contact with nature more they need to take more precautions.  On our website we have a lot of information about how people can minimise the chances of being bitten by a tick and developing Lyme disease.</p></speech>

There is a danger in labelling people who do not have laboratory diagnostic evidence of positive serology indicating chronic Lyme disease because, as stated by Dr. Cryan, prolonged antimicrobial treatment can lead to side-effects such as central vascular catheter infections, fungal infections and so on.  There is also a concern about people who have other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease and so on.  There are many documented cases of people who turned out to have diagnoses that had not been adequately investigated at a proper stage because of a false diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.  We must be very careful in this regard.  It is important that diagnoses be made by accredited laboratories in Ireland.  I would be reluctant to depend on the diagnoses of some laboratories, for example, in Germany which are not accredited and do not operate to the same high standards applied in Ireland.</p></speech>

However, the delegates have given good responses to the questions put to them thus far.</p><p>  I would like to follow on from an issue highlighted by Deputy Billy Kelleher.  There appears to be a huge difference of opinion on the diagnoses people are receiving from laboratories in Germany and Belgium and those being offered here.  Has this issue been discussed at international conferences and, if so, in terms of the line being taken on this issue in Germany and Belgium and what the delegates have told us today, what has been the general outcome?  It has been stated there is no laboratory support for diagnoses.  I presume this matter has been discussed at international conferences.  I would welcome some feedback in that regard.</p></speech>

Approximately two years prior to that meeting I attended a conference on the issue.  The view of people who spoke at that conference was that the problem of chronic pain was not recognised in Ireland.  The conference was attended by experts from Australia who were also of the view that the problem was not recognised here.  The group was then invited to appear before the committee at which time it put its case to the then Minister, Deputy James Reilly, who had the matter investigated.  The problem of chronic pain is now recognised in Ireland.  Are doctors in Ireland inclined to dismiss the issue?  I refer to the story about Mark as outlined in the three-page letter sent to us by his mother.  I am sure he is experiencing exactly what is set out therein.  Are doctors in Ireland quick to dismiss the idea that someone is suffering from chronic pain?</p></speech>

I have received a letter from a constituent on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry who believes she contracted Lyme disease when hiking in Killarney National Park.  Kerry is one of the counties identified as high risk in that regard.  The experience of the person in question has been absolutely appalling.  Despite undergoing numerous tests in Ireland, she was misdiagnosed as having many conditions.  When she travelled to Germany for further tests her condition was finally correctly diagnosed.  Because the correct diagnosis was so late in coming she is not in as good a condition as she could have been.  Her family have had to sell the family home to meet the cost of tests and treatment.  Their lives have been ruined and she can no longer work because of her medical condition.  She is at her wit's end at this stage and hugely concerned about the failure to acknowledge huge flaws in our testing system and the negative attitude to diagnoses of Lyme disease.  She has asked me to put a number of questions to the delegates.</p><p>  Why are patients who test positive for Lyme disease in other EU countries not given access to treatment in Ireland?  While I acknowledge that that question was answered earlier, I would welcome elaboration on the response, including the reason in 60% of cases the disease is not detected and why, following testing, many patients are diagnosed with other conditions.  Is it the case that people are being tested numerous times until there is a negative result, despite the initial result being positive?  Has any progress been made since this matter was last discussed here in the setting up of the proposed sub-committee and inclusion of sufferers of Lyme disease in it?  As I said, according to my constituent, the culture here appears to be not to try to accommodate people.</p></speech>

Lest Dr. Cryan thought I was insinuating anything about the calibre of any person, I was not.  I apologise if that impression was given; I was only trying to tease something out.  </p><p>  Dr. Cryan has stated that in the case of 30% of the tests carried out the results are negative.  Is there a common reason for this?  I may have misunderstood an earlier response, but, as I understand it, according to Dr. McKeown, there is what is called chronic Lyme disease.  However, according to Dr. Cryan, there can be no such disease if there are no antibodies.  If antibodies are detected, there is such a thing as chronic Lyme disease.  If antibodies are not detected but people are experiencing the symptoms on the list, what is Dr. Cryan's explanation for what the people concerned are going through, or is that too broad a question to ask?</p></speech>

Why is there such a discrepancy between the accreditation systems in Germany and Ireland?  Is the laboratory in Germany acting independently?  Many people have told us that they were diagnosed in Germany as having chronic Lyme disease.  Is it the view of the delegates that the accreditation system in Germany is not up to scratch or that some laboratories there are acting outside internationally accepted accreditation systems?  I would welcome clarity on that issue.</p><p>  As asked by Deputy Regina Doherty, what is the explanation in the case of a person who has all the symptoms associated with Lyme disease but in whom no antibodies are detected?  Dr. Cryan has stated people would almost welcome a diagnosis of Lyme disease because it is treatable.</p> <p>Is there almost a yearning that a person needs to find out what is wrong and that one hopes it is this?  Is that what Dr. Cryan was inferring?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-18a.1319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bartley Cryan" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121800018#V00200"><p>I mentioned that there is an active neurological service in Cork University Hospital.  A number of people there have progressive neurological conditions and there will be quite long differentials for the potential causes of those conditions.  If a treatable cause can be found, the onus will be on the neurologist and the investigating doctors to exclude as vigorously as possible all treatable causes.  Lyme disease, being one of the treatable causes, would be vigorously pursued by the neurologist and the investigating doctors.  It is not that the patient wishes he or she has Lyme disease; it is that the treating physician will vigorously check for any treatable condition in somebody who might otherwise have an untreatable relapsing condition.<br/>Deputy Doherty mentioned that a person may have the symptom complex but not the antibodies.  It is very difficult to explain scientifically, and it is difficult to prove it if one reviews the literature, how in the absence of the organism and an immune response to the organism somebody can get the symptoms that are part of that chronic Lyme syndrome caused by the organism.  One has either an infection or an immune reaction to the infection.  In either case one should be able to detect one or other of those.  If there is no evidence of it detectable and the person has symptoms - the symptom complex is very broad and the list of things that can cause that is extremely long - one can rule out Lyme disease by the absence of the bacterium or by the absence of the body's response to it.  Obviously, people who have been infected and are not treated can get chronic Lyme disease.  On the issue of the use of the term chronic Lyme disease in the absence of antibodies or evidence of infection, there is no literature proving that it actually exists.<br/>One wonders why some people, such as Deputy Brendan Griffin's constituent, is not responding to treatment, and perhaps she is not being treated for the right thing.  He mentioned that 30% of the tests were false negatives.  The vast majority of the false negatives occur early in the infection where the erythema migrans has come because one gets the erythema migrans in the first 30 days, usually in the second week.  The antibodies only start to become positive around then.  One may find that the antibodies are positive in week four and the rash is present in week two.  It is a very characteristic rash.  Any GP who sees this and recognises it will repeat the test about six weeks later and it will confirm it.  When one takes that out of the count, the testing is quite accurate.<br/>On the German laboratories, there are a number of laboratories.  If one searches the Internet, one will find people in the US saying they will PCR and will detect Lyme disease in a whole series of body fluids.  A professor in our department has been trying to do that with Lyme disease for the past two years without any success. The people I referred to will do that test at great cost to the individual.  Many people are offering very questionable tests to people at great expense.  The test used by the laboratory in Germany is a lymphocyte stimulation assay.  The speaker at the committee's previous meeting, who seems to have enormous experience in Lyme disease, surprisingly has not written very much in the literature.  I actually looked it up to find some of the bases for his suppositions.  He has written only one letter but no scientific publications, which is extraordinary given his interest in the syndrome.<br/>However, on the tests that he recommends and about which he is quite positive, the literature is very mixed on that particular test.  It is a cellular version of what we do with antibodies so one is looking at versions of the same thing, but in other hands the sensitivity and specificity would suggest that it is not as good as the test we do.  Germany seems to have a particular interest in all of this but where is the most Lyme disease in the world?  New England.  Where are the people who have the longest experience of dealing with lyme disease?  The US.  Where is the most serious Lyme disease, the specific <i>borrelia burgdorferi</i>?  We have a variety of other species that are less pathogenic.  The US.  Whose advice would one be best advised to follow?  The people who deal with it most often, the most serious forms of it and have the most problems with it and who actually diagnosed it, in the first place.  We follow the IDSA guidelines, the CDC guidelines, the UK guidelines and the ECDC guidelines, all of which are singing from the same hymn sheet.  In fact, it could be the same document.</p></speech>

I would suggest the reverse.  I would suggest the other side is groupthink.  The Deputy mentioned international conferences.  There has been quite an amount of debate, both verbally at conferences and in the literature, about this whole subject.  Following a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease, the scientific basis for protracted antibiotic therapy for this poorly defined condition is non-existent.  When it becomes existent. the treatment, modification and management of it will change.  At the moment there is not a sufficient weight of scientific evidence to suggest that seronegative patients who have this symptom complex with the huge potential list of differentials have actual occult Lyme disease.  While variety of suggestions have been put forward, if one goes through them one after another, it is very difficult to prove a negative.  We got blood in from a person who wanted to find the undetectable viruses.  I rang back asking which undetectable ones she specifically wanted us to look for.  She said that if we could not find them, they must have an undetectable virus.  The absence of something does not mean it is present.  There is no scientific proof to suggest that this occult Lyme disease syndrome actually exists.  People are doing a lot of research.  The Lyme disease diagnosis is not an exact science at the moment.  It should, hopefully, be improved.  People have been looking for this particular cause.</p><p>  I was present at a conference 25 years ago where chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease were being discussed and they were trying to find linkages between the two.  This line of investigation has been going on for quite some time and there still is not tangible scientific evidence.  The crucial thing is that people do not get misdiagnosed.  If one is diagnosed with the syndrome and one does not respond to the treatment, the chances are that one has got something else, but time has moved on.  We do not repeat testing until it goes negative.  The only reason we might repeat a test is to confirm there was not a mix-up with patient labelling or something like that.  In fact, every significant test we get, we will always get a second sample from the patient to confirm that it is positive, and occasionally one will do them to monitor therapy.  Once one is positive, one will be positive for life and those antibodies will be present.  It is the same with all the viruses and various other infective agents that we have come in contact with.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on two trials that have followed up patients who have been treated for Lyme disease and that have compared them with healthy controls.  One of the studies, a Slovenian study, shows that the symptoms after treatment at six and 12 months were the same in the treated group as the control population.  Another similar study was done in a Swedish group.  Again there was no difference in the outcomes following treatment.  The issue is that both studies highlighted the background prevalence of non-specific symptoms in the general population such as arthralgia, aches and pains, myalgia fatigue and other subjective symptoms.  Unless one compares it with a control population the evidence does not exist that there is a difference once people have been adequately treated.  There is no scientific evidence to support the need for long-term chronic use of antibiotics.</p><p>  There was another question from Deputy Brendan Griffin in regard to the sub-committee of the scientific advisory committee.  This year we have deferred a number of our committees because of the issue of Ebola virus disease and we have had to pull a number of our people in the HPSC to work on Ebola.</p> <p>We will pick up those committees next year, hopefully, prioritise them and resume the work that had begun on them.  If we have an emerging viral threat, we must prioritise what we focus on.  That is the nature of the business we are in.  Hopefully, if there are no other competing priorities like the Ebola virus disease, we will be able to pick that up.</p></speech>

In terms of chronic seronegative Lyme disease, the human body is designed to fight off alien substances, including infections.  One of the ways it does this is through antibodies.  My feeling is that if somebody has an infection, they must mount an antibody response.  If the antibodies are not there, it means the person has a desperately damaged immune system and is open to all sorts of infections or that the diagnosis would be something else.</p><p>  In terms of guidance, it is extremely important that we produced our consensus statement and highlighted a number of guidance documents.  Whenever we develop guidance, we look for confluence and a majority of evidence pointing in one direction.  To do that, we have access to a vast amount of evidence through various repositories of information that are made freely available to us.  It is a wonderful resource.  We look for confluence of evidence which does not mean that we discard other evidence.  All the evidence in terms of diagnostics and treatment very much point in a particular direction, and that is the basis upon which we have developed guidance.</p><p>  I note to Deputy Griffin that it is shocking to hear of someone who is placed in that awful position.  I would be very concerned that if that person got a diagnosis outside the country, he or she was given the wrong diagnosis.  Quality assurance in our labs is very high and extremely important because our medics - my microbiological colleagues - are here to protect people.  That is why across all developed countries the laboratories operate to a very high quality assurance standard.  That is necessary to ensure that people get the correct diagnosis in order that they do not go down a road of being given inappropriate antibiotics that could damage them or having an inappropriate lumbar puncture, which very occasionally has complications.</p></speech>

If somebody is diagnosed outside the country, whether through a national lab or a dodgy lab - I do not want to say that but it is the only way I can describe it - and comes back here, what help can they be given to assure them that what they have is not what they have been told?

I can tell someone with a high degree of confidence what treatment one of my patients will get where, as happens, he or she goes for an international second opinion.  I have a pretty good idea what he or she will hear if he or she goes to see the head of breast oncology at Harvard, Yale, UCLA, Stanford, or the Royal Marsden.  I know what is being published and have a couple of hundred papers myself.  Many of these people are amply published.  Dr. Cryan has given the most masterful and professional testimony I have ever heard anyone give to the committee.  It has been forensic, accurate, dispassionate and informed and I commend him on it.

Generally speaking, where someone has a diagnosis of an infectious disease from abroad, the treating physician and-or GP will redo the tests, serologies, etc. here.  The person will be treated exactly the same as anyone else.  In the UK roughly 15% of Lyme disease is acquired and diagnosed abroad.  We would have many people who come back from central Europe who have Lyme disease and had a diagnosis abroad.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, in the US and the equivalent bodies in the UK, which are all highly reputable, agree on the two-tier approach to diagnosis and the treatment regimens.

We have learned today that it is very important for people to get an accurate diagnosis and not end up with a diagnosis which misses something very important whereby they do not get adequate treatment for that condition when they should.</p></speech>

In medicine one starts by trying to identify the cause of the condition and one needs to start with the correct diagnosis.  It is like divergent roads.  If one goes too far down a road one can end up causing a patient harm, so getting the diagnosis right at the beginning is crucial.  This is why we rely on good clinical acumen, which we have in abundance in this country, and the appropriate tests, as Dr. Cryan stated.</p></speech>

The witnesses have spent the past number of hours explaining that one will get a diagnosis if one is testing for the disease itself or the body's reaction to antibodies.  How can somebody go to Timbuktu and get tested and receive a positive diagnosis without one of these two things?</p></speech>

It depends on what one is seeking.  If a particular test seeks antibodies and another test examines stimulated cells, the two tests seek different things which may have come from the same source.  There will always be some tests which are slightly divergent.  Another spirochetal disease is very similar to Lyme disease and has three phases.  We screen for this and do two other tests afterwards.  Quite frequently we have divergent results because each test examines different things.<br/>Some of the earlier Lyme disease enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, ELISAs, were non-specific because in the earlier tests the ELISA sought antibodies to the entire bacterium.  They have been defined and refined.  We have many spirochetes, which <i>borrelia</i>is, in our mouth.  They are common organisms and there are many common bits to them for which people can develop antibodies.  We need to use an assay which takes out these common bits and focuses on the specific <i>borrelia</i>bit.  There can also be differences because there are different species in Europe and the United States.  This has all been gone into in considerable detail, so the available assays, including the one we use, is up there with the best internationally and the most accepted.</p></speech>

There are false positives and false negatives and the activated lymphocyte assay is not internationally standardised and is not recommended by the IDSA or the CDC in the United States.  For these reasons we do not use it, because it is not an internationally approved assay.</p><p>  To answer the question on antibiotics, if I phone a general practitioner with a strong positive result for somebody with a facial nerve palsy, which is one of the neurological manifestations which comes on reasonably early in Lyme disease, it will be sent to the reference laboratory.  I know it will take three weeks to come back so I will suggest the patient is treated so the Lyme disease will be treated as early as possible.  The result from the reference laboratory is likely to be positive and the person will have completed treatment by the time the result comes back.  If the result is not confirmed then the facial palsy has another cause, although we would repeat the serology six weeks later to be sure.  If it is Lyme disease, it will have been treated as early as possible, which reduces the long-term complications.</p><p>  There is a suggestion that if someone with an infective illness is treated early, the antibody response can be blunted so the person does not develop as many antibodies as would be the case if he or she got the full disease.  This is in theory, but in practice it does not really happen.  Many people are well treated for infections but they still have many antibodies.</p></speech>

Many conditions make it very difficult for one to diagnose anything serologically.  In the reference laboratory in which I worked, if we had a positive test for Lyme disease, we tested for three or four other illnesses to exclude them because one can have cross-reacting antibodies.  We ensured the antibodies were due to the <i>borrelia</i>and not due to another spirochete, rheumatoid arthritis or a connective tissue infection.</p></speech>
