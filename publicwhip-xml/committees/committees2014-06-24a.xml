    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400003#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee today.  I am Peter O'Brien, chairman of the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, DIGI.  My day job is corporate relations director for Diageo in western Europe.  I am accompanied by Ms Marie Byrne, entrepreneur, who is in the process of establishing a new whiskey distillery in the heart of Dublin's Liberties, and Mr. Willie Masterson, who was last year's champion malted barley farmer.  We are here as representatives of the 92,000 others like us throughout Ireland who depend on the drinks industry for their livelihood and to talk about ways in which this influential committee can seek to support the drinks industry as we look to the future with a lot of excitement and ambition.</p><p>  I will give the committee a brief overview of the drinks industry in Ireland before we use the opportunity provided to us to focus in on the significant opportunity that exists for Irish whiskey at present and what that means for the agricultural economy in this country.</p><p>  Broadly, the drinks industry can be split into two parts: manufacturing and distribution, which includes the retail and wholesale sectors as well as the on-trade and off-trade.  The distribution side is extremely employment intensive and acts as a centrepiece of communities throughout the country.  However, the manufacturing side will be of greater interest to the members as this is the side of the industry which provides demand for 50,000 apples, 200,000 tonnes of barley and 300 million litres of milk every year.  These purchases support the livelihood of 12,000 farm families throughout Ireland and are a vital part of the agricultural economy of this country.</p><p>  In recent years, Ireland has seen a decline in the overall number of manufacturing jobs in the economy as the country moves towards a more service-based economy.  In contrast, the drinks manufacturers have been looking to invest in Ireland over recent years.  My company, Diageo, is looking forward to opening its &euro;168 million refurbishment of St. James' Gate and the new brewhouse in September, and our colleagues in Jameson have recently completed a &euro;200 million upgrade to their Midleton production site.  However, projects of this scale are being called into question by the Government's repeated targeting of alcohol taxes come budget time.  When assessing the viability of investing in Ireland, global boardrooms use tax as a critical determinant of the business situation and, unfortunately, Ireland's alcohol tax policy is now deemed hostile by many.</p><p>  It is not hard to see why these global boardrooms might be wary of Ireland's recent decisions on alcohol tax.  In less than 12 months, between December 2012 and October 2013, the Government increased excise on beer by 44%, on spirits by 37%, and on wine by 62%.  A report by EUROSTAT last week showed that hard-pressed Irish consumers are now paying the highest alcohol prices in Europe, although it should be noted that this is not through any action by the drinks industry.  The average Irish drinker drinks the same as the average German drinker.  In Ireland, such a drinker pays &euro;733 a year in alcohol related tax while a comparable drinker in Germany pays &euro;302.</p><p>  The drinks industry in this country has a rich heritage and there is a strong commitment to supporting local producers.  A recent DIGI report identified that the drinks industry purchases a far greater share of its inputs locally than other industries.  In 2013, the drinks industry spent &euro;1.1 billion on Irish produce, most of which was on barley and milk from quality Irish farms like the one run by Mr. Masterson.</p><p>  I will now hand over to Ms Byrne, who will give the committee a flavour of the exciting opportunities facing the drinks industry in Ireland over the coming years, particularly in relation to Irish whiskey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Byrne" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400004#E00100"><p>Irish whiskey was once the most successful spirits category in the world with more than 12 million 9 litre cases being sold every year in the mid-19th century.  For a variety of reasons Irish whiskey was left lagging behind its international competitors and by the 1980s there were only two distilleries in the country of the 88 that had been operating during the glory years.  Irish whiskey, however, is on the way back.  There are now 20 distilleries all over the island at various stages of construction or production and last year 6.2 million 9 litre cases of Irish whiskey were exported.  That is a little over half of the total sold a century ago so there is still plenty of room for growth, which businesses like mine want to expand into in the coming years.  We are doing this by focusing on building brilliant brands with global consumer appeal, offering an alternative to Scotch and Bourbon whiskies.  Irish whiskey is the fastest-growing spirit in the world and has carved out its own niche in the global spirits market, relying on the traditional craft of Irish distilling with an authentic and welcoming heritage, from a country universally acknowledged for its premium agricultural produce and underpinned by high quality whiskey product with a distinctive taste and broad appeal.</p><p>  The growth of Irish whiskey is of obvious relevance to this committee given that malting barley is the central ingredient.  Mr. Masterson will outline what the growth of Irish whiskey means for farmers and the importance of malting barley as a crop but I want to focus on another angle.</p><p>  Whiskey is a fantastic product but it is a complex one to bring to market.  I am involved with the Dublin Whiskey Company, a new distillery that is setting up in the Liberties in Dublin.  We bought the site in 2012, but it will be 2015 before we start construction on our historic mill building, due to a lengthy planning process, and therefore it will be late 2019 before we are ready to sell whiskey.  The building purchase and renovation, capital equipment, running costs for several years and marketing are all paid out long before any sales occur.  In our case that is approximately &euro;10 million.  That is a very tough financial journey and a huge barrier to entry.  That is why alternative revenue streams like whiskey tourism are so vital to the industry.  There are already several important whiskey tourism venues in Ireland which attract 600,000 visitors every year.  I am delighted to say that the new distilleries plus other new attractions, such as the Irish Whiskey Museum add to the potential for this category which could easily surpass the 1.2 million whiskey tourists who visit Scotland annually. </p><p>  The whiskey industry requires a holistic approach in order to nurture small distilleries, such as my own Dublin Whiskey Company, through the difficult period before we can market our product which will be mainly for export.  To size the prize, the Scotch export market is worth approximately &pound;4.3 billion annually.  Once we are able to sell our product we need to be able to rely on a robust home market before we can scale to export.  At the moment Government policy does not allow this to be a realistic option.  We are now in the bizarre position that Ireland is one of the most expensive places in the word to buy Irish whiskey with the Government taking 68% of the retail price of an average bottle of whiskey in this country.  In fact the &euro;17.37 tax take on a bottle of Jameson in Ireland is more than the total retail price of that same bottle in New York at &euro;16.61.  This not only prevents us from establishing a foothold in our domestic market but also prevents our brand from building a relationship with tourists when they are here as those tourists think we are trying to rip them off.  The high price of alcohol was the second most cited negative feature of Ireland in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s recent research, after the weather.  I am not suggesting that this committee can do anything about the weather but surely it can help us to be more competitive with rival destinations such as Scotland.  We should be very excited and extremely proud of the current offerings and what is coming down the road, where the breadth of Irish whiskey available to consumers is undoubtedly exciting.  Our single malts, blends and the cream of the crop, the uniquely Irish pot still, all deserve global recognition. </p><p>  I will now hand over to Willie Masterson who will talk about the importance of the drinks industry to his farm, and to farming in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Masterson" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400004#E00200"><p>I am a tillage farmer from near Bunclody, County Wexford.  I have been farming for 25 years and the farm has been in the hands of my family since 1919.  It was a mixed farm, cattle, tillage and sheep, until 20 years ago.  Then we concentrated on sugar beet and malting barley and as the committee knows, the sugar beet disappeared nine years ago.  We then changed over to farming 90% malting barley and 10% hay.  If the drinks companies did not demand the malting barley we would have been in a very tricky spot.  Our farm also borders the River Slaney and the Slaney valley has been recognised across Europe as a quality area for growing malting barley.  For as long as I can remember barley has been a vital crop on our farm, primarily because we can always rely on demand from big drinks companies such as Guinness and Irish Distillers.</p><p>  I was delighted to hear of the huge surge in global demand for Irish whiskey.  I have always thought it strange that Scotland &ndash; a country not much bigger than our own &ndash; should have such a reputation for a product that we produce here with the best possible ingredients.  The Irish Whiskey Association has said it wants to double the amount of Irish whiskey exports by 2020, and double those exports again by 2030.  I commend Ms Byrne and the others like her around the country who are taking a risk and setting up businesses which will be able to export quality Irish whiskey around the world.</p><p>  This increase in the global demand for Irish whiskey will mean a fourfold increase in demand for the ingredients that go into producing that whiskey, like the malting barley that comes from our farm.  At a time when the prices for many farm products is falling, for example, the price of beef, this would provide much needed security for farms like ours.  Leaving a steady demand for malting barley gives farmers a bit of certainty when they are planning for the future.  Big capital investments such as those in St James&rsquo; Gate and Middleton give us a bit of confidence that the drinks producers will be buying malting barley in Ireland for years to come.  Having that certainty is a big boost for people like us who were badly affected when the sugar beet factory closed up.</p><p>  Over 35,000 tonnes of malting barley were sold to the drinks industry by farmers in County Wexford last year, and 500 tonnes of that came from our farm.  I look forward to working with the likes of Mr. O'Brien and Ms Byrne to make sure that through growing the global demand for Irish whiskey we can make that number even more impressive next year, and every year after that.</p><p>  Before I hand back to Mr. O'Brien I will make a couple of points about the drinks industry here.  The drinks industry is employing people in every parish in this country.  I know that there is a lot of talk of economic recovery at the moment but in County Wexford there are still a lot of people out of work and those who have jobs need to keep them.  There are nearly 3,000 jobs in Wexford dependent on the drinks industry and they need to be supported by Government.  I and my fellow malt and barley growers are very proud to be a part of the drinks industry, which is an Irish industry that has a rich heritage in our county and country.</p><p>  The drinks industry has produced iconic brands and its products are enjoyed by people from all over the world.  It also focuses on purchasing its materials domestically from farmers like us.  Heineken and Guinness can boast that 100% of the barley used in their beer production in Ireland is grown in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Brien" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400004#E00300"><p>The drinks industry is a vital part of the agricultural economy of this country.  Since this Government took office it has consistently made the industry a target at budget time which has made an already difficult situation worse.  A total of 80% of the increase in the price of a pint since 2011 has gone directly to the Exchequer.  Since 2012 the tax on 1,000 cases of wine has increased by &euro;18,000, a cost that has to be borne up front by importers, distributors and restaurants until the product reaches the final consumer.  Given the current problem of access to credit in Ireland, this &euro;18,000 has to be soaked up in cashflow, leaving less money for small businesses, such as independent off-licences to invest in growth or their staff.</p><p>  The industry is now on the cusp of a period of growth.  Pubs, off-licences, restaurants and hotels that have come through the recession have had to innovate to survive and are therefore well placed to take advantage of the expected upturn in economic growth.  Drinks related tourism is booming, and the pub remains the biggest attraction to tourists thinking of visiting Ireland, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The committee has heard about the resurgence in Irish whiskey and the very real opportunities that offers to Irish farmers.</p><p>  The right policy choices by Government can ensure that this growth potential is realised over the coming years.  We are asking this committee to use its considerable influence to call for a reversal of last year&rsquo;s punitive 20% excise increase to support jobs, tourism and hard-pressed Irish consumers.  Excise is a tax we simply cannot afford.</p> <p>Excise is a tax that we simply cannot afford.<br/>I am sure many committee members have read the report published yesterday by the Health Research Board on alcohol consumption.  We welcome the report.  It is a long time since we have had such clear data on alcohol in Ireland and I congratulate the Health Research Board on producing it.  We need to reflect on some of the headlines printed this morning.  A key finding of the report is that 74% of people either do not drink or drink once a week or less in Ireland.  In the face of some rather ridiculous headlines in our newspapers today, I wish to repeat that 74% of people in this country either do not drink or drink once a week or less and 26% drink more than once a week.  One must ask how we ended up with headlines which state 1.3 million people in Ireland are binge drinkers.  The World Health Organization gives us the answer, as its AUDIT-C screening tool is the definition used.  It might be jargon to you and I but what it means is if one drinks three pints or more once a month, one is classified as a harmful drinker.<br/>Members of the drinks industry are painfully aware of the fact there is an issue with alcohol abuse in Ireland.  We have invested millions in <i>drinkaware.ie</i>, the only health promotion campaign on the issue in this country, and individual companies continue to invest in programmes throughout the country.  We are eager to work with the Government to implement targeted evidence-based policies which will work.  Classifying the entire Irish population as binge drinkers is not a helpful way to tackle a serious issue and nor is a blanket increase in alcohol taxes.  Such increases simply punish moderate drinkers, cost jobs and make our tourist offerings less competitive while doing nothing to alleviate the pain of those abusing alcohol.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400005#F00200"><p>Unfortunately, I must leave shortly as I must attend another meeting.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  This is a complicated issue and I would like some factual information.  Do the witnesses have information on the total value of alcoholic drinks sold in Ireland every year?  What is the value of imported and domestically-produced alcoholic drinks?  What is the value to the economy of alcoholic drink exports?  If we had this information, we could quantify somewhat the impact of taxes.  Tax is put on imported as well as domestically-produced alcoholic drinks, but domestic excise tax does not go on exported drinks and has no effect on the ability of people to sell worldwide.</p><p>  I have been involved in tax formulation.  We cannot walk away from the fact that abuse of alcohol is a major problem in the country and costs our health system and economy billions.  More importantly, it causes huge misery in society.  It is fair to state it has been a serious contributory factor to high levels of suicide.  To think this is a one-way street is simplistic; it is a highly complicated subject and we as politicians must consider every side of the story.  Of course the drinks industry it important for the economy, but if we are honest it is also an important drain on the economy.  When we make decisions, we must do so in the cold light of day and take everything into account.  In defence of my colleagues of all parties, we have been trying for many years to grapple with the problems caused by alcohol.  As constituency politicians, all of us have seen the violence and misery heaped on people by the abuse of alcohol.  I cannot forget this and put it out of my mind when I come to a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  A politician must consider all of the consequences of his or her actions.</p><p>  I have huge time for publicans.  If I had a choice between having people drink at home where there is no control and young people buying all types of alcohol and consuming it in strange places, or having people drink in the controlled atmosphere of a pub, I would much prefer the latter where, from my experience, publicans try to act responsibly.  I favour shifting the burden of tax on alcohol and see much more tax, such as a packaging tax, on alcohol in off-licences.  We should encourage people to drink in a social way with more controls.</p><p>  Another issue that must be faced when collecting money is what should be taxed.  Germany was mentioned, but it probably has much higher taxes on private properties than we do.  A government must consider whether to place tax on items which are socially positive to tax, such as cigarettes.  Many people agree this discourages smoking.  When I consider taxes on alcohol, I would like a tax which would stop young people walking out of shops with van-fulls of alcohol under their arms, causing them and those around them harm.</p><p>  I am in favour of curbing sponsorship by drinks companies and banning some of the advertising which is very focused on young people.  Such advertising creates a view that one cannot have a good time unless one is half langers.  I have argued this point previously with the drinks industry.  I understand the importance of the drinks industry and I am not a teetotaller.  However, the presentation we heard was quite simplistic.  When I make decisions or recommendations, or have an input as an Opposition parliamentarian, I must be absolutely clear that I will take a very cautious and balanced view on the issue because of all the issues I face every day of the week, this is not a one-way street.  If we remove tax from drink we could rebalance it significantly, but what does the drinks industry suggest we tax in replacement?  If tax is removed from drink, something else will have to be taxed because the Exchequer does not have enough money to begin abolishing taxes.  We as politicians should be very open about the fact this is the equation.  I am interested to hear from the witnesses what they think we should tax as an alternative to removing the total tax take from alcohol, particularly taking the huge social cost into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400005#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations which were interesting to say the least.  I was intrigued when I heard the witnesses wanted to address the committee on the importance of the industry to Irish agriculture.  I was interested to hear the pitch and it has not disappointed me.  It is ironic the drinks industry is presenting to the committee to make the case drink is over-taxed in Ireland on the day the report by the Health Research Board was published.</p> <p>That is a fallacy when it is estimated that drink-related illnesses cost the Exchequer &euro;3.7 billion a year.  According to the Minister's figures, the country is only taking in &euro;3.2 billion in taxation on alcohol.  There is a case to increase the taxation to perhaps make it pay for what it costs us as a society to deal with the health issues that arise as a result of alcohol abuse.  I understand that farmers make a livelihood from selling malt and barley to the drinks industry.  The drinks industry exports to countries where much more responsible drinking takes place than is the case here but, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, that cannot be divorced from the reality that we face every day in terms of the way alcohol is abused in our society.</p><p> According to figures out today, only 26% of people drink more than once a week but that is a huge volume of alcohol for that small proportion of people.  If we got down to what would be a healthy level of alcohol consumption, the figure of 11.9 litres per person per annum would reduce significantly, but would the drinks industry representatives be coming in here complaining about how difficult it is to survive because the volume of alcohol being consumed has declined to a healthy rate?  Those are the problems we face.</p><p> The investment being made by Diageo and Irish Distillers was cited, and the difficulty taxation is causing for those companies.  They are investing to export and excise duty levels will not affect them.  Therefore, it is disingenuous to cite those investments being put at risk by domestic taxation.  Approximately 70% of Guinness produced here - it will probably be more when the new factory is completed - is exported.  Ninety per cent of Baileys is exported, and I am sure 80% or 90% of Jameson and other Irish whiskeys are exported also, therefore, the taxation argument does not factor in with regard to the investment decisions those companies are making.  They are like all multinational companies in that they make their decisions based on corporation tax and so on.  They are not looking at the domestic argument.</p><p> The same arguments were made by the pharmaceutical companies when we considered bringing in reference pricing for drugs in the health sector.  They said they would leave Ireland if they had to pay a proper price for their drugs.  The domestic market is not the deciding factor for their presence here.  The taxation provisions they get and the access to other markets is the reason they are here, not because they are looking to make a great deal of money from the domestic market.</p><p> I agree that we should examine rebalancing taxation to make it more expensive to purchase in off-licences and to encourage people to go back to the pub because drinking in a pub is more socially acceptable.  The vast majority of drinking that takes place now is at home in people's sitting rooms where there is very little control of it.  We may not have had perfect control of drinking in pubs, but there is no control in terms of people drinking in their own homes.</p><p> There is no doubt that farmers and many others depend on the alcohol business for their livelihood but we must examine the overall impact of the drinks industry, and how we strike a balance in that regard is the key.  We might have to look at rebalancing the tax on off-sales as against pub sales.  That might do something to help protect jobs in the pub business but it cannot be divorced from the harm alcohol abuse is doing in society, and drinks companies have a role to play in dealing with that harm.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400006#G00300"><p>If it were the case that we had comfortable pubs with cheery fireplaces where people could have a nice glass of whiskey and then leave, we would be cheerleaders supporting everything the witnesses do but as my colleagues outlined clearly, unfortunately, that is not the world in which we live.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the complexity of the scenario, and I concur with that.  It is not that we do not support entrepreneurs and people like Mr. O'Brien going out and trying to create a business.  We do, but in this case he knows he will always be in this dilemma in that the cost to the Exchequer of the downside of alcohol consumption is a large one, and there is no mention of that here.  Mr. O'Brien has tip-toed through the middle and said the industry cannot put up with this.  On the other hand, how will we fund looking after those people?  The tax has to be garnered somewhere.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien spoke about the huge surge in demand for Irish whiskey and said it was the fastest growing spirit in the world, or words to that effect.  It is a growing industry.  The witnesses are part of an industry that is not declining.  It is growing, as per their own evidence, and by the sounds of it the industry will continue to grow.  That is an irony when we are examining the cost to the Exchequer of caring for those people who have problems with alcohol.  If any of the witnesses have sat in an accident and emergency department or spoken to either a general practitioner or a consultant in any hospital, they will tell them that the cost is enormous.  They can pluck as many figures out of the air as they wish and say the figure is only 1%, two people or whatever but it is a sufficient number of people, and we know we have a problem.</p><p>  While I accept the witnesses support the DrinkAware campaign, I would argue that is not sufficient, that the DrinkAware campaign is a small part of what needs to be done, that alcohol producers have a major responsibility, and that the DrinkAware campaign must be stronger and have more invested in it not necessarily money, but in terms of its creativity and capacity to reach people.  I am not sure it is doing all it can do, but that might be an argument for another day.</p><p>  If the levels at which the excise is now set is not acceptable, what is acceptable to the witnesses?  The final line in Mr. O'Brien's script states that excise is a tax that we simply cannot afford.  I disagree entirely.  I believe his industry can afford it.  His evidence suggests that his industry is part of a growing market across the world.  There is a great tradition here.  With a new industry and a product that has never been sold previously, he has a great deal of opportunity.  What does he believe the industry can afford?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400006#G00400"><p>I thank the representatives for attending today.  I am disappointed with the approach taken.  I expected a slightly different presentation when the witnesses are appearing before an agricultural committee.  It is important to highlight taxation issues here.  They may be better suited to the finance committee but we are all legislators and I am happy to touch on those issues.  I had expected a more agricultural focus.  Mr. Masterson's presentation was interesting but I had expected to hear more about the challenges and demands facing the agriculture sector to allow us reach the potential Ms Byrne has in her company and in growing the export potential, both in whiskey and other products.</p><p>  Leaving aside the agricultural element, I am concerned that Mr. O'Brien played down the challenges we must face in tackling the drinking culture.  In terms of the World Health Organization's categorisation of a harmful drinker, we can decide on the best description of a harmful drinker but the upshot of what he is suggesting is that this country does not have a drinking culture.  No one in this House can afford to take that approach, and we must be fair and balanced in the way we approach such issues.</p><p>  A number of issues impact upon this area.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Bill is before the House.  The ban on below cost sales of alcohol was lifted a number of years ago and we have seen its impact in terms of the number of sales of alcohol in off-licences, which was addressed earlier.  The level of drinking that takes place at home is not a healthy development.</p> <p>To an extent the pub is a regulated environment.  Therefore, the move away from pubs due to the availability of large volumes of cheap alcohol in supermarkets is not a healthy thing for the country.</p><p> I have adopted a balanced approach to the matter and do not support the banning of sponsorship of sporting events by drinks companies.  Last weekend we had a golf event that we could be very proud of which does not have a main sponsor.  However, I do not believe the argument put forward that it would be easy to find sponsors from other areas.  I disagree with the idea that one could take the likes of Punchestown and the Curragh racecourse and not allow them the option of availing of sponsorship by a drinks company because Cheltenham and Aintree could still be beamed, via telecommunications, into every house in Ireland with advertisements by drinks companies displayed everywhere.  Therefore, I do not think a ban here would have the desired effect.  We need a balanced approach and I am hopeful for one. </p><p> I am very excited about the potential of growth in the Irish whiskey industry, in particular, and its international demand.  That demand needs to be international because of the kind of figures that have been talked and the growth in the number of distilleries around the country.  However, if the demand is based on consumption here then such a development will cause its own problems.  </p><p> The delegation is right that Irish whiskey is sexy again and we need to look at how best to support it.  From that perspective, and getting back to the agricultural element, I ask Ms Byrne the following questions.  What challenges will we face with an increased output of quality Irish whiskey?  How can we maximise the return?  What challenges does she envisage for the input side?  What demands will be placed on the agricultural sector?  What raw materials will distilleries need into the future?  How many more Willie Mastersons will we need to provide that element and meet  the challenges?  </p><p> I am a Deputy for Kildare South and Boortmalt is based in Athy.  There are plenty of malt and barley growers around.  They do not all need to be located near the River Slaney and there are plenty of them around Athy as well.  The sector is a vital part of the drinks sector.  Many farmers who live near me grow malt and barley.  My one criticism is that the link between Diageo and the farmer seems to have gone.  The farmers deal with Boortmalt and Boortmalt deals with Diageo and never the twain shall meet.  Something has been lost from that situation and farmers are frustrated as a result.</p><p> Obviously it costs more to grow malt and barley.  Locally, a lot of farmers had their barley ruled out because of high protein levels last year and I presume a significant amount of barley had to be imported.  The farmers who had invested in the extra costs to grow malt and barley ended up only having barley suitable for feed purposes.  I am not sure how aware Diageo was of the impact that situation had on farmers and Mr. Masterson is probably aware of a similar situation in Wexford.  There is a challenge in that sector.  It is important that Diageo reconnects with the farmer through some form of communication.</p><p> I wish to mention another element and inputs regarding the growth of whiskey.  Mr. Masterson touched on the huge loss caused by the demise of the sugar industry a number of years ago.  I am aware that a new proposal for the sugar industry to return is being worked on behind the scene.  One element is the production of bioethanol which would also give us an option to produce alcohol.  That could be another important by-product from the sugar industry.  I would like to hear the views of the delegation on the matter.</p><p> I shall finish by returning to the initial point made by the delegation that the industry cannot afford the existing taxes.  As politicians we deal with different segments of society every day of the week who tell us they cannot afford the current range of taxes.  However, the country needs its present tax take in order to survive, get us back on an even keel and stop running a deficit.  Therefore, difficult choices must be made.  In talks to reduce a tax one must see the positive to be gained on the other side.  The presentation by the delegation focused very much on consumers in Ireland and the tax they pay.  I thought the focus should have been on the export potential of the drinks industry and the knock-on impact it could have on the agricultural sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400007#H00200"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I also wish to welcome the presentations.  If I were cynical I might think that this debate was about Diageo rather than anything else.  Let us think about this matter from an agricultural perspective.  I congratulate Ms Byrne on her initiative.  I know from having limited experience of a distillery that has been set up in my home town of Drumshambo, County Leitrim, that there is a long lead-in time.  The development is a great vote of confidence in the Irish drinks industry, the export market and her ability to expand same.  I wish her well in that regard.</p><p>  With regard the agricultural point of view, I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Heydon about the industry requiring 50,000 apples.  Where are the apples grown?  Are they all grown in Ireland?  Are they imported?  Are they all Irish apples?  Are they southern Irish apples?  I would prefer that they came from the island of Ireland rather than outside the area.  I am curious to learn that information.  From an economic point of view and on the subject of taxation, apples grown in the Republic of Ireland will yield money for the Exchequer but apples grown outside the jurisdiction will not.  That is the only reason that I made the distinction.  I am curious to know where the 50,000 apples come from and whether they are imported into the State.  Similarly, for the 200,000 tonnes of barley and 300 million litres of milk.  As Deputy Heydon asked, does that demand create a challenge?  My question might best be answered by Mr. Masterson.  Furthermore, has the increase in demand, plus the fact that 20 new distilleries are being set up and the expansion of Diageo and Irish distillers, put pressure on his group or contemporaries?  Has the increased demand provided an opportunity for more farmers to engage in the growing of malt barley?  </p><p>  I come from the wetter and damper part of the country.  Is malt barley better suited to a more pleasant climate?  Is the growing of the product confined to the south east and south midlands?</p><p>  In terms of a report published yesterday, my next question is on Mr. O'Brien's reference to three pints a month.  Please correct the following if I am wrong.  Yesterday, I listened to analysis of the report on radio which stated that the three pints referred to was three taken at the one time because the report referred to binge drinking.  It was also said that three pints equates to 80% of a bottle of wine consumed at the one time, not over a month.  That was the context of the three pints but perhaps I am wrong. </p><p>  Reference was made to a plea for reduced taxation.  At a time when the Irish tourism industry is expanding, increasing its numbers and therefore increasing employment, I find it hard to understand the argument put forward that taxation is a key component of an adverse impact on the tourism industry.  Perhaps the delegation might square the circle in that regard. </p><p>  My next questions concern drinking at home.  Does it matter to the drinks industry where that drink is bought?  Does it have a view on this?  In the context of its proposition here to support the Irish pub, perhaps the representatives of the drinks industry should spend some time and money on promoting the pub culture in this country as part of the tourist attraction.  That would be a better move rather than simply saying it is a good idea for people to drink in pubs.  Apart from the weather, most people come to Ireland to visit its pubs.  At the same time alcohol abuse seems to centre more on the non-pub consumption of alcohol because people drink at home having bought their alcohol in supermarkets and off-licences.  Does the industry have a view on the matter?  Or is it only concerned with its bottom line that results from increased consumption?  Does it have a role to play in helping the tourism industry and promoting the Irish pub culture?  The presentations centred on the tourism dimension and that is why I have asked these questions. </p><p>  I do not wish to give the impression that I do not understand and appreciate that the drinks industry provides employment and makes a very valuable contribution to the Irish economy through its taxation measures.  Also, I appreciate that people like Ms Byrne, and more like her, are expanding the export market which in turn will increase employment here.  I do not in any way underestimate the contribution made by the drinks industry.  However, I have often been of the view that sometimes the industry might act in a more practical manner, and perhaps more responsible manner, in terms of its presentations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400008#J00100"><p>I thank the delegation from the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, Mr. Peter O'Brien, Ms Marie Byrne and Mr. Willie Masterson, for making this very good presentation.  I echo Senator Mooney's closing words as I too admire the industry that creates economic benefits, employment and growth in the country.  I love wine and a glass of whiskey but as a member of the Oireachtas, we are all in the same boat and see the consequence of alcohol abuse in Ireland.  I wish that Senator John Crown was present because he is an expert in this area.  We have a cultural problem with alcohol that is a major health and economic problem.  The freshmen who will enter university at the end of the summer are late teenagers, basically just out of childhood, are pursued by branded drinks companies on social media to avail of cheap drink and cheap nights out and to become immersed in whatever brand is pursuing them.</p><p>  I know from my children of 18 and 20 years that the latest fad is the pre-drinking culture.  I am appalled at how cheap beer is in the supermarket.  The youngsters can buy beer and then go to the flat or apartment to drink it before continuing on to the cheap night out and only need to have one drink because they have already consumed it.  This is a significant risk for young people.  Young people face being exported because they are living in a joblessness state, and are also at risk because of the issue with alcohol.  I would have agreed with Deputy Heydon about sponsorship of sport.  The reality is that the 12 year old boy who is brought to a big rugby final or other sporting event, is wearing the green jersey with the name of the beer on it and sees his sporting heroes, who probably do not drink, but part of their contract is to have a glass or a bottle of the beer in their hand after they have won the match, is getting a subliminal message.  It is like McDonald's in that it is subliminal advertising that will link that child to alcohol.  I am not so sure that drinks companies should be sponsoring sport.  Some 20 years ago in Australia they banned all alcohol sponsorship of sport.  They also increased the taxation on alcohol and invested the yield from that tax in sponsoring the sport. </p><p>  I have great admiration for Ms Byrne's distillery.  I have a constituent, Bernard Walsh, who is building a distillery in Carlow.  He is another super entrepreneur.  Thank God for the rate of corporation tax in Ireland because I know from Mr. Walsh that one must wait a long time for the product and I admire Ms Byrne for being able to wait and to have to spend so much money before she gets the rewards.  Exports will generate the rewards.</p><p>  I was taken with the point that one can buy a bottle of Jameson in New York for $16 while it is more expensive to buy it in Ireland.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Perhaps we could consider introducing a tax rebate at the airport for tourists, so that we ensure that tourists can buy Ms Byrne's whiskey at the best price possible.</p><p>  Suicide in this country is at an all time high.  Half of the suicides are a result of alcohol.  St. Vincent's Hospital, which is the main centre for liver disease, has had a 335% increase in admissions since 1995.  One in four accident and emergency admissions is related to alcohol.  One in four brain trauma admissions is related to alcohol.  We have a problem.  I admire the drinks industry but could we join together with the drinks industry to help our culture recover and get back on a steady track so that we are not affecting our young people's health.  As Deputy Pringle said, we would also raise money to reinvest in the health service and educate people to drink properly in the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Brien" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400008#J00300"><p>I thank everybody for their passionate interest in our industry, which is great.  I feel that I am sitting between the two acceptable faces.  I am passionate about the drinks industry and what we do.  If Arthur Guinness had sat here 235 years ago, he might have been the Marie Byrne of his day.  He would have probably made a number of the same points.</p><p>  This is a very complex area.  I think it is unfair of people to suggest that we do not take the issue seriously and that we have not taken the issue seriously.  We talk at great length of the impact of drink.  We need to recognise that 92,000 people work in this industry.  They are exactly the same as the other people sitting around this table.  We are the same people as the members.  We are not some bunch who sit in a corner with the intention to wreak havoc on Ireland.  We are the brothers, sister, fathers - the same as everybody else.  We have families and face the same issues.  We try to do the best with our own kids.  We are not sitting here and saying we will make the situation really bad.  It is important to recognise that. </p><p>  I welcome all of the positive support for the pub.  The drinks industry group represents all the publicans in Ireland.  It is absolutely fantastic.  I would encourage everybody in this room to continue to promote the pub as a place.</p><p>  We talked about the tourism offering.  We have played a significant role in tourism.  All of the drinks companies have visitor centres offering massive tourism opportunities.  The Guinness Storehouse, as most know, is the largest visitor attraction in Ireland.  Now there is the Jameson distillery, Midleton whiskey tour and Liberties whiskey and many others.  I am sure Irish whiskey will be a major success.</p><p>  If I have an opportunity to make a request of the agencies, this committee, or the tourism authorities, I would ask them to note the tourism bodies in Ireland have air-brushed the pub out of all of their advertising.  They have decided somehow or other that alcohol is bad and not to do it.  From the F&aacute;ilte Ireland statistics, the No. 1 reason that people come to Ireland is to listen to music in a pub and the No. 3 reason is to drink a pint of Guinness in the pub.  The No. 1 reason they do not like coming to Ireland is the price of alcohol.  It is a very complex area and we need to look at it.  The pub is a fantastic offering.  All of the tourists who visit our pubs are responsible drinkers.  They do not come to our pubs to sit and get drunk, they come to enjoy our products.</p><p>  On the wider issue of alcohol.  This is a growing industry because we are finding that people such as Ms Byrne and others are creating great export opportunities.  Consumption of alcohol is down by more than 20% in the past ten years.  Irish people drink the same as the average of most European countries.  In my day job I get to travel around all of Europe.  We have the same debate in every country.  I think at times we want to build on our worldwide reputation for being drinkers to try to beat ourselves up a little bit more.  The same issues apply in all the other countries.  It is a very complicated area.  We have one of the highest rates of tax on drink in Europe and we are saying we have a major problem.  Spain has the lowest tax in Europe and they do not feel they have a similar problem.  There is a massive issue related to how we as a society educate people about alcohol and bring people with us.  It is very complicated.  We want to play our role and we do it passionately and we will continue to do it.</p><p>  The point about education is very well made and we are in constant discussions with the Department of Education and Skills on finding ways to teach people about alcohol at the appropriate age in schools.  We do not do that and I think we should do it. </p><p>  The accident and emergency service was mentioned.  I spent a shift in the accident and emergency department in St. James' Hospital.  I know what it is like.  I have done my 12 hours shift and worked with incredible people.  I compliment Professor Patrick Plunkett and his team on the amazing job they do.  It is a very complicated area, but it is not young people turning up in the accident and emergency department.  It is not one in four drunk people turning up for treatment.  When one goes to an accident and emergency department, there is no category that says "alcohol related".  As Professor Plunkett would tell the committee, the most important thing is to assess cases for whatever it might be.  Alcohol might be a factor, but it might not be a factor.  There are a core number of people who are chronically addicted to many substances, including alcohol.  They are heavy drinkers and they appear in the Health Research Board report and we need some targeted interventions to help people like that.</p> <p> It is neither fair nor accurate, however, to paint all drinkers with the same brush and claim that anybody who drinks at all is a binge drinker.  Definitions are no more than that and one may agree or disagree with them.  According to the World Health Organization definition, a binge drinker is anybody who drinks three pints in a single sitting in any one month.  In other words, a person who goes out and spends five hours in a pub and has three drinks, and does the same again the next month, is a binge drinker.  I am not saying the WHO is wrong in its definition, but I am saying we must be real about what it actually means and the message we are giving to people.  We should, in my view, be focusing on the much smaller percentage of hard core, seriously addicted drinkers and those who might be in the process of getting to that stage.  We are passionate about solving the problem of excessive drinking.  It is not good for us and it is not good for our industry.</p><p> Senator O'Keeffe asked what we would consider an acceptable rate of tax.  That is a matter for Government and is not for me to decide.  All I know is that we are paying the fourth highest rate in Europe and competitors in many other countries are paying much less than us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Byrne" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400009#K00200"><p>I will focus on my own experience, which is very much on the whiskey side of the house.  Deputy Heydon raised an interesting point regarding the opportunities and obstacles facing the burgeoning whiskey industry.  Education is vital.  Scotland has a fantastic educational institution, Heriot-Watt University, where people can study for a degree in distilling.  What I have in mind is the provision of a one-year masters or something like that for agriculture graduates.  Companies like mine would be delighted to take in young graduates and spend time giving them hands-on experience.  What we would get in return is access to the new and innovative ideas those graduates are learning about on a dedicated distilling course.  One lesson we have learned from the Scottish experience is that the Scotch Whisky Association is so rigid in its prescription of what Scotch whiskey should be that it is actually tending to stifle innovation.  Scotch is the category leader and we are chasing after it.  Embracing innovation is important in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the size of the whiskey export opportunity.  In 2013, exports from the Republic amounted to &euro;307 million, or &euro;350 million if one includes Northern Ireland.  In Scotland, exports of Scotch whisky are worth &pound;4.3 billion.  There is a huge gap to be bridged but the potential is there to do it.  As I said, education is a major issue.  There are massive opportunities around bioethanol, warehousing, increasing malt and barley production and so on.  There are probably not enough suppliers into the distilling business at this time.  If I had lots of money, the next business opportunity I would consider would be looking at other ways of getting a reduced price in bringing in malt and barley.  In addition, the smaller distilleries probably do not have the capability to bring in large tonnage of barley, especially in the city centre.  I can only take it in one-tonne bags.  New and innovative approaches in the malting industry present significant opportunities for growth.</p><p>  There also are real opportunities for growth in terms of employment.  For example, we are looking at a cost of &euro;10 million plus to get ourselves up and running and taking in at least 35 to 40 people in the next couple of years.  There is a knock-on effect for tourism.  We are located 600 m from St. Patrick's Cathedral, for instance, which gets 200,000 tourists annually.  We will be looking to attract some of those visitors as well as tourists who would come to Ireland specifically to visit a new distillery.  The interesting thing about brewery and whiskey tourists is that they are generally high net worth individuals who spend three or four additional nights in hotel rooms annually and have a higher net spend compared with other tourists.  There is a massive amount of research from brewers in the United States and Scotland that we can leverage.  When one considers that Scotland receives 1.2 million whiskey tourists per year, the size of the prize is clear.</p><p>  Senator Mooney asked where I would like to see our whiskey being sold.  I would not like to have spent more than five years developing what I hope to be an absolutely magnificent whiskey only to see it being sold in an off-licence at below cost by staff who do not have the expertise and attention to detail to educate customers about it.  We do not want to see publicans serving it who have not been trained and cannot advise a customer against throwing a large measure of cola on top.  With any premium product there is a requirement for those who sell or serve it to have a degree of expertise.  We certainly are not targeting under-age drinkers.  Given that our price point will be &euro;40 plus per bottle, I do not see any 16 year old choosing it over a &euro;7 flagon of vodka.  We are trying to promote a premium product.  My background is in agriculture and I have always been tremendously proud of the quality of our agricultural produce.  We have always punched above our weight in that regard.</p></speech>

Malting barley grows well on light soils, including the Clonroche series soils which spread all the way from Wexford as far as Athy.  Diageo introduced new rules this year which require that barley for distilling must be grown in soil that is under 9.5% protein and between 9.5% and 11% for malting.  The difficulty is that one might do the very same things this year that one did last year, but there is no guarantee the soil will be within that protein range.  It is essentially in the hands of the gods.  Having said that, some 110,000 tonnes are being produced at the moment for Boortmalt, with the latter estimating, given all the extras that are coming on stream, that it will not need any more than an additional 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes to cover the distilleries.  The 200,000 tonnes that were referred to earlier include Midleton and places like that.</p></speech>

We are specifically interested in the agronomics side of things.</p> <p> From the committee's point of view the report on the retail grocery sector is the most relevant to the sector, this in addition to the economic aspect, that is, growing the products and ensuring the export markets are developed, whether it is through Bord Bia and various outlets abroad.  The witnesses have got the feedback from committee members, in the context of our report, concerning the way in which alcohol is being used as a loss leader.  It would be better to ban alcohol advertising in the newspapers.  Only 20% to 25% of sales are through independent off-licence operators the rest is through the major large multiples.  That is the real problem.  We have a very concentrated drinking problem in Ireland.  The reasons for this are not simple but they can be identified and addressed.  That is what we should go after.  Part of the problem is the pricing structure, including the taxation structure.  If that issue was targeted realistically, one could then consider alternative ways of targeting taxation.  It was the drinks industry - perhaps not the witnesses who are present - who asked that the cost of a bottle of wine be increased by &euro;1 as opposed to putting a tariff on a pint in the lead-up to the budget when there was a realisation that we were in the middle of difficult budgetary choices.  At the time that was the preferred choice.  People may disagree with that but that was the response at the time.  I have to call a halt as there are two other presentations.  We had intended to finish at about 4.30 p.m.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee at relatively short notice.</p></speech>

I thank them for appearing before the committee to speak on the agri-taxation review.  Just to explain, some members of the committee have had to go to the Seanad and hope to be back but I hope that a couple of others members will be here.  We considered it important to invite the witness to make a presentation so that it will go on the record.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular mater and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I propose to take both presentations together, Mr. Patrick Kent following Mr. Kieran O'Dowd.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Kent" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400010#L00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to the agri-taxation review, announced in last year&rsquo;s budget.  The ICSA believes that a progressive agriculture sector requires a tax regime which incentivises hard work and entrepreneurial spirit; assists those who have invested in developing and expanding their farms; supports efficient farm transfer between the generations without punitive capital taxes; features VAT, excise duty and carbon tax that makes Irish agriculture more competitive; and encourages long-term land leasing, farm partnerships, land consolidation and installation of young farmers.</p><p>  We need long-term views not short-term gains when it comes to agri-taxation.  By that we mean that the right tax incentives which lead to better land mobility, encourage young farmers to take over and support better farming structures will ultimately lead to greater tax take in the long run.  However, even the best taxation policy cannot solve all of the problems faced by the low income dry stock sectors and I would be failing in my responsibilities to cattle and sheep farmers if I did not point out that we need to tackle the income crisis in these sectors as a priority.  For some farmers however, their choice will be to look at alternatives to continuing to lose money on current enterprises and for them, we must look at the tax implications of such decisions.  </p><p>  Before I outline some of the key points made in our submission on the agri-taxation review, I wish to clearly state that the ICSA is resolutely opposed to any talk of land taxes.  Farmers, like everyone else in society, should be expected to pay tax in line with their earnings and their ability to pay.  We know and understand that the overall taxation context is heavily influenced by external pressure to balance budgets and by the need to ensure we can borrow from international markets.  </p><p>  However, it is also important to appreciate that increased taxes are acting as a deterrent to hard work and investment.  It is an article of faith that there can be no increase in the 12.5% corporation tax rate because any increase would cost jobs and threaten foreign investment.  Yet there seems to be no problem with taxing sole traders or self-employed people who are not incorporated at 52% on marginal income above &euro;32,800.  This is particularly severe in the context of enterprises trying to pay down principal on borrowings out of after-tax income.  Accelerated capital allowances have been phased out, for example, the three years for farm waste management scheme expenditure, and there are no allowances for land purchase.  Farm income volatility is also a huge issue that is impacted by tax levels.  As volatility increases, farmers who have profit in a good year should ideally set aside some of this for the almost inevitable downturn in future years.  However, saving money to invest in the business should be regarded as prudent but instead it is actively discouraged by DIRT rates of 41% and, more importantly, by high tax levels on profits.</p><p>  The ICSA submits that &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo; planning should be encouraged as an alternative to income averaging.  This would be facilitated by allowing an unincorporated farmer to invest a proportion of profits in a good year tax free into a special account, which could be accessed in future years for one of three options: for living expenses in a bad year which would be subject to normal income taxation; for investment in land purchase or farm development; and to cover exceptional costs such as extra feed in an extreme weather event.  The key objective here should be that young farmers taking over the family farm should not be burdened with a potentially crippling tax bill at a time when they need all the finance they can get to make a go of the business.</p> <p> From 6 December 2012, the Group A parent-child tax-free threshold was reduced to &euro;225,000, progressively down from &euro;434,000 in 2009, while the capital gains tax, CGT, rate has been increased incrementally, from 20% to 33%.  Both of these measures increased the risk of significant tax liabilities for farmers who take over the family farm, either by way of gift or inheritance.  These changes mean that a young farmer taking over the farming business where land and other assets exceed &euro;2.5 million is at risk of a substantial tax liability on the excess at a rate of 33%.</p><p> On the other side, on capital gains tax retirement relief, budget 2012 provided for the introduction at the end of 2013 of a new upper limit of &euro;3 million where the person transferring is aged over 66.  While it is desirable to encourage early transfer of land, it is not always possible or desirable to do so.  A potential CGT hit for those farmers over 66 years could have the perverse effect of encouraging holding on to the land until death.</p><p> In general, ICSA is concerned that the trend in recent budgets has been to expose more farms to greater risk of capital taxes on transfer, which we regard as harmful to the overall objective of a young farming population.  ICSA has welcomed the general reduction in stamp duty to 2%.  There is a special rate of 1% for transfers between blood relatives and 0% for young trained farmers.  However, these rates are temporary and we would like to see them established on a more permanent basis.</p><p> Stock relief is vital for farms, which are expanding.  We would like to see stock relief rules in place on a more permanent basis.  We welcomed the introduction of farm restructuring relief.  However, there are two problems here.  First, the relief is only available until 31 December 2015 &ndash; this needs to be extended indefinitely.  There is no reason for a short-term incentive; farms can only be restructured when the opportunity arises and when it coincides with the financial wherewithal.  Second, the relief does not provide for sale and purchase of entire farms.  However, it is clear that in many cases this will be the most efficient route to consolidating a farm holding.  ICSA, therefore, submits that such transactions should also be facilitated.</p><p> The exemption of certain income from long-term leasing of agricultural land applies a number of restrictions on qualifying lessees.  ICSA submits that this is unduly restrictive and is hindering stated Government policy on land mobility and the facilitation of partnerships and collaborative arrangements.  Specifically, it is not possible to avail of the relief on income up to &euro;12,000 in the case of five-to-seven year leases, &euro;15,000 on leases of seven to ten years and &euro;20,000 on leases greater than ten years where the lessee is a company or where the lessee is "a person with whom the lessor is in partnership".  The uptake of the tax relief has been low suggesting that it is not achieving its purpose.  A key reason is that many farmers are very reluctant to commit to the total loss of control over their land for an extended period.</p><p> ICSA submits that it is highly desirable to encourage older farmers to consider entering into partnerships with young qualified farmers.  This is a more desirable option for some farmers who do not wish to retire totally and where a partnership could potentially bring much greater benefits in terms of developing a farm, and facilitating the involvement of young farmers on a collaborative or partnership arrangement.</p><p> In cases of genuine registered partnerships, there is a need to ensure both partners can achieve a reasonable economic outcome.  It is also necessary to ensure that the relief for long-term leasing does not conspire to undermine the option of partnership.  However, at present, the rules mean that land cannot be leased to a partner and therefore the older farmer is faced with rejecting the partnership option in favour of long-term leasing to a third party, with whom there is no collaboration.  In turn, the older farmer may see that as undesirable as there is no involvement in sharing experience, keeping some control over the management of the farm or participating in the development of a business that will be more efficient under a partnership model and potentially more likely to facilitate new trained entrants compared with simply leasing out to the highest bidder.</p><p> ICSA submits that there is an urgent need to support more land mobility and that the preferred route should be through partnership.  Accordingly, the long-term leasing tax incentive should also allow that qualifying lessees would no longer exclude a person who is in a registered farm partnership with the lessor and a company which has been set up for the purposes of a farming partnership arrangement and where there is a registered farm partnership in place involving a second partner who is not a family relation of the lessor.</p><p> ICSA also submits that the long-term leasing incentives need to be pushed more.  We suggest that the highest level of leasing income exemption of &euro;20,000 which currently applies to leases in excess of ten years should be allowed for leases of five to seven years for a once-off period of three years with a view to encouraging older farmers to move away from conacre.  We believe that the current ten-year requirement for this is too daunting.</p><p> The increase in carbon tax in recent budgets has not helped the viability of farms and agricultural contractors.  Excise duties are also damaging.  The double tax refund available against the carbon tax is extremely cumbersome and not well understood.  It is manifestly preferable to simply reduce carbon tax and excise duties on agricultural fuel.</p><p> ICSA believes that the employee tax credit discriminates against the self-employed, including full-time farmers.  There is no longer any justification for this discrimination which potentially costs an individual full-time farmer &euro;1,650 in extra tax, assuming a tax liability.  ICSA believes that the employee tax credit should be replaced with an earned tax credit, in line with the Commission on Taxation, although it should be phased in quickly rather than over time.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that there are such a small number in attendance today.  We have met the members who are here on a number of occasions and know that they are supportive of young farmers.</p><p>  From our own point of view, we have made a submission as well and I will read it into the record.  At the start, we set the context: the need for food and agribusiness, the need for active farmers and the need for access to land.</p><p>  Ireland, as a farming community, is delivering food security.  It has the capacity to feed in excess of 30 million people, which is significantly greater than the population of this country.  As a result, our key emphasis is on delivering top-quality safe food for the export market as well as for our own market.  Also, in this country, we employing 150,000 directly, and many more indirectly, in the sector.  We export 85% of our food to over 160 countries.  It is a significant market and agriculture is a significant part of the Irish economy.</p><p>  The need for active farmers is where Macra na Feirme wants to step up to the plate.  At present, 7% of farmers are under the age of 35 and 45% are over 55.  In 2000, 13% of farmers were under 35.  The percentage under 35 has almost halved in 14 years.  If that trend is to continue, the future would be bleak for young farmers.  In order to grow the sector further, we believe measures need to be taken to ensure that young farmers are encouraged into the sector, and this agri-tax review will provide the forum for that.</p><p>  On the need for access to land, from our point of view there are a number of structural issues which need to be dealt with, particularly around land use in the area of leasing and disincentivisation of conacre.  As the Chairman will be aware, we completed a national land mobility study.  The study found that 45% of farmers over the age of 55 do not have anyone to take over the farm after them.  They may have children but they have no identified farming successor.  As a result, we established a land mobility service headed up by the Mr. Austin Finn, who is a chartered accountant and farmer with a BSc (Ag).  Mr. Finn has found in his work carried out since November that short-term land rental is a key issue and the conacre system is a major structural barrier.  Many farmers are afraid to rent on a long-term basis and no matter what work farm organisations such as ours do, we still need support from the Government and further incentivisation of the longer-term leases and disincentivisation of conacre.</p><p>  Outside of the family farm, there is little opportunity for a young person to get established in farming.  In our opinion, the tax code should favour the active use of land.  There is not as great a need for the tax code to favour inactive or non-farming land ownership.</p> <p>We need to farm the land to its full potential, whether through dairy, beef, suckler or forestry.  The majority of Irish farms are family farms which need to pass from one generation to the next over time.  This should not wait until the younger farmer has reached his or her late 50s because it is more difficult to make changes to the farm at that stage.  The capital taxation code has by and large been favourable to facilitating this without an excessive taxation burden.  That policy needs to continue.  Taxation measures favouring on farm investment, such as stock relief and accelerated capital allowances, have yielded a significant economic return to the Exchequer through increased output and productivity, as well as greater environmental protection.  Young farmer measures are important to facilitating the next generation of farmers to establish sustainable and viable farming enterprises.  The European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, has determined that farmers who are younger than 35 tend to show 40% more economic potential and utilise 37% more hectares of agricultural area.  This highlights the importance of ensuring the early transfer of farms to young farmers to help achieve Food Harvest 2020 and future growth.<br/>With approximately 6,250 leases currently claiming the tax relief on long-term leasing of land, the tax relief is not by itself resulting in a significant increase in long-term leasing because conacre is still more attractive to landowners.  Auctioneers tend to encourage people to continue with conacre because it suits them to get the annual fees.  Legal professionals prefer the <i>status quo</i>because they may not be familiar with the various incentives available.  This is why we believe the reliefs need to be publicised more widely.  Generally farmers are <i>au fait</i>with agri-taxation measures and are well served by agricultural advisers, whether from Teagasc or private consultants.  However, it is hard to get over the line with auctioneers and legal people.  We have heard anecdotal evidence this year of a mother who transferred land to her sons.  Both parties to such contracts are now required to get legal advice.  When the mother consulted her solicitor, the latter practically talked her out of the arrangement because of concerns about what might happen if her children put her in a nursing or on the road without utilising the land.  These issues need to be addressed.  We call for a more pragmatic approach by legal professionals that recognises the agricultural nature of the country.  <br/>I will now outline our main proposals on agri-taxation under the headings of income tax and capital tax.  In regard to income tax, the 100% young farmer stock relief allows young trained farmers to offset an increase in the value of their stock against their tax liability.  At the outset, all livestock farmers need to build up a viable production base through livestock.  This is a long-term investment in the farm which needs to be achieved without a heavy tax burden.  It would be permissible under state aid rules to extend the duration of the relief from four years to five years.  Extending the relief would give young trained farmers an additional year to grow stock numbers and expand output at farm level without a heavy tax burden.  Greater flexibility as to the activation timeframe of the relief would facilitate young trained farmers to select the five years they want to apply the relief from their longer term farm business plan.  Young farmers do not always benefit from the relief in the first few years because they may not have the financial strength to grow stock numbers quickly.  The amount eligible for stock relief should be increased from &euro;70,000 to &euro;150,000.  This figure equates to a 100 cow dairy herd, which is a reasonable target for a family farm.  Given that the average dairy herd is approximately 70 cows, a herd of 100 cows is an achievable target and it is something younger farmers are aiming for.<br/>The current 50% tax relief for partnerships is limited to a maximum of &euro;7,500.  This is restrictive and given the efforts made to promote collaborative and partnership farming this relief should be significantly revised upwards.  The 2020 Food Harvest report sets out a target of increasing by 33% the value of primary output over the next ten years.  To facilitate investment by primary producers in stock we need to extend stock relief measures to 2020.<br/>Access to land is one of the main structural barriers in Irish agriculture.  Long-term leasing of land is unfortunately under utilised at present.  Currently, the first &euro;12,000 of rental income per annum is exempt from income tax for leases of between five and seven years, &euro;15,000 for seven to nine years and &euro;20,000 for ten year leases.  We think these reliefs should be retained because they offer strong incentives.  They need to be better publicised, however.  We also propose a double rent relief for the first year of rental expenditure on long-term leases for active farmers.  This would disincentivise conacre by offsetting the additional legal costs arising from the fact that each party now needs separate legal representation.  Double rent relief would favour the person who is farming the land.  The other reliefs favour the landowner.  Revenue would need to provide landowners with an information leaflet on tax relief on land leasing.  A key factor in allowing future young farmers the opportunity to scale upwards will be land availability and the opportunity for farmers to source land at a reasonable cost.  Realistically, farmers are not going to be in a position to buy land and allowing them to lease land for terms of between five and 15 years will allow them to borrow from the banks to make affordable capital investments.<br/>We believe there is justification for introducing a new initiative to alleviate farm income volatility for farmers operating as sole traders.  The principle would be the creation of a Government bond to allow farmers to deposit surplus profits in good farming years and withdraw reserves in years with poor returns, subject to certain limits.  On encashment, the value of the bond or fund would be liable for income tax.  Initiatives of this nature have been introduced in a number of countries, including Australia and New Zealand.  The bond or fund would double up as a young farmer fund to allow access to credit at a preferential rate.  This could be administered through the NTMA, with the result that we would be investing at a preferential rate.  Young entrepreneurs would be able to access credit to finance their business start up ideas and contribute to growth and job creation in rural areas.  We propose that the scheme would allow farmers to take some excess income arising from a good year in farming and invest it in a government bond fund and withdraw up to certain limits in a year of poor return while paying tax on exit from the fund.  The fund or bond could provide young farmers with access to credit and interest subsidised loans to facilitate establishment of new farm business and collaborative arrangements.  While the Government might be paying a low interest rate to the farmer investing the money, it will be able to charge interest when the money is loaned to younger farmers.  <br/>Capital allowances are granted for tax purposes in lieu of a deduction for depreciation and are available in respect of certain qualifying expenditure incurred in the provision of certain assets for the purposes of a trade or rental business.  We propose the introduction of an accelerated allowance for farm expansion to include buildings and machinery, with 50% in year one and the balance over two years, or at 33% per annum.  We would also support the introduction of free capital allowances on plant and equipment that can be attributed to environmental or climate benefit, such as slurry spreading equipment with injection systems which benefit the environment, reduce emissions and deliver an enhanced nutrient value for farmers.</p> <p> Another key proposal is the introduction of capital allowances on new farm building investments for landowners who are not farming but are engaged in collaborative arrangements to invest in the farm.  They have the buildings and are renting them out to young, trained farmers.  We think the introduction of capital allowances for those new farm developments should be encouraged.  It would also help the farmer who has the land to invest in buildings, so that young farmers will be able to benefit from their use during the collaborative arrangement.  We think this would also send a positive signal that the Government believes collaborative arrangements should be further encouraged. </p><p> As regards capital taxes, the current system of 90% taxation relief is important to land that is being transferred.  It means that farmers can keep the block of land together and do not have to delve into assets to pay a taxation bill.  That system should be continued.</p><p> Currently, relief is given by reducing the market value on which capital acquisition tax is calculated by 90%, provided that 80% of the gross assets post transfer are agricultural assets.  We fully agree with that relief, which has served the country well.  We therefore completely endorse it.</p><p> Landowners should be encouraged to complete a course in collaborative arrangements, particularly if they have no previous agricultural education.  This would help them explore options for best utilising their land, be it leasing, share-farming or other collaborative arrangements of which there are many.  It is another incentive and a way of getting the message across.</p><p> Stamp duty relief provides for exemption from stamp duty on certain transfers of agricultural property to young trained farmers.  The fact that it has been kept quite low on farm land means that it helps with the transfer to young farmers.  We do not want any obstacles in the way, so we want stamp duty relief to be continued in its current form.  This relief should be agreed for a minimum of six years at a time to facilitate succession planning.  These issue can sometimes take time to go through.</p><p> The future for the next generation of young farmers is promising.  Young farmers in Macra na Feirme feel we want to be at the forefront of any developments that are carried out.  The agri-taxation review will be key, along with the CAP and everything else, in fostering the development of young farmers into the future.</p></speech>

I am not from a farming background so I might not have the same knowledge of agricultural affairs as my colleagues.  The Macra na Feirme presentation seems to make a bit more sense concerning conacre leasing arrangements.  If leases are not long enough for farmers to develop their farms, the idea is to penalise people renting on short-term leases rather than shortening the term where maximum relief comes in.  That seems to make perfect sense and it would be a worthwhile proposal.</p><p>  Given that the average farm income in 2013 was &euro;25,000, how many farmers would benefit from stock reliefs?  I imagine one would need to have a fairly high taxable income to benefit from the maximum amount of relief.  Are any figures available for how many farmers would benefit from such reliefs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400013#O00400"><p>I thank both groups for their presentations and apologise for having missed the ICSA one.  We meet all the agri-groups prior to each annual budget and we listen to many similar presentations.  Can both groups respond to the question of income averaging, which does cause a problem?  Can the ICSA expand further on how income averaging can be achieved?  Farming is a volatile sector and much depends on the weather, as well as on world markets.</p><p>  In the beef industry, we can see the current problems for suckler farmers who will have no income.  If they had an income averaging situation, however, they may have a tax liability at the end of the year.  How can we manage this income averaging?  The ICSA said that farmers could perhaps opt out of averaging for one year.  </p><p>  That ties into the Macra na Feirme presentation on income volatility.  Mr. O'Dowd said that a bond could be put in place but can he expand on that?  A bond can be taken out but for how many years can it be left in place?  I presume that income tax will be paid on it when it comes out.  I ask both representatives to expand on those matters.</p></speech>

There is very little in either presentation with which we could disagree.  We all want to see the farming situation improving.  It is a low income industry and quite a number of farmers are not in a taxable situation.  Getting young farmers to form business partnerships with older farmers is a key issue.  It is worrying to see the age profile of farmers, only 7% of whom are under 35.  In 2000, the figure was 13% so that is a worrying trend.  We must all do our bit to ensure that more young people become involved in farming.  Will the 25% increase under the single farm payment or CAP be a major help towards getting younger farmers involved in the sector?</p><p>  I also want to raise the issue of banks.  I came across an instance recently where a young farmer wanted to buy a house and 18 or 20 acres of land.  The banks were reluctant to deal with him, but told him that if he were buying a house on its own they would give him a mortgage much more easily.  One wonders what is happening in that respect.  Some work will have to be done to ensure that such young farmers get an opportunity to buy farm land.</p></speech>

The similarity between them struck me.  I thank both representatives for attending the joint committee today.  The issues of land mobility and access to land are common to both the ICSA and Macra na Feirme.  As regards disincentivising conacre, we will ultimately have to look at making serious changes to how this is structured.  During the CAP negotiations it struck me that we were the only country in Europe that had a problem with meeting the historical date for payment.  That was all linked to conacre because other countries have medium or long-term leases, partnerships, and a much healthier approach to land, whereas we do not.</p><p>  As regards rainy day planning, in Kildalton agricultural college I recall being told that farmers should beware of big cheque confidence.  A big cheque may arrive one day but they will have to survive for the next six months without another shilling coming in, so they should not spend the money on a new tractor.  The ICSA's rainy day proposal is an interesting one.  We need to undertake a body of work in the coming months on foot of the presentations.  I will allow the witnesses to answer the questions now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400013#O01100"><p>Income averaging is why we made the proposal for rainy day funding, which is similar to Macra na Feirme's bond idea.  Income averaging is a little bit crude and inflexible in various cases, and it is not available to all farmers.  It can be limited if there is off-farm income or if they are also involved in other businesses.  In addition, once one gets into it one is stuck in for three years, which becomes a problem.</p><p>  One only ever goes for income averaging when the problem arises, but that is not really what we would like to achieve here.  We are saying that when years are good, people should be encouraged to have the possibility of putting some of their profits aside into a fund or a bond.  That can be sheltered from taxation until they draw it down in the future.  They will draw it down because at that point either they have an income crisis, in which case they will be paying a lower rate of tax when they draw it down anyway, or they may have an investment project they may wish to put it into.  Alternatively, there may be a fodder crisis.  By facilitating people in putting this money away each year where they have surplus profits over and above what they might need, one is encouraging planning.</p> <p>It is not done on the basis of income averaging, when one suddenly has one year and one has locked oneself into a three-year period.</p><p> I may as well address the issue of conacre, long-term leasing and collaborative arrangements.  We have made a proposal, and it is important to understand what we are saying.  Of course we all agree that short-term conacre is not the best deal.  Long-term leasing is preferable to that but collaborative farming in turn is preferable to long-term leasing.  Long-term leasing is fine when a farmer has made a decision that he is finished with farming, that he is happy to retire, but that is not the case for many farmers.  I think we are going about the issue the wrong way if we think we can encourage men to lease out the land for ten years and say "day-day" to farming.  That lesson has been reinforced by the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform, where people who had got out of farming and leased out their farm for a long time are high and dry in terms of CAP reform.  Obviously there is a lesson in that for people, which is not to lease out all the land or go for short-term arrangements.  For all the reasons we have given, in addition to the people who are sick of being involved in businesses that are not profitable, people in cattle and sheep who are making no money year in and year out and are telling us they have to do something different but for whom retirement is not on the agenda, collaborative farming might be a possibility.  I am not saying this is a flood, it is a trickle but the trickle must be encouraged.  In that case, one is faced with a strange dilemma.  Under the long-term leasing tax relief arrangements, one cannot lease to a company or to someone with whom one is in partnership.  This is where the problem arises.</p><p> Somebody looking at a collaborative arrangement needs to be able to understand how he is going to get income out of this arrangement and how his new farming partner is going to get income out of it as well, a sufficient income for two families.  One of the issues is that if one can manage to make profit, then one has taxation issues.  On the other hand if one goes in for a long-term lease, one can get up to &euro;20,000 tax free.  The rule on long-term leasing is an active disincentive to go into a collaborative shared farming partnership type arrangement.  It is almost certain that the smart thing to do from an income point of view is simply to lease out the land and take the &euro;20,000 tax free.  On the other hand that is not attractive unless one is absolutely convinced that one has finished with farming and is happy to retire.  We have a logjam.  The ten-year lease with &euro;20,000 tax relief is not attractive and that is an obvious fact because the scheme is not being taken up.  The short-term conacre is the worst possible arrangement for all.  There is a general agreement that collaborative arrangements are what we need to look at, but we must ensure the taxation system is working favourably for collaborative arrangements and that it is at least matching the taxation treatment of long-term leasing.</p></speech>

I think the key point in all of these discussions is to get more young farmers into farming over the next generation.  A startling figure from Macra na Feirme is that the proportion of farmers over 80 years of age is larger than those under 35 years of age.  That is a startling statistic in 2014.  If that figure is not reversed in a reasonably short time the agricultural system will be in serious trouble.  There must be a change of attitude and I hope this process will encourage that change.  We need a carrot more than a stick approach to try to do that.  I welcome the discussion.</p><p>  Long-term leasing is very important to that process as well.  I think the whole process has been very well articulated today.  The ICSA has elaborated on long-term leasing and Macra na Feirme has emphasised the importance of the role of young farmers and active farmers becoming involved in the system.  An attitude and mentality change needs to come about as a result of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran O'Dowd" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400014#P00400"><p>Collaborative arrangements, long-term leasing and shared farming all need to be encouraged.  While we would differ from our colleagues in the ICSA in so far as while we need to encourage long-term leases by incentivising and getting them publicised further in order that more of those arrangements are taken up, people who want to continue farming and have some link with the land also need to be encouraged and supported.  The key statistic is that 48% of farmers over the age of 55 years do not have an identified successor.  That means they will not continue farming indefinitely.  They need to be given some option in respect of what they will do with the land.  If they were to die in the morning and somebody takes over the land, the land must be farmed effectively and productively.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle commented on the benefit and the stock relief.  In the dairy sector in particular, young farmers in the early days will not be able to avail of the stock relief to its full extent.  However, if they are expanding rapidly and if they have a good income coming from the good milk price and they want to reinvest into the business, we believe they could be caught with a significant tax bill at the growing stage.  These young farmers are sole traders.  They will not be seeking to incorporate the farm and will be paying tax at the higher rate.  We believe they should be helped by being given the flexibility to grow and develop in the initial period.  This should not apply to the dairy industry only.</p></speech>

Nobody wants to say he is avoiding tax or anything like that.  The key metric Macra na Feirme is trying to get across is that we need to create economic activity.  We know from the age profile of farmers that younger farmers will create this economic activity, especially in rural areas where it is most needed.  That will lead to further taxation down the line and will broaden the tax base.  Creating more economic activity will be a win-win for everyone involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014062400014#P00600"><p>That is the key to it.  Without stock relief, expansion is stifled.  Without stock relief one will end up being unable to reinvest in the business.  When one is trying to develop a dairy industry, the key is to use stock relief to grow the numbers reasonably quickly.  This is the single most important taxation measure in place.</p><p>  The two presentations today were very useful.  I hope the taxation review body takes them on board because the suggestions in both presentations were constructive, productive and worthwhile.  The key is to make land available to young people, but they do not necessarily need to own it.  It was the tradition to own the land, but now one does not need to struggle to put the capital together to purchase land and then not be in a position to use the working capital to develop the business.  Bar inheriting, winning the land or marrying into a farm, one could not get into land management.  That is the key.</p><p>  Short-term conacre is a problem in Ireland.  It is unique to Ireland and is a major deterrent.  Where somebody is thinking of retiring, is unsure whether he has a successor and wants to go into a collaborative or shared farming partnership for three or five years - I think five years should be the minimum - this provides the person who is trying to get on the farming ladder an opportunity to get started and move to a more permanent arrangement.  I think there are very valid arguments for saying that the taxation treatment of income from both should be equal.  It does not compel a person to get into long-term leasing to avail of the tax relief but we want that to be the ultimate goal if one does not have a successor.  In the meantime we will allow a taxation incentive system for shorter-term arrangements.  Both suggestions have merit.</p><p>  We have invited other organisations to appear before the committee on 17 July.</p> <p> I thank the witnesses for coming before us at relatively short notice.  We consider it is important that before we make a submission to the taxation review body, we would hear from the main stakeholders, that is, the main farm organisations who represent both those who are trying to get into farming and the farmers who are thinking about retiring.  </p><p> As there is no further business we will adjourn.</p></speech>

Schedule B includes COM (2013) 781; COM (2014) 161, 223, 239, 261, 283, and 298; EWN:2014/C138/33; and EWN:2014/C 44/14.  It is proposed that these items do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  We will now deal with the proposals under schedule A.  COM (2014) 258 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council regarding appliances burning gaseous fuels.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2014) 166 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine.  It is proposed to note that this is an adopted measure.  Do members have any comments?</p></speech>

The situation in Ukraine is very difficult.</p> <p>It is very complex and it probably needs more time for discussion than we are able to deliver here.  I also believe, obviously, that Ukraine is at a critical juncture in how it resolves its relationships with the EU and Russia.  Everybody would support the Ukrainians in their efforts to deal with that.  Russia has obviously played a shocking role in the destabilisation of the region and it has been very expansionist in that regard.  Its role has been a multiple of any role played by the EU.  However, the EU's role has been expansionist in the area and this negotiation of a trade agreement is part of that expansion and it is happening at the same time as Ukraine is trying to resolve its relationship internally.<br/>We have been given this COM not as an opportunity to give input to it, but just as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  We should communicate our dissatisfaction to the source of this COM that our national Parliament, the Oireachtas, has not been given an opportunity to input into its development in some way before it has become a done deal, as such.</p></speech>

The COM has already been passed, so it is an adopted measure.  Do we agree to note it and also express our dissatisfaction with not having had a chance to be involved in the process?  I point out that it is a temporary COM providing for a reduction in customs duties up to November.  We should ask to have a chance to debate it prior to November if there are any changes to it.  I accept there are different views around the table on in.  We will ask that we have the chance to give it proper scrutiny next time.</p><p>  COM(2014)170 is a proposal for a Council decision on a position to be taken by the European Union within the trade committee set up by the trade agreement between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other, as regards the adoption of the rules of procedure for the trade committee, the rules of procedure and the code of conduct for arbitrators, the establishment of the list of arbitrators, the list of experts and the group of experts, and the adoption of the rules of procedure for the group of experts on trade and sustainable development.

There are major issues with access to land and resources.  There is extreme poverty in the country and it is the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a trade unionist - hundreds and even thousands of trade unionists have been killed there.  With the onset of this European free-trade agreement with Colombia, there have been mass uprisings among the people of Colombia, which have led to 70 deaths.  I believe the trade committee dealt with in this COM is not sufficient in its oversight of human rights to be able to deal with the problems happening in Colombia.  The committee has sent a letter to the Minister requesting a debate on the floor of the D&aacute;il on the issue as soon as possible before the trade agreement is passed, or not, by the Oireachtas.  Had we had the opportunity - again we do not - my view would be that this would be held back until there is a determination by the Oireachtas on the whole trade agreement itself.</p></speech>

Chambers Ireland is the largest business organisation in the State.  With over 55 member chambers in our network, we represent businesses in every region and economic sector in Ireland.  Our geographic representation gives us a unique understanding of the challenges facing businesses throughout Ireland.

We also understand the opportunities and believe Government can play a major role in minimising the threats and turning the opportunities into realities.</p><p>  In this presentation, I shall focus on four main themes: the cost of doing business; the importance of local business supports; high street development; and public procurement.  We are pleased to make this submission which focuses on creating the right conditions for growth.  We believe that the buoyancy created by our recommendations will negate any costs attached.  It is our hope that the contribution we make can assist in improving the trading conditions in Ireland&rsquo;s towns and villages and help to retain and create employment within these areas.</p><p>  On the first core series of points, the cost of doing business, the most clear and obvious way that businesses can be helped to create and retain jobs is to ensure they stay in business.  To this end, it is vital that the cost of doing business is kept at sustainable levels.  We believe there should be a targeted rates reduction.  Many small businesses are struggling due to excessive rates imposed by local authorities.  We understand local authorities have done their best and are striving to reduce rates, but the rate levels can still be high.  In order to guarantee their survival, allowing them to retain the important jobs they provide, we recommend the introduction of a rates reduction for companies, located within town centres, which provide much-needed employment and contribute to the quality of life in these areas.</p><p>  We recognise that this should be more nuanced than, for example, the large retail levy and expanded small business relief scheme, currently in operation in Northern Ireland.  However, the support it provides for small businesses can be the difference between remaining viable and ceasing to trade.</p> <p>While we recognise that the issue of rates is a reserved function of local authorities, it is the role of Government to provide the required funding supports and statutory and policy frameworks to enable the local authorities to implement initiatives focused on business development and job creation. <br/>Recent reforms have enabled local authorities to raise or lower the local property tax, LPT, in their area by 15%.  We are concerned that any shortfall in funding resulting from a decrease will be met through a corresponding increase in business rate or may make a planned reduction in commercial rates less likely.  Cork County Council has already voted to lower its LPT by 15% in line with the manifesto commitments of many councillors.  However, councillors must also be mindful of the business community in its jurisdictions as it is they who will support growth and create jobs.  A short-term win for householders could lead to significant losses if previously successful businesses close due to an inability to pay local authority charges.  This is an especially sensitive issue in counties such as Cork and Donegal, where former town councils are being integrated into county councils.  In both of these counties, and there are others such as Clare, there are significant  differences between the rate struck in the county and the town that is being incorporated.  In this context it is vital that these and other similar local authorities are mindful of the need for a progressive levelling of the rate base, ideally towards the lower of the two rates over the longest term possible of ten years.<br/>We believe that if local authorities were encouraged to be more flexible over rates, the standard and mix of businesses in town centres would be enhanced.  The increased footfall from such an improvement would have a clear impact on job creation and retention.<br/>The rates rebate scheme in Limerick, which allows new businesses to claim a rebate of up to 50% in their first year and 25% in their second year is a model that Government could encourage other local authorities to follow.  The correlation between a proactive, supportive local authority and a strong business revival can be seen in Cleveland, Ohio, where businesses are encouraged to move downtown through a range of schemes and incentives.<br/>We can now say with some confidence that the Irish economy is in a better place than it has been for some time.  Our members frequently tell us that trading conditions in their local area are improving and business owners are now more confident about the future.  However, there is still a reluctance to hire new staff.  This reluctance is based on fear.  Employers need certainty that the cost of employment will not increase.  The rate of PRSI paid by employers, responsibility for sick pay and issues about redundancy create a hesitancy to take on new employees.<br/>In our pre-budget submission we have included a wide range of recommendations designed to make Ireland's fiscal landscape more business friendly and in turn support and create more jobs.  While many of these apply to businesses of all sizes, many are of particular significance to the type of small businesses generally found in town and village centres.  They include continued certainty of the 9% VAT rate for hospitality; to increase the qualifying amount for cash accounting for VAT to &euro;2.5 million per annum; no further changes to the sick leave payment regime and to reinstate the lower employers PRSI rate for Class A staff.  This point is worth developing further.  When wage bills are too high, businesses are less likely to hire new employees.  The 4.25% increase in employers Class A PRSI in the 2014 Budget Statement directly contributes to businesses being unlikely to hire new employees.  It has resulted in a reduction in employment growth levels and should be revisited with a view to supporting new job creation in significant numbers.  This is a classic example of the opportunity cost involved not being factored into calculations determining whether to increase a rate or not.  In our view, with a fair wind and further positive momentum in the economy, upwards of 50,000 retail jobs could be created in Ireland.  <br/>Another point related to the cost of doing business is the impact of excessive regulation.  We welcome any moves to make compliance with regulations, such as licence applications, easier and more consistent<b>.  </b>Legitimate business and legitimate jobs are threatened by the level of black market activity that persists in Ireland.  We were pleased to learn this morning of the &euro;14 million find.  We congratulate all the authorities involved in that good news.<br/>Counterfeit products of all kinds have a considerable impact on the profitability of legitimate retailers.  The Revenue Commissioners made seizures of goods with a value of &euro;5.4 million in 2012.  As this figure related to seized good alone, the true scale of the problem remains unknown.  This could be just the tip of the iceberg. <br/>The sale and purchase of counterfeit goods takes footfall away from legitimate traders.  The sale of counterfeit cigarettes, for example, takes secondary spend from retail areas that depend on it for their survival.  We note that certain policies that seem attractive are actually counterproductive.  We recognise that the Cabinet has just given approval to draft laws which may compel tobacco companies to use plain packaging, however, while this policy is based on long-term health considerations, which we fully understand, it fails to take into account the impact on employers, retailers and so on.<br/>The counterfeiting group of our international organisation, the International Chamber of Commerce, states that branding allows customers to make better choices in the marketplace: &quot;Plain packaging makes it easier for packaging to be copied by counterfeiters, exposing consumers to products with unknown and potentially dangerous ingredients&quot;.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, which are being established around the country must be exclusively focused on a core remit of mentoring and supporting start ups and SMEs with up to ten staff.  There must be no duplication of services already provided by the private sector.  Local community development committees, LCDCs and local enterprise offices, LEOs must use the expertise and experience of local Chambers Ireland to provide the best environment and conditions in which to do business.  All business support units in local authorities should regularly engage with Chambers Ireland to work together on delivering agreed economic development targets.  Ideally, business representatives on these bodies would be representatives of the local Chambers Ireland group.<br/>We believe Government should encourage local authorities to follow the initiative in Cork where 1% of all commercial rates are ring-fenced for economic development to encourage economic growth and job creation.  We have 55 Chambers Ireland bodies around the country.  We have a chamber in every town in the country, providing us with feedback and is the source of our momentum.<br/>As well as the somewhat indirect initiatives above, there are more direct ways that the Government can support our town and village centres and the job creating businesses in them.  The local authorities must be encouraged to work with retailers and business organisation to introduce or expand town centre developments schemes and introduce a high street innovation fund.  The impact of out-of-town retail parks on traditional town centres is dramatic and runs counter to the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on retail planning which state:<blockquote>The town centre is the focus for a range of commercial and community activities, resulting in a mix of, often interdependent, land uses which contribute to a sense of place and identity.  It include a combination of natural features; historic buildings, cultural, civic and governmental buildings, as well as public spaces.  This physical form and mix of functions, which will have evolved over a considerable period of time, makes a town centre different from a shopping centre and provides much of its character which can be further enhances by introducing appropriate new uses into historic buildings.  It also has a high level of accessibility to employment, services and facilities for all the community. </blockquote>The decline of town centres has an impact which transcends the interests of retailers as traditional sites of community activity and social interaction are lost.  Conversely the best performing town centres tend to have a significant proportion of retail activity; a broad and engaging retail mix and a good dining and entertainment mix.  Government can encourage local authorities to work with business organisations to improve town centres.  We have numerous examples of the benefits provided to local economies through collaboration between local chambers and local authorities, all of which have the potential to create new jobs.  I have listed examples in my presentation but in the interests of time I do not propose to go through them other than to note the very good initiatives that could be replicated elsewhere.  Examples of collaboration between the local authority and chambers are South Dublin Chamber, the Enterprise Europe Network, which is a partnership between Enterprise Ireland and five regional chambers, Letterkenny Chamber, Cobh and Harbour Chamber, Ballyhaunis Chamber, Ennis Chamber and Cork Chamber. <br/>The Government could also follow the lead of the United Kingdom and introduce a high street innovation fund.  This was created by the Minister responsible for local growth with money awarded to council with the worst affected high streets.  It recognises the work done by local authorities and acts as an incentive for others to up their game.  Perhaps the idea of a local growth Minister could be considered in Ireland.<br/>Car parking costs must be applied strategically to increase footfall in certain areas, thereby supporting businesses and jobs.  It is our view that the funding formula for municipal districts, whereby central government matches the funds raised by the municipal district through car parking and leisure charges, actually produces a perverse incentive for local authorities to increase car parking charges, so as to increase the matching funds.  We believe that some of the saving arising from the reform of local government should be specifically earmarked to guarantee free parking provision at optimal time periods to support footfall and encourage consumers to shop in town centres.</p> <p>In this context, a parking window of two hours would be ideal, especially on busy shopping days such as Thursday through to Saturday.</p><p> The final main point is public procurement.  Many Irish companies, particularly small and microenterprises, feel that they are at a disadvantage when tendering for contracts offered by contracting authorities.  This is a genuine threat to their survival and is subsequently a threat to the many jobs they provide and the rates they pay.  We recently issued a white paper on this issue - we have copies with us if any of the members wish to see it - following extensive consultation with our network and a number of subject matter specialists.  We conclude that Ireland needs a strategic public procurement policy to stimulate the economy, incentivise innovation, support business and promote job creation.</p><p> Our specific recommendations include: mandate the office of Government procurement, OGP, to consider always the wider impact that procurement reform has on the economy when measuring success, rather than a simple metric of how much money has been taken out of the procurement budget; transpose the new European Union directives into national law in a timely fashion, without gold-plating, and where options are available, the most business-friendly one must be chosen; reduce the number and types of contracts being awarded on the basis of price alone - an appreciation of the benefits to the Irish economy in terms of jobs created or revenue raised through taxation should become the norm in tendering procedures; help SMEs to become part of the supply chain for major capital works; guarantee the office of Government procurement employs fully professional staff, with specialist qualifications; simplify the process of pre-qualification and reduce the amount of material that must be provided by suppliers at this stage and make the process of banking or saving information on the system work better than it does; make open procedure tendering the norm for contracts of all values to level the playing field and facilitate SME participation; effectively use the process of dividing contracts into lots to encourage SMEs to bid, resulting in a wide range of bidders and potential winners; create opportunities for SMEs to enter joint bids which take account of the nature of the Irish economy; use eTenders to its full capability by promoting it, simplifying it, making it easier for SMEs to register and training suppliers and buyers to use it effectively - training is a key issue and we must ensure procurement buyers are well trained on new procedures such as the new circular 10/14 recently delivered by the OGP; make the entire process of public procurement fully transparent by allowing suppliers to see where and why they score or fail to score marks, defining clear roles for procurement officers and holding them to account on the basis of more than just cost savings achieved - face-to-face feedback should become the norm; and establish an independent review body entitled to adjudicate on matters where a firm feels it has been treated unfairly and to decide on redress.</p><p> We note the recommendations in circular 10/14 deal with some of the issues in procurement, but not all of them.  It is now vital that all contracting authorities conform to the guidance set out in this circular and work towards a situation where indigenous businesses can benefit fully from public procurement processes.</p><p> Town and village centres are vital to our sense of community, and urgent action must be taken to support the businesses that do so much to support them.  From providing jobs and creating wealth to engaging in corporate social responsibility projects, such as sponsoring local sports teams, doing charity work and protecting the environment, it is often businesses that put most into local areas.  They deserve the support of both central and local government.  We greatly welcome the committee's interest in this area and are happy to respond to members' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400006#F00300"><p>I welcome the group from Chambers Ireland.  We do not disagree on much in the presentation, but I have a few questions.  First, what are Mr. Talbot's views on the impact of the collapse in people's incomes in recent years on town centres and the retail sector generally in the context of the budget cycle getting under way?  Is there not a case to be made that the more income people have in their pockets, the more life there will be in town centres?</p><p>  Second, I note Mr. Talbot did not refer to the impact of information technology, IT, and particularly the Internet on town centres.  How would he propose to entice a generation aged up to the mid-20s that is utterly comfortable buying online and would buy online before going to the town centre?  What proposals does he have in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400006#F00400"><p>Aonta&iacute;m leis an gcuid is m&oacute; at&aacute; r&aacute;ite.  For me, the biggest variable in the last seven years has been a collapse of demand.  It alone is undoubtedly the most important thing to happen to the sector.  Private and public investment has collapsed, as has disposable income.  One of the points made by Mr. Talbot is that wages are too high and it is virtually impossible to employ people.  However, if wages are too low, it is virtually impossible for people to buy things in his shop or retail outlet.  There is a happy medium and, from our point of view, the minimum wage is the basic that must be paid.  People must have a proper wages in order they can purchase in retail outlets.</p><p>  What effects have the property charges and the talk of water charges had on the spend in Chambers Ireland members' outlets?  I fully agree with Mr. Talbot on rates and the costs of doing business.  We believe rates must be progressive, like every other element of taxation.  It is complex but it must have some relationship, although not a full relationship, to the profitability of the business, and it can have a role in the reorganisation of towns.  Mr. Talbot mentioned Cleveland, Ohio and referenced a few economic incentives that were given to businesses to move downtown.  Will he give us more information on that?  Also, could he give us information on energy, transport, insurance, legal and credit costs?  These are having a large negative impact on business.</p><p>  Parking is a function of the local government fund.  When that fund reduces, the local authorities are forced to get funds from parking, among other sources, and that kills the golden goose.  I also believe that some of the business groups were somewhat naive when they thought the property tax would reduce rates for businesses.  It is clear there was no real intention in that regard and that the local property tax is just to substitute for the local government grant rather than business rates.</p><p>  With regard to business debt, Morrissey's quarry in Carlow has been put into receivership because of business debts.  Will Mr. Talbot talk about the experience of Chambers Ireland's membership with business debt?</p><p>  The two-tier economy has not been focused on sufficiently either in this committee or in any other forum.  There is a massive contrast between the experience of retailers within what was traditionally called the Pale and the experience in the area outside it.  Perhaps Mr. Talbot will discuss that.  It is not our desire to talk down enterprise anywhere, but it is important to focus on that.</p><p>  What can the Government do with regard to the rolling of contracts?  I believe the rolling of contracts in public procurement is a significant problem.  It is creating a major difficulty for small entrepreneurs in accessing them.</p><p>  I agree on the necessity for a good strategic partnership of organisations to deal with the revitalisation of town centres.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, must work with the chambers of commerce and the local authorities and they must all be on the same page with regard to delivering a proper strategy.  They have been disjointed for too long and that must cease.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Talbot" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400006#F00500"><p>I thank members for their questions.  They made some great points.  With regard to Deputy Calleary's question about the impact on incomes, the difficulty we have had over the past five years is that it was necessary to get the country's borrowings back to a sustainable level and to do that without destroying the country.  We see the budget debate taking place at present and the impact of the debate about the &euro;2 billion adjustment that might be necessary this year.  It is our view that taxation is too high and must reduce.  Equally, however, we are desperately trying to ensure we do not set people's expectations too high that difficult times are over.  There is a middle ground of trying to find the balance that conveys to people that things are improving, but that we are still a long way from where we were when we started into this severe recession.</p> <p>Things are improving but we are still a long way from where we were before this severe recession.  Overlapping with the impact of property charges and water charges it has an impact on retail spending.</p><p> We also noticed, prior to the past 18 months, that any shocks anywhere in Europe, such as the talk three years ago of Italy going to the wall, had an impact on shops in Ireland the following weekend.  Irish consumers are very aware of the potential impact of international developments on Ireland.  It is important to end the shocks, for example, not to introduce new taxes.  People need to understand that there is stability and that in future tax will move downwards, and salaries and wages upwards.  People have suffered flat or reduced pay and their confidence will, I hope, improve if they see an upward trend in pay, a downward trend in tax and no new taxes.  The good weather in the past few days has been enough to get people out spending.  There is money in the economy but people&rsquo;s mindset has been to pay down debt, and prepare themselves for future shocks.  The sooner we can kill off the last of the shocks, the better.  Confidence is an element of this as well as lack of money in people's pay packets.</p><p> In response to Deputy Calleary, IT and the Internet have a big impact and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is actively rolling out its vouchers to get businesses on line and we are happy to work with it on that.  Improvement is needed in this area.  Quite a few businesses are computer illiterate.  We would like to see that improving.   We need an improved strategy to make more businesses computer literate and get them on line.  It will be quite hard for local retailers to compete with some of the big line operators.  In the era when tourists will come with a carry-on bag of the size allowed by Ryanair or Aer Lingus they cannot bring much stuff home.  There is an opportunity for a retailer who interests somebody in an Aran jersey in Galway to direct the customer to a website.  Tourists typically do not take as much home as they used to do when luggage was kept in the hold.  There are certainly opportunities in that area. </p><p> In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, we think the increase of 4.25% to 8.5% in the PRSI rate is particularly detrimental to the wage sector of many retail jobs.  That needs to be reviewed, to see whether it should be brought back to where it was.  Chambers Ireland has traditionally supported the national minimum wage and continues to do so.  We think it is very important to maintain a certain minimum standard but we must make sure the economy is competitive.  There are always challenges and trade-offs.</p><p> Credit costs and debt continue to be a problem.  Many companies have a good core company but at the peak of the boom unfortunately decided to buy a building and piled debt onto their balance sheet for a premises they could now be renting for significantly less.  That is a challenge.  We are working on several committees, such as those run by the Department of Finance, on credit availability and equity financing for small business and so on, to find some solutions to that problem.  One or two of the banks that are exiting the market are starting to drive solutions into the market by being prepared to do deals so that they can exit.  That does not solve all the problems.  We are seven years into this recession.  Many companies and their bankers have learnt to deal with their position.</p><p> Chambers Ireland fought hard over the years, and sometimes it is difficult for a business organisation to call for a property tax, which we knew would affect the money in people&rsquo;s pockets but the core for us was to rebalance the way local authorities are funded.  We wanted local authorities to have a diverse set of funding sources in the long term and not to be exclusively dependent on business and or Government.  We see the local property tax as part of a medium to long-term evolution of the local authority environment.  The recent changes in local authorities and town councils are very positive but they raise issues that we need to manage.  We never expected local property tax to lead to a direct reduction in business rates, we simply thought it would add a much more diverse set of funding arrangements for local authorities.</p></speech>

All local authorities wanted to build huge shopping centres because they saw the rates coming to them, which has left us somewhat over-supplied with shops.  Balance and giving a sane funding model to local authorities that gives them more control of their budgets, makes them less reliant on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s late delivery of budgets for next year and more insight into their budgets leads to a more sustainable community for business and citizens.</p></speech>

We are very aware of that.  We are working with our chambers around the country to give them training and assistance in how to engage with their local enterprise office, LEO, and their local authority in the new economic development role that local authorities have.  We recognise that there may even be more than two-tier problems and we need to play our part to help in dealing with them and to help the local authorities.  We need good strategic partnerships.  We want to see how best to coordinate our resources and those that local authorities have on the ground and to make them complementary not competitive.  There is a risk that LEOs, which will have their own budgets, will start to compete with things we do, or they could complement it.  Through talking to, and working with, Enterprise Ireland, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government we see a great openness to developing that community-spirited good strategic partnership.</p></speech>

They were very interesting and covered a wide range of issues.  They did not touch on upward only rent reviews.   I know that 13 trade associations got together recently to call on the Government to pass that legislation which has already gone through the Seanad.  What is the witnesses&rsquo; view of it?  Do they support the move to abolish it?</p><p>  I have a problem with the case being made for public procurement because some people I know who worked on Government agencies were stunned to discover the amount individual State organisations were paying.  As an example, hospitals were each buying from their local sources.  They were supporting jobs there but were paying a multiple of what could be paid if they bought centrally.  There seems to be a difficulty in that area.</p><p>  Can the witnesses tell us anything they know about the scheme to incentivise development in the city, in Cleveland, Ohio? </p></speech>

The fact that local authorities will have stronger powers and local politicians a greater say in the authorities&rsquo; activities will help towns develop.  Before now, when funding came from a central source, there was a problem about how it would be spent.   It was centrally controlled.  That it is now local is very important.</p> <p>My view on procurement differs from that of Senator Quinn.  The problem was that one was getting a local service as well.  That sometimes assisted when it was needed.  The witnesses mentioned that joint bids have been entered.  An issue with regard to the scale of an SME has an impact on who can enter for public procurement.  Could the witnesses give examples of cases in which a number of companies have come together to put in a joint bid?  It might be illuminating for other companies that have previously procured but have been unable to do so more recently because the rules and regulations have changed.  The move towards using the European definition of an SME, which requires a business to have a minimum of 50 employees, excludes a fellow with five, six or ten employees because he does not have the scale.  Can the witnesses give examples of how that problem has been overcome?</p></speech>

I am aware that some successful work has been done in this regard under the Action Plan for Jobs.  I understand that multiple licences have been joined together in one place online, for example.  Can we be given some more practical examples of what might be done?</p><p>  I would like to pick up on something that was mentioned by Deputy Calleary.  As an outsider looking in, I genuinely think some small retailers in Ireland are not at the races when it comes to the reality that information technology is an essential part of the way we do business today and will be the way we do business in the future.  We will go to our towns and villages for a shopping experience, but we will not do all our shopping on the high street.  We will go there when we want certain added extras, but that might not be what we do during the week when we want to buy things.  When I was recently looking to buy some new pendant lamps for the house, I had to go to the large multiples even though I would have been more than happy to support more local people if I could have.  The point I am making is that in a certain sector of society, new jobs are being created in remote servicing technology, which involves examining people's businesses and their existing websites.</p><p>  Those involved in business sometimes think it is enough to have a website.  They do not appreciate that the website is a virtual shop window.  As the witnesses know, businesses have to change their shop windows depending on who they want to attract and what they want to sell.  I suggest that with the exception of the large chains, Irish retailers are just not at the races.  The reality is that people like me - people of all ages, but particularly younger people - end up buying products from outside Ireland because that is the way we shop.  I will make a final point before I conclude.  I know I have taken up a bit of time.  All of the other things mentioned in the witnesses' report, such as the rates issue and the enhancement of our streets and civic spaces, are all great - I almost get the sense that they are seen as things we should be doing, but many retailers are not focusing on the information technology sector.  I know it costs money.  I suggest it is a case of whether one can afford not to invest in it, rather than whether one can afford to invest in it.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present for their presentation.  This topic really drew me in.  I apologise if my questions have already been asked.  I have been very taken by the UK Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which supports localism in public procurement.  It allows somebody who tenders for a service or a product to show the economic and social value associated with it.  If that tenderer is able to keep jobs in the local area, that might help to prevent depopulation, for example.  The rating scale that is used under the UK legislation helps such tenderers to win contracts.  I think it is a very good measure.  As we know, everything is not always about pounds, shillings and pence.  Many more people lose out when it is about pounds, shillings and pence.  Much more money might have to be spent on social welfare, for example.  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p><p>  I would like to ask about another issue that was touched on in the presentation.  The character is being stripped out of many villages and towns in the west.  The development of shops like Aldi, Lidl and Tesco on the outskirts of towns and villages is taking the heart out of them.  We know about the benefits of supermarkets in terms of consumer value and employment, etc.  The profits are being repatriated in many cases.  There has been some discussion about introducing a so-called Tesco tax as a means of rebalancing this sector.  Have the witnesses any thoughts on that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Talbot" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400008#H00500"><p>I thank everybody for their questions.  I am aware that Senator Quinn is very engaged with the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  One of the challenges we have in our network is that our chambers throughout the country are not seeing it as an issue.  It is not being seen as one of our priorities.  We keep revalidating it.  Every time the Senator communicates with me, we go back out to our network to revalidate our position.  We have a very clear brief from our network to the effect that we should get involved in things that are priorities for our chambers.  I will be happy to talk to the Senator about it afterwards.  The members of our network are saying they do not see it as a huge issue.  It might be a bigger issue in some areas than in others.  It is not one of our network's priorities.  We keep revalidating our position.  We did so in light of the great work the Senator did in February, when he put a group together.  We have to make sure we are current.  I can talk to the Senator about that later.</p><p>  Reference was also made to public procurement.  I ask the committee not to misunderstand what we are saying about the need to drive efficient purchasing.  We fully agree that there is a need to drive waste and inefficiency out of the public procurement sector.  We have developed recommendations about ensuring procurement is undertaken by properly qualified professionals.  The role of those professionals will be to ensure procurement is done correctly - there should be no waste - and is not done at the expense of Irish small and medium-sized businesses.  If one looks at price on its own, or as a certain percentage of the tender, there is a danger that as competitive bids come in from other countries, it becomes impossible to make a difference in other respects.  At the moment, there is a tender out for approximately &euro;6.5 million worth of books for D&uacute;n Laoghaire library.  I understand that 65% of the tender calculation will be based on price.  The danger is that a large warehouse in the UK will be able to supply that.  This would have a significant impact on the Irish book industry.  It is very difficult to make an impact in the other 35% of the weighting, which relates to service issues, that is sufficient to outweigh the 65% of the weighting that relates to price alone.  There is a need for balance not only in the evaluation of the tender, but also in the criteria that are used in the first place to set the tender.</p><p>  Deputy Lawlor made a similar point about procurement.  We absolutely and fully agree that there is a need to ensure we get good value for our procurement.  All of these points can be tied together.  A point was made about how other countries are doing it.  The LM3 model tries to evaluate the social impact of procurement.  We have set up meetings with a software vendor that supplies a great deal of software to the UK procurement market to see if there is anything we can learn from that country's experience in this area.  I do not have all the answers to the very good questions that have been asked.  We are looking at these matters.</p><p>  I was also asked about the Ohio model.  We have a link on the page.  I do not have a list of the stuff in front of me.  I ask the members of the committee to look at the link.  I apologise for our phones.  I have turned my phone off.  Mr. Murphy tried to use his phone and got certain feedback.  We put up the link specifically so that people could look at it.  The model in question looks like a good one.  It is covered in the footnotes.</p><p>  I would like to respond to what was said about the possibility of putting together companies that have done tendering.  One of the challenges is that there is a lot of rhetoric out there.  At the moment, small businesses are reluctant to get involved with eTenders.</p> <p>We are trying to get people over this hurdle so they get involved.  There is also much rhetoric about competition, with regard to companies grouping together to bid and the impact of competition law on this.  There is much fear, and there is an onus on the Office of Government Procurement and on procurement managers to do a good job and get into their local communities to encourage the right type of organisation to get involved.  We will work with our members and chambers to educate people better on the advantages.  Some of this perhaps comes back to the surprising lack of computer literacy we still see in some organisations, which is of concern.  One must be computer literate to engage in the Government public procurement process at present.  We need to drive forward on these issues.</p><p> With regard to practical suggestions on red tape, do not get me wrong because much good work is coming out of various Departments to try to reduce the amount of business regulation and red tape, but we need to keep going on it.  Approximately 37 different Acts apply to the employment of a person and this is very difficult for a small business.  This is a good example of red tape.  In 1997, the taxes Acts were consolidated where finance Acts over 30 or 40 years were consolidated into one and we started again.  This probably needs to be done again but that is another matter.  This type of approach needs to be taken to employment regulation because that is what puts off somebody from employing an extra person.  We all know that if every small business in the country employed one more person, our unemployment problem would be largely solved.</p><p> The various inspections which must be dealt with by someone in the restaurant business are not necessarily co-ordinated.  Perhaps we should have central co-ordination of inspections by sector rather than by Department or quango.  Various issues such as this can make an employer's life very difficult.  Our view is that it should be as easy as possible for employers to create employment.</p></speech>

A cadre of communities is buying online and, for example, many travel agents were wiped out when the business migrated online.  However, many travel agents now offer bespoke services to individuals at higher spend.  There was a shake-out but others created jobs.</p><p>  It is worth noting that consumers are the last to know we are in recession.  It is when people lose their jobs that they know we are in recession.  Consumers are also often the last to realise we are out of recession, and do so when they and their friends start getting jobs and pay rises.  With such changes in the local dynamic, many jobs in retail can be created very quickly because consumers will always want things.  People may buy some of their items online, but they will still want to parade the streets with nicely designed bags in nice shops doing nice buying.  We thought long and hard before stating 50,000 jobs could be created.  We are deadly serious that 50,000 jobs are a-begging in retail if we fix consumer sentiment, get a better wind in the local economy and consider issues such as the opportunity cost of the 4.25% hike in employers PRSI affecting class A grade staff.  I have absolutely no doubt PRSI is an impediment this year because it was effectively doubled as it was temporarily halved during the crisis.  It has a very real impact on the cost-benefit analysis retailers make on whether to hire an extra body.  It is through incrementally hiring another body that more jobs will be created in the economy.</p></speech>

The hours people work now are different, such as 12-hour shifts, and the last thing they want to do is go out and buy something.  This is the changing nature of the work experience.  It is no longer 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and apart from institutional types of work, new modern work is flexible.  I understand what the witnesses have stated about other issues, such as the class A stamp, but these can be addressed.  The changing shape of work patterns of people will not be addressed as such.  It will constantly evolve and while I am not saying everybody will do so, a larger amount of people in the service sector will be able to work from home.</p><p>  To give a practical example, the last thing I want to do on a Sunday, if I have worked six days, is go out and look for pendant lamps.  That is not a shopping experience; it is a necessity so to speak because it is something I want to get done.  Many people are in this category.  The witnesses are stating that if we get everything else sorted, not as many people will want to go online.  This sounds like resistance from the organisation or its members, that it will be dealt with on another day because it is a tough one and that there is also an issue with computer literacy among members.  I accept this, but the witnesses mentioned easier targets which the Government can change.  I am speaking about the changing face of retail.  A local supplier can become a global supplier quite quickly if it is effective.  I am not stating they all will, but I get the sense of people being dragged into the 21st century rather than embracing it and embracing technology and changing work patterns.  I am sorry but this is the sense I get.</p></speech>

Recently, I conducted a small survey of small retail businesses in Galway.  One person told me every time someone comes into a particular sports shop, the person will have already checked the prices online and unless it can be at least matched, the shop will not get the business.  The person also stated shops pay rates and rent and bring the heart back into villages and that there must be some gain for them and an incentive to remain open because they can also put their businesses online.  The person asked whether the retail sector could get the 9% VAT rate which was given to the hotel and service industries as it would keep them open and competitive.  Let us face it - online businesses do not have the same costs.  Do the witnesses receive this type of feedback and what is their view on it?</p></speech>

The market decides whether businesses shut or survive, whether it involves Amazon or any other business.  We have been asked to address the conditions that collectively through our regulatory and fiscal regimes we can address to enable local businesses to survive.  It is right to state businesses need to go online, as those which do not will be dead.  There has been a massive shake-out in the downturn, but a significant number of jobs are still in the sector with 180,000 people still employed in retail.  It has massive potential to grow further and this is what we are getting at.</p></speech>

Senator Healy Eames spoke about the sense of place in a town centre.  Much of our presentation was focused on how we return a sense of community and good experience to a town centre to help people return there.  Deputy Lyons is familiar with Charlestown shopping centre and Finglas.  Finglas was a marvellous community town when I was growing up but the shopping centre has had an impact.  This comes back to how local authorities can help to drive what happens in an area.  To return to our presentation, we stated there is a real onus on local authorities, the new structures, the local community development committees and strategic policy committees to focus on the redevelopment of town centres.</p><p>  With regard to taxation, if all VAT was reduced to 9% everyone would want a piece of it.</p> <p>It is about how we make sure we are making the right changes that keep us alive as a country and get our sustainability sorted out.</p></speech>

We wish to make sure we support measures such as, for example, the national minimum wage, which still is higher than in the United Kingdom and that has an impact.  If, for example, somebody in the book trade is operating from a warehouse in Norwich, the rates he or she is paying, versus the rates somebody pays for being in Fingal, Cavan or wherever he or she might be, are a cost-competitive issue, as are all these things.  Increasingly, even for just ordinary retail purchases, we are competing with international sellers.  This again goes back to expertise in retail.  This conversation is about towns and villages and not just about retail.  Another thing is many companies do not engage with organisations.  They just wish to open their doors and do their own thing.  Again, we would like to see more of those companies getting engaged.  If one is more engaged with the environment, with one's chamber and one's local authority, one might learn more about the things that are available and open to one.</p></speech>

I believe the witnesses' own report, published last year, put members in mind of this topic and the taking on of this area, because while other reports have been produced since then, RGDATA's report was one of the first to really target this topic of the need to discuss the town centres.  On some of the joint committee's trips around the country pertaining to the issue of the black economy, members visited a few towns, particularly in the west, where there clearly was an issue to be addressed.  I thank the witnesses for their time and as I outlined at the end of the last presentation, this is part of a wider process through which members are going to get some action in respect of the retail consultation forum.  It will meet again in the autumn and the joint committee hopes to feed into that process with a report on this issue as well.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>If that has not put her off, I invite Ms Buckley, who is used to the committee, to make her presentation.</p></speech>

We are delighted to appear before the joint committee to talk to members about policy options to support business growth and job retention and creation in Irish towns and villages.  As the Chairman noted, I am accompanied by Mr. Colin Fee, an entrepreneur from County Louth with shops and businesses in Dundalk and Drogheda, Mr. Hugh Doyle of the Donnybrook Fair group, a second-generation retailer with shops and businesses in Dublin and Wicklow and Mr. Eamonn Gavin, who is a town centre supermarket owner in Ballinagh, County Cavan.  They are representative of the owners of the 4,000 local shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets that RGDATA represents.</p><p>  A few years ago, the economist Mr. Jim Power carried out research for RGDATA and found that the independent retail grocery sector in Ireland supported 90,000 jobs and made a total contribution of &euro;3.6 billion to the Irish economy.  The study highlighted that the shops RGDATA represents are major employers and contributors in local economies and have a strong family ownership structure with second, third, fourth and fifth-generation involvement.  They are major supporters of local and Irish suppliers, make a major contribution to their local communities and local authorities and provide many people with their first job.  Importantly, Mr. Power pointed out that spending &euro;100 in a locally-owned shop is worth three times more to the local community than spending it in a global chain.  RGDATA members are the town and village retailers and are happy to assist the joint committee's examination of policy options to drive job creation and retention.</p><p>  Before we touch on those options, I would like to state that entrepreneurial independent retailers are doing it for themselves.  RGDATA members are creating and sustaining jobs and businesses, constantly innovating and adapting, proactively dealing with competition from the biggest retailers in the world, actively engaging in their local community, seeking out local Irish producers and products to bring to their customers and constantly reinvesting in their business and their people.  These are key characteristics of the Irish independent retail sector and this is why we still have a third share of the Irish grocery market, in a marked contrast to our UK and EU neighbours where independent shops are losing out to multiple chains.</p><p>   Consequently, while independent shopkeepers are getting on with what they do best, namely, creating and sustaining jobs and constantly innovating to ensure their businesses survive and thrive, what can members as policy makers do to assist them?  RGDATA believes that what the policy makers need to focus on is delivering on the promise to make Ireland the best country in the world for small business.  To paraphrase a slogan all members will have heard, some things have been done but there is a lot more to do.  What policy makers need to do is to allow the conditions to exist for businesses to do what they do best, which is to get on with generating businesses and creating employment.  We are not looking for a hand-up or a handout but instead for the State to stop adding unnecessary red tape and to focus on removing unnecessary impediments to doing business.</p><p>  What can policy makers do to assist with job creation in towns and villages?  I will provide some suggestions from RGDATA.  They should reinstate the 4.25% employers&rsquo; PRSI rate.  They should ensure no increases in business costs as a result of new legislation or regulations.  They should monitor constantly bank charges, as well as access to and the cost of credit.  In addition, they should monitor the cost of implementing changes in payments on foot of the Government&rsquo;s drive for fewer cash transactions and more electronic payments.</p> <p>We also need to establish a national parking policy guideline, get upward-only rents legislation through the D&aacute;il, drive cost cutting and efficiencies at local government level, ensure value for money from commercial rates and a fair sharing of burden between town centres and out-of-town retailers and support clued-in retail developments with sustainable retail planning policies while introducing specific incentives for town centre regeneration.</p><p> With regard to business costs, we have been long promised a 25% reduction in business regulation costs.  If members ask any independent retailers, unfortunately they have not seen evidence of this; all we hear about is new, additional charges or red tape.  For example, the Minister for Health wants to raise &euro;5 million by imposing a new annual tobacco licence, costing between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per retailer, although retailers are already registered and regulated by the Office for Tobacco Control and pay a &euro;50 fee.  This action alone will close struggling newsagents and smaller shops, costing hundreds of jobs in towns and villages.  We ask members to ensure the transfer of the national lottery licence will not lead to new charges from banks just to change the name on long-established agreements to provide bonds for national lottery retail agents.  We thank policymakers for ensuring that retail agents' margins are ring-fenced but this could be another way of taking some of that margin away from retailers.</p><p> RGDATA retailers are very conscious of the responsible sale of alcohol and we want to support the responsible retailing of alcohol.  We note the voluntary code will become statutory and we ask members to ensure this will not add to the costs for independent retailers.  We welcome the competition and consumer protection legislation currently going through the legislative process; it will introduce new compliance and training costs for grocery goods undertakings with a turnover in excess of &euro;50 million.  We see some groups calling for this threshold to be reduced to &euro;10 million but that would be totally unnecessary and significantly add to the costs for smaller retail businesses.  These are just some of the issues that policymakers can influence.  They will impose new costs and more red tape but will not deliver any significant benefits and will have an impact on jobs in smaller shops in towns and villages.</p><p> Policymakers may be delighted that banks are getting back to profitability but local Irish business owners are paying for this with new bank charges and increased security costs.  For example, the cost of lodging cash has increased from less than 20 cent per &euro;100 to almost 50 cent per &euro;100.  That increase has added approximately &euro;20,000 to bank charges for one of our members who runs a forecourt business.  I recently saw a refreshing presentation from the chief executive of the office of better regulation in the UK and, in that jurisdiction, they have to remove two existing licences or regulations before they can introduce a new one.  Additionally, they run a scheme called "Trading Places", where business regulation inspectors spend a few days working in the business they will be inspecting so they get a good understanding of what it is like to be on the other side of the counter.</p><p> Where towns are well managed, RGDATA gets few complaints about commercial rates but we get many complaints where the streets are dirty, the town centre is uninviting and parking regimes or charges are driving customers away from the town.  We also get significant complaints when the area has been revalued and the rates for a shop increased by 70% or 150%, as has happened to RGDATA members.  We urge policymakers to ensure the costs for any small or medium-sized businesses do not increase by such amounts in any one year.</p><p> The committee has already heard much about making town centres clean, attractive, safe places that are inviting to visit and in which to do business.  Some towns are doing a great job and in many of these RGDATA members are involved in or spearheading town trader groups.  The group provides assistance in helping these but we need more involvement from local authorities and specific funds ring-fenced for investment in town centre regeneration, with specific incentives to regenerate town centre sites and derelict buildings and shops, as well as heritage buildings and sites.  There should be a focus on revitalising derelict town centre sites and vacant shops before any further edge of town or out of town development is approved.  We need value for money for our rates spend and there also needs to be joined-up thinking in the administration of town centre parking regimes, which are driving people, literally, to out of town centres with free parking.  This needs to be addressed.  RGDATA supports the effective management of car parking &ndash; we understand that this is necessary &ndash; but if there is a charge for parking in the town centre then there should be a similar charge for parking in the out of town shops.  Car parks in out of town centres should be subject to rates.</p><p> RGDATA has never opposed the national minimum wage and we actively assist our members to comply with all of the various employment regulations and legislation.  Why do policymakers continue to single out only the retail grocery and convenience sector for a joint labour committee, JLC, wage-setting structure?  This effectively will mean that just because we sell certain items like confectionary and pressed ham, we end up with a statutory system that imposes higher starting wages than the rest of the retail sector.  Retail has changed and fashion stores now sell sweets and confectionary, department stores sell newspapers and magazines, cakes and biscuits, off-licences sell pizza and ice cream, and booksellers sell groceries.  The barriers are blurred and we should all be treated the same.</p><p> If we want retailers to create and retain jobs in rural towns and villages, we must reinstate the 4.25% employers' PRSI for people earning less than &euro;356 a week.  That one change since 1 January this year has added &euro;20,000 to &euro;80,000 to RGDATA members' wage bills, which equates to many jobs in the retail sector.  Some 2,200 further retail jobs have been lost in the most recent CSO statistics, and if this lower rate of employers' PRSI is reinstated, we will create new jobs.</p><p> I will now ask my colleagues to outline how they are getting on with creating and retaining jobs in towns and villages, and what they think needs to be done to assist them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Fee" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400011#L00200"><p>Our main business is in Dundalk and we have convenience and forecourt stores.  We have recently acquired a public house for our sins.  Our business has been in the family since 1958, and my brother, Eugene, and I took it over in 1991.  We currently have 65 staff employed, and that number is down approximately 20% in the past five years because of cost cutting.  We have a number of projects in the pipeline.</p><p>  In all my years working since we went into business on our own in 1991, I have found the past two or three years to be the most challenging and difficult.  I have three of the main examples of what we experienced over the past couple of years, and the first concerns planning levies.  We built two shop units adjacent to one of our sites and the parking levies as part of the planning levies amounted to &euro;80,000 because of the number of shops.  We paid the money but no extra parking was provided for it.  The money accounted for approximately 25% of the total project costs, which involved changes to a post office, alterations shop and a pharmacy.  There are between 12 and 16 people employed in these new businesses, which did not relocate from elsewhere.  It will take three to five years of rent just to pay for the parking levies.  There are three other businesses in town which were going to do similar ventures to create employment but the parking levies in particular stopped them going ahead.</p><p>  The Chairman mentioned another big issue concerning the black economy and something must be done about it.  I will not get into the specifics but everybody knows what these people are at.  They are not regulated or obeying rules, and they do not pay all the duties they should.  There have been a couple of incidents when people have opened a business and undercut us, particularly on the fuel side, as Dundalk is a hive of fuel laundering sites which seem to be completely above the law.  These businesses operate but not everything on the staff side goes through the books or is declared.  Many regulations are not been heeded, and nothing seems to be done.  We are four cent or five cent per litre adrift.</p> <p>They are selling fuel below the price our supplier pays for it.  That is an area that needs to be examined.</p><p> We also find it hard to attract staff even though we pay over the minimum wage.  This is mainly because social welfare entitlements are too lucrative.  Recently, when we had to cut costs, instead of letting two staff members go, we decided to reduce their hours.  Two months later, one of the staff members said he had got a job over in the UK and was heading there.  When I informed the other staff member of the good news that he was back on a five-day week, he told me it would cost him money to do so because of the value of the social welfare benefits he was getting for working a three-day week.  We subsequently had to hire another person on a three-day week.  When we are interviewing for staff, we are invariably asked by applicants if they will be paid through the books.  When we inform them, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, they are disappointed.  We are trying to compete in that field with retailers who are not paying through the books.  This whole area of regulation has to be tightened up.</p><p> As Ms Buckley stated, there are a significant number of regulations in our business from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the environmental health officers and the Dangerous Substances Act with which we have to comply.  We have issues with unregulated car washes.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association, IPRA, reckons there are over 3,000 unlicensed car washes currently operating.  They wash them cheaper than we can as it is not viable for us to do it at their prices.  Our car wash business has been practically eradicated.  These unlicensed operators, for example, do not have effluent licences or do not pay water charges and simply get away with it.  In my area, two food outlets opened recently.  I know from standing in them that they are not fully compliant with EHO regulations.  They also undercut us and seem to get away with it as well.  The regulated businesses seem to be the easy touch for many of the regulatory bodies.</p><p> I hear these reports in the media that banks are turning around credit and loan applications in so many weeks.  Our experience is that this is total rubbish.  Currently, we have an application in for the restructuring of existing credit facilities.  It has been with the bank for 15 months which keeps coming back for more information which resets the clock every time.  I have two other applications in, one for a new venture for a public house beside us which went up for sale and which we bought for strategic reasons.  We bought the pub for almost &euro;600,000 through a bridging loan from one of our stakeholders.  We made applications through the Bank of Ireland in July 2013 and AIB in November 2013.  We still have not got a letter of sanction from either bank.  I went way up the line three weeks ago and it is moving now.  The main part of this public house will be a restaurant.  We will hire between 12 and 18 staff, including chefs, waitresses and counter staff, to run this part of the business.  However, we cannot hire them until we get the bank finance.  That is an indication of how the banks are stymying access to credit.  The same is happening with another building we bought with a restaurant and two coffee shops looking to rent it.  Again, I cannot close the sale until the bank comes back to me.  The banks seem to be grossly understaffed, having got rid of their experienced staff.  This is the toughest I have ever experienced.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that times are incredibly difficult.  Like everyone in the trade, we have seen massive reductions in like-for-like sales over recent years.  As a management team, we feel we have made some solid decisions over the past six years that have helped us survive and grow.  Since 2008, we have opened three stores and are examining other opportunities.  Some of the Government&rsquo;s interventions, such as the PRSI reduction and the removal of the joint labour committees, have helped us maintain jobs.</p><p>  We feel, however, there is a lack of support from the Government in certain areas.  For example, as an independent retailer we are feeling a big effect from below-cost selling in some of our stores.  Fruit and vegetables comprise one area where our sales are dropping massively.  The multiples can sell bags of carrots for 5 cent and alcohol at below cost even though the Government increased duty on wine by &euro;1.  These are having major impacts on our business.  It is not just about us losing the revenue but the effect it has on our footfall.  This, in turn, affects the numbers of people we can employ.</p><p>  While we welcome and see the obvious benefits of trade liberalisation, the issue is that large corporations seem to have an unfair advantage as they can absorb losses associated with below-cost selling.  In effect, the Government is subsiding these losses while, at the same time, putting small businesses at an inherent disadvantage.  While we are positive about the future and are examining more opportunities, we are looking for more support from the Government in certain areas.</p></speech>

We had a good run over the years, building the staff from two to 42 and the shop up from 600 sq. ft. up to 7,000 sq. ft.  Over the past ten years, it has all changed dramatically, however, from a high to a slide.  From 2008, our business has suffered dramatically.  We have had local competition, which is fair enough as we are four miles from Cavan town.  We have lost about 20 staff and while we are running a profitable business, it is getting harder.  I do not mind work but having to work between 70 and 80 hours a week is hard.  This affects many of the small shop owners I know from around the country.</p><p>  It has been ten years since I spent a penny on our business when normally I modernise my facilities every six years.  Last September, I took on the first staff member since 2008.  In July 2008, there was the fuel smuggling Border problem, the start of the recession and then in September, the financial crash.  That year will be etched in my memory for ever.  Last September, I felt we were getting stronger and were at the bottom of the bucket.  On 1 January, however, even before I opened the shop, I discovered our business was down &euro;22,000.</p> <p>The previous day I contacted my bookkeeper to inquire what was wrong with the wages which were way up and was informed it was employers' PRSI.  I was stuck because we had to add an extra &euro;22,000 to our bottom line in order to survive.</p><p> I am still optimistic; I am not pessimistic.  This is a small matter.  I do not know how much taxes are generated by the employers' PRSI but it makes a difference in a small rural town.  I do not know if all of the members of the committee are from the country but I can attest to the fact that it has been devastated and things get worse as one moves further west.  In my area I am the main employer by a mile and my wage bill will be about &euro;400,000, which has a big impact in a small community.  The wage bill used to range between &euro;600,000 and &euro;650,000.  We work very hard but I feel that the Government has not put much thought into employers' PRSI.  My company puts money into a small rural area and there are hundreds of people like me.  I am not on my own.  However, more thought should be put into this matter.</p><p> I do not know how the Government would raise other taxation but I know it must raise taxation.  The current rate of employers' PRSI is one of the biggest mistakes that has been made in recent years.  I was going to carry out some renovation work this year, which I still hope to do, but I have not taken on another staff member even though I could do with one.  </p><p> I had planned to do something else today but Ms Buckley telephoned me at 2 p.m. yesterday and asked me to come here today as a replacement for somebody else.  I had arranged for extra staff to carry out a deep clean on refrigeration and take things apart in my shop, which is done twice of year.  I started that work this morning, jumped in the car and drove up here.  When this meeting is finished I will probably have a cup of coffee with Ms Buckley but then I will travel home and finish off the job in my shop tonight.  I should not have to do so, and I do not mind doing so, but it is not just me who works hard.  There are hundreds like me and we would like a little more thought put into this matter.  </p><p> I suggest one simple way to raise taxation. We have a pile of customs people sitting on their backsides around the Border yet we have a black market for cigarettes.  It is a drug dealers' market and they are going house to house to sell their wares.  The reason I mention this matter is because I was shocked by the following instance.  About 18 months ago a lady came to me whom I had not seen for a while and I said to her, "Kathleen, I have not seen you for a while.  Did we do anything wrong to you?"  She said she was in hospital with a respiratory problem and said I would never believe how she got it.  She had visited her sister-in-law for a Christmas dinner.  There were only two smokers present, this lady and her sister-in-law, and they went outside to have a smoke.  That was when her sister-in-law told her about great value cigarettes where she got a man to call to her twice a month with her supply of cigarettes that cost half nothing.  The person to whom I refer is not from a housing estate but holds a senior position in a company.  However, she ended up in hospital due to a respiratory problem caused by smoking.  That is neither here nor there but the long and short of it is that there is a rampant sale of cigarettes.  I know that we heard good news about this problem today but that was today.  The sale of illegal cigarettes is rampant around the country.  I suggest that customs officers are utilised more, and  asked to work seven days a week, if necessary, or use more scanners at the ports.  Such initiatives would generate the same amount of money for Revenue as we must pay in employers' PRSI.  If that was done we would have more money to employ more people and those savings add up.</p></speech>

He has raised a couple of issues.  One of them was the black market which we, as a committee, put a lot of work into last year.  We have made a lot of recommendations to Government, some of which have been acted upon.  However, we intend to pursue the matter.  He is right that a lot of taxpayers' money is wasted and a lot of jobs could be created if that money was spent on jobs.  We will work on the matter.</p><p>  I thank everyone for their presentations.  We will now have questions.  I suggest we take all of the questions together because there is a third presentation to be made afterwards.  Taking all of the questions together will test people's memory.  For a change I shall call Senator Quinn first as he must leave early.</p></speech>

Some of the problems are the same but some are new.  Perhaps the delegation can tell us things that we can do.  Perhaps it would outline the position on parking levies, as I am not up to date on them, and on Joint Labour Committee, JLC, wage structures.  I had understood this had been addressed but it has not from what has been said.</p><p>  Will there be a change to the view expressed by RGDATA that we rely too much on the State, Government and council to do things?  How can we encourage everybody to clean the streets and clean their own footpaths outside their own shops?  Some towns do so.  I travelled to Drogheda last year or the year before where I found that people in the town did not talk to one another, and one street did not talk to another street.  We got them all together and one of the first things they said that they do not tidy up the street  as they look to the council to do it on a daily basis but they would be prepared to do so on the days the council does not.  I got them all promise to clean the street outside.  Sometimes we have got to do the work ourselves rather than rely on somebody else.    </p><p>  I wish to refer to the competition Bill and the reduction in the relevant charge from &euro;50 to &euro;10.  What is that about?</p></speech>

I always say if we could get RGDATA to meet senior civil servants in the next few weeks we might do more good than in anything else.</p><p>  Employers' PRSI was referred to by Mr. Doyle, Mr. Gavin and Mr. Fee.  Can Ms Buckley tell me how much has employers' PRSI cost its members?  Has RGDATA calculated the cost?  There has been an ultimate fall in employment in retail which I personally think is directly linked to the cost of PRSI.  I would like to hear the figure for the overall cost to RGDATA members.</p><p>  RGDATA has led the campaign against out-of-town shopping and breaches of the planning laws.  Where is that fight at present?  Has the argument moved on?  Is it still a live argument?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014062400013#N00500"><p>I commend RGDATA on its presentation.  It is very clear to me that its organisation and members are the backbone of the retail sector throughout the State.  I also commend it on its minimum wage policy.</p><p>  The welfare cliff was mentioned which is a big issue in this State.  My view is that it is necessary for welfare protections to persist at a higher wage level so that people can go back into those jobs.  If one goes the other way with jobs then people will be pushed into poverty.  The delegation is right that the protections, as currently structured, force people out of the workforce. </p><p>  The issue of rates is huge and there needs to be a progressive approach taken.  I fully agree with RGDATA's view that out-of-town parking spaces need to be charged rates.  There is no doubt that these businesses are part of the business offering but they have a competitive advantage over town centres.</p><p>  Banks are the Holy Grail of the Government's policy and everybody else has been left on the sideline.  That ranges from debt distress to bank charges for cash.  Difficulties with getting loans was mentioned.  Does the delegation have information on its members going out of business because of the impact of debt distress on functioning business?  Have they gone out of business due to debt distress?</p><p>  Regulation and costs were referred to.  Does RGDATA have the cost for particular regulations throughout the sectors?  Can businesses say that a given regulation cost their business a given amount of money?  I understand that the delegation may not have the information right now.  If it quantified those costs in the long run it would make it easier for us to argue either for or against a regulation.</p><p>  I agree that the grocery model, as constituted within legislation, is archaic and historic and it does not take into consideration the evolution of businesses.  What effect have the property and water charges had on business?  The conversation on water charges pre-election, in my understanding, has had a negative effect on people's disposable income.  People must financially plan around the charge.  I would like to hear the view of RGDATA on the matter.</p><p>  With regard the Border, it is my strongly held view that we need to equalise excise, taxes and fuel policies.  We have different types of diesels, etc., on the island which creates a space for criminals to launder fuel and so on.  It would be interesting to hear more views from RGDATA on the matter.</p><p>  The composition of the delegation has led to a good geographical spread.  Can the delegation give its view on the two-tier economy that is developing in this State?</p></speech>

The latest ESRI report published in July states differently.  It finds that six out of seven people would be better off in work due to the social protection policies been put in that have  place.  That is the latest evidence-based data available.  The ESRI, which is the research body of the State, indicates that, as of now, almost six out of seven people would be better off in work.  I checked it while sitting here just to make sure I got it right.</p><p> The other issue is on parking fees.  Although I agree that something needs to be done, we cannot get away from the fact that out-of-town centres, whether we like it or not, paid a development levy on their parking spaces during the planning permission stage.  That is the position.  How are we to deal with that issue?  We cannot ignore that essential ingredient whereby they had paid for those spaces when developing those out-of-town centres.  If there is another creative way of levelling the playing pitch I would like to hear it.</p><p> I agree with the witness in respect of the black economy.  The witnesses appeared before the committee previously on this issue.  It is great to hear the good news today but most certainly we are not at the races when it comes to the black economy and it is the companies represented here who are losing out.  What does plain packaging do?  I understand from a public policy point of view what it is trying to achieve but I am not sure whether there is enough research as of now, from other countries, such as Australia which has led on this issue, whether it has an impact on public health policy.  It will definitely impact negatively on the businesses, which some of the witnesses are representing here today.</p></speech>

In respect of employers' PRSI, the cost to Mr. Eamonn Gavin, who has 28 staff, is &euro;22,000.  Other members who have several hundred staff, have reported their costs to us.  In the independent retail trade, many of our members employ part-time people.  These are very important jobs in local communities for mothers who want to work in the morning and be able to collect their children from school.  Many of these are earning less than &euro;356 per week because they are working shorter hours.  They are hugely important jobs to those families in those communities.  That employers' PRSI allowed retailers to give those people jobs.  As Mr. Eamonn Gavin said, he would employ more of those type of people if he could afford to because he needs more assistance in his store but he unable to do so due to costs.  If that is the average among our members we believe there could be 90,000 jobs in the independent retail sector.  Even if the number is 80,000 and if it costs &euro;22,000 for every 20 jobs, that is a lot of money collected through PRSI.  We think it is better if it paid to people who will spend it in their local community and keep other businesses and jobs going.  Our argument would be that it is a short-sighted measure which, if reversed, would make a critical impact on local jobs.  Quite often we appear before the committee and discuss policies.  This is a simple measure that could be put in place and which we genuinely believe would create jobs in towns and villages, the type of jobs that are needed.</p><p>  On the issue of out-of-town centres, we are big champions of the retail planning guidelines and sustainable retail planning on which we have done much work in the past.  Following a review of our retail planning guidelines I am delighted to say that the planners in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are good, think ahead and are strategic.  We are appreciative of the work they have done on those guidelines.  Where the guidelines are upheld - I am aware of this from other groups who have appeared before the committee - and retailers are directed into the retail zone or the town centre, those towns are doing very well.  If we think about the examples that have been relayed here about towns that are doing well, they are the towns with the retailers, and importantly, the food retailers in the town centre.  The towns that have allowed the doughnut development and the food retailers to go out to greenfield sites are the towns that are suffering.  The daily footfall that the food retailer creates has gone out of the town.</p><p>  The retailers who want to build huge out-of-town stores do not want competition.  They want to be out there on their own where one can go to their free car park and do all one's shopping there without giving business to anybody else.  We think we are the most competitive.  We are happy to be in the town centre where one can come in and compete with us.  We think that is a much fairer system and it is much better for the town and the community because everyone is shopping around.  There is competition, variety, quality and choice.  Our only concern is that every now and then a local authority or somebody tries to get around the retail planning guidelines or apply for a change to their development plan.  We would say to member of the committee, as policymakers, that they should resist that.  </p><p>   An application was made earlier this year for a very large discount warehouse beside Ikea in Ballymun.  That should have been resisted as it will be devastating for towns and villages not only in that area but in surrounding counties.  There is some move towards changing local neighbourhood centres to allow in much bigger stores.  That is not what a local neighbour centre is about.  A local neighbourhood centre is a local small convenient store with a medical centre, a beautician, or whatever but not a very large supermarket.  One should not change those laws to allow for large supermarkets to go in.  They should be local neighbourhood centres.  While many positive developments are taking place, I ask policymakers to keep an eye on the position because there are people who will always try to wriggle and change the guidelines and forget about the good policies in place.  </p><p>  I invite Mr. Colin Fee to speak about the difficulties with the banks, obtaining loans and parking levies, on which Senator Feargal Quinn asked for more information.</p></speech>

There is no change to the infrastructure.  If we could put the park in we would it ourselves as part of the overall project.  What happens is that one is levied.  The local authority works on the basis of a number of car spaces for that development and one is levied accordingly.  I think the cost is &euro;8,500 or &euro;8,300 per car space.  If one has a development such as ours, where one is charged &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 just to provide parking spaces, and taken with the other levies such as water, sewerage and so on, one ends up paying a huge amount.  That is an impediment to getting these projects off the ground especially the smaller in-town projects.  I am aware of three that did not go ahead because the costs meant they were not viable.  I do not know if all local authorities charge the same price but in County Louth the cost is &euro;8,500 per unit.</p></speech>

We think it is more about ensuring that people who take on part-time or low-paid jobs are not penalised for taking on those jobs but are encouraged to do so.  We agree with members on that issue.</p><p>  We were asked about the black market.  That is an issue on which we all agree.  A question was asked about the specific cost of regulations.  RGDATA has done much work in this area and on the huge number of licences and regulations.  We put a cost a cost on it at the time which I will forward to the committee.  We have had a development in this area as the Government is working on a portal whereby retailers can get all their licences in the one place.  We would like them to include a 25% reduction on all the costs but we are not hearing that yet.</p><p>  We do have concerns about new licences coming on stream.  For example, the one mentioned today, the new licence for tobacco retailers has apparently gone to Cabinet today.  It is unfair on legitimate tobacco retailers to charge them an extra &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 per year.  This will result in the closure of small tobacconist newsagents and will put people out of jobs.</p></speech>

I am the senior legal officer with Nasc, the Irish Immigrant Support Centre.  Nasc is a non-governmental organisation working for an integrated society based on the principles of human rights, social justice and equality.  Nasc, which is the Irish word for link, works to link migrants to their rights through protecting human rights, promoting integration and campaigning for change.  Nasc was founded in 2000 in response to the rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers and migrant workers moving to the city of Cork.  It is the only NGO offering legal information and advocacy services to immigrants in Ireland&rsquo;s second city.  Nasc&rsquo;s legal team assists some 1,000 immigrants annually in navigating Ireland&rsquo;s protection, immigration and naturalisation systems.  We also assist migrants and ethnic-minority Irish people who encounter community-based and institutional racism and discrimination.  Our campaigning strategy is informed by the issues emanating from our legal case work and our day-to-day work with migrants.<br/>The Nasc legal service has considerable experience responding to inquiries from employment permit holders.  The content of my presentation is drawn directly from the case work.  Our service responds to the needs of employment permit holders by way of acting on behalf of this migrant group in individual cases to both to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, DJEI, and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, of the Department of Justice and Equality.<br/>We welcome the publication of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014.  In particular, we welcome the intention to introduce legislative protection for migrant workers who do not hold an employment permit in cases of illegal employment contracts, in response to the High Court decision in the Younis case.<i></i>The Bill proposes to legislate for a number of policies already in place concerning the current administration of employment permit schemes and we welcome the intention to provide legislative protection in these areas.<br/>Nasc made submissions to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation prior to the publication of the Bill, with a particular focus on the availability of a mechanism whereby undocumented migrant workers could regularise their immigration permission.  The Nasc legal service has assisted a number of undocumented migrant workers to regularise their immigration status and obtain new employment permits.  In our experience, the current process for regularisation of undocumented migrant workers in exceptional cases is currently subject to discretionary and inconsistent decision making.  We therefore particularly welcome the proposal to introduce legislation that will provide for a reactivation employment permit<i></i>for migrant workers who previously held an employment permit but fell out of employment through no fault of their own.<br/>I wish to provide more detail on reactivation employment permits.  The provisions contained in section 6 propose to insert section 3(A)(2)(<i>f</i>) into the Act of 2006.  That has the potential to ensure attainable pathways to regularisation for undocumented migrant workers.  We particularly welcome the co-operation of the Department of Justice and Equality in that regard.  However, we believe that the requirements proposed by section 3(A)(2)(<i>f</i>) are overly restrictive and a number of undocumented migrant workers would be unable to regularise their status in the State as a result.  We submit that the section should include a provision where the requirement to have &quot;previously held an employment permit that is no longer in force&quot; could be waived in exceptional circumstances where the migrant worker has been exploited.<br/>Section 3(A)(2)(<i>f</i>) also requires applicants to not be in employment when making an application under this section.  It is submitted that this section should be removed as the majority of undocumented migrant workers have no option but to engage in black market employment while they seek to regularise their permission in the State.  This provision could deter undocumented migrants from availing of the reactivation scheme.  We submit that the requirement to have received an offer of employment &quot;in respect of an employment for which an employment permit is required&quot; should also be deleted as undocumented migrants in our experience are often low skilled and unable to satisfy the eligible job categories for the grant of an employment permit.</p> <p>It is our experience also that delays in processing applications can have a serious impact on the outcome of an application.  The immigration permission extended to undocumented migrants by the Department of Justice and Equality to apply for an employment permit can often expire before a decision has been made.  Then the lack of immigration permission may be stated as a reason for refusing the employment permit.  The validity of immigration permission should not be used as a ground for refusal in cases where the applicant had a valid permission when the application was submitted.  It is therefore submitted that section 3A(2)(f) should be amended to provide for permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to be valid at the time of submission of the application.<br/>Section 14(1)(c) provides that an employment permit can be refused if the foreign national landed in the State without immigration permission and has not been given permission by the Minister for Justice and Equality under the 2003 Act and was employed when the application for an employment permit was made.  Section 14(1)(c) also provides that refusal may be issued where the foreign national was previously employed in the State without a permit or immigration permission.  It is submitted that section 14(1)(c) is overly restrictive and the requirement not to be in employment at the time of making an employment permit application should be removed <br/>Section 14(2) amends section 12 of the Act of 2006 by inserting numerous provisions after subsection (1) that allow the Minister to refuse an application.  Subsection (1I), as inserted by section 14(2), refers to applications made under reactivation employment permits sections.  It allows the Minister to refuse these applications if an employment permit application was previously made for that purpose and no renewal application was submitted, and it is in the &quot;public interest&quot; to refuse the application.  Employment permit holders are completely dependent upon their employer in relation to the submission of renewal applications and we have experience of cases where a failure to submit a renewal application results from no fault on the part of the employment permit holder.  It is submitted that section 14(2)(1I) should be amended to include a provision that excludes a refusal on the basis that failure to submit a renewal application resulted from no fault on the part of the employment permit holder.  It is submitted that the refusal of an employment permit on the basis of &quot;public interest&quot; should be deleted as it has the potential to allow for arbitrary and inconsistent decision-making.<br/>I want to touch on spousal and dependant employment permits.  The current legislation provides that permits will only be available for spouses or dependants of highly skilled workers holding an employment permit.  This is to encourage this category of foreign national to take up employment in Ireland,  Employment permits for dependants may also be granted to family members of a research project researcher resident in the State pursuant to Directive 2005/71/EC.  We submit that spousal or dependant employment permits should be available to all categories of employment permit holders to ensure family members of migrant workers have an opportunity to become economically viable in Ireland and contribute to the economy.  In addition, the extension of spousal or dependant employment permits to all categories of employment permit holders would be a mechanism whereby family members can integrate into Irish society and would ensure respect of migrant workers' private and family life.<br/>Section 3(A)(2)(b)(i) provides that spouses or dependants who wish to apply for an employment permit must have obtained permission to land and reside in the State as a dependant.  This provision would appear to exclude relationships that have formed in the State due to the requirement to have obtained a so-called permission to land.  The requirement to have obtained both permission to land and to reside should be removed to allow for relationships that have formed in the State to avail of spousal or dependant employment permits.  The availability of spousal or dependant employment permits are essential to attract and retain highly skilled and all categories of employment permit holders.<br/>While the Bill does not make any provision in relation to sectoral employment permits, we wish to highlight the fact that a sectoral approach to the issuance of employment permits is provided for under existing legislation.  We submit that section 4(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 should be fully implemented to allow the permit holder to work in a particular economic sector as opposed to working for a specified employer, as is the current practice.  In our experience this practice greatly increases the risks of workplace exploitation and limits labour market mobility.  Correct implementation of the Employment Permits Act 2006 would allow all permit holders to change employer within the permitted economic sector and would remove the requirement to apply for a new work permit.  The provision of sectoral work permits should protect migrant workers from becoming undocumented as they would have greater mobility within the labour market.<br/>My final point refers to a general undocumented workers scheme for exploited migrant workers.  We submit that provision for an open-ended undocumented workers scheme should be introduced in the Bill to cater for migrant workers who have been subjected to exploitation, fraud, deception and employer non-compliance and who do not qualify for the reactivation employment permit provided for in the Bill.  Such a scheme should include concessions relating to salary thresholds and ineligible job categories to ensure low-skilled undocumented migrants are afforded an effective pathway to regularisation.<br/>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for the opportunity to make my presentation.</p></speech>

We have had difficulties in this area but in comparison with other European countries, we have managed some elements quite well.  I think the proper drafting of this Bill is necessary to ensure we improve on it and do not have similar problems to what Britain and other countries have experienced.  I think the people of Belfast will have a thing or two to say about the title of second city of Ireland.  I just thought I would get that aside in there.</p><p>  The Younis case has provided a watershed and has awoken a great many people to the exploitation.  Mr. Mohammed Younis spoke at our committee last week and some of the information he provided would shock one to the bone about modern Ireland, and his experience bears out the necessity for improvement.</p><p>  With regard to the reactivation of permits, Ms Cumiskey referred to the fact that some people were not able to regularise their situation.  Is it difficult to estimate how many people are finding it difficult to reactivate their permits?  She referred also to delays in processing applications.  Has she information on how long these delays are and the difficulties they are causing people?  One of the concerns some people would have about the Bill is that if a person arrives in Ireland illegally and then applies for a permit to work, that might create a weakness in our regulations.  It is contended that people should have the opportunity to apply legally for a permit from abroad, but if one states that people can regularise their situation in Ireland, it will mean that others will worry that people will flock here to regularise their situation.  I always think of the other side of the coin, the Irish in America, when I hear that argument and how strong we are when looking for regularisation of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  Will Ms Cumiskey address that fear that some people have about people flocking to Ireland for work permits?</p><p>  The complete dependency of the permit holder on the employer in my view creates the opportunity for exploitation.  We have tabled an amendment on the spouses issue and we have also tabled an amendment for those who have been separated or divorced because these individuals need confirmation of their eligibility to be regularised.  We support the views on the sectoral approach.</p> <p>Although we will not be able to submit some of the Irish Immigrant Support Centre&rsquo;s suggestions on Committee Stage, we can submit them on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This is the first time we have seen a policy introduced to have a scheme to re-activate these types of permissions.  When one is working on these types of cases, one is working at the discretion of two Departments, namely, INIS, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, in the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I cannot give the specific number of re-activations granted.  Those figures are not published and we have to ask for them.<br/>Over the past five years, we have assisted 25 migrants who were previously in the State on a work permit, became undocumented and wanted to get back into the system.  They needed an employment permit to do that.  To do this, one must make an application to INIS for an immigration permission because one cannot apply for a work permit from within the State without this permission.  This step to get a decision on a temporary permission could take up to three to four months.  Then one must submit an application to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the actual work permit.  This is a two-tiered approach but with this legislation it is essential both Departments will work together on this in a meaningful way.</p></speech>

It also strikes me, however, that there is a major resourcing problem in the service.  In any of the cases I have dealt with, it took a long time and the level of engagement was low with the agency.  I have had cases of people whose work permits went out of date while waiting for INIS to provide a service to them.</p></speech>

If a decision on a work permit has not been granted by the time an immigration permission expires, one has to go back to INIS to ask for another temporary permission.  We would hope that some regulations will be put in place once these re-activation employment permits come into law to allow for a minimum processing time or a greater synergy between both Departments to ensure the applications come through efficiently.</p><p>  On the question about the floodgates argument, applications for employment permits from within the State are absolutely exceptional.  The majority of employment permits are made while the migrant worker is outside the State.  The proposed scheme will only deal with people who were previously legally in the State but fell out of the system through no fault of their own.  I cannot see any merit in the argument that it will result in floods of migrant workers suddenly coming to Ireland.  What we are really dealing with in this legislation is the legacy issue of migrant workers who have been in Ireland for a long time.  The current income threshold of &euro;30,000, the ineligible job categories and the 50:50 rules mean there will not be a high grant level for applications for general or low-wage employment permits.  The legislation is dealing with people who have been here for many years, who have been exploited, who have not been able to upgrade their immigration permission or attain Irish citizenship.</p></speech>

It is estimated there are 30,000 undocumented migrant workers in the State.  I cannot comment on the number of those who have fallen out of the system through no fault of their own.  INIS introduced a scheme in 2009 for undocumented migrant workers who had been exploited and who previously held a work permit in the State to get back into the system which proved successful.  We also had direct experience of that.  It gave people the opportunity to become economically viable when they would not have the chance without the scheme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014062400003#B00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to have a constructive and full debate on Committee Stage.</p><p>  As Deputies are aware, the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the merging of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  That is why the legislation is important and we need it in place before the summer recess.  The Bill introduces the necessary statutory provisions to enable Ireland ratify the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.  It expands the scope of the convention to include measures to protect the environment from any possible deliberate harmful release of nuclear materials or radiation through sabotage of a nuclear facility.</p><p>  Having listened to the concerns raised by a number of Deputies at the Second Stage reading, I want to again reassure the sub-committee that this merger will not, in any way, result in a diminution, or a perception of a diminution, of our commitment to radiological protection for the public.  I believe the merger will enhance our capacity to continue to deliver regulatory and advisory functions to the highest standard, as well as foster greater synergies and linkages between radiological and environmental policies.  The establishment of the Office of Radiological Protection, within the EPA, will maintain, and indeed build on, the positive profile of radiation protection.</p><p>  The EU Basic Safety Standards Directive, which was agreed during the Irish Presidency of the EU, has as one of its core principles the protection of the environment against the harmful effects of ionising radiation.  This illustrates the growing synergy and inter-dependence between the current functions of the RPII and the EPA.  </p><p>  I will briefly address a number of issues raised by Deputies earlier.  Ireland has an ongoing engagement with the United Kingdom in relation to radiological and nuclear matters.  Officials from the Department of Energy, Community and Local Government, and technical experts from the RPII, meet regularly with their counterparts from the UK Department of Environment and Climate Change.  At these meetings, Irish officials ensure that the UK authorities are kept aware of any concerns on the Irish side, and emphasise that all possible steps are taken to ensure that the highest levels of safety apply at Sellafield, and all other relevant nuclear sites.</p><p>  In November 2012, the Department published a summary of a probabilistic risk assessment report,  prepared by an independent team of international experts, which assessed the risks to Ireland from any potential incidents at Sellafield.  The experts quantified the likelihood and potential impact of an incident occurring at Sellafield, resulting in the release of radioactive material, and found that such an incident would give rise to "no observable health effects in Ireland".  The merger will, in no way, lessen or reduce the current high level of scrutiny applied to Sellafield.  Indeed, I have been told that a visit by the Department and EPA-RPII representatives to the site at Sellafield is currently being arranged for later this year.</p><p>  Another issue which was raised in several contributions in the House was the issue of radon gas.  The Government's primary approach to dealing with the issue of radon is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home.  </p><p>  The National Radon Control Strategy, prepared by an inter-agency group and published in February, sets out 48 recommendations with the ultimate aim of reducing the number of radon-related lung cancer cases which, I think, exceed 220 annually.  Successful implementation of the strategy will require action from a range of Departments, public bodies and stakeholders.  A co-ordination group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently been established to monitor the implementation of the strategy, to report annually on progress and, at the end of the four-year period covered by the action plan, to make recommendations to Government on what further actions are deemed necessary.  I want reassure Deputies that the comprehensive action plan, which is currently being implemented,  will in no way be adversely impacted by the merger.</p><p>  Some concerns were expressed during the appearance by RPII board members before this committee last Thursday about the name of the merged body.  The name will be the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Radiological Protection will be one of five divisions within that organisation.  That means there is a separate division of radiological protection.  The issue of the naming and branding of the merged organisation was very carefully considered.  A number of options were examined prior to the final decision.   </p><p>  The merger working group, established to implement the Government's decision to merge the two bodies and made up of officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the RPII and the EPA, considered the possibility of a name change.  Alternative names were considered.  The issue was then referred to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who decided to keep the EPA name.  His decision was communicated to the RPII board on 24 June 2013 and the reasons were explained in correspondence.</p><p>  A key consideration was the fact that the EPA has far greater name recognition amongst the general public than the RPII.  Also, it is widely accepted that the RPII will benefit from the greater public reach that the EPA banner gives.  The EPA has a much stronger presence on social media, for example.  As a result of the merger, the RPII will now be in a position to access the wider reach of the EPA in the social media space.  It should be highlighted that the cost of re-branding the EPA would have far outweighed any benefits that would accrue from a re-naming.  Finally, it should be pointed out that other environmental protection organisations around the world contain radiological safety divisions, most notably, the US EPA.</p> <p> The aim of the Government's agency rationalisation programme is to reduce the number of State bodies and integrate their roles and responsibilities back into other existing bodies, with some consequent efficiency savings.  Irrespective of the level of savings, the general policy is to follow through on mergers and rationalisations, unless there are strong evidence-based reasons for not doing so.  In the case of the merger of the RPII and the EPA, it is clear that the synergies and greater linkages between the environmental and radiological functions will enhance the capacity of both organisations into the future.</p><p> Some savings have been identified and estimated, beginning at a low level in 2014 and increasing in 2015 and 2016, as these synergies become embedded.  The savings arise mainly under the themes of HR, governance and some administrative cost savings.  Cost savings of up to &euro;260,000 per annum are anticipated from 2016 onwards.  While this figure already incorporates recognition of staff efficiencies in the order of &euro;100,000 per annum, further workforce planning, including a review of structures, roles and responsibilities, will be completed later this year which can further clarify and identify future needs and capacities, as well as scope for further efficiencies.</p><p> The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government provided &euro;70,000 in capital funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 in respect of the merger.  In addition, there is an allocation of &euro;696,000 for current funding and &euro;223,000 in capital funding under the Department's 2014 Vote in respect of merger costs. This expenditure is required to facilitate the updating of human resource, ICT and financial systems, along with accommodation facilities to ensure a smooth operational transition to the merged organisation.</p><p> It was determined at the commencement of the merger process that the most efficient and cost-effective way to enable the merger was to establish a fifth office within the EPA structure, namely, the office of radiological protection.  None of the existing divisions-offices within the EPA are established specifically in legislation.  The 1992 EPA Act sets out that the agency shall consist of a director general and four other directors.  The number will be five post-merger as signalled in this draft legislation.</p><p> It is the function of the director general "to arrange the distribution of the business of the agency among its directors" but this must be done having regard to the statutory functions and requirements of the body.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate or desirable for legislation to prescribe the divisional organisation of the EPA, or to confer one of the offices with a more pre-eminent or differentiated status.  None the less, the EPA board, including the director of the new office of radiological protection, will have to continue to ensure sufficient resources and effort are being directed to meet all the merged bodies' functions, and I have full confidence they will manage their expertise and resources accordingly.  This approach reinforces the findings of an independent review of the EPA, published in May 2011, which concluded that "the flexibility and change management shown by the EPA is a major strength and should not be limited by overly prescriptive statutory provisions governing the Agency's structure".</p><p> A number of Deputies have raised concerns on the potential loss of radiological expertise brought about by the merger.  I reassure the committee that this will not arise and, indeed, is addressed specifically in the legislation.  Section 21 provides for a person with radiological protection expertise to be included on the statutory selection committee for directors of the EPA.  I note that the chair of the RPII told this committee last week that there was no reason to believe that the office of radiological protection would be depleted of scientific expertise.</p><p> The Bill also provides that the Minister may appoint persons with radiological expertise to the EPA's general statutory advisory committee, established under section 27 of the EPA Act.  This advisory committee will also be provided with the statutory ability to give advice on radiological protection matters.  Furthermore, a separate specialist advisory committee, dedicated solely to radiological protection, will be set up by statutory instrument towards the end of this year.</p><p> The second purpose of the Bill is to put in place urgently the statutory provisions required for Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.  This amending treaty will be a cornerstone of international nuclear security measures.  Ireland has long maintained a policy position of encouraging the highest international standards in this regard, and it is important to support our words with actions through ratification of this treaty.</p><p> I welcome the general support by all Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate for the provisions outlined in this Bill to facilitate the ratification.  I look forward to the debate today.  I recommend the Bill to the committee.</p></speech>

I was the only member who had tabled amendments.  Clearly, the poor attendance is an indication that Tuesday mornings are not convenient.  I would indicate to the clerk that I am not in a position to attend committee meetings on a Tuesday morning for the reason that a meeting of the Technical Group coincides with such meetings.  As I am the Whip for the Technical Group, it is particularly difficult for me to attend.  I am unhappy at the lack of attendance and also that the meeting has been arranged at a time that does not suit members.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and his officials.  It is worth pointing out that we have no history of being good at institutional building.  In fact, we have a litany of organisations and institutions that have been almost tweaked following independence and others that have been created that have been pretty disastrous.  The HSE is probably the prime example.  We are not particularly good at building new institutions.  My experience of the Environmental Protection Agency is mixed.  Some of the desktop material is often good and is useful, but when it comes to things happening on the ground, I have had poor experiences with the EPA.  This is one of the areas in which the EPA needs to be particularly good.  We will not know if the assurances the Minister of State has given us that everything will be fine will be the case.  I hope we never know if it is dysfunctional because, if so, the merger of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland with the Environmental Protection Agency could have very serious consequences.</p><p>  Mergers are particularly difficult in that one is often merging two different cultures as well as the staff of organisations.  One could not classify this as a merger, rather it is an incorporation of the RPII into the EPA.  A function of the EPA is about protecting the environment, often from the impact of people, whereas the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is very much about protecting the public from the harmful effects of radiation, radon gas and so on.  Therefore, it has a different focus.  Giving it legislative protection or maintaining some level of independence would have been the very least I would have expected.   I would also have thought the naming of the organisation would have been important.  Essentially, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is being dissolved and incorporated into the EPA.  Arising from the analysis conducted a couple of years ago on the proposed merger, it did not appear there was any great advantage in doing this, even from the point of view of funding.  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond in respect of the advantages other than saying there are fewer quangos, which is very much a throwaway comment.  We have to look at individual organisations and see what their function should be.</p><p>  The Bill allows Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, to which Ireland is a party, to include the words "and Nuclear Facilities".</p><p>  It appears that not all aspects of the RPII are transferred to the EPA.  My argument is that in terms of coherent legislation, this should have been stand-alone legislation.  I will go through the aspects that have been omitted later.</p> <p> Even where there is good legislation and it would work in theory, often there can be problems in practice.  Mixing two cultures in terms of a merged organisation is one matter.  The staff complement can be another.  I wonder whether this will be looked at as a cost-saving exercise, whether there be the ability to increase the staffing and whether there will be sufficient staff to deal with the merged functions.  Some organisations have lost staff through embargoes.  There are gaps in that regard and filling those gaps is obviously an issue.  Those are the opening points that I would want to make.</p><p> Unfortunately, I am watching the clock.  I am sure the Minister of State is watching the clock as well.  I do not want to dwell further on opening comments.</p></speech>

It is a separate and distinct function.  I noted the Minister of State's comment that this is a fifth office and the other four would not have had a different legislative basis, but they have not been the subject of a merger.  My point is that this one is the subject of a merger.<br/>We must retain public trust that the organisation will act independently, and one cannot say that here.

Trust is the big issue.</p><p>  The EPA sometimes, because of its function in dealing with matters, is trying to curtail activities.  We will see this with the climate action and low carbon development Bill where we will be changing consumers' habits.  We will be dealing with fairly big issues, such as, possibly, genetically modified food, where the EPA will be under public scrutiny.  The maintenance of the trust of such organisations as the Environmental Protection Agency is all the more valuable by virtue of the fact that it is an independent separate body.  In the absence of that, the fact that the RPII could be pointed to as having an independent function within the EPA would be the least that we could do to maintain some degree of public trust.</p><p>  This will happen increasingly.  Last summer, we spent more than a week in here dealing with the pre-legislative stage of the climate action and low carbon development Bill.  It is clear there will be fairly serious functions for the EPA as a monitoring organisation.  That cannot be left outside the door in terms of maintaining that public trust.  That is one of the main reasons we should maintain a key independent self-contained organisational structure.</p><p>  The Minister of State might let me know what is being saved as a consequence of doing this.  If we are giving away something that is an intangible, it is important to understand that at least there are tangible returns on it.</p></speech>

Being here is important, and Deputy Catherine Murphy took the time to put down the amendments.</p><p>  While we all have different experiences of the EPA, and I acknowledge that whatever experience Deputy Catherine Murphy had locally happened, my experience is entirely different.  I always found it above reproach.  It was a bit like Caesar's wife, according to the history books.  It is totally independent and I have never seen a successful challenge on a scientific basis to anything generically of which I am aware that the EPA does.  Compared to international bodies, it ranks extremely high in terms of public confidence.</p><p>  The environmental protection agency of practically all countries is extremely independent, highly efficient and scientifically based.  Any meetings I have had with the EPA have always been about facts.  They have never been about opinions in terms of the conflicts in my community.  The current structure is proven and it has worked well.</p><p>  On the question Deputy Catherine Murphy raised about the four offices, each office will have a head and the heads report to the director.  I am happy that, within the context of what they are presently doing, there will not be any diminution of their role.</p><p>  There are new efficiencies that can be made.  I appreciate that members may not necessarily be aware that the two organisations, the EPA and the RPII, are already working together on the monitoring of drinking water.  They are also already working together on waste management, including radioactive waste; water quality; and emergency response protocols.  These functions, that they jointly do as two separate organisations, can now be carried out more efficiently and effectively.</p><p>  There is also a general move internationally towards the merging of functions in a crossover between environmental and radiological protection.  On the environmental protection agencies in radiological protection, there are 35 members of the European environmental protection agency and 14 of these have at least some involvement currently in radiological protection.  Most of these are called EPA, EA or some derivative.  None has the word "radiation" or "radiological" in its title.  If that is helpful, that is the international experience.</p><p>  The role is extremely important.  I have every confidence in the professionalism of both organisations when they merge.  I acknowledge that when organisations merge there are HR issues and personality issues.  They have to merge and there has to be space and time and enlightened management decisions to ensure that there is a seamless transfer.  Differentiating the status of the various offices within the EPA, in terms of saying that one section has a different legal role from the rest of them, would likely do more harm than good.  They all are under the banner of the EPA and that covers everything.</p><p>  On the other issues Deputy Catherine Murphy raised, the office of environmental enforcement, the office of climate, licensing, research and resource use, the office of communications and corporate services and the office of environmental assessment all are equally important.  They all are part of the EPA.  They all have the powers and have to go through the due process.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

In fact, that was one of the elements we sought in terms of oversight of the sectoral plans in the climate action and low carbon development Bill.</p> <p>What will happen now is that instead of that independence, the reporting will be done through the CEO and there will be a loss of independence.</p><p> I do not have any reason to dispute the scientific advice produced by EPA.  My concern relates to the EPA's ability to respond where people who hold licences are non-compliant.  The EPA tends to work with such people, in some cases for an overly long period.  I can identify bad experiences in which the EPA should have become involved at a much earlier stage.  It is understandable for the EPA to hesitate if jobs may be put at risk by the closure of a company that is not complying with its licence.  There is a trade-off in this regard but the perceptions of such a trade-off can diminish the role of the EPA.  I have often wondered whether it has the capacity to follow through in respect of certain non-compliant licence holders.  When our meeting concludes, I can provide the Minister of State with a pretty bad example from my constituency if he so wishes but I do not want to outline it here.  One's view of an organisation can be coloured by such examples.  I can also attest to good examples but these tend to involve licence holders who go beyond the call of duty to be compliant.  As I think it should have a separate function, I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

This new merger will help to bring about responsibility within the EPA for non-ionising radiation, including in respect energy infrastructure, so that we have a one-stop-shop for dealing with the issue.  Work has been under way for more than a year to join up the cultures of both organisations to ensure a smooth transition.  When the EPA was originally established, it incorporated An Foras Forbatha.  There is, therefore, a precedent for another body being absorbed into the EPA.  If I cannot answer the Deputy's specific question now, I assure her I will revert to her in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

It starts before any action takes place, so there will be consultation with the Minister at that stage before they effect the regulation.  In other words, the Minister would have to take due notice of what was being said.  I presume the Minister could not reasonably disagree with it.  The Minister would always have to act prudently and wisely, particularly in this area.  It would give a dimension to the political system to be aware of, and fully versed in, what the issues were before it would happen.</p></speech>

There is no option for outside organisations like environmental bodies.  Some of those bodies have played quite an important role.  I found them useful.  We had some of them in at the pre-legislative stage of the climate change Bill.  We received fascinating insights and information from people.  One that sticks out was Board Watch, which was a particular highlight.  It does not appear, however, that environmental bodies will be part of the preparation of contingency planning.  Is that an oversight?  Is it needed and, if so, has it been thought about?</p></speech>

There could be significant security issues concerning some of the regulations, so it might not necessarily be wise that everybody would know what some of the issues were.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that there must be such a role.  People can always write to the EPA and specific bodies.  The Deputy's point is whether there is a list of bodies that should be a notice party that the regulations are being made, or to give them an opportunity to communicate on that issue.  Is that the Deputy's point?</p></speech>

It is a question of the appropriateness of that aspect.  That may or may not cover the Deputy's point but it gives the institute power to reach out to, or acknowledge, specific interest groups in this area, aside from statutory bodies.</p></speech>

I will examine that committee and match it against the point I am making.</p><p>  I have a couple of other points to make on this section.  If somebody does not co-operate when making the contingency plan, where they have a permit, there should be some sanction such as revoking a licence.  It changes culture if there is a consequence but that is not included in this section.  It would be useful to include that kind of aspect.</p></speech>

For example, we saw what happened with the deficient process in respect of wind farms.  Process is incredibly important in terms of how one deals with the public.  The public must be party to it.  We talked about this in some detail when we dealt with the pre-legislative stage of the climate change legislation.  In terms of access to information, is the Minister of State satisfied the language is strong enough and that there is the possibility of broader public participation in and access to information during the licensing process?</p></speech>

It is a different way of doing things.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, articulated it quite well about a more open style of Government, and I agree with him on that.  The last thing one wants is for people to have to go through freedom of information on something where there should be an open process in which people have confidence.  It is about how that process is rolled out and who is included as a matter of right in that process.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had to go through freedom of information but I could not get the information through it either because there were issues, in particular security issues.  Given the nature of the business, I was not entitled to it.  At all times, the EPA operates in a transparent way.  In my experience, it is always available for consultation and to communicate.  It has always been prepared to visit my constituency if there were proposals of concern to citizens.</p></speech>

I welcome to the meeting Ms Yvonne McKenna, chief executive officer, Ms Tricia Nolan, manager, South Dublin County Volunteer Centre, and Mr. John Cotterell, manager of Louth Volunteer Centre and Volunteer Ireland board member, on behalf of Volunteer Ireland.  They are all welcome and members appreciate their attendance.<br/>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.</p> <p>Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documentation the witnesses provide to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting concludes.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> More than most, all here are aware of volunteerism.  It permeates through all of our different communities.  Particularly at times of economic difficulties, volunteerism is much more visible and appreciated, and there is a bigger demand for it.  As a race, we have this sense of belonging.  Everybody one knows is involved in an organisation, be it a GAA club, a political party, the Red Cross or the IFA.  As an Irish person, one has this huge sense of belonging but also a huge contribution to give to so many voluntary organisations.</p><p> We are looking forward to the exchange this afternoon.  No doubt it will be productive.  I now call on Ms McKenna to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of Volunteer Ireland and I am here together with Ms Nolan and Mr. Cotterell.</p><p>  Volunteer Ireland is the national volunteer development agency and also a support body for local volunteer centres in Ireland and volunteering information services.  We exist to increase awareness of volunteering, access to volunteering and quality in volunteering.  We are here to talk to the committee today because we see this as a crucial moment with respect to the supports that we give to volunteering in Ireland.</p><p>  It is the third time that we have spoken here.  The first time was in 2003, and on foot of that meeting there was an announcement of a package of measures to support volunteering.  It was the beginning of a strategic approach to supporting volunteering in Ireland through the development of volunteering infrastructure.  We came here again in 2009 to talk to members as the country was slipping further into recession and to describe its impact on volunteering and highlight the importance of supporting volunteering through the recession.  We are here today, hopefully, also at a crucial moment, as we turn the corner on the recession and come out of it, to seek the committee's support with respect to continuing to support volunteering but also to highlight some of the impact of the recession on supporting volunteering and the volunteering infrastructure.</p><p>  Since the recession, we experienced an increase in the demand for volunteering roles, as the Chairman pointed out, of almost 100%, and that has remained consistently high.  We are still experiencing many who want to volunteer and want to give to their community, and could also be seeking to develop their employability skills or seeking to make a positive change in their community.  At the same time, the community and voluntary sector has experienced significant cuts and an increased demand for services.  In that context, we are trying to support community and voluntary organisations to be better at involving volunteers and to be more creative about those volunteering roles.</p><p>  As volunteer infrastructure, between ourselves and the volunteer centres, there have been near consistent cuts since 2009 and we are at a stage where any further cuts will cause unprecedented damage to the services that we can provide.  In one sense, we are looking for the committee's support and a stay of execution with respect to the cuts being imposed.</p><p>  More importantly, we also want to seek the committee's support.  This committee, as I have outlined, has had a significant positive impact on supporting volunteering and we come to seek its support with respect to one issue, which is a policy for volunteering.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has committed to developing a policy that will support volunteering and from our perspective, two years down the road that policy has not yet been forthcoming.  We believe a national policy should provide national objectives against which the achievements of the volunteering infrastructure could be set and evaluated.  It is really in relation to those matters about which we are here to talk to the committee today.  Obviously, we provided a submission in advance.  I might hand over now to Ms Nolan who will speak about what we do and the outcomes we seek.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Nolan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014062400004#D00300"><p>As Ms McKenna stated, I am the manager of the South Dublin County Volunteer Centre.<br/>In times of ever-dwindling resources, in some ways it is incumbent on us to deliver a bang for our buck, particularly as we are in organisations in receipt of public funds.  Ms McKenna spoke about the funding issues that affect us as a network but one aspect I want to speak about is our value for money as a network.  I will highlight some of the outputs that we measure as a network of 21 volunteer centres and Volunteer Ireland, and then Mr. Cotterell will speak about some of the impacts, which we can see and which are not as easy to measure.<br/>Over the past years one of our main achievements as a national network has been to build from the ground up a national database for volunteering which we called I-VOL.  We have done this at little or no cost to the Exchequer.  It is a database donated to us by a company called Salesforce and it is worth in excess of &euro;150,000 in in-kind funding.<br/>We built I-VOL as a searchable database for volunteering.  It allows potential volunteers to view opportunities to volunteer around them, right down to their local town.  It can be accessed on the website, <i>volunteer.ie</i>, or one can look at it on any volunteer centre website.  If one has time, one can download our smartphone application, app, for volunteering, called I-VOL, which was developed by a volunteer from the Institute of Technology Tallaght.<br/>As well as allowing potential volunteers to view opportunities and to register with their local centre, I-VOL allows organisations to register online and register their volunteering opportunities.  It provides the match between volunteers and organisations.  Crucially, it also allows us to track trends and statistics in volunteering.  I thought I might present some of the startling statistics from 2013 that we have measured.<br/>In 2013, some 14,953 new volunteers registered on I-VOL for the first time, either through I-VOL or through their local volunteer centre.  These were all new volunteers who were registering for the first time.  A further 2,500 volunteers from previous years re-engaged with centres and came back looking for more support and new opportunities to volunteer.  Therefore, 17,500 volunteers in total were supported across the network of centres.  Over 6,500 volunteer roles were filled.  These are volunteer roles that we know of, those who have come back to us stating that they have started volunteering in an organisation doing a piece of work.  We do not hear back from many of the volunteers who we refer on to organisations and start, I suppose, because our job is done.<br/>One aspect we are able to measure with volunteers who have started is the amount of hours they commit to volunteering.  In 2013, we recorded over 500,000 volunteer hours.  These are not cumulative hours.  These are hours that are recorded by volunteers who registered in 2013 and started volunteering in 2013, and we are not counting the volunteers who started volunteering in 2012, 2011, etc.  It is the international standard to measure a volunteer by the average industrial wage, and if one multiplies those 500,000 hours by the average industrial wage, the result is the equivalent of over &euro;11 million in return on investment.  One should note that the budget for the infrastructure to support 21 centres and Volunteer Ireland is &euro;2 million and yet we are giving back in one fell swoop over &euro;11 million worth of volunteering hours.  This is the equivalent of 300 full-time workers who we would have to put in place to replace the volunteers who have begun volunteering.<br/>Startlingly, 71% of volunteers registered with us are under 35 years of age and 62% who have come to us have never volunteered previously.  Another point to note is that organisations are supported by us and are registered on our database.  In 2013, over 900 new organisations registered for volunteers bringing the total amount of volunteer organisations that we support across Ireland to 7,000.<br/>If one were to go onto I-VOL today, one would see over 3,000 active volunteer opportunities for potential volunteers to browse through.  These are national statistics and we can break these down into local statistics.  If a member would like to find local statistics about volunteering trends in their county, we would be happy to provide them.  I would highlight that this is only a taste of what we measure and it does not show the other work that we do.<br/>We also provide training and supports to not-for-profit organisations on volunteer management and good practice.</p> <p>Sometimes we might say it is not always as difficult to get volunteers as it is to retain them in organisations.  Therefore, much of the work we do at local level is to help organisations to develop their capacity to retain volunteers once they have started.  We work with corporates also to support them in volunteering as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes.  Volunteer Ireland runs a series of inspiration days to support corporates to volunteer.</p><p> Local volunteer centres have taken on the role of providing a Garda vetting service to local and small not-for-profits that cannot gain access to Garda vetting themselves.  Recently, we have been approached by the Department of Social Protection and now we are providing vetting for all the CE programmes nationally, in addition to providing vetting for small local organisations.  In excess of 500 organisations are accessing Garda vetting through their local volunteer centre.</p><p> We also run promotional events and campaigns on volunteering, including National Volunteering Week, local outreach programmes and the Ireland Involved awards.  We have developed and implement quality standards, not only for volunteer centres but also in respect of organisations that involve volunteers.</p><p> It can be clearly seen that from the relatively small amount of money invested in the volunteering infrastructure, we provide a great return.  I will hand over to Mr. Cotterell, who will talk about the phenomena that are not easily measured, the impacts.</p></speech>

I want to give members an example of how one of their constituents might avail of the services of the centre.  This is very pertinent to Deputy Nash, who is based in Louth.</p><p>  William, who is mentioned in the case study, ran a jewellery business for years but unfortunately had to give up because he suffered a bout of depression.  He was referred to the volunteer centre by the HSE.  In this regard, we are linked to the occupational support therapists.  When we met William at the volunteer centre, he told us he did not know there was an opportunity to volunteer.  When we sat down with him, we listened to his story as to where he was coming from and his skills and interests.  The key role of the volunteer centre is to make it easier for people to volunteer.  We connect people with opportunities based on what is suitable for them.</p><p>  William did not want to make a long-term commitment.  Therefore, when he was starting off, we got him to volunteer as part of an opportunity that arose for us called the Lens A Hand photography exhibition.  Basically, it is capturing the spirit of volunteering in Louth.  We had many photographs of different people in Louth volunteering.  We showed them in different shopping centres to get people to think about volunteering.  The hope was that seeing smiles would inspire people to do something themselves.</p><p>  A key part of the centre's function is selling volunteering.  People ask what is in it for them.  As members will know from their constituents, many people who are unemployed, retired or not feeling part of the community need to be sold the concept of volunteering by us.  It is a key role of the centre.</p><p>  Since William's volunteering went so well, we ended up connecting him to Action Against Addiction.  Deputy Nash is probably familiar with this.  It supports young people who suffer from addiction.  The organisation has a shop and recycles.  William is now teaching young people the skill of jewellery-making, which was his business before he had to give it up.</p><p>  William told me just last week that volunteering gives him a sense of worth despite his having been out of work for so long.  He is able to give something by passing on his skills.  Furthermore, he is keeping busy and learning himself.  Since he does not have much involvement with people, this is a great way for him to meet people and have a bit of a laugh.  The key to volunteering is feeling connected to one's community.</p><p>  What I have described is the perspective of the volunteer but one must also consider the impact of volunteers such as William on the community.  For example, an older person might look forward to receiving a weekly visit, and a young child might get a boost of confidence from earning a badge in the Scouts.  The various organisations and community groups cannot exist without volunteers.  This is why the critical role of the volunteer centres and Volunteer Ireland is associated with offering support and letting people know what is available and what is going on.  We support the organisations to ensure each volunteer feels his time is valued.  Thus, volunteers stay with their organisation and continue volunteering.</p></speech>

We should remind ourselves of the true value of volunteering.  Mr. Cotterell gave a great example of an individual.  I am quite aware that I am speaking to the converted here.  There is nobody in this room who has not arrived at his or her current position without the support of volunteers.</p><p>  When we take a step back and examine the impact of volunteering, we realise it is good for individual volunteers, the recipients of volunteering, community and voluntary organisations, the sector, the community and society.  Recipients of volunteering are those who are receiving direct services from volunteers, including entertainment.  Across the gamut, from the most vulnerable to the most invincible, we are all recipients of volunteering whether we know it or not.  For the volunteer, volunteering provides an opportunity to express oneself, practice skills and develop new ones.  It helps one on the journey towards or out of employment.  It is an important element of community development.</p><p>  What is common across all areas of volunteering, be it fund-raising to develop a website or training a football team, is the connection with other people.  Volunteering presents an opportunity for us to become part of something bigger than ourselves.  Literally, that is the meaning of life.  What keeps us alive is our connection to other people.</p><p>  The community and voluntary sector would not exist without volunteers.  Volunteers are really the research and development element of community and voluntary organisations.  They allow us to provide more and better services.  When volunteers take on certain roles, there is really no comparison with the paid employee.  In that respect, I am thinking of some of the advocacy services, for example.</p><p>  Volunteering is also important to the recipient community.  The extent to which communities have strong networks of volunteers or high levels of volunteering makes them more questioning and also more equal.  We should not forget the extent to which volunteers remind us of the kinds of services we otherwise fail to provide.  With respect to the State, although we do not measure volunteering in Ireland, we know that in the developed world the value of volunteering is considered to be anything between 2% and 3% of GDP.  That is a significant figure for our country.  However, it is beyond that as it is what we cannot count that matters.  It is no longer radical or outlandish to say GDP is not the only measure of the wealth of a society.</p><p>  To conclude, it is our belief that we should take volunteering seriously.  If we want to do so, we should have a more strategic and structured approach to supporting volunteering.  In our mind, that involves protecting what has already been built up and also seeing a future for it with respect to a policy that will set national priorities and objectives on which we can deliver.  I thank the members for their time.  We are available to take questions or further comments.</p></speech>

A policy to support volunteer centres, introduced in 2009, envisaged a volunteer centre per county, with the exception of Dublin, where the centres were to be per local authority area.  That policy has been on hold since its introduction because of the economic climate.  Essentially, the volunteer centres are both urban and rural.  They are in 17.5 counties across the country.</p></speech>

It is approximately 120 miles from the south of Cork city to south and west Kerry.  There is a considerable number of volunteers, be they in sports, political or other organisations.  In any one town, one will note various committees, including for Tidy Towns and the Red Cross.  How does one measure the number scientifically?  One could say that there are 15,000 volunteers, for example.  How does one measure the number in an area that does not have a volunteer centre on its doorstep?</p> <p>Is there a requirement for the organisation to affiliate itself to Volunteer Ireland?</p></speech>

There is a volunteer centre in Cork.  The Chairman is right in saying that they will be best known where they are based.  They would support all the organisations around Cork through outreach.  The figures we are giving the joint committee today are the individuals who have found out about volunteering through us and went through our systems.  We do not count the number of organisations that we are supporting at arm's length or who already have their own volunteering networks.</p><p>  The 15,000 people who will register to volunteer through us this year represent just a drop in the ocean compared to the numbers who want to volunteer and who the volunteer infrastructure will support indirectly.</p><p>  It would be great if Ireland did count volunteering and we can do that through the census or national quarterly household surveys.  If we had a sense of the extent to which volunteering occurs, as well as its outcomes and impact, we would probably take it a lot more seriously than we do.</p></speech>

For example, the centre in south Dublin has had nearly a 45% decrease in funding since the start of the recession.  Other centres have had decreases of between 15% and 20% or 25%.  It was probably around &euro;3 million before the start of the recession.</p></speech>

I will call on Senator Landy first because he proposed this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014062400006#F01000"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the presentation.  It is important to recognise the outstanding work being done by Volunteer Ireland.  The Cathaoirleach asked a number of questions about Volunteer Ireland's location and the fact that it only operates in some counties.  I understand that is a funding issue and Volunteer Ireland cannot open centres if it does not have money to do so.</p><p>  In her paper, Ms Nolan outlined why it is important to have a national policy on volunteering.  To act as devil's advocate, I would say it is difficult to publish a policy document to begin such a process due to a funding issue.  I would like to get her reaction to that point.  I have a series of questions but I will put that one first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne McKenna" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014062400006#F01100"><p>We have highlighted that the amount of funding that goes into volunteering infrastructure is not exorbitant.  It is public money, however, which needs to be spent in the right way.  Even if the amount was kept as it is, therefore, through a national policy we could ensure that it is being spent correctly.  We can go through a process of finding out what objectives we are trying to achieve through this.  In some ways, the volunteering structure has been a victim of its own success in the sense that when funding first started to be given to it back in 2005, at that point about six volunteer centres were emerging.  However, they operated at different levels and did not have a common understanding of what they should be doing.  From that time until now - where we have 21 local volunteer centres plus a national organisation - we have developed a way of working which is consistent.  We have developed a quality standard framework which assesses volunteer centres and how they operate.</p><p>  Volunteer centres all have four core principles by which they work, which is to support volunteers and volunteering organisations.  However, that is happening in a vacuum with an absence of a national policy and specific objectives.  That is why we feel that a policy might assist, so that the achievements of the volunteer infrastructure can be set against those.  In that way, we could see where we are going in a few years and if we are achieving what is necessary.</p><p>  We would like to come here and say that money is required, but it is not just that.  Current investment in volunteering should be maintained, while developing a policy or strategy to ensure it is having the maximum impact.  That is the point we are trying to make.</p></speech>

Is it logical to consider that if one has a policy with no extra money, one can expand Volunteer Ireland's ambit to every county?</p><p>  In urban or rural communities, most people who use their leisure or family time to volunteer, generally speaking, are involved in the GAA, soccer, rugby, athletics or the swimming club.  The quota of voluntary time is more limited because in our own communities we all grow up in various organisations, including the GAA and others.  In my case, my volunteer hours were spent on the sports field.  Is Volunteer Ireland trying to draw in people who are not already involved or is it trying to divide the time of those who are already involved?  If so, is that a difficulty?</p><p>  My last question concerns public awareness of Volunteer Ireland.  It is operational in Tipperary where I come from.  I made inquiries prior to this meeting and was surprised by the linkages between organisations and individual volunteers.  I attend various events and, to my mind, there is no great awareness of Volunteer Ireland.  The bigger question is whether Volunteer Ireland is trying to grab people who are not already involved in other volunteering pursuits - that is, with the mainstream organisations.  I know that is a mouthful but perhaps Ms McKenna can try to answer it. </p></speech>

As regards funding, the only policy for volunteering in Ireland is that which supports volunteer centres, which has been on hold since 2009.  If that is on hold and we are unlikely to suddenly start investing money in it, what should we be doing otherwise?  We are also in a different time, so what can we do with the money invested to ensure that counties without a volunteer centre are also catered for?  In addition, how can we fix the somewhat unequal investment across counties?</p><p>  Many people will not need the support of a volunteering infrastructure.  As an individual, if I feel confident about my abilities or if I know what cause or activity I wish to get involved in, the volunteering infrastructure is not necessarily there to help me.  We try, however, to get those portions of the population that might not know the benefits of volunteering.  </p><p>  A lot of volunteering in Ireland occurs through organisations.  Senator Landy mentioned the GAA, which has a huge presence.  Few of those organisations, with the probable exception of the GAA, are established to accept volunteers.  They have been set up to achieve aims, including combating homelessness or putting on community fairs.  They often require support to ensure they are better at involving volunteers.  </p><p>  Every day, we see organisations that think they cannot ask someone to do something because they are not paying them.  Or they may think they cannot ask a volunteer to leave an organisation if it is not going well.  We try to build a capacity to encourage and assist organisations to think about involving various kinds of volunteers in different ways.  </p><p>  With respect to the Senator's question, we are not trying to take over what is already happening.  We try to assist and support volunteering as it is required.  We have worked with the GAA but, with all due respect, it probably does not need our support as much as other types of organisation that may not have volunteer policies or procedures in place.  I do not mean that it has to be bureaucratic but instead of thinking one needs a fund-raiser, there may be different roles in which people can be involved, thus operating more broadly in the community as a result.  It is not about us trying to take over existing volunteering, but is rather about trying to address the gaps.</p></speech>

What we are capturing is young people who may not know how to get involved in a local sports club.  We are tapping into younger people a great deal of the time.  We have a significant number of non-Irish nationals who come to us to volunteer.  They are not connected to their communities in many ways and see volunteering as a way to become connected.  They come to it through their local volunteer centres rather than by knowing about a GAA club or other local sports organisation.</p></speech>

The year 2003 was mentioned.  It was the year I was mayor and I placed particular emphasis on volunteering in south Dublin.  I thank Ms Nolan for flying the flag well in south Dublin.  Ms McKenna has nothing to worry about in that area.</p><p>  There was a reference to 21 volunteering centres, but I thought there were 23.  Did two close down?  Can the witnesses say a little more about support and disproportionality?  Where is it coming?  There is a manager from Louth and another from south Dublin present here.  All the heads of all 23 organisations come together as a group to co-ordinate activities.  Where is the disproportionality evident?  What can we or other parties do about that?  As a national umbrella organisation, it should be possible to seek suggestions from the membership.</p><p>  Ms McKenna mentioned all the good qualities of volunteering.  To suggest a return of &euro;11 million on a &euro;2 million investment is to sell volunteering very short.  If one considers also the health benefits and the issue of depression, a great deal of other valuable assets fall to be taken into account.  It is not alone what people gain for the community, but what they gain for themselves in keeping themselves out of hospital.  I do not know if people watched Maureen Gaffney's programme about how to be happy.  She gave out a &euro;20 note.  It is known in volunteering that what one does for others gives one more satisfaction than what one does for oneself.  She proved it again on Tuesday night when she showed that giving away is better than taking.  If that was added in, I could see the figure of 3% of GDP referred to standing up as a reckoning of the benefits and value for money.  The witnesses have always had an advocate in me for volunteering.</p><p>  Motivation was mentioned and people realising, as Ms McKenna said, what volunteering can do for them.  Most people who volunteer do not do it for themselves, rather they find out afterwards what it does for them personally.  If we could do anything it would be to help to get the voices of the volunteer organisations known nationally.  On foot of what the Chairman has recommended, we may be able to do something on a policy for volunteering.  When the wise heads of the 23 organisations come together, might a prototype policy be developed?  One cannot do anything without knowing where one is going and this is asking the converted to do what we know is necessary.</p><p>  Nothing was mentioned about philanthropy in the statement that was submitted to the committee, unless I missed it.  Philanthropy is significant in terms of donations for voluntary societies.  Has a strategy been used in that regard?  I presume so.  Active citizenship and engagement are among the aims and objectives of the philanthropic organisations.</p><p>  We want to ensure all State agencies in social areas are engaged and have a policy.  I am spokesperson on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the Seanad.  What is needed is cross-cutting policy across all agencies to ensure that when a Department or agency is developing a policy, it includes volunteerism.  In what ways do the witnesses consider the Departments are falling down or stepping up to the plate in that regard?  What can the committee do to ensure there is cross-engagement among Departments?</p><p>  We know from the statistics that everyone is looking for a job now, but volunteerism has not slowed down.  It has been proven that 94% of people who volunteer get a job quicker when seeking employment.  I thank the witnesses and hope they will keep it up.</p></speech>

Instead of north and south Dublin centres, we have Dublin City Volunteer Centre.  Previously, there were two in Limerick and they merged.  It is part of the process of being more efficient and effective.</p><p>  We brought all the heads together and made a submission to the Department on the thinking of the volunteer infrastructure as to what could be included in a policy statement.  That can be submitted to the committee also.  We could further update the submission as to how it would dovetail with other policies which have been put in place since it was formulated.  In any event, it would provide the committee with a headline sense of our thinking as to what should be in a policy.</p><p>  The other question was on the cross-departmental approach.  I agree with the Senator about the return issue.  Even the cost saving that results from volunteering is phenomenal.  It is something the National Youth Council of Ireland has looked at in its research.</p><p>  To have a cross-departmental approach would be wonderful.  A couple of comments were made on the difficulties we have in promoting what we do.  Today's meeting is an example of how that can be assisted.  We would welcome the committee's views in that regard.  We are housed and supported within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, this morning I was at a forum meeting on corporate social responsibility which is a significant issue.  Previously, I spoke to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  We are connected with other Departments and any assistance that can be provided in that respect would be very welcome.</p></speech>

It involves the raising and giving, or RAG, army, which is the student's volunteering society so that this is coming from the ground up.  It would be helpful if the Department of Education and Skills worked with us and Campus Engage to develop that across third level and even at secondary level through transition year programmes.</p><p>  A key issue we are raising today is a policy but we are also looking for the committee's support in maintaining our funding.  We cannot do this without the members.  We are struggling to get that awareness out there.  It takes time and money.  It is another key recommendation we have for the committee.  What the committee can do to help us with that is to champion volunteering.  For example, we could have a day of volunteering for Oireachtas Members where we get everyone out.  Perhaps, they could help us to clean up a school.</p></speech>

A 5% cut in funding for us this year is the equivalent of &euro;100,000.  That is a drop in the ocean to the public purse but would decimate our infrastructure in terms of the impact it will have on us because we have really been cut over the years.  It will cause services to be dampened down even more.</p><p>  A question was asked about gaps.  The south east is a real gap.  There is no volunteer centre in Wexford, Kilkenny or Waterford.  There are other counties that do not have centres but if one was to look at a major gap on the map, the south east in particular is badly affected.</p><p>  The Senator asked about philanthropy.  I said earlier that the centres receive in-kind funding of over &euro;150,000 per year from the Salesforce.com Foundation so sometimes philanthropy is not just about money.  It is about the other things that one can receive from a corporate that are not necessarily monetary.</p></speech>

I regularly witness the impact of the Louth Volunteer Centre in my own community.  We are very lucky to have the centre in Drogheda.  I can see its impact all of the time.  It is very visible and effective.</p><p>  I am very taken with a remark where the witnesses describe themselves as prime delivery agents.  It never made much sense to me for the volunteer centre network to be subjected to significant funding reductions in recent years given that it is a gateway service and has such a huge role to play in the broader context of the community and voluntary sector.  It can make a big impact for a very small amount of money and it has done so.  I have witnessed it.  I am very encouraged by the fact that Volunteer Ireland is insisting upon the production of a national policy on volunteering.  It is unusual to find organisations in that space.  Many organisations may feel they have something to fear from the development of a national policy.  Volunteer Ireland clearly does not and I do not think it has anything to fear from it.  I am encouraged that it is happy to be benchmarked against that.  Where are the obstacles in the Department in terms of the publication of that document?  Clearly, Volunteer Ireland has the support of this committee in terms of the publication of that policy.  </p><p>  I note that there has been a 100% increase in volunteers registering with these centres since the onset of the recession for the want of a better way of describing it.  As people slowly but surely find their way back to work and full-time employment, what is Volunteer Ireland's view regarding how it will retain them?  My own sense is that volunteer centres helped broaden the horizons of people who may have been out of work and who presented to and engaged with the centres.  The people in question cannot envisage their lives without volunteering now, which is very positive, but how does Volunteer Ireland intend to retain the services of those with whom it has engaged in recent years probably as a direct result of unemployment?  </p><p>  I note from Mr. Cotterell's reference to the enterprise in Dromiskin in county Louth that an audit of talent and skills in the community was undertaken and that the centre now has a talent bank into which it can tap.  Members might be interested in him elaborating on how the centre would go about doing that because there is a gap across the country in terms of communities having that sort of knowledge.  It is a really progressive thing to do.  Any organisation would wish to have a reasonably good audit of the skills available to it and the same could be said for a town or village.  Could Mr. Cotterell elaborate on that and how he might recommend that members encourage their own communities to work with volunteer centres to carry out that exercise?  </p></speech>

The work of volunteers the length and breadth of this country is priceless and contributes greatly to building a better society.  Senator Landy spoke about sport, the number of people involved in it and the number of volunteers who run sporting events throughout the country each weekend and during the week.  Their work is invaluable.  Indeed it is at the heart of our sense of community.  Does Volunteer Ireland sell itself short in this area - the value of volunteering to communities and society in monetary terms?  Around 100 people are registered with the Longford Volunteer Centre - Longford being the county I come from.  I see that 300, 400 or 500 people are volunteering weekend after weekend.  This area needs to be looked at because I believe there are more people contributing in a voluntary capacity to the development of society and this is not recognised even by Volunteer Ireland.<br/>Volunteering is acknowledged in our action plan for jobs.  Has there been an increase or decrease in young people's participation in volunteering in the past years?  What are the main barriers to volunteering among the unemployed?  Perhaps a volunteering award scheme is <i>in situ</i>in most counties.  Could it be set up in every county to celebrate the great work of volunteers, to let them know they make a difference in their local communities, to raise awareness and to recognise the important work carried out in their respective communities?  <br/>Longford has the best result in the national Tidy Towns competition.  All this has been achieved through the volunteers who come in day after day and night after night and in the morning before they go to work to contribute to its development.  They have this great sense of pride in their community.  This is not recognised by the general public and we could do more to promote the great work of volunteers that is not measured in numbers.  A total of 100 people registered with the Longford Volunteer Centre.  This number is ridiculously low when one looks at the number of people involved in volunteering.  I would say that over 1,000 people would be involved on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming in today because I represent a constituency in Sligo and would be very familiar with the work that is taking place there.  I see it on a regular basis and have been speaking to the witnesses' colleagues there.  We resolved an issue with the local authority regarding accommodation in Sligo.  What is the nature of Volunteer Ireland's relationship with local authorities?  Is the relationship close?  One of the issues the witnesses spoke about here was funding and the lack thereof.  I see the number of people who are actively participating in activities in Sligo in areas raised by the witnesses such as sport, the Fleadh and Tidy Towns.  I attended a briefing in Buswells Hotel some weeks ago.  It is vitally important that more people are more aware of it because there are many people out there.  I have seen the age profile of those involved in volunteering and it is very encouraging.  I am speaking based on my experience in Sligo.  I am very impressed with the work, commitment and effort put in by so many people on a daily basis and I commend Volunteer Ireland for the work that has been done there</p></speech>

I understand some of my colleagues will also wish to comment.  With regard to the obstacle to the policy, we work closely with the community section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and believe that it is committed to a policy.</p> <p>That Department has a variety of policies of late.  One of the obstacles is the workload of that section in the Department.  I recognise that funding is an issue and that the Department will not be developing a policy that would commit to additional funding.  We hope the policy will not result in any cuts to funding, however.  We are trying to remind the Department of the importance of policy and the impact it should have.</p><p> In regard to whether we will be able to retain these volunteers, when we discussed this issue with a previous committee in 2009 we pointed out that the way in which Ireland supported volunteering through the recession could influence the kind of society that emerges.  Job seeking and skills building were clearly a factor for many of the people who decided to volunteer in response to the recession but a considerable number indicated to us that they were motivated by a desire to be more involved in their communities and exercise a degree of control.  This was a period in which Ireland lost its sovereignty and people wanted to get involved in activities which would have an immediate impact.  Even if we are to go straight from a recession to another boom, it is important that we create a society in which everyone who wants to volunteer can volunteer.  Some of the biggest barriers to volunteering are not knowing that one has something to give or where to go.  That is why the infrastructure plays an important role.</p><p> Investment in volunteering infrastructure began in 2005 and since then we have never seen a reduction in the number of people who want to volunteer.  The sense that people stopped volunteering during the boom is probably not entirely correct.  It is an instinct to connect with others and I see this as becoming even more important as we, hopefully, head out of recession.</p><p> I agree that we sell ourselves short in regard to the impact of volunteering.  Applying an average industrial wage to the number of hours that a volunteer donates does not even tell half of the story of the impact of volunteering on society.  It is not the role of volunteering infrastructure to count volunteering or to get a sense of its impact.  Perhaps the CSO can provide the national statistics required to get a real sense of the impact.</p><p> We have engaged with the Department of Social Protection regarding the barriers for volunteering among unemployed people.  While recipients of State benefits are permitted to volunteer, individuals are being told that if they are seen to volunteer for longer than a certain number of hours they risk losing their benefits.  A volunteer who receives State benefits can complete a certain form but the low number of completed forms reflects the extent to which people feel that receiving State benefits is a barrier to volunteering.  One of the biggest barriers is the opportunity to volunteer.  When organisations are firefighting because their funding is being cut and the demand for services is rising, they do not have the resources to take stock and see how they can grow their volunteer involvement.  Our experience is that when people approach us to volunteer we can find it difficult to find opportunities that match their soft and hard skills.</p><p> We did not mention philanthropy in our submission.  We work at local level to develop philanthropy but while someone who wants to give money will rarely be refused, it is often more difficult to find ways of investing offers of time.</p><p> We operate a national volunteer award scheme, the Volunteer Ireland awards.  The scheme is operated nationally rather than at county level.  People do not volunteer to win awards or recognition.  The value of the award scheme is not necessarily for the person who receives an award but in the impact it has in inspiring others.</p></speech>

We have not rested on our laurels in building a national database through which volunteers can identify opportunities because we are now throwing it on its head.  In the next couple of months we will be launching a volunteer finder service, whereby community organisations can log on to our database to search for volunteers by their skills.  The online system should be launched by the end of this summer.  We are constantly building on our online presence.</p><p>  All of the volunteer centres are encouraged to work with their local authorities and local area partnerships.  South County Dublin Volunteer Centre is housed by South Dublin County Council in its Clondalkin and Tallaght offices.  We are not housed there today but we are normally housed there.  All of the volunteer centres are in receipt of some funding from their local partnerships.  Ring-fenced funding of 1% is given to local partnerships for volunteering activities, and this goes to the local volunteer centres.  We have close working relationships with local authorities and local partnerships and it is important that we are integrated at that level.</p><p>  In regard to retaining volunteers as we come out of the recession, my experience at local level is that many of those who started volunteering during the recession were not necessarily unemployed people who had time on their hands.  Our volunteers included people who felt the country was in trouble and they wanted to put their shoulders to the wheel.  The main reason people volunteer with us is because they want to give something back not because they want to gain or improve their skills.  That is an interesting trend.</p></speech>

This project emerged from a presentation I made to the local council.  I sat down with a local councillor, Declan Breathnach, to identify the skills possessed by the people who were willing to help their communities.  This included people with public relations and writing skills.  We sent 700 questionnaires to the houses in the local parish to ascertain residents' skills.  Rather than ask respondents to make a commitment to volunteering we sought information on what areas might interest them.  What emerged from the survey was a befriending service for older people which we have developed into a mass texting service linked to the I-Vol system.  We can now let people know what is happening so that they can volunteer if they wish.  It is a question of giving people more choice to volunteer in a way and a time that suits them.</p><p>  Louth Volunteer Centre is housed in a property owned by Louth County Council at a reduced rent.  We recently provided 60 volunteers for the local Irish maritime festival, which was run by the council.  There is a win-win in these relationships.</p><p>  In regard to the unemployed, perhaps the committee could help us to reduce the aforementioned barriers.  I understand the Department of Social Protection and the Intreo offices do not recognise volunteering as one of their key objectives when they are trying to place or progress people who are unemployed.  They focus on training and employment but volunteering should also be considered given the skills that can be developed.  Even at the most basic level, someone who lacks confidence to commit to employment or training can use volunteering as a stepping stone to employment.  We ask that volunteering be recognised in the Department's objectives.  We could also go to jobs clubs to make our presentations because, as has been pointed out, not enough people know about Volunteer Ireland and volunteer centres.  Unfortunately, because we are trying to manage and help the people who register we do not have the funding or the time to promote and advertise our centres.  That is a key constraint. </p></speech>

I am trying to get a handle on it from the charts provided but I cannot.</p> <p>It is impossible to say what is an average volunteer.  One person will do their two hours on Daffodil Day once a year whereas I remember being on a sports committee where someone was volunteering 50 hours a week.  It is difficult to say there is an average volunteer.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put them on silent.  They must be switched off, otherwise they will cause interference with the broadcasting equipment.</p><p>  Today we will discuss the outcome of the European Parliament elections and their implications for Ireland and Europe.  We will consider the composition of the new Parliament.</p> <p>We will look at the composition of the new European Parliament and consider the relatively low turn-out across the European Union.  We will also discuss the move away from the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties towards extremist parties on both the left and the right and consider the possible impact that might have on the work of the European Parliament.  We are joined today for our consideration of those issues by Professor Gail McElroy from the Department of Political Science at Trinity College Dublin and Ms Suzanne Lynch, who is the European correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>and is based in Brussels.  The head of the European Parliament office in Dublin, Mr. Francis Jacobs, has helpfully provided the committee with a background note on the outcome of the European Parliament elections.<br />Before we begin today's proceedings, I have to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not make charges against a person or entity by name or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I welcome Professor McElroy and Ms Lynch.  I invite Professor McElroy to address the committee.</p></speech>

I intend to focus mostly on group formation in the European Parliament, the deadline for which is today.  There was a great deal of media coverage of the European elections.  One might think from reading the newspapers that a broad sweep of far-right parties was rising across Europe and arriving at the doors of the European Parliament.  There has been an increase, to some extent, in the percentage of people voting for Eurosceptic and far-right parties, but I would like to make the point quite clearly that it has been overstated.  Perhaps we were a little taken by the rise of UKIP in Britain and the success of the Front Nationale in France, but we should bear in mind that far-right parties won no seats in a majority of member states.  In fact, 18 of the 28 member states do not have any far-right representation.  Having said that, it is newsworthy that the Front Nationale topped the poll in France and the Danish People's Party topped the poll in Denmark.  The question of whether the latter party is a far-right one is open to broad debate.  The number of MEPs representing far-right parties, based on a general definition of that term, has increased from 35 to 52.  This can be largely attributed to the success of the Front Nationale.  Five far-right parties lost representation in the 2014 elections.  It should be of interest to Ireland as a bailout country that the far-right did well in just one of the bailout countries.  I refer, obviously, to the Golden Dawn party in Greece.  The bottom line is that the rise of the far-right has been overstated.  The two main parties in the European Parliament are still the two main parties.  The EPP lost a not-inconsiderable number of seats, but it is still the largest group.  In light of the austerity of the times we live in, it could be considered on some level as a not-unsuccessful election for the EPP.</p><p>  The level of turnout, which increased slightly by 0.1%, seems to have levelled off at approximately 43%.  There are huge variations across the different countries of Europe.  We do quite well, even by comparison with the countries that have compulsory voting.  It is obvious that our figures are inflated by virtue of the fact that our local elections are held on the same day.  Maybe other member states could take a leaf out of our book on that front.  Alternatively, we could all adopt compulsory voting in order to reach the levels of over 90% that have been attained in some countries.</p><p>  I wish to say a few words about group formation in the European Parliament.  Following the elections in May, the last month has been a time of great dynamism.  The three main groups have been relatively stable, but there have been huge amounts of movement on the fringes.  This issue has been in the news in Ireland today because the European Conservatives and Reformists, ECR, group has managed to oust the Liberals from third place.  This is a big story, particularly because an Irish MEP decided at the last moment to become a member of that group.  This matters in a lot of ways.  The ECR's slight edge over the Liberals will mean that it does quite well in terms of report allocation, plenary speech time and chairmanship of committees.  It is clear that the ECR was very keen to make a splash.  There was a big battle for MEPs between the ECR and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, EFD.  UKIP is probably most familiar to us of the members of the EFD.  They battled for MEPs from parties like the True Finns and the Danish People's Party, both of which have switched groups.</p><p>  The European Parliament is very different from a national parliament in the sense that there is a great deal of volatility at election time.  There are always many new parties and freshmen MEPs in the European Parliament.  Typically, between 70% and 75% of incumbent Deputies are re-elected at an Irish general election, although this was not the case in the 2011 election.  The equivalent figure in the European Parliament is never more than 50%, for a variety of reasons.  People choose to retire.  Life in Brussels is exhausting in some senses.  The second-order nature of the elections means there is a great deal of movement.  There is always a kind of reinvention of the wheel.  Some countries are better at re-electing MEPs than others.  Germany has a much higher return rate than Ireland or some of the east European countries.  That gives German MEPs an advantage in terms of policy expertise and knowing the ropes of such an institutionally complex legislative environment.</p><p>  There has been a lot of coverage in this country of the fact that UKIP did so well in Britain.  UKIP has formed a group, which will probably have 48 MEPs, and is doing reasonably well.  One needs to bear in mind that this group is not ideologically very cohesive.  UKIP is in the same group as the Five Star Movement, which is led by the Italian comedian Beppe Grillo.  They share a kind of Euroscepticism, but very little else.  One of the big stories today is that Le Pen and her colleagues have not managed to form a group.  They will be in the European Parliament as Independents because even though they met the numerical criteria, they failed to meet the state membership rule, which requires a group to have MEPs from seven countries.  One could argue that over the years, the main groups have made a concerted effort to ostracise some of the more fringe groups by continuing to increase the criteria for membership.  As a result, parties like the Austrian Freedom Party, the Dutch Freedom Party, the Le Pen group and Vlaams Belang will not be able to form a far-right political group with rights to make speeches and take plenary time in this Parliament.</p><p>  It is possible that the European Parliament will not be very different in the new term.  The three main traditional groups - the Liberals, the Socialists and the Christian Democrats or EPP - tend to turn up and vote cohesively and that is unlikely to change.  The other groups, with the possible exceptions of the Greens and the GUE, find it hard to whip people into line.  I am thinking particularly of the fringe far-right and far-left groups.  Indeed, they find it hard to get people to turn up to the same extent as the more institutionalised and bigger political groups.  The two big political groups will have a majority of MEPs between them.  Along with the ALDE, they will have almost two thirds of MEPs.  It should be borne in mind that these groups will have a standing arrangement to vote together.  It cannot be described as a grand coalition because there is no government resting on a vote of no confidence.  There are issues that will divide them.  The EPP and the S&amp;D have been explicit about their intention to make their arrangements, which are already consensual, more explicit.  Consensus is the hallmark of the European Parliament.  For many reasons, it is difficult for those of us who are more familiar with Anglo-Saxon democracies to get our heads around that.  The use of trilogues and early informal agreements has risen hugely from approximately 28% in the fifth European Parliament to over 80% in the eighth European Parliament.  We should not be obsessed about what happens in Strasbourg.  All the decisions are made before that.  I imagine we will witness more of that in the future.</p><p>  Voting cohesion is very high in the European Parliament.  Indeed, the three main groups - I include the ALDE in that for the time being - almost always vote together with no division among them on a plurality of votes.  There is very little division between the groups because they have sorted it all out beforehand.  If everything is decided behind closed doors, for example, in trilogues with the Commission and the Council, it has implications for transparency and democracy but it makes for legislative efficiency.  The time that elapses between the proposing of legislation by the Commission and its becoming law has been reduced rather impressively over the last couple of Parliaments.  I could continue, but perhaps I have used the seven or eight minutes available to me.</p></speech>

I will deal with a couple of themes and then move to a broader analysis.<br />One could see the turn-out in a positive light.  It is the first time that the year-on-year decline has been reversed.  It has stabilised at 43%.  There is a huge disparity between countries such as Belgium, where I voted, and where 90% of people vote, and Slovakia where the turn-out was 13%.  There is a trend for quite high votes in the larger countries such as France and Germany, whereas the central and east European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia are down at 20%.  Why has the European Parliament not brought these countries, which acceded in the past ten years, along?<br />The performance of the far right and far left is used as a term to mask greater diversity.  There are extremely xenophobic parties such as Jobbik in Hungary and Golden Dawn in Greece and the more moderate parties such as the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, in Britain which is regarded as less extreme than the British National Party.  It is true that the European People's Party, EPP, and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;amp;D, are still the largest parties but we cannot underestimate the success of these anti-establishment parties.  Their strong vote in large founder member countries such as France and Britain means they will have more MEPs which will change the hue of the parliament.  It is significant that Marine Le Pen's party, which is anti-European and wants to exit the euro, topped the poll in France, traditionally the most federalist and pro-European country and one which pushed the euro.<br />The main impact will be felt nationally because the success of the political fringes may force mainstream parties to change their policies somewhat, for example, the British Conservative party is hardening its Eurosceptic stance and anti-immigration policy because of UKIP's rise and because it is losing voters to UKIP.  The same is happening in France.  President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande is quite strong on anti-immigration policy but arguably if the National Front was not succeeding he might not have been as strong on that issue.<br />This will solidify consensus among the EPP and S&amp;amp;D members.  I have heard people say off the record that there is a concerted move in the parliament to isolate some of these extreme parties.  That will encourage the S&amp;amp;D and EPP to work together more.  We will know more about the political groupings next week but the fact that Marine Le Pen and Mr. Wilders did not get enough support from the seven countries to form a group is significant.  This raises the broader question of how much power the European Parliament really has.  We have heard how since the Lisbon treaty in 2009 the European Parliament has gained much more power but the power to initiate legislation still resides with the Commission.  The member states have more power through the Council formation.  One of the ironies of contemporary history is that the period since 2009, when the parliament should have come into its own, coincided with the bailouts and the eurozone crisis when all the decisions were made at Council and Commission level.  The European Parliament had no part in any of the decisions on the Greek and Irish bailouts.  The Commission and Council were actively involved in the troika programmes.  Maybe now that the eurozone crisis has calmed down a bit the media will take more interest in the parliament and there will be more activity in the parliament when the EU is out of crisis management mode.<br />One of the outcomes of the elections last month has been the debate about the election of the European Commission President.  This did not really engage the public before the elections but it has now become very divisive and quite serious.  The Taoiseach is travelling to the summit of EU leaders on Thursday.  It now looks likely that Jean-Claude Juncker will be appointed.  The debate arose over the so-called <i>spitzenkandidat</i>system.  The political groups argue that they interpret a clause in the Lisbon treaty, to the effect that the Council must take account of the elections, as meaning that each party must nominate a candidate and the person with the most votes wins.  Britain has taken a very strong stance on this.  Traditionally, it has a history of blocking or vetoing European Commission Presidents.  The significance this time is that if it goes with Mr. Juncker it will set a precedent and that will continue from now on.  Many people from the Parliament say this is a good way to address the democratic deficit between voters and the institutions that represent them.  That raises the question of where does or should power reside in the European Union.  Should it reside in the European Parliament, the only directly elected institution?  Or should it reside in the European Council?  The battle is taking place this week in Brussels.  Britain is very strongly opposed to the parliament getting more power.  It believes it does not have a mandate because the election turn-out is so low.  It feels strongly that the job of the European Commission President should not be politicised and that if the parliament gets involved that will politicise a role that should be neutral.  Many see the European Commission as a kind of civil service.  There are serious debates going on this week in Brussels.<br />The context for the debate about the EU job that happens every five years has changed because there will probably be a referendum on EU membership in Britain in the next few years.  In the past few days there have been hints that the Conservative Party may even campaign for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote to leave the EU after this.  There is a danger that this issue of the appointment of the next Commission President will alienate Britain and British voters.  It has featured very heavily in the British and German media.  A former French leader wrote an opinion piece in <i>Le Monde</i>, that was published in <i>The Guardian</i>, saying that Britain should leave the EU, that there has been enough of Britain making changes and it should just go.  It would be interesting to see how the British membership of the EU plays out in the next few years.  This debate over the leadership of the European Commission could have serious ramifications for the future of the European Union.</p></speech>

Britain aspired to have Chris Patten elected at the beginning of the decade and that was vetoed by its Gallic neighbours.<br />In respect of the <i>spitzenkandidat</i>, we had many meetings here in advance of the European Parliament elections and people said that having a lead candidate from each party would help to raise awareness among the population at large and make the elections more democratic.  Deputy Byrne, Senator Noone and I attended the meeting of the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC last weekend in Athens.  We discussed the outcome of the European Parliament elections.  One of the draft conclusions was that COSAC welcomed the success of the <i>spitzenkandidat</i>as a concept but we removed that conclusion because the feeling across the room was that it was not a success.  It may have been a move in the right direction but it certainly could not be called a success.  I would be surprised if 5% of the Irish population could name Mr. Juncker, Martin Schulz or Guy Verhofstadt.  I do not think their names have crossed over into common parlance.</p> <p>It was a positive move in the right direction but I do not believe it could be described as a success.  It did not make that much difference when it came to the turnout but it is something from which we can learn.</p><p> The way the advent of the new MEPs from the far left and far right could lead to some fragmentation of behaviour within the Parliament was mentioned.  Many of us as parliamentarians believe there has been a shift in power in the European Parliament since Lisbon II.  Moves are under way between myself and my fellow chairmen of EU affairs committees across Europe to try to increase the power of national parliamentarians.  If there is fragmentation at European Parliament level it might give national parliaments an opportunity to increase our overall power within the structures of the Union.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014062400005#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were helpful.  It is always useful for us to reflect on the opinions of people such as the witnesses who take a broader view than those on this committee of the national Parliament, but it appears that citizens across Europe are disengaging from the European project.  We all have a view on the reason that is happening but at a time of crisis, when they see a failure on the part of the institutions to react in a manner they believe benefits them, they tend to withdraw and take a more nationalistic view, which clearly has happened.</p><p>  Ms Lynch spoke about the Council and the Commission being seen as the institutions that dealt largely with the crisis when, in effect, a more bilateral approach appeared to deal with it - too much between France and Germany.  Despite the democratic deficit, to use that great phrase, in which the institutions operate, we ended up having this bilateral arrangement where summits were held on a weekly basis in France and Germany, undermining the institutions in which people had built some trust.  It is clear they were not in a position to deal with the crisis, and they did not have their own legal framework.  Part of the reason for that had to do with the way the euro project came about without the appropriate mechanisms to deal with the crisis.</p><p>  It is not surprising that citizens across Europe are becoming more eurosceptic and nationalistic in their outlook because the project people believed in, and it is happening here, was not fit for purpose; it is still not fit for purpose.  Much of it is lost because people talk in generalities on occasion but we have some concrete examples now of where the Irish State is looking to Europe regarding the retrospective recapitalisation of the pillar banks.  Two years ago a decision was taken at a Council meeting, and the matter is still dragging on.  This committee has gone into the minutiae of that across all political parties.  It is about banking union and having the appropriate resolution in the event of banks failing again, but it is dragging on and there is no determinate point at which we can say we will resolve that.  We get soundings from various officials to the effect that is unlikely or it might not happen, but that further erodes the confidence of citizens in Ireland who seek some type of outcome.  They believed a decision had been taken that was positive for Ireland yet it seems to have petered out and withered on the vine, so to speak.  The centre of Europe has not been its own best advocate in that regard.</p><p>  We can even look to the efforts made in Lisbon to try to do away with the democratic deficit and allow more input from citizens on decisions being taken.  In terms of the decision on the next Commission President, everybody expected that the Council would be mindful of the results of the Parliament.  It is a classic fudge, but the fudge has to be dealt with at some point and we are now dealing with the fallout from that.  This wrangling is going on now when it was sold at the time to citizens that if they follow this route the issue they have had about the Commission will be resolved because it will be based on some type of electoral legitimacy and will have an albeit indirect connection to the citizen.  However, member states that largely bought into the notion of the collegial way of doing business are now saying that is not what the citizens decided, and they tried to play fast and loose with the rules that were established.  It is the institutions themselves and the member states, largely through the Council, that undermine citizens' impression of what should and could happen because they return to secular or national interests, and we have a way to go to get the Council to think more collectively in the best interests of all member states rather than looking at its narrow, nationalistic benefits.  At some point we must decide who is in or out.  </p><p>  There is a debate about whether the United Kingdom will remain in the EU.  It is vitally important for Ireland that it remains in the European Union but the associate membership it has created for itself is damaging because other member states then begin to wonder if they have more to gain by dislocating themselves somewhat from the EU.  It is not surprising that citizens are showing a greater level of euroscepticism when, ultimately, the politicians and the leadership in Europe is disengaging more and not engaging in a proactive way that benefits everybody rather than their own national interests.  That is a long-winded way of making my point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014062400005#D00300"><p>I welcome both witnesses.  To contradict what the previous speaker said, people are not disengaging more.  We had a higher turnout in the elections.  It was marginal and still low but it is inaccurate to say there is greater disengagement.  It is probably more accurate to say engagement could be greater.  While there has been a strengthening of some of the eurosceptic and far-right groups such as the European Conservatives and Reformists, ECR, which would be very damaging to Irish interests in the positions they take, the reality is that the European People's Party, EPP, is still the biggest party and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;D, is the second biggest.  In terms of the narrative we seek, we forget sometimes that in Europe the centre very much won, as in Ireland.  Fine Gael was the winner of the European elections.</p><p>  While some of the parties on the other side have done a little better, they are still very much in the minority when it comes to what the people of Europe want.  If we combine the EPP and the S&amp;D membership of the Parliament, we can see they have a huge majority, and we can add ALDE to that also.  The people of Europe have expressed the view collectively that the European Union's centre way of operating got a huge vote of approval from the people of Europe.  It is also a concern, and something we all have to take on board, that the opponents have grown in number but it has been an extremely difficult number of years for the European Union and for many of its member states.</p><p>  I have questions for both witnesses.  I attended an EPP meeting last week, and this follows on from some of the comments made about the United Kingdom.  Are the witnesses getting a sense that there is a growing weariness of the "our way against the rest of you" position being taken not just by the Tories but the British generally, and that the European countries are becoming fed up with it?</p> <p> I agree with Deputy Timmy Dooley that it is very much in our national interest to have a strong United Kingdom within Europe.  Are we getting lonely as one of the nations standing up for Britain's membership?  Is there a growing sense in Europe of "if you want to go, off with you"?  My second question is a bit technical, it is about a comparison between our system and the various systems of electing MEPs and the list system.   The witnesses referred to the churn of membership.  I suggest the reason for a low churn in Germany is that it tends to replace people at the top of their lists.  I would be interested to hear the pros and cons of the list system and how it would impact in our little republic.</p></speech>

The statistics show that the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats are still the strongest groups in the European Parliament.  At the outset we should congratulate  Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP, on his decision to opt for a different grouping to that for which he was supposedly elected.  We have heard it said that he was the ALDE candidate.  In a sense he is doing Irish citizens a favour by allowing this controversy to raise its head.  What would ALDE have meant to the Irish electorate? In trying to analyse the reason for the growth of the extreme Left and the extreme Right, we look to the statistics and some of those from both wings who have been elected to the parliament.  I will cite some of the political groupings such as, I Believe, in Slovenia; Earth Party, in Portugal; Politics can be Different, in Hungary; Animal Rights Party in the Netherlands; the Pirate Party in Germany; We Can, in Spain; another called Citizens, another called-----</p></speech>

There are many more examples.  What I am trying to elicit from the witnesses' practical knowledge about what is going on in Europe is whether we should be surprised there are so many groupings going forward?  After all we are a community of 28 nations.  Within some of those nations, unlike Ireland where we have a single border, two religions Catholic and Protestant, there may be a dozen borders with various minority groups such as Greeks, Hungarians or Poles living there.  There are far more complex political issues to deal with than in Ireland.  What does it mean for all these disparate weird groups being elected throughout Europe?  A little closer to home, Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, got 50% of the electoral support in his constituency.  Does it mean anything to the Irish electorate that some have the title S&amp;D after their names, some have Christian Democrats or the EPP and, if not, what does it say about the electorate?  Let us concentrate on the Irish electorate.  Are they really voting for MEPs on the basis that as European MEPs they are going to do something very specific, very political, on behalf of Ireland Inc.?  My fear is that it does not, and is not working that way.</p><p>  My final question centres around the debate on Brian Crowley, MEP.  It appears to me that horsetrading is taking place and, if so, how does it work?  It seems to me that this man has got a better deal from his new grouping than he had from ALDE.  What type of services are these groupings providing to individual MEPs?  What type of  seduction takes place?  A former colleague MEP, who had left the Labour Party which is a social democratic party ended up in the Social Democratic Party grouping in Europe.  Can the witnesses analyse what the people of Ireland are telling their MEPs to do on behalf of Ireland Inc.? Does S&amp;D, L&amp;N, MS, M5 or PD after one's name have any relevance whatsoever? </p></speech>

I welcome both witnesses to the discussion on the European Parliament elections and its broader history.  On the turnout issue, Ireland would have had a reduction in turnout.  When Ireland became a member of the EEC, as it was then, the whole concept of direct elections was coming into being and there would have been a new process for all the countries involved.  In regard to new entrant countries, such as Slovenia, are the witnesses surprised at its turnout rate of 13%?  Does that correspond to a lower turnout in its national or local elections?  Is it the case that as this a new democratic process for Slovenia in terms of European Elections that it would have such a low turnout?<br />On the issue of the turnover, I put that question to the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, when he appeared before the committee recently.  Does the retirement rate for the European Parliament damage the interest in the process - not so much in Ireland - across Europe as the well-known faces are not seeking re-election?  There is also a high replacement rate even in Ireland in terms of Members of the European Parliament.<br />In regard to the <i>spitzenkandidat</i>, was the lack of engagement, the methodology or the fact that they would not have been household names, albeit, very important and strong Europeans in terms of Mr. Juncker and Mr. Schulz, an issue?  If the candidates were Ms Merkel, Mr. Sarkozy, Ms Legarde or Mr. Barroso would they have generated a greater level of debate across Europe than the two very strong and experienced candidates who would have gone forward?</p></speech>

We may be beating ourselves excessively in terms of electoral turnout and what it means.  We have to concede that on 23 May, of the 51% or 52% of people in the Republic who cast their vote, at least 95% of those went to the polling booth to vote for the local election candidates.  Let us be honest, the European ballot paper was secondary.  That is the way it has always been.  If people try to say otherwise I ask them to reflect back to 1984, which was the only year in which the Irish European Elections was held separate from local elections.  In the 1980s the average Irish turnout would have been 70% plus but I think the turnout on European election day in 1984 was about 40%.</p><p>  I do not think we should be shocked that the European election campaign did not particularly engage the voters.  We have to be thankful that more than half the people voted.  We must accept the fact that they actually voted in the local elections and while they were at the polling station they filled out the European election ballot paper.  The challenge is how to enthuse people to take a more pro-active part  from a candidate perspective, a party perspective and a voter perspective in the European election campaign.  In that regard, Deputy Dara Murphy asked the witnesses to reflect on the electoral system.  I look forward to their response to that issue.  We are permanently debating the electoral system.  The Oireachtas debates parliamentary party issues and the Constitutional Convention but we have not really progressed.  If we want to be politically brave and innovative we could certainly use the European elections to look at an alternative electoral system.  Nobody can claim that the current three constituencies of enormous size make any sense.</p> <p>The nearest MEP for a person in County Wicklow, just a few miles out of south Dublin, geographically, is Deirdre Clune who is based on Cork city.  Will the delegation comment on this aspect of the electoral system?<br />I also want to raise the issue of how candidates advertised themselves on their posters and so forth.  Candidates should show the emblem of their European political affiliation rather than their home political party.  For example, Deirdre Clune was on the ballot paper as &ldquo;Deirdre Clune, Fine Gael&rdquo; when she should have been &ldquo;Deirdre Clune, European People&rsquo;s Party&rdquo;.  This would bring home to the voter that the candidate is not simply representing a narrow, national political party but a broader political movement.  What is the delegation&rsquo;s view on this?<br />In my time in the Oireachtas, we have had only one weekend poll.  Over a decade ago, we had two by-elections in south Tipperary within 12 months.  The first by-election took place on a Friday which was won by Deputy Seamus Healy.  The subsequent by-election 12 months later was won by the then Senator Tom Hayes, which was expected.  As that poll was held on a Saturday, turnout increased substantially.  I believe there is a better prospect of enhancing voter turnout on weekends.  If we are serious about getting the electorate to vote, voting should be over a day and a half such as all day Saturday, half day Sunday or <i>vice versa</i>.  We must be a little different in this regard and I would like to hear the delegation&rsquo;s views on this.<br />We are getting a little bogged down with the victory of the eurosceptics in these elections.  Looking at the local election results, one could say there was a politics-sceptic victory with the big block parties rejected.  The eurosceptic results were not a huge sensation across Europe as economic conditions had impacted.  We have seen all of this before.<br />It was obvious that the aspect of the European elections concerning the European Commission presidency did not take off here.  No one went to a polling station to vote for a candidate because it would determine the choice for Commission President.  Some years ago, former Taoiseach, John Bruton, proposed the Commission President should be directly elected by the citizens of Europe.  This was also official policy of my former party, Fine Gael, as it was passed at a party Ard-Fheis.  Should the lead candidates for the Commission presidency present themselves before the citizens of Europe?</p></speech>

Why are so many people anti-European?  Why is it more popular to be anti-Europe than pro-Europe?  In the middle of the last century, it was necessary to be pro-European in a new embracing way in the aftermath of the Second World War.  That challenge has gone and economic challenges have risen in their stead.</p><p>  The European Union has been demonised by individual member states for domestic political purposes and reasons of political expediency from time to time.  We can analyse as much as we like after that but that is the way it goes.  There has been a huge welter of anti-Europeanism in the UK for some time, for example.  Why is that so?  Europe is seen as admonishing with EU administrations imposing add-ons of a punitive nature whenever European Commission or institutions see fit.  For example, the main factor associated with anti-Europeanism in this country is probably penalties and fines for non-compliance with EU regulations on climate change, carbon emissions, fisheries and agriculture.  These are fines for regulations that were accepted by our Administration.  The theory is that Europe is imposing these on us.  Europe does not impose any regulations but merely sets out the general broad agenda, proposes a directive which is then decided by member states.  A member state can accept, reject or amend a directive.  For example, conservation orders and turf-cutting regulations are all lumped together by people who blame the European system for them.  To my mind, these claims have undermined the concept of the modern European Union to an extent that is dangerous.</p><p>  Replacement candidates for European elections should be voted for as well.</p></speech>

This would give the people the chance to decide who a replacement candidate would be.</p><p>  How do we address the problems now arising in the European Union?  If we the people of Europe continue in the direction in which we are headed, we will see an end to the Europe which we inherited at the beginning of this century.  This would be a sad development.  It is inevitable this will happen if we do not get in front of the issues perceived to be causing concern which are alienating Europe from the people.  We have spent much time making Europe more relevant and part of the people.  It has reached over the national administrations to deal directly with the people, which is not such a good idea.  We need to address those issues.</p><p>  Why are so many people anti-European?  Why is there a growing number of people vehemently indisposed towards the European concept?  Why do we allow legislation to pass, albeit coming from Brussels but originating from our own national institutions, which then comes back to bite us on the tail and generates antipathy towards the European Union?</p> <p>We distance ourselves from them and say we cannot have that appalling bureaucratic system.  We have to join up all the systems and the thinking and try to return to where we were in terms of encouraging European people to take possession of Europe.  Each member state has a duty to take possession of the European project.  Once they move away from taking ownership of the European project, for whatever reason, the project will die.</p></speech>

In no particular order, and I will not answer all the questions, I will start with the question on the role for the national parties, which Deputy Hannigan mentioned.</p><p>  I would be concerned going forward given the fast-tracking of legislation and even though national parliaments have been empowered under the Lisbon treaty that the timeline for input from the national parliaments is very tight and the move towards more informal trilogue agreements means that despite the theoretical input from the national parliaments, in reality national parliaments are not particularly strengthened in the decision-making process.</p></speech>

Of course, the issues have gone to the sectoral committee and this may be a loss to the D&aacute;il.  The membership of the European Affairs committee are very interested in Europe and are passionate about it but perhaps it is not the top of the agenda of the legislation going to individual committees, but that is a debate for another day.</p><p>  Every time the European Parliament elections happen, we have a conversation on the citizens disengaging from the process.  There never was some glory time when the citizens were heavily informed and deeply passionate about the European Union, there was a permissive consensus, if anything, that broke down about 20 years ago.  Deputy Durkan touched on many of the reasons that we have become more Eurosceptic.  It is very convenient to blame Europe, there is a great deal of blame-shifting by national parliaments.  Decision making is incredibly complex as members well know in the European Union and most citizens are not that interested in getting their head around the nature of the relations between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, co-decision, co-operation and assent.  It is very complex.  This is problematic.</p><p>  There is a role for the media.  It may be a chicken and egg scenario in that Europe does not get coverage in the media in most of the EC countries.  Some of the Scandinavian countries are better at covering it but they are becoming more Eurosceptic.  It is not clear if the people are uninformed because the media does not cover it or the media does not cover it because the people do not care about it.  It is a case of dual causality.  Perhaps if one really wants to engage people then the Erasmus Plus and Socrates Plus programmes offer a move toward that.  Some of the more successful arrangements for making people passionate about the European Union, are the daily interaction.  People need to be reminded of the advantages of the Schengen Agreement, the eurozone and those kinds of issues.  Much of the legislation coming out from the European Union is very technical and it is very hard to get people interested in lawn mower noise or bendy bananas, that is not an issue - but it is one that the British media went with.</p><p>  There was some comment on the electoral system and we could spend all day speaking about the electoral systems.  Certainly it is a factor that almost two thirds of German MEPs are returned, given the closed list system where the party gets to rank the candidates and there is not that degree of shifting.  If I were to suggest one simple change as a way of changing the electoral system for the European elections in Ireland, it would be to increase the district magnitude as it would make it more proportional to have the country as one entity.  One would lose the geographical connection, but we have lost it.  Members have touched on the fact that the geographic connection is no longer there.  With an 11 seater constituency one would approach better levels of proportionality.  Three seater constituencies are problematic.  The magic number is five or six for district magnitude.  That would be one option.  I am not sure but I do not think it would require a constitutional change, however, I am not a constitutional lawyer.  I think it would be an easy change and would lead to greater proportionality.</p><p>  On the question of branding of the candidates, there was some branding on the election posters, but it was definitely in a much smaller font than that of their political parties, such as the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il names.  Deputy Byrne touched on this point, however, people are not aware of the groupings in the European Parliament.  They have no clue and they do not care which parties the MEPs are in.  That is not confined to Ireland but is replicated across the European Union.  The European elections are second order elections, they are protest elections, people are voting on national issues.  It is an old chestnut.  One cannot force feed people information and to be interested in European elections.  To some extent the switch by an Irish MEP to another party has given some coverage, to the remarkable fact that more than 150 national parties from the 28 member states managed to coalesce into seven or eight groups.  Did the MEP have a mandate to join the ALDE group?  Probably not, most people who voted for him did not know what group he was in.</p><p>  Switching is very common in the European Parliament.  It is not so common for British MEPs although there have been incidents of British and Irish MEPs switching but it is very common for the French and Italians.  There are bizarre situations that half of the French from one group will be in different groups in the European Parliament and that is perfectly acceptable.  It has not been the Irish tradition, and this is perhaps very controversial, in that one can have different parties from the same country in the same group in the European Parliament, even if they are on opposition and government benches.  The Italians are famous for that.  It is unlikely to happen for British or Irish parties but it certainly is an option.</p><p>  On the question of what Brian Crowley, MEP, got from the ECR, I cannot speculate on that but by it becoming the third largest group there will be funding advantages.</p></speech>

What MEPs want is the chairmanships, reports and plenary time because that is where one will, to some extent, get media coverage.  Plenary session is not where the action happens, if one wants to influence the legislation, one does not go to Strasbourg when they are voting on it.  That is way too late, all the action has happened prior to that.<br />How can we boost turn-out for the European Parliament elections?  We are doing a good job by holding the elections on the same day as the local elections.  Holding the elections at weekends definitely increases turnout by a couple of percentage points.  Sunday elections in particular seem to be beneficial but we should not berate ourselves too much, as we achieved a 52% turnout.  If one takes out the countries with compulsory voting, although compulsory voting is not really that punitive in some of the countries, we are doing reasonably well, although it dropped from the previous time.<br />The <i><font color="#222222">Spitzenkandidaten</font></i><font color="#222222"> did</font>not capture the public imagination but oddly, with the negative coverage now, it is getting some play in the media.  Is there any such thing as bad publicity?  It will be interesting to watch what happens in the next couple of days.  It seems that the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;amp;D, will back Jean-Claude Juncker and in exchange Martin Schulz gets to continue to be the European Parliament President for the first two and a half years of the legislative session.  He will probably be an EP candidate down the line.  The big story is the consensus and agreement going forward between these two parties.  There are issues on which they are divided, being a centre left party and a centre right party.  One issue to watch will be the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  The S&amp;amp;D are more sceptical about it.  That will also be a big divisive issue for the European Conservative and Reformist, ECR, Party.</p></speech>

One of the things I did not touch on is the new issues for the next five years.  We all know that water charges featured in the debates on the European elections.  Obviously that has nothing to do with the European Parliament.  We are one country out of the 28 member states and there were different issues on the doorsteps in other countries, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  We are quite aware of the TTIP negotiations in Ireland and the farming lobby is quite strong on this issue, but in Germany and Austria it was an issue on the doorsteps.  The German people are very aware of this agreement and very against it.  I am generalising slightly but Angela Merkel brought it up with Obama at the G7, referring to chlorinated chicken.  An Irishman will be leading these negotiations for the EU over the next five years.  It is a significant issue and definitely there must be more public awareness of it.  In one of our own media outlets, a Deputy was reported speaking of the positive benefits it will have for business in Ireland.  One would not be having the same conversation in Germany, Austria and countries like that.</p> <p>I know from talking to journalists there that it is a huge issue.</p><p> Immigration is another issue that explains the Eurosceptic vote.  It is not an issue here to the same extent.  People might feel uncomfortable about the reality that it is a huge issue.  If one turns on a current affairs television programme in France, it is likely that one will see people talking about Islam and about immigration.  I recently visited a refugee camp in Bulgaria that is accommodating immigrants coming in through Syria.  This is a huge issue in Greece.  Approximately 90% of immigrants come in through Greece.  Immigration will be a huge issue during the forthcoming Italian Presidency of the European Union.  We seem to be missing this in Ireland.</p><p> Data protection is another issue that could have implications for us.  Germany is really interested in it.  The revelations about Snowden will impinge on the EU-US trade talks as well.  This could have implications for Ireland down the line, given that we host many Internet companies.  Many of them have their European headquarters here.  This issue will be one to watch in the next five years.</p><p> I would like to mention another matter that is potentially worrying for Ireland.  Olli Rehn, who is the outgoing Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and who played a crucial role in the Irish bailout, will have an even bigger role now that he has been elected to the European Parliament.  Obviously, he is extremely experienced.  Two weeks ago, he told a breakfast briefing in Brussels, which was organised by European Movement Ireland, that corporation tax and aggressive tax planning was an issue on the doorsteps when he was campaigning in Finland.</p></speech>

Even the right-wing parties are economically nationalist and anti-globalisation.  We are into this whole issue.  The investigation into tax in Ireland and two other countries, which was launched a few weeks ago even though tax is not within the remit of the European Union, is setting a precedent that Europe can get involved by examining different tax structures.  It has to be said that this issue is by no means confined to Ireland.  There is now a focus on patent boxes.  Nine countries, including Britain, are being investigated for the use of a specific technique that allows companies to pay less tax on activities involving patented inventions.  Some of these issues will be on the agenda in the next five years.<br />I was interested to hear what was said about the consensus between the EPP and the S&amp;amp;D.  They said in the press release they issued yesterday that they hope &quot;to find a lasting solution to the crisis not based on the policies of the past&quot;.  This might be a bit optimistic for some people.  I envisage that there will be a new discussion about the policy of austerity.  Last weekend, Francois Hollande held a mini summit of left-of-centre leaders, including the Italian, Austrian and Danish premiers, at which they decided to back Jean-Claude Juncker.  It appears that Italy, in particular, is pushing for greater flexibility on the debt and deficit targets set by Brussels.  Ireland is talking about providing for cuts of &euro;2 billion in the budget in the context of the rules imposed by Brussels.  That conversation is also taking place in other countries, including much bigger countries like Italy and France that are under big pressure to meet their debt targets.  The Italian debt-to-GDP ratio is huge.<br />Perhaps all of this can be seen as positive in the sense that the European Parliament is more likely to hold the Commission to account for its economic policies, many of which were launched as crisis mechanisms.  It seems that all parts of the European Parliament are hoping to shift the emphasis away from fiscal consolidation to investment.  When Herman Van Rompuy circulated a letter to leaders before Thursday's summit setting out the priorities for the next five years, he spoke about things like public disenchantment with the EU, the need for renewal and the need for investment.  That could be a kind of trend we see over the next five years as a way to connect with the proportion of voters who are disillusioned.<br />I think we will all agree that people in Ireland did not vote on the basis of the <i>spitzenkandidat</i>system, even though Jean-Claude Juncker was elected in Ireland.  It was a big issue in Germany, however.  I know German and Austrian journalists in Brussels who are heavily in favour of this system.  It has been suggested that this is because Martin Schulz is German and Jean-Claude Juncker is fluent in German.  One can imagine that we would probably have been a bit more engaged if there had been an Irish candidate.  The system was also backed in France, where Francois Hollande was a strong supporter of Martin Schulz.  Some of the bigger powers are behind the <i>spitzenkandidat</i>system.  I suppose it is only natural.  Given that we have just 11 of the 751 MEPs, Ireland is lucky to continue to have huge influence in Brussels.  The big issue at the moment for the east European countries is Russia, Ukraine and gas.  Obviously, we are geographically far removed from it.  This will be a big issue for many countries in the next five years.  Issues like energy and foreign policy could end up becoming the crucial centre of gravity in EU decision-making in the years to come.  They could replace the economic story.  Our MEPs who are starting their new five-year terms will need to have views on all of these matters.  These issues - not water charges, unfortunately - will be to the fore in the coming years.</p></speech>

I also welcome all the people in the Visitors Gallery and Ms Caroline Sloan, Ms Yvonne Moynihan, Dr. Michael Byrne, Professor Jonathan Hourihane, Mr. Pat O'Mahony, and Ms Lorraine Nolan to our meeting today.<br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones should be switched off for the duration of this meeting and should be in airplane mode rather than on silent because they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings and it is unfair to staff to have buzzing noises in their headsets. <br/>Our meeting this evening has been convened to discuss EpiPens which are used for the treatment of allergic reactions.  Severe allergic reactions can have devastating consequences for those affected and immediate access to medication can be a life-saving intervention.  Today we are conscious that Ms Sloan, whose daughter Emma tragically died, is with us.  We offer our sympathies to her and thank her for being here and for her courage, not just in coming here but in campaigning since Emma's death.  We know it is not easy to be here but we appreciate her presence<br/>Professor Jonathan Hourihane and Dr. Michael Byrne from University College Cork, UCC, have been very strong advocates and campaigners in this area.  We are also joined by Mr Pat O'Mahony and Ms Lorraine Nolan from the Irish Medicines Board, IMB.  They are very welcome this afternoon.  I apologise to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in because this meeting unfortunately clashes with his business dealing with a Bill in the D&aacute;il.<br/>The purpose of our meeting is to promote awareness of the campaign run by our witnesses and to ensure that the like of the tragedy which has occurred may never happen again.  I am aware that circumstances surrounding Emma's tragic death are now the subject of an inquiry by a statutory body and that this committee needs to exercise caution and should not enter into a discussion regarding these events as we do not wish to prejudice the outcome of that inquiry.  This is an important meeting and I thank the many people in the Visitors Gallery for showing their support for our witnesses.<br/>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their  evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I invite Mrs Sloan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

She will forever be 14 years old.  I loved her from the day she was born and I watched her grow into a beautiful young woman.  Emma was bright, beautiful, smart, funny and kind.  She was so kind to others in her short life that I am very proud to be her mother.  Emma lived her life to the fullest.  She was headstrong and she knew her own mind.  She had many plans for her future, which included doing her junior certificate, becoming a stylist, getting loads of tattoos and having a family of her own.  I was sure she would achieve all of this and more.  Instead, Emma died on a cold street corner one week before Christmas while we watched helplessly.  She was looking forward to Christmas, her new telephone, and her tickets.  All her presents still sit wrapped in a box in a press.  I only ever got to spend one Christmas with all three of my children.</p><p>  Emma's death has been described many times as a tragedy but for me that is not the case because a tragedy is something unavoidable.  Emma's death was avoidable.  Had we had the correct information and education about her allergy, and had we had access to an EpiPen, Emma would be with us today.  That is the reason for the campaign.</p><p>  The first aim of the campaign is to free up the availability of EpiPens.  They should be in every first aid box in the country.  There is very little training required in the use of these pens.  They cost 10 cent a day to keep which could make the difference between life and death, especially for people as yet undiagnosed with allergies.  The second aim is to have all allergy sufferers supplied with ID cards or bracelets.  This would be of benefit for two reasons, one can walk into a chemist and be given a pen and someone else can easily identify what is happening to a person who goes into anaphylactic shock and is not able to administer the pen him or herself.  There is a scheme in Scotland under which pharmacists have an orange light and will administer treatment for anaphylaxis.  While this is a step in the right direction it is not practical unless one has the reaction in the vicinity of a chemist.  As we are all too aware since Emma's death, time is not on our side.</p><p>  This country should follow in the footsteps of America where last year President Obama signed legislation to encourage all schools to stock EpiPens following the death of two children.  Canada is also introducing this measure state-by-state, which has already saved lives.  We are also campaigning for an allergy clinic in every county in Ireland.  Until recently Professor Hourihane was the only allergy specialist in the country.  He was based in Cork.  Recently an allergy specialist has been appointed in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  The waiting time for an appointment is one and a half years.  How many children could die in that time and why are there not better services for children with allergies?  Had Emma been referred to a specialist, given the results of her allergy test and given an allergy management plan she would be alive today.  We knew the importance of having her asthma inhaler and carried it everywhere.  Had we known the importance of the EpiPen we would have carried it everywhere.  We were never told Emma's nut allergy was fatal.</p><p>  Since starting this campaign a little over seven weeks ago we have collected over 60,000 signatures, including 10,000 on-line.  The support from people across the country has been amazing in promoting the campaign and collecting signatures.  Many of Emma's friends have been involved every week, attending various events and locations to promote the campaign, and collecting signatures.  Everywhere they go people who sign the petition express shock and outrage at the circumstances of Emma's death and see the aims of our campaign as common sense.</p><p>  The campaign has also received support from the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Hotels Federation of Ireland, Dublin Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service and Deputies and councillors all over the country.  Emma died because we were denied access to a life-saving injection.  We will continue to fight for Emma and have her voice heard until the changes are made to ensure this never ever happens to another child or family because she gave her life for this.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiative to discuss the provision of EpiPens as they provide vital life-saving injections.  I met Ms Sloan through the Emma&rsquo;s Voice campaign because I too suffer from anaphylaxis.  I did not know that I had anaphylaxis until I went into shock in a restaurant in 2010.  Fortunately for me, I was able to discuss my symptoms on the phone with a doctor and she was soon able to administer and adrenaline injection.</p><p>  Since that incident I have been consistently vigilant in telling members of staff in restaurants about my shellfish allergy, despite that, however, there have been occasions on which I have suffered a reaction because of cross-contamination in food.  For this reason it is my submission that it is very important to have EpiPens available in restaurants.</p> <p>The fact is that people have died in restaurants in this country as a result of allergies.  The law is insufficient.  Proof of that has been the death of Emma Sloan.</p><p> My written submissions could be distilled into four distinct categories which I will briefly summarise.  First, I identify the problems with the law.  In effect, there is no real legislative platform at the moment.  Second, I will suggest solutions by examining the laws in other jurisdictions, in particular the US, Canada and the United Kingdom.  My submissions will focus on the provision of EpiPens specifically in restaurants and schools.  Amending the regulations is insufficient in itself.  A comprehensive Bill is required.  In my submissions I consider the Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill and suggest that any new law should model itself on the provisions of that particular Bill.</p><p> Finally, in my submissions I consider the civil liability in the administration of epinephrine in an emergency situation.  That is very important.  I will illuminate the importance of setting out the scope of liability in any potential legislation so that any individual who intervenes in an emergency situation need not be afraid of the threat of the proceedings.  Therefore, it is very important to remember that EpiPens exist to save lives and not to create unnecessary legal woes.</p><p> In terms of the current law, regulation 8 of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003-2008 does provide that a pharmacist can supply epinephrine without prescription in an emergency.  I submit that the legislation is restrictive because it fails to define an emergency and, furthermore, it fails to cater for people such as me who have undiagnosed allergies and do not have a prescription for an EpiPen.  The only way to fix the issue is for the legislation to go further and to set out further exceptions for emergencies and extend accessibility to schools and restaurants in particular.  There also needs to be provision to introduce a scheme to train first responders.</p><p> I submit that schools and restaurants in particular are a hot bed for anaphylactic reactions.  Currently, there are no statutory protocols in being for dealing with food allergic customers.  In addition, there are no formal guidelines in schools for the treatment and management of anaphylaxis.  Deficiencies in the legislation will lead to exposure in terms of liability.  The only way to minimise that is to introduce guidelines.</p><p> The US in particular has been very proactive in introducing legislation.  As Ms Sloan said, President Obama signed federal legislation in December 2013 requiring schools to stockpile EpiPens.  Individual states will enact their own laws.  The Act permits trained staff to administer the injections and it requires schools to have a stockpile of epinephrine and furthermore to have a plan in place for the management of anaphylaxis.  Most importantly, the Act outlines the scope of liability which protects trained individuals who administer an injection in an emergency.  I set out the text of that in my written submissions.</p><p> The federal legislation was enacted as a result of the death of a student in Virginia.  Amarria Johnson accidentally ate a nut in school.  The school had an EpiPen belonging to another child but was not allowed to use it on Amarria and as a result, unfortunately, she died of anaphylaxis.  Subsequently, Amarria&rsquo;s Law was enacted.  That allows schools to administer EpiPens and it indemnifies anyone who uses one on a child.</p><p> In Canada, Sabrina&rsquo;s Law was enacted following the death of a child in school.  The Act requires that every school board adopts an anaphylaxis plan dealing with life-threatening situations.  The Act also provides that no action will be taken for a claim for damages in respect of any act that is done in good faith.</p><p> Across the water, in the UK, the Children and Families Act was enacted last month.  It requires every school in England to ensure that children who suffer from health conditions such as anaphylaxis get the care they need in school.  Once again, there is a requirement that staff are trained in respect of the medical condition and protection is provided should an allegation of negligence be made subsequently.</p><p> I do not think amending the regulations will resolve everything.  I propose that a Bill would be more broadly welcomed, such as the Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill.  The way the Bill is set out is of some relevance.  Part 2 deals with the provision of defibrillators, which requires all owners of designated places to install defibrillators.  Part 3 deals with training in the use of defibrillators.  Part 5 deals with the scope of liability in order to protect anybody who does act in good faith.  Part 6 is concerned with offences and penalties that may arise.  The layout of the Bill is a good guide for any proposed heads of Bill.</p><p> Action is needed on the introduction of comprehensive legislation to impose, first, mandatory health plans in schools, a requirement to stock EpiPens in schools, restaurants and other places that may have a first aid kit, and a requirement to train staff.  Most importantly, the scope of liability needs to be set out in any legislation so that individuals do not have to fear a claim for damages against them.</p><p> A policy combining all of the above would probably be one of a kind and if it were to be introduced, Ireland would lead the way in terms of accessibility to EpiPens.  I thank the committee for inviting us before it, in particular those members who have helped Ms Sloan, especially Deputy Gerry Adams, who first brought the situation to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I also thank the Minister for Health for suggesting that the regulations could be reviewed.  I commend Ms Sloan for her strength of character.  It takes a rare person to turn a very tragic situation into positive action and I applaud her for that.</p></speech>

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom mo mh&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas a ghabha&iacute;l leatsa as ucht an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agat ar an &aacute;bhar tabhachtach seo.</p><p>  I am Dr. Michael Byrne.  I am head of the student health department in University College Cork.  I am also co-co-ordinator of UCC Health Matters, an initiative that is seeking to make UCC a HSE-recognised health promoting university.  I was the founding medical director of UCC&rsquo;s first responder automatic external defibrillator, AED programme, that has overseen the provision of more than 40 automatic external defibrillators in multiple locations on and off campus in UCC.  I am a trained health care AED provider and have previously been an AED basic life support, BLS, instructor for both health care and lay personnel.  I am co-lead, along with Professor Hourihane, of UCC&rsquo;s anaphylaxis initiative.</p><p>  I am more than happy to defer to Professor Hourihane in terms of the research, science and the application of knowledge in the area of anaphylaxis, especially in the paediatric setting.  He is acknowledged as a world expert in the field of anaphylaxis, and Ireland, and in particular Cork and the Munster region, are indeed fortunate to have the services of an expert such as he.</p><p>  My passion, interest and concern in this area arises from my role as the medical practitioner on-site, responsible for protecting the health, welfare, well-being and safety of more than 18,000 students that are on campus daily.  As head of the student health department, I lead a team of health care professionals, endeavouring to anticipate and provide care for the full range of the usual presenting problems that occur in the primary care setting, for a population comparable to any large rural town.</p> <p>In addition, as a student health physician I am challenged with anticipating and providing for the unique health threats and risk-taking behaviours that are prominent in a third level setting and among students.  To date, we have had a number of notable successes, including in the area of alcohol related harm, with the successful implementation of the university alcohol action plan, which has been recognised nationally and internationally as an example of best practice.  A particular success in the area of life-threatening emergencies was the establishment of the first responder automatic external defibrillation, AED, programme on campus, with the recruitment and training of lay university personnel to act as first responders, along with the deployment of more than 40 AEDs.  Within one month of having AEDs on campus in UCC we had the great fortune to manage to save the life of a parent of an attendee at a conferring ceremony by means of successful defibrillation.</p><p> All of which is cited by way of illustrating that we believe in UCC that we have an established a track record of identifying real life-threatening risks and of implementing innovative and effective solutions to mitigate those risks.  It was in that context that I was delighted to be approached by Professor Hourihane to seek to establish a comparable first responder anaphylaxis autoinjector programme, which as he has indicated, we managed to design and implement in 2011.  It is with some dismay therefore that we continue to be unable to activate this innovative and life-saving pilot project for the want of appropriate legislative approval.</p><p> We contend that, given the in-house expertise, the established proven track record, and the unique high-risk practices that this anaphylaxis-prone age group display, there is no better setting in which to demonstrate proof of concept and to establish such a first responder anaphylaxis autoinjector pilot programme.  Thankfully, life-threatening anaphylaxis is rare.  We very rarely see cases of near-death anaphylaxis in the student health premises.  We have done so, however.  In my eight years as head of service in UCC, we have saved at least one life in danger of anaphylaxis in our emergency treatment room through the prompt administration of adrenaline.  We have had one episode of anaphylaxis on our premises in eight years.  Therein lies the problem, however, because there will be many more anaphylaxis episodes which will occur outwith our premises.  Anaphylaxis will occur when someone is not there but in the library, on the running track or in one of our multiple eating places on campus.  It will occur at night and at weekends.  It will occur when we are closed and not available.</p><p> Students are risk takers; it is in their DNA.  They see themselves as invincible and even those who know themselves to be at risk often will ignore the risk.  We anticipate that those who know they have anaphylaxis may not even carry their autoinjector on many occasions.  Few, if any, will step forward and admit to having an issue with food allergy or anaphylaxis, not wanting to stand out in any way.  In four years, despite regularly promoting and encouraging self-declaration at registration and orientation, not a single student came forward to tell me of an existing food allergy so that I could establish and compile a risk register.  This is a high-risk vulnerable population.  We believe we have the expertise in-house and the willingness to embrace the challenge.  We have an innovative, safe and effective means of reducing the risk, and we ask for the committee's support to make that happen.</p></speech>

I was a member of the 2012 to 2014 food allergy and anaphylaxis task force of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, EAACI, whose documents were published and launched at EAACI&rsquo;s annual congress in Copenhagen last week.  I submitted that in PDF form as part of my written evidence.  Other scientific documents were also included.  I am the co-chair of EAACI's food allergy and anaphylaxis meeting, the world&rsquo;s biggest food allergy meeting, which is scheduled for the National Convention Centre in Dublin in October.  The committee is invited to attend, if members so wish.  I am principal investigator on a prospective study of anaphylaxis, with Professor Ronan O&rsquo;Sullivan and Dr. Ioana Maris, funded by the National Children&rsquo;s Research Centre, Dublin.  I co-lead, with Dr Michael Byrne, the anaphylaxis initiative in UCC.  I am chairman of the Irish Food Allergy Network.  Until last week I was secretary of the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology, which receives unrestricted financial aid from industry, including contributions from manufacturers of autoinjectors.  I declare that as a relative conflict of interest.  However, the grant is unrestricted.  I am a board member of the Clemens von Pirquet Foundation, an independent charity affiliated to the professional association, EAACI, which promotes the scientific study of allergy in children.  I have received research funding and travel grants from other sources.  I recently visited Boston to investigate the possibility of bringing oral immunotherapy practices to Ireland.<br/>Anaphylaxis is a term coined by Clemens von Pirquet in the early 20th century to indicate the phenomenon of lack of protection.  Prophylaxis is protection and anaphylaxis is lack of protection.  Anaphylaxis could loosely be considered the opposite of prophylaxis.  The use of the term anaphylaxis is now broadly related to allergic reactions to allergens, which can be foods, which we are mainly talking about today, pollens - we are in the middle of hay fever season at the moment, house dust mites, which cause asthmatic attacks, and medicines, which are by far the commonest cause of anaphylaxis because they are administered to people by routes that are not natural such as injection and other means.  Anaphylaxis is a common problem within hospitals but we are probably more focused today on community reactions outside the hospital setting.  Recent European position statements and systematic reviews recognise how difficult it is to collect data because the disease is diffuse in its presentation and it is difficult for unfamiliar physicians, nurses, other health professionals, members of the public, parents and other carers to recognise it.  It is noteworthy that 20% of acute asthma deaths are probably anaphylactic in nature because the final common pathway in anaphylaxis can be wheezing and the person may be too unwell to say why the wheezing started.<br/>Anaphylaxis is likely to become more common because we are moving into a dynamic phase of management of food allergies where we are giving the foods people have been rigorously told to avoid.  In the oral immunotherapy programmes it is harder to have the treatment than the condition where one simply avoids the food rather than eating it.  Allergic reactions are becoming more common.  Iatrogenic anaphylaxis is going to become more common.  Immunotherapy will be moving from research protocols to more routine care in other parts of the world but, as usual, Europe, and in particular Ireland, will be behind the curve due to inherent caution and uncertainty.<br/>It appears that people at risk of anaphylaxis have a lack of protection against the outcome of the condition.  People are unaware of the condition.  The legislation is not in place to protect people who might be aware of it and families are uncertain as to who can help them.  The situation could be addressed with simple or complicated legislative measures that would be both innovative and widely welcomed by the public.<br/>While death from anaphylaxis is rare, the prospect of it is not.  Death is a grim part of daily life for families.  They feel they are being followed around by the Grim Reaper.  That is a sentiment I hear every week.  A more classical way to put it is that the sword of Damocles is hanging over their heads.  They feel that the Grim Reaper will take their child if they make the tiniest mistake with their food.  That is a hard way to live.  It inhibits families sharing their child's life with other carers and adults <i>in loco parentis </i>and limits their child's normal integration in social groups such as after-school clubs, sports clubs and social parties.  Those are all normal parts of life which are manageable allergy exposing situations if proportionate restrictions and precautions are in place.  The handing over of adrenaline autoinjectors from an experienced but anxious family to an inexperienced and unfamiliar family can be very stressful and can limit such interaction for families.<br/>In the United States, the Executive has enacted the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act.  However, it must be recognised that President Obama had a personal interest in the issue as one of his daughters is peanut allergic.  She has eaten food in Ireland, in Dalkey, and precautions must have been put in place for her in a way we do not think is worth putting in place for other children.  The intention of the Act is to indemnify and encourage schools to have generic adrenaline available to administer to people who do not have their own adrenaline kits, or more likely to people who are not already aware that they are allergic to a food such as Ms Moynihan found out in adulthood.</p> <p>There is no reason that this administrative effort could not take place in Ireland, which has far more limited or effectively no on-site school medical services.  Nurses are employed in schools in the UK and America but it is not common in the public school system in Ireland.  However, it must come with appropriate training packages and renewal mandates.  It is not something that can be stuck to the wall with masking tape.  We have to be familiar with the use of these devices in a way that allows us to be confident in using them in a situation where everything else has gone wrong.  It is not sufficient to just put these kits into restaurants and catering outlets without the backup of training and support from public health authorities and allergy services. <br/>We have far fewer allergists than America or European countries.  Finland, with approximately the same population as Ireland, has 100 paediatric allergists.  It is also difficult to access to allergy services in Ireland.  The paediatric allergy clinic in Cork University Hospital is the largest in the country and I personally receive twice as many referrals per week as all the other services in the hospitals, each of which are resourced with two consultants.  I am a 0.5 position because I am an academic and I receive twice as many referrals, which <i>pro rata</i>equates to four times as many referrals.  My service&rsquo;s wait times are all in breach of HSE guidelines and I have no idea how to fix that.  Waiting times for the allergy clinic in Cork are at least one year for routine appointments and three years for diagnostic food challenges.  These obstacles to accessing treatment suggest that the need for empowering patients and other partners in the social contract with families may be even more critical in Ireland than elsewhere.<br/>If a person who carries prescribed adrenaline needs assistance in using his or her medicine, this assistance is covered by Good Samaritan provisions in legislation.  The administration of unprescribed medication by health professionals is also covered by existing legislation.  The gap in Irish legislation relates to the administration by non-medical staff of adrenaline to people for whom adrenaline is not specifically prescribed.  This problem was solved in the United States and there is no reason that the Oireachtas cannot do the same.  A pilot study proposed by UCC in 2009 and 2010 engaged in extensive training and recruitment of first responders for a programme of campus wide allergy stations beside existing defibrillators.  The photograph I have circulated to members shows a locked black box beside a defibrillator.  It is not the case that somebody can insert a &euro;2 coin into this box to open it or that it is easily accessible.  A first responder would have to be asked to access the box.  The programme was voluntarily suspended in February 2011 in the context of confusion about over the counter administration of oral contraceptives by pharmacists.  As it became apparent that the legislation under which we presumed protection would be available was unclear, we decided we could not take that responsibility.  Since 2011, when we voluntarily suspended our programme, we have sought advice and guidance from regulatory authorities.  We received no assistance sequentially from the Irish Medicines Board or the Chief Pharmacist&rsquo;s Office prior to January 2013, when a Deputy facilitated a meeting with the Secretary General.  Unfortunately, no material progress has occurred since then, despite multiple inquiries. <br/>Since the death of Emma Sloan by anaphylaxis in Dublin in December 2013, our study in Cork has received details of 36 more cases of survived anaphylaxis in Irish children.  The regional variance in reporting reflects the uneven medical awareness of the condition.  More cases are inevitable and another avoidable death is also inevitable.  Continuing legislative inaction could expose the State, its ill-equipped schools and its health care providers to liability in such an event.<br/>If Emma Sloan had been born Emma Obama, we would not be having this discussion because she might be alive and well in the United States.  The wider, regulated availability of adrenaline in the community and easier access to more clinicians who understand anaphylaxis are achievable, affordable and uncontroversial public health care innovations that meet several of the Government&rsquo;s aims to improve patient autonomy and self-care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-24a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat O'Mahony" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014062400006#G00200"><p>I am saddened by the evidence presented by Ms Sloan, whom I have not met previously.  I offer my sympathy to her and her family on their avoidable tragedy.  We have prepared an introductory statement based on the committee's request to us to appear before it.  I would also be happy to respond to any questions or additional comments.  Many of the issues raised are unfortunately outside of the capacity of the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, to address because they pertain to policies of the Department of Health and other agencies.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Lorraine Nolan, director of human products authorisation and registration, and Mr. John Lynch, director of compliance.</p><p>  The IMB, which is shortly to be renamed as the Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is the competent authority in Ireland for health product regulation.  The mission of the IMB is to protect and enhance public and animal health through the regulation of medicines, medical devices and other health products.  In the context of human medicines, one of the IMB&rsquo;s key areas of responsibility includes the approval of medicines prior to their being placed on the market.  Before a new medicine can be placed on the Irish market, it must be assessed and authorised by the IMB or by the European Medicines Agency.  The assessment involves establishing that a medicine&rsquo;s public health benefits outweigh its known risks based on an evaluation of the scientific data on the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.  Where the benefit to risk ratio is considered positive, the product may be granted a marketing authorisation.</p><p>  Adrenaline is a hormone which occurs naturally in the body but is also available as a medicine indicated in the emergency treatment of severe acute allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis.  A number of medicines containing adrenaline are authorised for use in Ireland.  Adrenaline products can be administered intravenously, IV, intramuscularly, IM, or subcutaneously, SC.  IV administration must be performed by a health care professional.</p><p>  Adrenaline auto-injectors, AAIs, consist of an adrenaline solution in a pre-filled delivery system designed for self-administration by the IM route.  AAIs are used for the treatment of anaphylaxis, which is a severe and life threatening systemic allergic reaction.  Such an allergic reaction can be rapid in onset, very severe in nature and can affect persons of all ages.  Adrenaline administered by the IM route acts more quickly than when given by SC injection.  This is an important consideration because rapid action of adrenaline is critical in reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis.  The exact incidence of anaphylaxis is not known but it is estimated that under 2% of the population per year experience anaphylaxis.  Anaphylaxis can occur if someone who is allergic to a particular trigger, such as a food, insect bites and stings or a medicine, comes in contact with that trigger.  Contact with the trigger results in substances such as histamine being released from certain blood cells in the body, thereby causing a clinical reaction which may involve many organs in the body, including the respiratory system, heart and kidneys.</p><p>  In Ireland, three different AAI product ranges are currently authorised, namely, Anapen, Epipen and Jext.  Each product range includes two different strengths, for adult and paediatric treatment, respectively.  These products are all authorised under European procedures, which result in authorisations in many EU member states.</p><p>  Anapen and Anapen Junior were the first auto-injector products to be authorised for the Irish market in 2003.  In the past three years the range of adrenaline products available has been extended through the introduction of the two new ranges.  Jext was authorised in 2011 and placed on to the Irish market in 2013.  Epipen and Epipen Junior product was originally authorised in Ireland until mid-2010, at which time the authorisation was withdrawn by the then marketing authorisation holder for commercial reasons.  In 2012, the product was relaunched in Ireland via an application through the European procedure and it finally came to market in 2014.  </p><p>  Adrenaline auto-injectors are automatic injectors that have been designed and developed for use by lay people for immediate self-treatment of anaphylaxis in an emergency situation, prior to seeking further appropriate medical treatment.</p> <p>The difference and advantage of the adrenaline auto-injector products versus other adrenaline products, such as other pre-filled syringe systems or standard injectable forms, is that the intervention of a health care professional is not required for administration of the product.</p><p> Given the nature of the auto-injector, the product information and patient information leaflets contain detailed instructions on how to use the product.  These include both written and pictorial descriptions for an emergency situation covering how to prepare the product for use and how to administer the product.  They also highlight the need to seek immediate medical assistance.</p><p> In the 11 years since Anapen has been authorised there have been a number of updates to the product to improve its design and functionality.  These include the incorporation of a variety of safety features to ensure safe administration of the product including accuracy of dosing, avoidance of needle stick injuries and inadvertent firing of the device.  Another important update that was made related to the required storage conditions, which means that the product can now be stored at room temperature rather than in a refrigerator as originally required.  This allows patients with allergies to carry the product with them at all times.  While there are some variations in design between the available auto-injectors, the Jext and EpiPen ranges have similar design characteristics.</p><p> AAIs are supplied in packs containing two auto-injectors.  One reason for this is the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis which can affect approximately 20% of patients who suffer an allergic reaction.  Biphasic anaphylaxis is defined as the recurrence of symptoms in a patient without continued exposure to the allergen.  The approved product information states that, in the absence of clinical improvement or if deterioration occurs, a second injection may be administered within a defined timeframe - ranging from five to 15 minutes - after the first injection.  Therefore, it is important for patients to carry two AAIs in case a second injection is needed.</p><p> Notwithstanding the above developments in these products, AAIs are complex systems due both to the characteristics of the adrenaline active substance and of the delivery device, which is designed to be as patient-friendly as possible.  The manufacture of these products is also complex.</p><p> I will now comment briefly on the current prescription status.  Under the EU Medicines Directive and Irish law, products for injection must be supplied on prescription only.  Accordingly, the marketing authorisations for these products stipulate that they are prescription only. </p><p> In addition to this legal requirement, there are safety concerns in relation to the possible incorrect use of adrenaline.  These include the misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis and the potential adverse implications of incorrect or inappropriate administration of adrenaline, such as administration to patients with a history of - or underlying - cardiac arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease including angina and hypertension, where incorrect administration could result in an exacerbation of these conditions or significantly worsen health care outcomes.  The fact that these are prescription medicines - and will be because that is what is required - does not mean that they cannot be provided in the kind of settings as described by earlier contributors.</p><p> I will now mention ongoing regulatory procedures.  With the Chairman's agreement, that particular commentary is not especially relevant to the discussion, nor is the latter part of my presentation concerning shelf-life.  Suffice it to say that shelf-life is an important issue, which feeds into any decisions that might be made about future availability.</p><p> I do have a brief comment on shelf-life.  Adrenaline is a relatively unstable substance which readily degrades.  This degradation is due to the chemical nature of the substance and is accelerated by factors such as exposure to light and oxygen, and pH changes.  The manufacturers of all the authorised products have taken a number of steps to minimise the degradation of adrenaline and prolong the shelf-life, including protection from light and oxygen, the inclusion of an antioxidant in the formulations, and control of the pH.</p><p> While there are some minor variations in the shelf-life of the authorised products, the shelf-life of AAIs ranges from 18 months to two years.  It is important that these products are not used after the shelf-life has expired.  After this time the efficacy of the product can be reduced which may result in the product not working as required in an emergency situation.</p><p> If the Chairman agrees, I can stop there.</p></speech>

I also wish to thank Ms Nolan for being here, as well as Mr. Lynch.  For the information of the meeting, we requested the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to make a presentation.  As members are aware, the PSI wrote in reply to say it would not be in a position to attend as it is currently undertaking a statutory investigative process.  The PSI said it would welcome an opportunity to discuss this important topic, including the pharmacist's role in the safe provision of medicines in an emergency.  The society has asked the joint committee to facilitate this at a later date following the completion of the current ongoing statutory process.  That letter was sent to the committee by the PSI.</p><p>  I apologise to members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery because there may be votes during the course of this meeting on the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill in the D&aacute;il.

I particularly want to welcome Ms Caroline Sloan and offer my sympathy on the loss of her daughter.  I commend her on her campaign and thank her for telling us about the campaign to date.</p><p>  The campaign is calling for better information for people with allergies.  The issues that have been raised a very down to earth and normal for most people.  I agree that there should be an EpiPen in every first-aid box and with trained first responders.  I also agree that they should be readily available in schools, cr&egrave;ches and restaurants.  People can cater for diabetics and are also trained to use defibrillators, so why not EpiPens?</p><p>  I wish to ask Ms Sloan about training and supports.  What type of awareness campaigns should be run on EpiPens?  I am asking questions today on my own behalf and that of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who has had to attend the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I wish to raise a few additional questions.  Is it the witnesses' understanding that the State can introduce legislation to provide EpiPens to the public without the prior blessing of the EU Commission?  Would this be in line with how we apply defibrillators?</p><p>  Why does Ireland have fewer allergists than in the US or other EU countries?  I read with concern the witnesses' comments that access to allergy services is in breach of HSE guidelines.  This is alarming.  Is there anything the HSE can do immediately without new legislation being introduced?  </p><p>  I read with interest that the campaign group established a first responder anaphylaxis auto-injector programme in 2010, but this is now dormant.  Can Ms Sloan explain where the problem lies?  Does she believe that the pilot programme can be expanded despite the lack of legislation, or is legislation required?</p><p>  Are there any circumstances where a lay person should be allowed to use an injector?  Is this just because we in Ireland do not have laws to cover this practice?  Does it happen in other EU countries?</p><p>  What implication will the current EU review have on the provision of injectors in Ireland?  If the review calls for a change in regulations governing the supply of injectors, how long will it take to legislate for it in Ireland?</p></speech>

In preparing for today's meeting, I thought of my experience in voluntary organisations such as the girl guides.  That is when I had the experience of using an EpiPen.  At the beginning of the meeting, our examination of the relevant legislation was mentioned along with civil liability issues.  Having had to use an EpiPen, I realise that one must know how to use it correctly.</p> <p>I refer to that judgment call to use or not to use an EpiPen.  Are there negative effects of misusing one?</p><p> There is a significant issue with young people and allergies.  Over the 20 years I have been bringing groups of young girls away, the range of allergies has been increasing.  One can try to ensure the environment is clear of nuts, jelly and so on, but when young people are away, they will have midnight feasts, occasions on which I have had to use a pen.</p><p> We have been focusing on schools, and Deputy McLellan mentioned cr&egrave;ches, but for me it is more about remote locations.  How do we ensure preparedness and provide appropriate training so that people know the symptoms of allergies?  It is so quick and so apparent when it happens but, unfortunately, it can be too late to know that they are the symptoms.</p><p> Some young people are great while others are not so good.  I am trying to work out how we can best respond.  My fear of the box on the wall is that the person with the key will not be around and that one will be looking at this box, knowing it should be used.  As legislators, how can we work to find a practical solution so it can made available appropriately?  That is what I am trying to work through but I have not heard about the negative effects or misuse.  Does somebody just get an adrenaline boost or are there other potential effects?  I would be interested in exploring those issues.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Sloan for sharing her experience with us at what, I am sure, is a really difficult time for her, her family and her daughter's friends and her school friends.  Something which struck me, as a mother, was that Ms Sloan said she did not know Emma's allergy was fatal.  I would like to ask the two physicians present about the screening process in terms of nut allergies among children.  We all know that when babies are born, they are screened with the heel prick test, and the blood test done to see if a particular condition is present.  How can we inform ourselves, as parents, of the kind of risk?  Are particular groups more at risk than others?  A comment was made about hay fever and how it is rampant at the moment.  Are people with asthma and hay fever sufferers more likely to be allergic to nuts or shellfish?  Is there something we can do in terms of screening when children present to public health nurses for their routine checks?</p><p>  If a child, a young person or an adult is diagnosed as having a nut allergy, how is it explained to his or her parents or to him or her?  Does he or she actually know what it means?  I have a young daughter who goes away with various groups.  They all give out that they cannot have Nutella but one of the children has a nut allergy.  They are aware of it but I am not sure everybody would be.  How is it explained to the parents or to the young person?  Are they aware of how sudden the onset can be and how to react to it?  I refer to the bracelets people wear, or do not wear.  How common is it for people who have a diagnosis not to wear the bracelet?  That is significant also.</p><p>  A comment was made about the legislation, the pilot project run in UCC and the distribution of the morning after pill by pharmacists, that this would be covered in the same way, that a prescription could be written and that the public could access it.  Will the witnesses talk a little bit more about that?</p></speech>

I once saw a 16 year old girl die from an anaphylactic reaction in the hospital setting and it was one of the most horrific things I ever saw and it has stayed with me forever.  A huge effort to prevent even one death like this is worthwhile.  We are talking about the prevention of rare tragedies.  All the time, as a society, we agonise over and debate the prevention of other rare tragedies but we should just fix this one.</p><p>  I would be delighted if Professor Hourihane could help me on this but I was doing a bit of arithmetic from figures from the United States and I am guessing that we probably have between one and three food allergy deaths per annum in Ireland if we can extrapolate that from data that have been presented in the US.  I do not know if it is correct.</p></speech>

They are rare deaths but they are only the documented ones.  It is certain there are more deaths.</p></speech>

That is pretty helpful.  We have had years of no maternal deaths in Ireland, which was wonderful.  It is not the way it is now but it was that way for a while.  We put a huge effort into ensuring there were no maternal deaths.  Rarity should not be an argument for not doing something.  This is an event for which there should be zero tolerance.  We should have no deaths whatsoever.</p><p>  I compliment Dr. Byrne and Professor Hourihane on their presentations.  I rarely say this but Professor Hourihane made me proud to be a doctor.  He made a really good presentation.  It was unsentimental, pointed, focused, committed and passionate and I am delighted he had the courage to highlight the deficiencies because it is a microcosm of a lot of problems which happen in our public health service.  We have huge deficiencies.  No member of this committee should have been surprised to hear him say we are off the bottom of the league table for numbers of allergists per head of population because I have repeatedly told members we are off the bottom of the league table in every specialty one cares to mention.  Whether general practice specialties or hospital-based specialties, we are hanging off the bottom of the league table.  We should also not be too surprised at his totally appropriate, unveiled and unadorned critique of the sloth with which the bureaucracy reacts to problems like this.  Those of us who have tried to effect different degrees of reform will be aware of it.</p><p>  This is really simple.  We could have legislation drawn up very quickly which would address the key elements of what is required which is to put mandates in place whereby places which either profit from, or take responsibility for, the presence of people who are eating would make appropriate provision for their safety in terms of dealing with food allergies should they arise and that there would be an elimination of legal liabilities for people who, in good faith, would make the kind of emergency decision which would have saved Ms Sloan's daughter but who are prevented from doing so because of fear.</p><p>  We need to address, in this context and in so many other contexts, the callous attitude our system has put in place in terms of under-providing, whether dermatologists in the south east, which has the highest incidence of melanoma in the country but where there are no dermatologists, whether children waiting for two years for hearing tests-----</p></speech>

We were all shocked to learn of the passing of her daughter, Emma, at Christmas.  The witnesses have given us an insight into the tragic circumstances that can cause people to pass away in a short time.</p><p>  I was struck by the use of the phrases "common sense" and "good faith".  Politicians are sometimes thought not to have any common sense.  I have had the privilege of being a member of a committee that shows an abundance of common sense.  If I was walking down a street and saw someone experiencing breathing difficulties, it would be common sense to run to the person and provide, in good faith, as much help as possible.  Whatever took place on the day Emma died was done on the basis of common sense and in good faith.  No one present can comprehend the events that occurred in Dublin city centre that day.</p><p>  I  give a commitment that the joint committee will do everything in its power to ensure the wishes expressed by Ms Sloan are fulfilled.  We must meet the Minister to discuss the implications of this tragedy and ensure no other child or adult is left in the position in which Ms Sloan and her daughter were left on the day in question.  I express my sincere thanks to Ms Sloan for speaking so openly and with such love and affection for her daughter.  I ask the Chairman to make arrangements to meet the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, with a view to having legislation introduced as soon as possible on this matter.  </p></speech>

I thank her and member of her family for showing such bravery in appearing before the committee to explain to members the current position in respect of the EpiPen and treatment.  I also thank our other witnesses.</p><p>  The clinicians who spoke painted a picture for us when they noted that the condition is treatable and the events that occurred were avoidable.  </p> <p>That is the tragedy of the situation we are currently facing.  We must, as a matter of emergency, put in place structures, procedures and resources to ensure that what happened to Ms Sloan and her family does not happen to any other family.  This is very a straightforward, black and white issue and there is no confusion as to what needs to be done.  It is about putting the procedures in place to ensure these devices are included in every first aid box in every pharmacy, voluntary organisation, workplace, restaurant and so on in the country.  Every member of this committee wants to see that happen sooner rather than later.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that we should take this issue directly to the Minister to ensure the structures and procedures are put in place without further delay to prevent any further tragedies.  We are told here and elsewhere on a regular basis about the lack of resources we are facing, but this issue must be a priority.</p><p> I conclude by extending my sympathies once again to Ms Sloan and assuring her that we will pressurise the Minister and the Department to put in place the procedures necessary to prevent the same tragedy befalling another family.</p></speech>

I have known Ms Sloan since before Emma's tragic death and saw what she went through in waking and subsequently burying her daughter.  It would be remiss of me not to attend this meeting given that I know the family intimately.  They have received massive support not just from relatives and neighbours, but also from community organisations such as the Bosco youth centre in Drimnagh, of which Emma was a member and which played a very important role in her life.  The board of management of the centre and the participants in the various courses that are run there have been an endless support to the family.  I renewed contact with some of these people only last week when the Drimnagh festival was in full swing.</p><p>  Although it is difficult to relive the horrors of the past, they allow us to understand the terrible tragedy that is the death of somebody in such shocking circumstances.  I listened with particular interest to what Ms Moynihan had to say.  It is clear that she has done a great deal of legal preparation; in fact, she has practically written the Bill.  I am biased in favour of Cork because my daughter opted to go to university there.  Regardless of what is happening in Trinity College, UCD, DIT, DCU or elsewhere, I congratulate to Ms Moynihan and her colleague on doing such a wonderful job in Cork.</p><p>  Unlike Senator Crown, I am not convinced that dealing with this issue will be as easy as bringing in the legislation. We have heard about what is being done in various countries, including the United States and Canada.  The medical professionals have emphasised that we need a policy in this area.  Before today I did not realise the extent of the legislative changes that are required and I do not fully understand what happened in the context of the provision of the morning after pill.  Nevertheless, we now know what is required and the ball is in the committee's court.  I wish members well in the lobbying they will have to do with a view to bringing forward legislation which will guarantee that no family will ever again have to go through the trauma the Sloans went through in their bereavement.</p></speech>

In fact, any training that would be required would relate to the ability to  recognise the signs of anaphylactic shock.  A Sinn F&eacute;in representative to whom I have spoken told me that in the United States mobile telephone apps are available explaining what anaphylactic shock is and how to recognise it.  Information packs are sent to schools containing a USB device from which information can be downloaded and made available to every class.  There really is no requirement for intensive one-on-one training.  From what we have seen, the materials provided are very simple and easy to use, focusing on educating people to recognise the signs.  In addition, if ID bracelets and cards were in use, anybody would know from looking at them what is happening to the person concerned and that the epinephrine pen should be administered.</p><p>  One of the members asked whether there are any side effects if a pen is administered to somebody who is not actually in anaphylactic shock.  There are no such effects as far as I am aware, but Professor Hourihane might confirm that.</p></speech>

The side effects can be dealt with after the benefits have accrued.  In young children, such as Emma or those even younger, there has never been a recorded case of somebody who has been unnecessarily administered adrenaline coming to harm.</p></speech>

I carry one around with me and know how to use it.  As members will see, if Professor Hourihane gives us a demonstration later, it is very easy to use.  Moreover, a bystander who used it on somebody on the street would be protected by the Good Samaritan provision contained in section 51D of the Civil Liability Act (Amendment) 1996, as inserted by section 4 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  Subsection 51D(1) states:<blockquote><br />A good samaritan shall not be personally liable in negligence for any act done in an emergency when providing&mdash;(<i>a</i>) assistance, advice or care to a person who is&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in serious and imminent danger, or apparently in serious and imminent danger, of being injured or further injured,<br />(ii) injured or apparently injured, or (iii) suffering, or apparently suffering, from an illness,</blockquote></blockquote>Subsection 51D(2) states: &quot;The protection from personal liability conferred on a Good Samaritan by subsection (1) applies even if the emergency is caused by an act of the Good Samaritan.&quot;  The only exception to this protection is &quot;any act done by the Good Samaritan in bad faith or with gross negligence&quot;.  In the case of certain categories of persons, such as teachers, a higher standard of care applies under the legislation because teachers, to use that example, have a duty of care to protect pupils from risk of injury.  The only way to minimise that is to provide mandatory guidelines and set out the scope of liability.<br/>The Deputy also asked about permission from the European Council or Commission.  We already have a regulation that allows us to regulate for exceptions, namely, regulation 8 of the pharmacy regulations.</p> <p>I do not see why this cannot be extended if legislated for properly.  As long as each policy is dealt with clearly and comprehensively and the exceptions are set out in legislation, I do not see why we would need permission.</p><p> I refer to the comments of Deputies Healy and Byrne.  I agree with Deputy Healy that change should be sooner rather than later.  Following a comment that Deputy Byrne made on having already drafted the legislation, I would be willing to draft any heads of a Bill.  I volunteer to offer my services to any Deputy who wishes to really make a change to this law.  Deputy Byrne said we needed a policy and this is what I was referring to later.  Policies can only be dealt with by primary legislation and that is why amending the regulations would not be sufficient.</p></speech>

In establishing the programme in University College Cork, we developed a working group comprising Professor Hourihane, myself, an expert from the school of pharmacy and other stakeholders.  We sought legal opinion from our office of corporate legal affairs and entered into correspondence with the Department of Health to give the two medical directors comfort around what would be a very new development, the provision of a prescription-only medicine by a layperson to a person for whom it had not been prescribed, albeit in what would be a Good Samaritan situation.<br/>Until the point of going live with it we were getting what was at best neutral support and might even have been interpreted as less than neutral.  The eve of going live coincided with the occasion when the morning-after pill was suddenly to become dispensable by pharmacists.  If members recall the events around that incident, other vested interests expressed considerable concern that pharmacists could suddenly dispense the morning-after pill and objections were made nationally around that.  That gave us both cause for concern that if a health care professional, for whom there was an obvious indication for a drug that they had under their control, was going to be prevented from dispensing something that was necessary, we were unlikely to get support if a first responder under our direction gave adrenaline to a person for whom it had not previously been prescribed.  In view of this we voluntarily suspended and then entered a three-year period of correspondence with committees and the Department of Health.  We have not managed to get a clear instruction as to what our personal liability would be or whether we could continue with the programme.  That is why we suspended it and why it remains in abeyance.  In essence we were looking for comfort that a prescription-only medicine could be administered under a controlled programme.  This is on a pilot basis with a world expert and a community that has a proven track record of delivering in this type of situation that a prescription-only medicine could be administered by a layperson to someone <i>in extremis</i>.  We have already heard it is a medication which in essence can do no harm in the vast majority of cases.<br/>That is the context in which we suspended.  These are particular university-setting high-risk vulnerable people who will not come forward and admit they have an allergy.  We think we have the perfect environment to test run.  We would be ready to go in the morning if we could get the comfort we need.</p></speech>

In essence we would be the first in Ireland and we would probably be the first in the world to deliver this.  There is a precedent in the UK for non-health care professionals to give adrenaline in some primary care trusts on a patient-group-directive basis, which does not exist in Ireland.  However, other universities are not in a position to make provision.  We thought we would demonstrate proof of concept because we have the world expert and we have someone who is keen to ensure this happens.</p></speech>

There are those who are known to have an anaphylaxis or an allergy and those who are unknown, and we need to be able to cater for both.  Anaphylaxis, as a word, is in common coinage among all our students, just as is a proper approach to alcohol.  They will recognise that they are at risk and be willing to come forward.  However, it is a multipronged approach because we have to acknowledge that even if we do the best and raise the profile of the risks around anaphylaxis they still will not do so.  So we need to make provision for that and make provision for the presence of these adrenaline pens in restaurants, on campus and beside the running track, and we need the first responders to be in place.</p></speech>

Deputy McLellan or Senator van Turnhout asked how we would cope if we made provision for adrenaline in remote areas.  It is a definite challenge.  Let us make it available in the high-risk areas first and demonstrate proof of concept, and we can then address the need in remote areas.  If we can make it available in a place where we know there is a high risk, we should do so.  The university community has been very positive about this initiative.  Volunteers have come from among staff members who have anaphylaxis or children with anaphylaxis and even staff members who are concerned for the welfare of not just students but visitors and staff on site.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman for his efforts in ensuring the issue was brought to this committee.  Very few life-threatening situations can be treated as easily as this.  Cardiac arrest and anaphylaxis are perhaps the only two things that are so eminently treatable with simple, available technology.  People would have had the same debates before AEDs were made available in the community.  AEDs are now in every sports hall in the country.  They were often in sports halls before they were in GPs surgeries because the community knew that was where the risk was.  We need to embrace this and do something about it.</p></speech>

As a paediatrician, I recognise that children are a neglected strata in the country - they have only just had their constitutional rights recognised.  It is my contention that if Emma Sloan had been an adult female, we would already have the legislation because this committee drove through the hearings on pregnancy, etc., last year after the death of Savita Halappanavar.  Children's deaths in this country have not counted for many years, in Tuam and elsewhere.  The fact that this was a child means that we are still here so long afterwards.  That is my personal view as a paediatrician.</p><p>  Many of the questions committee members have asked relate to my expertise and I will start there.  I will not talk about the EU legislation or reviews, etc.  Why are there fewer allergists than in other countries?  I have no idea.  I do not think the HSE had any idea that it had an allergist until I arrived into an academic post in University College Cork on the basis of my research expertise.  It was terrified as to what it would mean for its hospital to have an allergist in it.  It means that they do fewer tests, patients turn around faster and have less restrictive diets.  So it is cost effective.  It may take the money-following-the-patient programme, which is at least part of the discussion, for the HSE to realise that an allergy clinic is low cost, high volume, highly effective and the money flows in for that service.  That is how allergy services in the United Kingdom have flourished from a similarly low base.  I gave evidence to the British House of Lords in 2007 and on the basis of those hearings the mandate was given to the NHS that each region needed to have two adult allergists and two paediatric allergists with full support teams around them.</p> <p>We would probably need four or eight for the whole country and that would be fine.</p><p> I was asked how we could put this in place without legislation.  I understand the HSE sends out mandates to do this or that all the time and causes major panic about trolleys or breast cancer or whatever it may be.  I am not trivialising any other area and I know we cannot compete with trolleys or breast cancer and I am not asking that we should, but it would be possible for the HSE to require each hospital that has an emergency department to have the capacity for some physician in that hospital to be responsible for the after-emergency care and the community integration of the care for the people in their region.  If they have children and adults in their emergency departments they should have a paediatrician and an adult physician available to them.  The most common cause of anaphylaxis is medical equipment, biological agents for cancer and anaesthetics.  The anaesthetist looks after those in a crisis but then these people drop off the radar again.  It should be mandatory for the HSE to deliver on this but it would probably not be cost neutral.  </p><p> In response to the question on the circumstances for lay use, there is no situation in which one should not do it.  We have discussed that.  I was asked about the negative effects.  There are no negative effects and as we say to families when they come and see us, the kits are so easy to use that a man could do it.  </p><p> It is usually the mothers who come and we insist that the fathers come to us for the training so that they are not getting badgered to do what the mother was taught by us.  There is an expert disparity between the parents and it is always the mother who is the expert.  That is nature and nurture and we would like everybody to be able to use these in a way that is understandable.</p></speech>

Everybody can afford 15 minutes to save their child's life.</p><p>  We train lay members of the community but just because they have been trained by me does not make them a health profession.  We are relying on those people to deliver the training to teachers, scout groups and guide leaders and soccer coaches.  That is a HSE responsibility which has not been taken up by it.</p></speech>

Simply because the HSE has not said that it is, does not mean that it is not.</p><p>  A very interesting question is how we screen for nut allergy.  I do not know how one screens for nut allergy.  We know that 80% of children with nut allergy have eczema and we know that 95% of children with peanut allergy have other forms of allergic disease.  One might be able to find just the allergic children and test them for it.  The problem we have with that, Chairman and members, is that the positive tests are less useful than the negative test.  A negative test for a peanut allergy is very likely to be true that one is not allergic to it, so 95% likely and we send people home with a negative testing.  The problem is that if one has a positive test it is only 50% likely that one is allergic.  It is less useful as a positive test.  There is an issue of sensitivity and specificity of the medical test so it is not amenable to screening because it does not work as well with either result.  It is conclusive if it is negative but it is inconclusive if it is positive in the absence of a history of reactivity.  If somebody has had a reaction, the likelihood of it being a true result goes up.  If I tested everybody in a male hurling changing room with pregnancy tests and found a positive, it is likely the test is wrong.  If I did it in a camogie changing room, that poor girl is pregnant.  The likelihood of it being there affects how the test works.  We use these examples when we explain our test to parents so it takes only a few minutes.  However, that is what we say to them.</p><p>  I do not know how much they hear.  Do they need to hear it again?  Are there other resources that we could use?  There is the Inernet, there are apps, even a talking pen that gives one instructions like the defibrillators do.  We give them what we think they need but that might not be what individual families need and we might need to rehearse it and deliver it in other formats.  Bracelets are a very good idea.  It is not a new idea as they are already available for those with diabetes, sarcoidosis and long-term illnesses that cause the sufferer to seek emergency care.  We advise families to have them.  The take-up is very low.  We want the teenagers to wear them but they do not want to wear a medical bracelet, they want to have a tattoo or earrings.  I am not saying that we should allergy earrings or allergy tattoos.  I have, however, seen people in the United States with allergy tattoos so that when they are unconscious it is available.  As Senator Crown said these are rare tragedies.  I have made the comparison with maternal deaths and the national response to those cases.  I think it could be made mandatory for the providers of food who are making profit from food that they make their restaurant a safe place to eat.  The mandate for training cannot come from restaurateurs, it has to come from health authorities.  I would be very keen to see even a temporary elimination of liability so that we can perform our pilot before we go to the wider availability.  If it does not work, we should not do it.</p></speech>

It is a very important part of the overall solution.  There were two specific questions addressed to our side, the first referred to the current EU review for these categories of products.  Let me clarify that the review relates to the design of the products and the information that is provided to patients.  It does not cover the prescription status and that is determined at national level so it will have no bearing on that issue.  The second question relates to the legal basis that can be provided to make any changes that might be foreseen.  There were comments on a comprehensive Bill, which would clearly provide for that.  We also believe there are precedents existing under the prescription control and supply regulations which currently allow first responders to use prescription medicines.  We think this provision could be explored as an option.  The question of whether we could do it without EU Commission approval and the answer is yes it can be done locally at national level.</p></speech>

As a committee we now have a great deal of information to reflect on.  Arising from today's meeting the legislative process is not as simple as some might say but there is the political will to deal with it.  This committee has demonstrated that we do have the political will to deal with this issue.  We need to take up the issue with the Department of Health and as Mr. O'Mahony said, it is a policy issue for the Department of Health and that we would also talk to the Minister and the Secretary General at the Department of Health and have a follow-up meeting on this issue with them.  We should discuss with the HSE the issue of the mandate.  We should communicate with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland regarding its investigations on the outcome, the timeline and when it ought to be concluded.<br/>The purpose of our meeting today is to effect change in the area and to bring in much-needed change, which we in this room accept has to happen.  We will certainly raise the issue at our quarterly meeting with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We will put this topic on the agenda for our next full meeting with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We are committed to bringing about change on this issue.  <br/>On behalf of all members I express our thanks to Ms Caroline Sloan for coming to this meeting and extend our deepest sympathy to her on the tragic death of her beautiful young daughter.  We were glad that Ms Sloan had the photograph of her daughter to put in front of us to keep her in our minds as we continue to work for change.  We know that sympathy is not enough and that is the reason why, as part of our meeting today, we invited Ms Sloan to attend.<br/>I thank Ms Yvonne Moynihan, Dr. Michael Byrne, Professor Hourihane and Mr. O'Mahony and the members of the Irish Medicines for being present today.  I hope this meeting will continue to raise and promote awareness, not just in the committee room but beyond it.  I hope that any young person who is watching and listening to us today reads the transcripts of the proceedings.  It is important that we promulgate the matter and that people do not hide their situation in any shape or form.<br/>I thank Professor Jonathan Hourihane and Dr. Michael Byrne whom I have met on many occasions and I hope we will see change<b>.  </b>As Senator Crown said, it is a cumbersome slow and bureaucratic process but we will persevere and at the end of the day we will bring about change sooner rather than later. <br/>Finally, before I draw the meeting to a close, I thank all the members in the Visitors Gallery for their presence.</p></speech>
