I wish to draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17 (2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  By way of background information, the Sub-Committee on Fisheries was established to focus on the fishing community's socioeconomic situation, with a view to promoting sustainable industries.  The main areas for attention identified by the committee are aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries - specifically sea-angling - and tourism.  I welcome the witnesses and point out to members that this will probably be our last hearing before we start to draft our report.  I invite Mr. O'Corcora to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid anseo ar son na mb&aacute;d beag faoi deich m&eacute;adar le cead&uacute;nas ilfhi&uacute;sach l&aacute;n.  Is tionscal an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo don phobal cois farraige agus do phobal na Gaeltachta.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make a presentation here and put forward our views.  This industry is very important to the Gaeltacht and coastal communities, particularly along the west coast.  We are the forgotten people of Ireland and we feel our industry has been a scapegoat over the years and forgotten about.  The situation is getting worse and we are hopeful that something can be done about it.</p><p>  We have several aims and objectives, the first of which is to maintain a sustainable future for the commercial, inshore under ten metres sector.  In order to do this, we need access to all of the stocks.  We have been banned from fishing many stocks, which puts pressure on the shellfish.  There is a need for very aggressive conservation and rejuvenation programmes in certain areas.  For example, there is a conservation programme in place with the V-notching of lobsters, but we feel there is a far better way of conserving these stocks by allowing the females to breed in hatcheries and putting the juvenile fish out to sea, back to their natural habitat.  Tests are being done on this at the moment and the breeding success rate is up to 20% better than with V-notching.  We believe this method should be used for both lobsters and crayfish.</p><p>  We need an industry-led cohesive management plan to ensure sustainable supplies.  In that context, we are calling for the setting up of a central fisheries management board, with five fishermen from this sector on that board.  Proper marketing is another key issue because at the moment, the lobster and shellfish market is at an all-time low.  The European market is not the place to be going with much of the catch.  There is a large amount of lobster being imported from outside the EU which is affecting the price.  There are many other markets to be exploited.  Lobsters can be dry-packed now and sent on within a few hours of being caught.  The development of markets outside of Europe is vital but cannot happen unless a proper management structure is put in place.  We feel that the system that has been in place for the last 30 years has not worked, unfortunately.  There are many problems in our industry but no one is listening.  Solutions must be found through collaboration.</p><p>  The development of new management structures must be industry led and all stakeholders must be consulted.  The central fisheries board that we are seeking would co-ordinate the management of the inshore sector.  This could be done by regional committees advising the board of problems in certain areas.  The approach must be adaptable and flexible and must not be a heavy-handed one.  A streamlining of the licensing in the commercial sector is needed.  The marketing and labelling of fish is very important.  Labels must include information on where the fish is caught and by which vessels.  We also need clearly defined rules and regulations regarding seasonal entitlements and so forth.</p> <p> I will move on to our proposed management measures.  Fishing seasons for different species has been an issue for all my life.  I left school at 16 and my background is in fishing.  We went from one season to the next and one species to the next.  Many high value species can be fished on the west coast so one can take out a small amount for much greater reward.  As a conservation measure, we must consider days at sea versus quotas.  Minimum landing sizes must be respected and different types and different lengths of fishing gear must be considered.  Other proposed measures included limited access through controlled fishing, proper monitoring, V-notching programmes, onshore hatcheries, and area closures where required for specific times.  This does not involve closing an area and leaving it closed forever, which does not work.</p><p> We are also trying to get across the importance of the full polyvalent licence, which is basically a multifunctional licence.  It allows someone to fish several species using different types of gear.  These are the types of licences we had until 2005, at which point restricted licences came onstream.  However, the criteria kept changing and, coupled with the salmon ban and the ban on the spurdog, it has been detrimental to shellfish.  The real problem in pot licensing, which involves an area we do not represent, is the way it was administered and how licences were given to some people.  There are many questions and we would like people to revisit the matter, examine it closely and see how it was done.  Some 504 licences were issued although 700 licence applications were successful on the first day.  It has decreased to 460 active licences.  It created the problem.  Coupled with the salmon ban and the ban on spurdogs, we have lost herring entitlements and we cannot fish for mackerel.  It has had an awful effect.  I do not know what can be done but something must be done.  If not, the inevitable will happen and it will implode.</p><p> There are different minimum landing sizes for crayfish in the European markets.  Our size is 110 mm while other countries have 95 mm and the European regulations and minimum landing sizes do not apply to fish coming from outside the EU into the European market.  We are at a disadvantage.  We tried to get the law changed so that the minimum landing size would be 100 mm and the maximum landing size 130 mm.  This was rejected.  This discriminates against the Irishman because we are going into the same markets as others who have different rules.  We are told we are all Europeans but it seems that we are only Europeans when it suits us.</p><p> The ban on bass fishing is very contentious for the small boats sector.  Whether boats are 6 m or 9.9 m, they are only capable of so much when taking into account weather conditions and the style of the hull.  One can only do so much.  It looks like a quota will be set.  If it is set by Europe, will we have any quota in this country?  The French, in particular, are fishing species in our waters.  Who will compensate us for our loss of quota and the loss of livelihood?  We have made suggestions in the past.  The proposed management plan we sent in highlights this point.  There are several methods of catching bass and we tried to get it open to line fishing and that certain vessels be allowed in on a pilot scheme.  All proposals were rejected.</p><p> The salmon ban was the greatest disaster since the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>.  This tore the heart out of rural communities.  People in rural communities, who are not all fishermen, have not spoken to each other in six or seven years.  People believed the waffle they were listening to and now they cannot get local boats to supply them with one fish.  It created an awful lot of bitterness.  The salmon habitats directive was wrongly used.  We do not agree with the science or the way it was presented.  It was all one-sided and we would like to get the debate reopened.  We must look at the problems of rural communities.  People are emigrating.  It is a very sad fact when one looks at the fishing industry.  I come from Brandon, County Kerry, and when I started fishing in the early 1980s, there were 12 boats and 40 men going down to the pier every morning.  There are now two boats and three men.  My boat is a single-hand boat during the summer because it does not pay me to take anyone with me.  Under the original driftnet legislation, it may be possible to give out a far lower number of licences than when the ban was introduced.  These should be concentrated from Malin Head to Kinsale, which is the area people have suffered the most.</p><p> I had to go into a bank and borrow money to buy my licence and the fishing vessel, as did most of the other people, and we find we can no longer make a living with it.  A small number of licences could be given out in strategic areas.  We know there is a surplus of fish.  With regard to where the figures came from and the number of counters in the rivers, the figure of four counters in four rivers is biting at me somewhere.  All of a sudden, evidence was produced that rivers were below the survival limit.  However, there were no fish counters in the rivers so I wonder where the information came from.  That is what we would like to know.  This was unjust on rural communities.  Our proposed management plan provides for criteria for a small number of licences.  This would make a big difference to communities from Donegal to Cork particularly.</p><p> The spurdog ban was a European thing but it was initiated by this country in the beginning.  Spurdogs are so plentiful that I once unintentionally caught two tonnes of the stuff and I had to throw it over the side.</p> <p>It is a very good and marketable fish which could be sent to the United Kingdom if we were allowed to catch it in a regulated fishery for vessels under 10 m.  These boats cannot do much damage and if there was a regulated season and length of gear, it would alleviate the problems of shellfish.</p><p> There are many small bays along the coast and many of them are subject to the birds, habitats, Natura 2000 and other directives.  However, from the end of September to February large pelagic vessels are fishing where there are only 4 fathoms of water - they are nearly raising sand off the bottom in taking the herrings.  If some of these bays were closed and some of the smaller vessels were allowed to take a small quota, it would not do any harm.  It would, however, make a big difference to us and very little difference to the others.  Handing out high percentage quotas to large vessels is not the answer.  It is detrimental to us and our communities.</p><p> Factory ships from other EU member states and outside the European Union are fishing for mackerel 40 miles west of the south west coast.  They have a far smaller quota than the Irish mackerel fleet, yet they are spending ten months of the year there, maybe more sometimes.  Why is this happening?  How is it sustainable?  Who is doing anything about it?  Some deal should be made within Europe to take a small portion of the mackerel stock and not to bring it within the total allowable catch for hand lining by the small boats.  Again, it is a very marketable fish.</p><p> We also have the problem of seals which I know is a hot potato.  We asked fishermen all around the coast who own our own types of boat to count seals in their areas.  We have come up with a very conservative figure of 50,000, which is totally unsustainable.  We are not asking anybody to go out and kill seals, but perhaps some of them could be tranquilised and removed to some other jurisdiction because eventually they will have nothing to eat and will probably have to eat each other.  Seals are a massive problem.  There is no point going gill-netting for pollock or monkfish.  Whatever scientific evidence is put up about seals, I can tell the committee for a fact that they are doing desperate damage.  It must be possible to do something to reduce their numbers in some way.</p><p> We also have what we call the "alphabet" licences.  When I started fishing, there was one type of fishing licence.  There was a multifunctional polyvalent licence - basically a whitefish licence.  It permitted fishing for so many species.  However, boats now have licences with a "P" or an "A" or it could be any letter in front of them.  Most of these licences have been given out for free, while others have had to spend a vast amount of money in buying capacity and then they can obtain a licence.  This puts us at a great disadvantage.  Those involved in the Tralee Bay oyster fishery have "A" licences.  That is a managed fishery and doing no harm to anybody.  However, there are other areas where it is impacting and we would like to see something done about it.</p><p> The trawling done by larger vessels affects smaller vessels.  People not aligned to us have asked us to bring up this point.  Big vessels tow heavy gear and ecological damage has been done to the seabed, including the tearing up of rocks, which means that small boats can no longer work there.  If the people concerned were kept outside a certain limit, it might help.  </p><p> For many years the use of small-mesh nets by other EU member state vessels has done damage to stocks of whitefish.  Owing to the lack of rules on labelling, nobody knows whether fish imported from non-EU countries are farmed or wild.  Pollution is a problem that has not been addressed.  </p><p> I refer back to salmon fishing.  During the time of the salmon ban a number of local authorities wrote to the then Minister, Mr. Pat "The Cope" Gallagher, MEP, to ask him to ban the practice of drift netting as it was damaging tourism.  However, some of these local authorities installed sewerage systems which failed to meet EU standards.  In some cases, they still do not meet EU standards.  What has been done about this?  They are doing much more damage than a small vessel of 6 m to 10 m.</p><p> We are totally opposed to cage fish farms at sea and have initiated a study which is far from complete.  However, we have heard alarming reports of lice infestation and pollution.  There is a proposal to build one of the largest fish farms in Europe.  In the case of existing salmon farms, a team of divers should be sent down with sophisticated camera equipment to survey an area within half a mile of the cages and underneath them.  This would provide clear evidence of whether they should proceed.</p><p> Another problem has been the lack of representation for those with vessels of less than 10 m.  For years we have been trying to be recognised as representing a group.  Until recently almost every door has been closed in our faces.</p><p> I will outline some solutions.  We need a comprehensive management plan such as the one we suggested and a proper management structure, with local consultation.  We need access to all stocks which can be fished to a sustainable level.  We need to harmonise the landing criteria for crayfish, which is a major issue along the west coast.  We need a comprehensive and aggressive breeding program for lobsters and crayfish.  We need to look after the stock of juveniles.  While the V-notching programme is welcome, it is only tinkering at the edges.  Owing to the pressure on these stocks in recent years, they need an extra boost.  If the stocks are there and healthy, the demand for natural wild fish will increase into the future.  While we might not be around to see the benefits, somebody else will.</p><p> We need defined fishing seasons for certain species.  That is what fishermen did when I was a boy.</p> <p>They took a little of everything, which meant that there was a healthy stock of everything.  That is the way forward.  Part of the importance of full polyvalent licences is that they allow one to operate in such a manner.  They do not restrict or put one under pressure.  I hope the solutions we have proposed to these problems will be taken into consideration.</p><p> The introduction of onshore fish farms should involve renewable energy.  I know people have been complaining about the cost of electricity, butt here are many sources of renewable energy.  This approach would be very good for the environment and help the community.  We have watched recently as people have spoken about creating jobs through fish farming in rural areas.  With the possible exception of a few representatives of small areas, nobody seems to speak about or look at the potential for creating extra jobs in the wild fishery sector.  It is just not on the cards and has not been for the past 30 years.  It needs to be taken seriously.  There needs to be an investment in small fish processing plants such as local smokeries for herring and mackerel in coastal communities because there are no jobs in these communities.  As a result of the lack of investment, there is no infrastructure.  There are no industries other than those supported by natural resources - fishing, farming and tourism.</p><p> I will conclude on that note.  I thank members of the committee for listening to me.</p></speech>

Ag an am c&eacute;anna, t&aacute; b&aacute;id &oacute; t&iacute;ortha eile ag teacht isteach agus na h&eacute;isc s'againne a ghabh&aacute;il.

Caithfidh an t&iacute;r seo troid i gcoinne an r&oacute;l soil&eacute;ir at&aacute; ag an Aontas Eorpach sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin.</p><p>  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an tAire p&aacute;irteach san obair ar an gComhbheartas Iascaireachta at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an raibh deis ag Iascair&iacute; Int&iacute;re Cois Cladach na h&Eacute;ireann cruinnithe a bheith acu leis an Aire roimh r&eacute;.

N&iacute; bheadh aon chiall ann gan labhairt leis an tionscal ar t&uacute;s.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil tuairim ag an Uasal &Oacute; Corcora faoin m&eacute;id sin.  Aonta&iacute;m go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n le m&oacute;rchuid den mh&eacute;id ata r&aacute;ite aige.</p><p>  Mar at&aacute; luaite i ndoicim&eacute;id na hiascair&iacute;, t&aacute; an tionscal int&iacute;re f&iacute;orthabhachtach.  T&aacute; tuairim is 4,500 duine ag obair sa tionscal faoi l&aacute;thair, fi&uacute; leis an d&oacute;igh ina bhfuil an tionscal buailte.  T&aacute; a fhios acu si&uacute;d a bhfuil ag obair sa tionscal go bhfuil s&eacute; deacair go leor sl&iacute; beatha a bhaint amach.  It is very difficult to make a living in the industry to pay one's bills, cover one's mortgage costs, run one's car and put one's family through school and college.  There are 4,500 people involved in it.  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified some of the simple policy steps the State could take and which would not cost it one penny.  It is a good idea to provide for regional management structures that would lead to a more localised decision-making process, or more localised input by fishermen in local regions.  My understanding is that the fishing sector in different regions and different parts of the country is dealing with different issues.  It is obvious that the whitefish issue is a major one in the southern region.  As Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified, salmon and lobster issues are arising in the northern region.</p><p>  The ban on salmon fishing was a major blow to the inshore sector.  It was obviously introduced by a Minister from my own party, Mr. Noel Dempsey, and was a fatal blow.  The angling fraternity put huge pressure on the then Minister to consider the moneys that could be generated from angling tourism and there was documentation flying around everywhere in support of this.  However, those moneys have not emerged.  I accept that there was an issue at sea.  Drift-netting may have been depleting salmon stocks, but there were other factors also.  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified some of them, including the issue of seals waiting in bays and eating salmon as they come in and again on the way out.  There were other issues relating to spawning grounds in rivers, poaching and pollution.  Local authorities were playing a major part in the pollution of rivers.  However, only one issue was dealt with - the banning of drift-netting.  None of the other issues was dealt with, which was a mistake.</p><p>  When Dr. Alyne Delaney appeared before the committee, she said there were 250,000 to 300,000 salmon in the north Atlantic and suggested salmon fishing could be sustainable if it were reopened on a pilot basis.  I think Mr. &Oacute; Corcora is highlighting that point about sustainability also.  Other things such as a seal cull also have to be considered.  I would be in favour of a seal cull around the coast.  Obviously, Inland Fisheries Ireland is looking at rivers and spawning grounds and dealing with pollution control and poaching, etc.  All of that needs to happen, but there also needs to be an opportunity.  If that is not done, lobster stocks will become depleted.  That is happening because too much pressure is being placed on one or two areas.</p><p>  I am very keen for the committee to emphasise to the Minister that there is an alternative way of doing this.  Those involved in Inland Fisheries Ireland which is responsible for salmon fishing might not agree.  I have the highest regard for Dr. Ciaran Byrne, the chief executive officer of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We have to be able to show scientifically that this industry can operate again and some work may need to be done to show this.  I suggest it be done on a pilot basis for three or five years, after which we can reflect on the matter.  The salmon ban should have been introduced over two, three or four years, after which it should have been reviewed, but that is not what happened.  A blanket ban was introduced, which was wrong.  The rationale behind its introduction does not stand up.  I certainly do not see thousands of tourist anglers coming to County Donegal to catch salmon in our rivers.  Bed and breakfast accommodation, the hotels and restaurants are not seeing these tourists either.  It was a false claim.</p><p>  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has mentioned that a change will have to be made with regard to pot licensing.  His document refers to the need to study the UK model.  Is there anything there we should be considering?  Are there recommendations we should be examining?  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora can respond to these questions when he is summing up.  I am not familiar with what has been proposed in the United Kingdom, but he might be able to enlighten us.  </p><p>  I could go into much more detail on some of the recommendations made by Mr. &Oacute; Corcora.  I agree with the vast majority of what he said.</p> <p>I agree with the points made about mackerel.  The mackerel quota should not be divided exclusively among larger vessels.  An element of the quota should be made available to the smaller inshore fleet.  The same applies to the herring quota.  There was a small allocation for the inshore sector but it needs to be ring-fenced in respect of mackerel and herring.</p><p> I have always said there is a need for added value processing in the fisheries sector.  After leaving college, one of my first jobs was in the fisheries added value sector.  There is massive opportunity to add value to fish products, as there is with seaweed harvesting.  One gets &euro;100 per tonne when seaweed is exported to China.  If we add value to level 3, food grade, and level 2, at which ingredients can be used for facial beauty products, we can add up to &euro;800 per tonne.  It is a no-brainer to go down that road.  The same applies to fish landed here.  If we can add value and create jobs in the processing sector, that should be done.  There is a need for the Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department to do more.  There is a need for more funding and tangible research and development.  I know that BIM is doing work in that area but Government support must be provided so there is some incentive for someone with a small vessel to diversify and set up a small smokery or a plant.  In the food sector, it is always difficult to come up with proper research and development to define what the market demands.  There is a lot of research to be done.  How does one break into the market and compete with Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Lidl and Aldi?</p><p> Labelling is a major issue.  There is importation of stock into the country and fishermen are trying to compete with Canadian lobster.  There is a need to look at labelling, which the committee has examined from the point of view of agriculture.  We also need to examine it from the point of view of fisheries so that it is definitive.  We had a conversation with representatives of Aldi and Lidl, where Irish processed food is sold.  The ordinary punter buys the Irish processed food thinking it is authentically Irish, but it is not.  When it comes in here, a package is put on it and that may be the only processing that takes place here.  The fish may be caught in Norway but it is brought in here and sold with the Irish processed green label on it.  We must work on this and there is a need for a statutory framework to protect the Irish sector and ensure the Irish product obtains the highest possible price for the fishermen, just like the farmer.</p><p> The presentation was one of the best we have received at the committee.  It makes common sense and I hope we can reflect on it and implement some of the suggestions in our recommendations, which will go before the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>

It is good to have people representing not just vested interests in fishing but the communities they come from.  The IIE effectively does that, representing the largest number of people involved in the sector.  They all come from the coastal communities most affected by the prevailing policies and the lack of policy to ensure fishermen, their families and their communities can survive.  Regrettably, successive Governments have done the complete opposite.  In reading the presentation, I thought it was an affront to democracy that neither the previous Government nor the current Government has met the organisation.  It is an indictment of the political system that this is the case.  Some 4,500 people involved in the sector are effectively voiceless when it comes to decision-making processes.  They are not being listened to and have no voice at the table.</p><p>  I come from further up the same bay as Mr. O'Corcora and I grew up in the same environment of small farming and fishing communities with multiple fishing types throughout the year.  There was potting in the early part of the year, salmon in the summer and oysters in the winter.  This was replicated along the west coast and parts of the south coast.  There was also small farming in order to provide sustainable incomes for people in the community.  These were vibrant communities because people were community-orientated, not individualistic.  Successive Governments have made a point about how progressive some fishermen are.  The fact that 23 people own the entire quota is an indictment of the political system.</p><p>  I was on the committee while an industry was taken from rural communities.  People from different political persuasions, including Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, spoke against what Noel Dempsey was doing.  They were forced by the Whip to vote for what was done, which was a disgrace.  Senator Denis O'Donovan, who was a Deputy at the time and is from west Cork, was totally opposed to what was happening.</p><p>  Taking the salmon industry from our community had a terrible effect and put pressure on other sectors within fishing.  In order to maintain a sustainable income, people switched over to crayfish, gillnetting and lobster fishing, putting extra pressure on the area.  With regard to the number of pots people can fish on our coast, a regular-sized fishing person who is fishing crayfish and lobster pots has up to 900 pots.  Twenty years ago, 150 pots was a sizeable amount of gear.  Now, one must multiply it by five or six in order to have a sustainable income.  I wish decision makers could see how difficult it is for people to survive.  One of my best friends is a selector on the same football team as me.  He is a crewman on a boat and he has hauled 600 pots for less than &euro;50 for the day.  He was out from 4 a.m. until 12 midnight for less than &euro;50 in order to put bread on the table for his family.  That is what the system and the State have done to people like the witnesses.  I applaud them for coming here and everything they have said makes sense.  The decision-makers must decide where the quota will go.  All we can do, as elected representatives, is to give our absolute commitment to ensure that most of what is put before us is implemented.  We must pressurise the people who make decisions to implement the suggestions.</p><p>  I cannot understand how the bass industry can allow non-Irish boats fishing our waters while we cannot.  It does not make sense.  We have no quota.  The witnesses are correct about spurdog, which is thick in the water.  When jigging for mackerel in July and August, one gets a lot more spurdog than mackerel close to the rocks.  It is soul-destroying to see what is happening to our communities.  Irrespective of our political parties, committee members must be vocal in pursuit of the aims and objectives of what the witnesses are promoting so that the 4,500 people involved in the sector can put food on the table for their families, live in the communities in which they were born and continue in the industry.</p><p>  Culling seals as humanely as possible, which has always been done, is how we protect stocks.  Some cowboys do it and give the whole thing a bad name and it has the opposite effect.  We need a cull for salmon.  There are culls of badgers, deer and other species in order to keep a balance.  When we were allowed to fish salmon, there was nothing worse than seeing 15 or 20 salmon in the net and seeing the seal taking the salmon out of the net.  When it drops to the bottom, the seal is eating the salmon and the fisherman is going home with nothing.</p> <p>The wider public just see the headline; they do not understand what it takes to bring all this about.</p><p> I wish the delegates the best and compliment them on their work.  I am delighted that the committee has had the delegation before it.  The members present are from coastal communities and know exactly what the delegates are talking about.  We know exactly what they have gone through and the difficulties associated with trying to maintain the fabric of the community and industry.  However, we need to get others to listen.  That is the way we will go.</p></speech>

The committee was tasked with drawing up a report to consider what policy initiatives could be implemented to aid the inshore fishing sector to allow people to continue fishing.  Much of the focus has been on alternative industries - in tourism and aquaculture, for example.  It is useful to have seen a fishing-based document and heard a presentation that demonstrate how people who want to remain in the industry could be facilitated and assisted.  I hope the report, when produced, will include some of the policy initiatives recommended in the document and put them onto another plain that could result in their implementation.</p><p>  It is good that there is an organisation for inshore fishermen and that their voice is represented.  It is very disappointing that Ministers have not been meeting the delegates and taking on board what they have been saying.  We should be able to make policy decisions that allow for inshore fishermen to remain in the industry and continue to work together.  That is for the common good.  Too often, people have regarded stocks as their own rather than those of the nation.  We should be able to devise policy in ways that will allow everybody to have a share of the stocks and maintain their livelihoods.  This is important.</p><p>  The submission contains some interesting ideas on fishing seasons, closed times, etc.  These ideas should be considered on a regional basis across the country.  They should inform policy-making and decision-making.  We should not devise a policy that excludes people; we should facilitate everybody as much as possible.  Of course, there will be horse-trading and some will be disappointed, but we should definitely not specifically exclude anybody.  The salmon fishing ban has highlighted this to a large extent.  Fishermen can now focus only on crabs and lobsters, which makes no sense.  I welcome some of the policies included in the document and hope they can be integrated into a report and included in the final report.  I hope we will be able to engage with the delegates in the future and encourage the relevant Ministers to do so also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013062500008#H00300"><p>I welcome the two speakers.  As Deputy Martin Ferris stated, we come from fishing areas.  I was born and reared in Castletownbere and I am familiar with both sides of the delegates' argument in terms of the larger fleet that operates from Castletownbere.  There is also a huge inshore fleet, a forgotten fleet.</p><p>  Interestingly, the presentation goes to the core of what the committee was established to investigate.  The problems highlighted by Mr. O'Corcora are fundamental in determining how the committee should do its work and produce its report.  Other sectors such as aquaculture have representative bodies, NGOs and even Departments looking after their interests.  While they are not perfectly served, they are better served than the inshore fleet.  We should carry out an exercise in this regard.  Mr. O'Corcora, as with us all, will realise that the fleet capacity is set.  So many tonnes and kilowatts are allowed and that is the way it is.  If one had estimates of the numbers of jobs per tonne and kilowatt provided by the inshore and other fleets, they would tell a very interesting story.  One should bear in mind that coastal communities have been ravaged by emigration and the lack of opportunities that could be provided.  Perhaps the committee could carry out this exercise in its deliberations and put the matter under the spotlight.</p><p>  Fishing gets very bad press nationally and internationally.  The one exception is the inshore fleet.  Celebrity chefs and all those who seem to have an inordinate say in the media point to the inshore fleet because the fishery is sustainable and provides a living for families and support for communities - no more and no less.  The industry has much potential and this needs to be recognised.  If the committee did nothing other than recognise the potential of the inshore fleet, it would be a very good start.</p><p>  There is conflict, as we know.  Everything is not rosy in the garden because really delicate and sensitive management are required, even within the inshore fleet, to produce a policy or consensus.  Added to this are the competing interests of the larger vessels from the polyvalent, pelagic, beam and aquaculture sectors.  In addition, there is bureaucracy in the Department and Government policy.  Although I question why one would start at all, a start is needed.  Today's testimony is a good start.</p><p>  The driftnet ban in respect of salmon fishing was referred to.  Mr. Michael Keatinge of BIM testified that this could be examined.  He said that, using scientific information from the Marine Institute, for example, we could revisit these issues.  He excluded Aran M&oacute;r, for whatever reason, because the salmon run there is different.  I would welcome a re-examination.</p><p>  There is an inevitability about the policy on days at sea.  I was at a meeting yesterday morning in Castletownbere and noted that, irrespective of how the discard ban will be operated and administered, the days at sea concept was becoming part of the conversation.  I believed I would never hear about it.  It is coming from the industry.  One must talk about proposals.  The idea will be unpopular in some quarters and might be supported in others, but, at least, if one discusses concepts such as ring-fencing fisheries and additions to licences, there is merit in it.</p><p>  I heard an interesting proposal on banning pelagic fishing entirely from March to May or June for all fleets.  This effort would give more challenged species a chance, particularly when breeding.</p><p>  I am very interested in the proposals on substituting the V-notching, seeding for scallops and whatever else can be done.  The schemes are very progressive.  There was a scheme for scallops and reasonable success.  Schemes should be re-examined.  If they provide for a 20% increase in effort, it would be very much welcomed.</p><p>  The seal debate will be very contentious.  As Deputy Martin Ferris stated, people really do not understand the issues involved.  Tourists might like to see seals on the rocks, but a seal that goes to a driftnet will take one bite out of every fish.  It will take a bite out of the belly of the first fish, move onto the next one and take a bite out of its belly and continue in that vein, thus decimating stocks.  If that is the natural approach, it is difficult to deal with, but seals need to be managed in some shape or form.  It is about striking a balance between what is environmentally sound and what is economically sustainable for communities.</p> <p>All the presentations to the committee have been valuable but this presentation gets to the nub of what we are trying to do as a committee.  Many inshore fisheries may be represented through their POs but their voices are not being heard through their POs, organisations or communities, as they should be.  I hope the problems identified and solutions proposed by Mr. O'Corcora will inform our report in due course.</p></speech>

A total of 75% of the boats are less than 10 metres but, like everything else, if their catches were compared to those of the large boats, the breakdown would be 90:10 or worse and that is the nub of the issue.  If we are to pursue this path together, we must first arrive at a cross-party consensus.  We will then pursue a line that many people will say is attractive but will never succeed.  A short effort will be put in and then it will be dropped.  A fundamental change in how we do business is needed.</p><p>  When I was first approached by this organisation, I was interested in a number of basic concepts.  The first is the concept of <i>de minimis</i>. In other words, we are forever micro managing the small operators but, in many cases, the larger operators are governed by the same rules.  I recall during the drift net debate going out fishing one evening with guys in a currach to pull in the nets, which was legal at the time.  It was man against nature in a big way.  The reality is that over 100 years they had not managed to out-fish the capability of fish.  Mechanisation and automation have made many things unsustainable and, therefore, coastal communities must fish in an area exclusive to inshore fishermen in which all the stock can be fished in the knowledge that one will never be allowed to have a boat bigger than 10 metres.  The boat will be always limited in hauling in nets over a certain size.  In that way, fishing by definition would be sustainable.</p><p>  If we try to say we want a special deal for Ireland on inshore fishing, we are doomed to failure.  On the other hand, if we said coastal communities with small boats should have first call on stocks adjacent to their shores and the same should apply in Spain, Portugal, Great Britain and other maritime countries and we worked at gathering support for that, we might succeed because we would then create a pan-European demand among such communities for a fair share of the stocks within a set radius of the shore.  Limiting the number of stocks that can be fished, as Mr. &Oacute;'Corcora said, would put impossible pressure on the remaining stocks and, therefore, the limits should be applied to the size of boats and nets and all stocks should be fished.  If the change is to be made at European level, it will take five to ten years.  When I say that to people, they realise if they had started ten years previously, they would be home and dry with this change to the Common Fisheries Policy.  If the representatives wait another five years to come in and have a bitch at us about what is not happening and we all give out to each other about what is not happening and we say if it does not happen tomorrow, it will not happen, we will be exactly where we are now.  We all have to decide whether we have a common position and, if so, whether we are willing to take whatever time it takes to achieve long-term results regarding the European input into this issue.   This is a major European issue in the context of quotas, TACs and so on.</p><p>  I refer to salmon fishing.  Without Inland Fisheries Ireland declaring that there is surplus fish, the organisation is dead in the water but, luckily, its staff have said there is a surplus in certain areas, although there is a particular difficulty in County Donegal because there is mixed stock fishing.  When I was in Cabinet we fought powerful forces on this issue, which we must recognise.  The Minister at the time, Mary Coughlan, fought them.  I used to always argue that none of the drift net fishermen wanted an unsustainable fishery.  If they did, they were fools because they were cutting off their noses to spite their faces.  However, we must recognise that to make progress, we must make alliances with those engaged in the science of this issue and work with them to come up with solutions over which they can stand in order that, internationally, we can prove we are not in any way damaging stocks.  Anything else would be foolish and would not lead anywhere productive.  Just saying &quot;we want&quot; will not achieve anything.  If we tried to return to where we were, I estimate 85% of Deputies across all parties would oppose it.  I recall having that argument with fishermen.  I would love to see a free vote on this issue because I guarantee if we tried to return to the old <i>status quo</i>, it would be roundly beaten in the House.  We should recognise the challenge we face.  Fishermen living on the coast should have access to surplus stock as long it is sustainable.  It must be done in a way that is saleable nationally and internationally.  That is a major task but one on which we should work.  IFI, which has responsibility for salmon rights, has a key role to play and we need to work with its staff.</p><p>  I agree with Mr. &Oacute;'Corcora on the seals.  At the end of the day, there is no point making poor old <i>homo sapiens</i> starve while there is an overabundance of a predator that has done more than fishermen ever did to decimate stocks.</p> <p>There are humane ways of dealing with culling and the issue should not be off-limits.</p><p> I was interested in what Mr. O'Corcora had to say about crayfish and what could be done immediately.  He pointed out that we have a different standard from the European standard.  We should direct our attention to that and try to deal with the specific issue.  We should do the same with regard to bass.</p><p> I was also interested in what was said about food imports into Europe, which is an issue we could deal with instantly.  This issue arose in a different context recently regarding the standards that apply to fish food imports into Europe compared to standards applying with regard to European fish.  The issue arose in regard to horsemeat, where the standards that apply to the imports of American horsemeat through Mexico and Canada into the European Union are different to the standards that apply to the slaughter of horses here and the placement of that horsemeat into the food chain.  If the American standards do not kill people, why do we need to have even higher standards?  To put it another way, if we have a very high standard to ensure people are not put at risk, why does the same standard not apply to American horsemeat?  The same issue arises with regard to fish.  If we impose all sorts of high standards on our fishermen, in terms of catch, mesh size and various other standards to ensure sustainability of the seas - the seas and fish around the world do not recognise national boundaries - it would seem reasonable that Europe should insist on the same standards for imports.  This should apply to all food products for consumers, whether with regard to food safety standards, environmental standards, standards on the use of chemicals or any others.  The standards should be the same for all and Europe should set out clearly that with regard to the exploitation of the planet, it does not make any difference whether it happens within or without the European Union.  As far as Europe is concerned, citizens should not eat food that is not produced sustainably.</p><p> I was glad to hear my colleague say that this submission was one of the best we have had and that it addressed the issues bang on the nose.  One other issue that arose in this debate, which is one that has annoyed me over many years, was the theory of an alternative job.  This theory is that we will stop fishermen from fishing but give them an alternative job.  I have found two problems with this theory.  First, most fishermen know fishing best and want to continue fishing.  They do not want another job and if they are trained for another job it is not where their heart is.  Second, the alternative job very often does not materialise.  The ban on drift net fishing was a perfect example of what happens.  The significant income that came into coastal communities from drift net fishing has disappeared, but there has been no sign of any huge growth in tourism, angling and so on.  Perhaps there has been growth in the odd area, but in no way has there been sufficient growth to make up for the loss of income.  T&aacute; ceist mh&oacute;r ansin.</p><p> Molaim an m&eacute;id dua agus oibre at&aacute; curtha isteach san aighneacht chuimsitheach seo.

We can do a certain amount here, but we must, once we are clear on our policy - it would be a good idea to have a cross-party policy - work through our MEPs or otherwise to connect with all coastal communities and countries to try and find a common cause for the 75% of fishermen who, like those in Ireland, work in small boats and are being squeezed out, with very little effect on conservation.</p></speech>

I think the delegation got a flavour from the members of the importance they attach to the presentation.  The conclusion of the presentation sets out the bottom line from the committee's point of view.  If the sub-committee accepts on a cross-party basis that vessels under 10 m are vital for the survival and sustainability of rural, coastal and island communities, we have to consider putting forward an agreed position along the lines of the suggestion made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Perhaps we could recommend that those using such vessels be allowed to fish inside certain limits and to a certain capacity, with a mixed fish stock, at a level that allows for continued and ongoing sustainability and the maintenance of the species balance and everything else.  Perhaps some of the other things we have discussed can work in harmony with that basic principle.</p><p>  When I was a member of this committee in the last D&aacute;il, we travelled to meet the previous Commissioner, Joe Borg, who was from Malta.  He made the point that when the current Common Fisheries Policy was drawn up, his aspiration was that a two-track approach would be adopted, with one track for the larger fleet and the other track for smaller island and coastal communities in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Rightly or wrongly, he was not appointed to this portfolio for a second term.  I think discards have become the biggest issue in the portfolio of measures that the current Commissioner wants to see implemented.  It is not that the previous priority has been excluded.  Maybe this committee should reboot that effort.  While we can play our part, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v rightly pointed out that work is needed at EU level.  We are just about to embark on a Common Fisheries Policy that does not do anything that is exclusively negative in this regard, but does not do anything to help either.  We need to try to refocus attention on the coastline from Malin to Kinsale, in particular.  That part of the country is most affected by this.</p><p>  I thank the members and the witnesses for their comments.  We extended the period of time of the hearings to receive today's presentation.  It was definitely worthwhile from the perspective of all committee members.  I think I am the only member present who does not come from a coastal fishing community.  When I listened to what was said about seals, I was reminded that the same issues are arising with deer where I come from.  The difficulty in such cases lies with the public perception of what people are trying to do, as opposed to what they are actually trying to do.  I did not think a comparison could be made between deer and seals, but it is relevant in this case.  That concludes today's proceedings.  I thank members and witnesses again for their contributions.</p></speech>

With over 50 member chambers, we represent the needs of the business community in every geographical region and economic sector in Ireland.  Therefore, we are in a unique position to understand the concerns of the business community and express its views at national level.</p><p>  One of our core policy priority areas is the support of small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs.  Given that over 90% of all businesses in Ireland are SMEs and that most employment is located in this sector, meaningful and sustainable job creation depends on a strong and vibrant SME sector.  The inclusion of a ten point plan for micro enterprises in budget 2013 was welcomed by both Chambers Ireland and the chamber network around the country.  However, our analysis of the proposals led us to the conclusion that they would have limited impact on the trading conditions of most businesses.  Specifically, we believe too many of the measures included unnecessary limitations, were limited to certain sectors, were merely extensions of existing schemes or were merely facilitators of change rather than actual stimulus measures.  Transformative outcomes will only be possible through more ambitious and far-reaching measures.</p><p>  In response, we brought together a range of representatives from around the network and subject matter specialists from major accounting and taxation firms to produce an alternative ten point plan.  Throughout these deliberations we were guided by certain key principles: that the proposals must be ambitious; they must be designed to achieve job creation and retention; as far as possible restrictions on business and trade ought to be removed; our focus was to remain on indigenous, non-exporting companies which currently receive little support from State agencies; and all proposals must be revenue neutral as far as possible.</p> <p>What resulted is a set of policy suggestions which I believe can help produce the type of change necessary to transform Ireland into a country that inspires entrepreneurial behaviour and rewards the risks taken when starting and growing a business.</p><p> I propose to highlight some of the main points in the ten point plan rather than go through each one in detail.  The first point is the introduction of a reduced VAT rate on housing repair, maintenance and improvements, RMI.  The continuing crisis in the construction sector remains a major concern.  Accordingly, we recommend a reduction to 5% of VAT on all RMI on residential properties up to the value of &euro;50,000.  This would stimulate rapid growth and create new jobs.  Not only would this incentivise start-ups and create employment but it would also increase the circulation of money in the economy.  This would be fully in line with EU law, which allows member states to permanently reduce VAT in this area to 5% in order to support economic growth.  This rate reduction may be delivered by way of the home owner applying for a refund of VAT directly from the Revenue Commissioners to assist in ensuring work done is in the legitimate economy.</p><p> While critics have argued that under EU regulations, it is not possible to place a ceiling on such a scheme, precedent would suggest this is not the case.  In this regard, the plan points to a couple of examples where ceilings have been put in place for specific industry sectors.  Research conducted in the UK suggests that such a cut could create 3,625 jobs in Scotland by 2015, a country somewhat similar to Ireland in economic and demographic terms.  Furthermore, it is estimated that this could result in a further 2,178 jobs through the multiplier affect.  Another similar successful scheme designed to produce a temporary, timely and targeted stimulus is the home renovation tax credit introduced in Canada in 2009.  We believe the benefits of this initiative would go well beyond the construction sector because as home owners refurbish their properties, there would be an increase in the purchase of soft furnishings, white goods, electrical appliances and so on, all of which are liable for VAT at 23% and are in the area of retail, which is currently suffering badly.</p><p> The next point is a proposal to halve to 16.5% the level of capital gains tax for entrepreneurs.  We are all aware that the capital gains tax has been increased over progressive budgets from 20% to 33%.  We believe it is unfair to apply the same level of capital gains tax to an entrepreneur who is risking so much to establish an enterprise as that applied to an individual who, say, is investing savings in shares in the stock market.  A successful entrepreneur makes a significant contribution to the economy in terms of taxes on earnings, employment taxes and rates on economic activity, while the other investment is significantly more passive and does not make the same direct economic contribution.</p><p> Cyclical taxes such as corporation tax, capital gains tax and stamp duties as a total of the tax intake have fallen considerably since 2008, when CGT stood at 20%.  This supports the international evidence that increases in CGT rates can actually reduce revenue.  Furthermore, CGT makes up a small proportion of the total tax take.  For example, in 2012 it raised &euro;414 million as compared with almost &euro;20 billion from VAT and income tax.  Accordingly, we believe that capital gains tax should be reduced significantly for entrepreneurs so as to incentivise and reward risk.  This would also help companies to grow into small and medium-sized enterprises and develop internationally.  The key point here is that many innovators have the skill set to get a business up and running.  However, it is a completely different challenge for them to turn a micro or small business into a large internationally traded business and it may be more appropriate for them to sell up and move on and start off their next bright idea.  The current tax system does not necessarily facilitate this.</p><p> The next point is to encourage a targeted rates reduction for businesses in town centres.  We recognise that the retail sector remains an important part of the microenterprise and small and medium enterprise, SME, sectors.  However, many are struggling to remain in business due to excessive rates imposed by local authorities.  To guarantee their survival and allow them to retain the important jobs they provide, we recommend the introduction of a targeted rates reduction for companies located within town and city centres and which provide much needed employment and contribute to the quality of life in these areas.  While we recognise that the issues of rates and development contributions are reserved functions for local authorities, it is the role of the relevant Department to provide the statutory and policy framework which enables these authorities to implement initiatives focused on business development and job creation.</p><p> The next point is to enable start-ups to offset corporation tax losses against other taxes due.  We believe that in the start-up phase, a company should be able to offset trading losses against other taxes due.  Furthermore, an initial start-up period of five years would, in our view, be more beneficial for new companies.  This would assist cashflow for start-up companies, a vital ingredient which could enable them to overcome the most challenging period in their development.  The calculation could be done on a value basis so that the Revenue Commissioners do not ultimately lose out financially but refund VAT in a given year <i>in lieu</i>of a corporation tax deduction in future years when profits are made.  We recommend the introduction of a pilot scheme at the earliest opportunity, to be extended to all business start-ups once its efficacy has been established.</p><p> The next point is to employ &quot;the Ireland rate of return&quot; - which is a take on the internal rate of return - in tendering decisions for public sector contracts.  As one of the biggest purchases of services in the State, Departments and agencies need to be mindful of the positive outcomes of awarding tenders to locally based suppliers.  Rather than applying a strict value for money criteria, consideration must be given to the value produced to the national economy in terms of jobs created, increased revenue and reduced welfare costs arising from the award of contracts within the State.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department Public Expenditure and Reform need to work closely to ensure their policies are complementary.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is putting in place incentives to encourage SMEs while the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform may be adopting tendering and procurement policies which favour large firms often not resident in the State.  The method of single sourcing being pursued is a risky strategy which deviates from best practice internationally and could result in the collapse of large numbers of small local companies throughout the country.  From what we can see, the discretion of lower nominal contracts being awarded locally is being withdrawn from 2014 onward.  </p><p> Cost efficiencies and savings must not be achieved at the expense of jobs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should be mandated to review value for money critiques in the context of the wider return on investment for the economy achieved by awarding contracts locally.  The Committee of Public Accounts could then be empowered to review the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports via a jobs improving analysis of such contract awards.  We recently came across a report carried out prior to the awarding of contracts for campus development at UCD which showed that work carried out by individuals not paying tax in the State can lead to a fiscal loss to the State, which we estimate at between 20% and 30%.  We support cost containment and efficiencies by Government.  However, this cannot be at the cost of our SME community, the jobs it creates and the taxes it pays.  The business generated by local authorities is significant and plays a vital role in the local communities in terms of job creation and economic sustainability.</p><p> The next point sets out a number of operational changes which we believe will make business easier for small businesses and start-ups, including the consolidation of existing HR legislation, in respect of which there are currently 30 pieces; the creation of a one-stop website for exporters; the promotion of further joined-up government and a recognition that local authorities can do more to improve the conditions in which micro and small businesses operate.  More details on these proposals can be found in the full ten point plan.</p><p> Since the publication of the plan, we have received a great deal of feedback and input.  Many members of the chamber network have raised two further issues which we believe should be considered by the joint committee.  It will be no surprise to hear that improved access to working capital remains an issue.  Problems with working capital place a considerable burden on companies, leading to payment delays, cuts in wages and working hours and the use of personal funds or resources by employers and entrepreneurs to maintain the business.  To date, the response from Government has largely focused on investment finance, with measures such as the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance scheme.  More recently, measures were introduced to improve working capital, with the increase in the turnover threshold for companies to pay VAT on a cash basis rather than on an invoiced basis and the increase in the <i>de minimis</i>level of the closed company surcharge announced in budget 2013.  We welcome any move that addresses the concerns of SMEs and acknowledge the work that is being done to increase the supply of credit.  However, we are concerned that Government policy may not be focused on the most pressing needs of SMEs.  Availability of working capital and support for extended cashflow must become priority areas.  Enhancement of the availability of investment capital, while welcome, does not address the issue of supporting cashflow in the economy.</p> <p>The second report on the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme states uptake of the scheme remains disappointing.  Given the low demand for these funds the Government has the opportunity to redirect unused amounts to support cashflows in business by raising the qualifying amount for companies to use the cash basis for accounting for VAT from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2.5 million.</p><p> We cannot ignore the impact of the euro crisis and the push for improved trading conditions in the entire euro area is critical to Ireland's well-being.  The success of any recovery in Ireland is dependent on the surrounding economies on which we depend for exports and trade, and until economic conditions improve in the EU recovery in Ireland will be slow at best and the Government must do whatever it can to assist in the stabilisation of the European economies.</p><p> On behalf of Chambers Ireland and the entire chamber network I thank the committee for this opportunity to address it on our alternative ten point plan.  We hope committee members have found the presentation useful and that it will inform their interactions with the Government.  We are happy to take any questions committee members might have.</p></speech>

In the interests of transparency I must declare that I worked for the organisation prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  I welcome the plan.  Everybody around the table agrees on the importance of small and medium enterprises.  I will start with point 11 of the ten point plan and I am surprised Chambers Ireland forgot about it.  This is the issue of credit.  Will the witnesses give us an update on the availability of credit to Chambers Ireland members?  Reference was made to the poor uptake of the schemes and we are anxious to discover why the schemes are not going down as well as everybody thought they would.  Will the witnesses give us feedback on this?</p><p>  With regard to the proposals on town centres, a double rent reduction is proposed for those on upward-only rent reviews.  Will the witnesses outline how this would work practically and who would be in charge of implementing it?  I would also like to hear their thoughts on upward-only rent reviews generally.  Chambers Ireland proposes a targeted rates reduction, and it seems to go for the French model as opposed to the model in operation in Northern Ireland, the so-called "Tesco tax".  Will the witnesses outline the difference between the two and the reasons for Chambers Ireland's preference?</p><p>  The committee is doing much work on procurement at present and we are all in favour of jobs.  Does Chambers Ireland have specific recommendations on procurement?  When the Office of Public Works and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform come before the committee they tell us their hands are tied by EU procurement rules and that they cannot get around them.  Does Chambers Ireland have specific thoughts on this?  I welcome the idea of joined-up government and the issue of procurement shows we do not have this.  Chambers Ireland has pointed this out.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on breaking down the silos in government?</p><p>  Did Chambers Ireland manage to maintain revenue neutrality throughout the document?  What is the overall cost of implementation of the ten point plan?</p></speech>

Has Chambers Ireland calculated the cost benefit of its proposed reduced VAT rate for housing repair?  A five year period has been proposed for offsetting corporation tax against other taxes for start-ups.  This is a long time for start-ups, in that after the third year sustainability issues come into question.  How would this work in practice?  Would all losses over the five years be used to write off all forms of PRSI, VAT and corporation tax?  I understand the idea that a reduction in capital gains tax would allow for investment in the business, which would be better for the business.  Would it not be more efficient to provide a tax break against capital gains taxes on money invested into the business?  This would mean it would not be a case of profit-taking and there would be close alignment of investment in the business with reductions in capital gains.</p><p>  We have been speaking with Chambers Ireland about rates in town centres and we believe there is a necessity for a progressive rates base which reflects the profitability of particular businesses.  The problem with double rent reductions is that the Government would be subsidising landlords directly.  What is the view of Chambers Ireland on the possibility of the introduction of legislation or constitutional reform with regard to upward only rents?  It is a significant issue.  It does not affect a broad section of businesses in relative terms but it is very significant for the businesses which are affected.  Would constitutional reform be useful?</p><p>  I could not agree more on the "Ireland rate of return" element.  There needs to be a value for money basis on how the wider local economy is affected.  In the North it was very significant that tenders were broken up into small bite sized chunks so small and local businesses could start to consume them.</p><p>  With regard to a tax incentive policy and private sector investment, the issues of demand for credit and bank lending are core and should come before tax credit.  I have no problem with nearshoring.  The 2.5% for research and development is a good idea.  Incentives with regard to research and development often do not reach small businesses and this needs to happen.  Smaller businesses sometimes have problems with matched funding.  Does Chambers Ireland have proposals on how smaller businesses could better access matched funding?  I also agree with consolidating human resources legislation as long as low-paid employees are protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Talbot" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500005#D01300"><p>Mr. Murphy and I will do a double act as we have overlapping and complementary expertise in many areas.  Both Deputies raised the issue of credit.  Plenty of work is being done separately on credit.  The group which worked on these proposals was very much focused on taxation and business costs specifically rather than the credit issue.  This is why there is very little focus on credit in the document.  Our overall view on the credit situation is that the predominant issue in the economy is still a lack of demand.  Businesses are still consolidating and waiting to see future opportunity before they invest.</p> <p>We are now six years into the crisis and many of the survivors are coping where they are.  There are many issues as companies have property debt, for example, that may be interfering in core business, and we still need to find a solution in that regard.  Our gut feeling is that the core economy is not investing for the future, and it is important to ensure the banking system has money to lend when the economy starts to pick up and turn around aggressively.  It is important that the banking system is fit for purpose in future as there is currently a demand issue in place as much as anything else.  That is the feedback we are getting from members.</p><p> The issue of double rent reviews has been raised twice in different ways.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has summarised our views on the upward-only rent situation quite well.  Around the country we are finding that most landlords and businesses have managed to get together and find accommodation, so it is not a matter that preys on our members' minds significantly.  Ultimately, contracts are what they are so it would not be smart for the Government to overturn an agreed contract.  That is why we tried to suggest that the Government could find some way, in the absence of being able to legislate historical upward-only rent reviews, to recognise particular cases that may threaten jobs and provide some form of capping process.  It is not that we are saying there should be unlimited relief rather that there should be a form of capped payback for somebody who can prove it was impossible to renegotiate rent with a landlord on a contract going back before the start of the recession, for example.  That is the thrust of the recommendation in that area.</p><p> With regard to breaking down silos in Government, we do our best to ensure we present our ten-point plan, for example, to every Department that will entertain us.  Nevertheless, breaking down silos in Government will always be a challenge and we will do everything we can to socialise the work we do with the various Departments with an impact on us.  That is a combination of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Environment, Community and Local Government and so on.  We deal with multiple Departments on multiple issues but we cannot manage to solve the challenge of breaking down those silos.</p><p> With regard to overall cost and velocity of money, hardly any of these measures will have any significant impact on tax revenue, as almost everything we are proposing is targeting an area where nothing is happening at the moment anyway.  A 5% VAT rate on housing repair, maintenance and improvements, where virtually nothing is happening anyway, amounts to 5% extra revenue.  We are also considering velocity of money, and we have tried to come up with areas that have connected impacts.  If somebody does a kitchen extension or attic conversion, they would buy new fridges, dishwashers, televisions, carpets or curtains, and all of these would create VAT at 23%, making back the small margin between a 13.5% rate and a reduced rate.  We would propose the imposition of a sensible cap on any of these proposals to get things moving at the bottom end, so there would be no licence for people to rebuild a mansion.</p><p> We may never agree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on capital gains tax, as our idea is that low tax generates increases in taxes paid.  We also feel that decreasing corporation tax in this fashion would just help velocity of money, keeping more of it circulating in the economy and helping to regenerate economic activity.  That was the basis for our introduction.</p></speech>

Rather than having people wait or hanging on for retirement, why not let them exit a business and then use their resources and skills to create a new business?  That is as opposed to hanging on and waiting for people to retire, or starting to scale back five years beforehand.  It is about velocity of money and getting cash in circulation when we know demand is the big issue.</p></speech>

The advice we got from accounting an tax professionals in the group is that a three-year period, given where we are in the economic cycle, is not long enough to prove whether a business will succeed or fail.  That is why we propose a five-year period, with a cap to limit any Exchequer exposure.</p><p>  We are formulating proposals to get entrepreneurs thinking about establishing and growing businesses, as currently they are not doing so.  People are still afraid to invest in the future and we are trying to think of ideas that will encourage, stimulate and give people a sense that the Government is behind them, although perhaps in a number of small ways rather than one big way.  A number of incentives could contribute a couple of thousand euro to help businesses keep the doors open.</p><p>  With regard to research and development, the manner in which we produced the proposal was to recognise that there are State resources with significant pools of money for investment.  We want to have the State companies responsible for taking 2.5% of their budget and ensuring this is pushed out to small businesses.  There is not much take-up now but we want to try to get 2.5% accountable to a sponsoring Department getting into small businesses and making innovation projects work.  We did not really get into the challenges of raising matched funding and so on and we wanted a combination of carrot and stick.  That would allow people with budgets to be empowered and encouraged to get out there, find ideas in small businesses and deliver to them.  It is a psychological incentive as much as anything else and getting people's mindsets - particularly in the semi-State and public sector - to focus on getting some of that budget into the right type of companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Murphy" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500006#E00400"><p>Deputy Calleary asked about the local tax initiatives and target town centres, as opposed to the large retail levy and expanded small business release scheme, as it is called in the North.  Our thinking is that the French model is a little more nuanced and targeted, focusing on a retail mix that is vital in getting footfall in town centres.  Phone shops are very welcome additions to the streetscape but we do not want five in a row.  We want a baker, the candlestick maker and the phone shop.  The French model allows for a more targeted approach to diversity and shop mix.</p><p>  We have been a supporter of local property taxation and we welcome its introduction, although the timing is poor in terms of the economic cycle.  It has always been needed to disincentivise local authorities in chasing development levies etc.  When the local property tax is being rolled out, we have a once in a generation opportunity to support and recalibrate funding and taxing of local government in a way that supports jobs, often with low-skilled staff or businesses with a low margin.  That would help to enhance and animate town centres.</p></speech>

On initial reading of the document I was quite critical because it seemed to be a list of ten items outlining reductions, and my concern is that as a nation we are spending more than we are earning.  Every time somebody comes in they seem to want reductions in charges, and that will not work the whole time.  Nevertheless, it can work, and a shopkeeper knows that if he brings down a price cleverly, he can take in more money.  Mr. Talbot mentioned that ability a few minutes ago, and the explanation of a reduce VAT rate on housing repair is exactly right.  There is an opportunity to be able to reduce the VAT rate on housing repairs, and there will be benefits from 23% VAT coming from other items.</p><p>  There are not enough similar ideas in the document.  The case has been made that if capital gains tax is reduced to 16.5%, there will be a fair chance of providing incentives.  In the past 20 or 30 years, Ministers for Finance have reduced rates and taken in far more money on that basis.</p> <p>I would like to see more of that in this instance.  If there were more figures in Chambers Ireland's ten point plan and if it were more targeted, the organisation would have a better chance of achieving something.</p><p> I will mention my own business as an example.  We used to allow the local managers of our 24 stores to purchase on their own locally.  When we eventually decided to bring it in together and buy centrally, we could not get over the huge savings we achieved compared with when we bought locally.  I am not all that enthusiastic about giving responsibility to local businesses unless it can be shown that the figures are there.  In our case, there was a dramatic difference in price.</p><p> I understand the delegation's point that the VAT rate is not necessarily paid in Ireland.  The profit could be paid somewhere else on that basis.  We have a good example in the form of last year's decision by the Minister to reduce the rate of VAT in the tourism sector.  It seemed to give tourism a boost.  It has been of benefit in that area.  I would love to see more of that in these plans.  The simple suggestion that has been made with regard to housing repairs sounds like a no-brainer to me.  It seems to me that it is likely to work very easily if it is produced and promoted on the basis that has been outlined.</p><p> People are still saving rather than spending.  They are saving because they do not have confidence in the future.  Confidence is a delicate enough flower, but it could take off very easily if we made some changes.  I think some of the steps that have been proposed by the delegation would improve confidence.  I would love to see more figures.  Rather than pursuing this ten point plan, perhaps Chambers Ireland could concentrate on a smaller number of proposals.  I have some difficulty with the Northern Ireland approach of charging larger stores a higher rate to help the smaller stores on the main street.  We need to find a way of making the main street work better.  That will come from individual entrepreneurs.  There are thriving main streets in some towns.  The shops on those streets are generally not the traditional ones, however.  As Mr. Murphy said earlier, we have the candlestick maker as well as the baker and the others.  If we can find a way to encourage a mixture of shops, I think we can take off.  The main one is confidence.  I think expenditure will increase when we create confidence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/988" speakername="&Aacute;ine Collins" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500007#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Murphy and Mr. Talbot.  We welcome all suggestions about how to create jobs and make the SME environment far more friendly.  We are familiar with the proposal regarding housing.  We hope something will happen in the budget.  I would like to mention an interesting statistic in that regard.  The building sector is worth approximately &euro;8 billion at present.  If that figure increases by &euro;1 billion, some 10,000 jobs will be created and the Exchequer will receive &euro;500 million in tax returns.  That is a no-brainer.  We have to ensure we do not encourage growth in the black economy.  We must ensure the advantage of any scheme is confined to builders who are tax registered and tax compliant.</p><p>  I do not understand the proposal to allow corporation tax to be offset against other taxes.  I should understand it because I studied tax for long enough.  As I understand it, start-up companies are currently exempt from corporation tax up to approximately &euro;1 million.  I am not sure how this tax can be offset against VAT and PAYE.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are supposed to collect VAT, hand it over to the State and offset it against their own tax.  I also have concerns about how the payroll aspect of this proposal would work manually because it would affect people's PRSI claims.  I think the capital gains tax proposal is a great idea.  We need that.  The more movement we have on that, the more innovation we have.</p><p>  My biggest issue relates to the whole area of soft supports.  I do not see anything in this regard.  From what I am hearing on the ground, SMEs are constantly calling for supports of this nature to help them to access information and new markets when they are trying to develop their businesses.  We could do a much better job in that regard.  I am sure the delegation welcomed this morning's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that &euro;21 million is to be committed for research and development under the competitiveness fund.  I do not think we are doing half of what we need to be doing in research and development.  We need to increase threefold, at least, our current level of investment in this area.  According to the EU, we need to increase our current investment, which is approximately 1.15% of GDP, to approximately 3% of GDP by 2020.  That is very interesting.  When the US had its biggest economic crisis in the 1930s, it poured money into innovation and research.  We could learn some valuable lessons from what the US did to pull itself out of the depression.  It is obvious that Europe is still very sluggish.  We are particularly concerned about France.  If there is no lift in an area that comprises 40% of the global economy, we will have a problem in Ireland.  Innovation is still a big issue.</p><p>  The seed capital and investment incentive schemes have never worked.  They are fantastic, but there is a big blockage in this regard.  We need to make them simpler.  I wonder whether Chambers Ireland could look into that.  I know the Irish Taxation Institute will be in.  There seems to be a blockage with regard to these schemes.  They need to be open to everybody.  They need to be made far simpler.  Under the seed capital scheme, one has to spend the money before one can get it back.  Perhaps there is another way of organising it.  I ask the delegation to consider this aspect of the matter and come up with some ideas on it.</p></speech>

Senator Quinn asked a number of the questions I had intended to ask.  It is great to see proposals like this.  Like other speakers, I would have liked to have seen more figures with regard to costs, etc.  Perhaps the members of the delegation can work on that over the period ahead.  Can they elaborate on the French model to which they referred?</p><p>  The fourth proposal in the ten point plan involves the adoption of a targeted approach to rates reduction for businesses in town centres.  This committee has received presentations from retailers and has visited a number of towns.  The retailers have expressed similar concerns and made similar proposals.  I know where they are coming from when they speak about the effects of big multiples.  It may be the case that smaller outlets associated with a large multiple are struggling or dealing with their own issues.  It might be counter-productive to impose higher rates on them to benefit other smaller shops.</p><p>  Are the businesses represented by Chambers Ireland placing an emphasis on the regeneration of town centres to encourage people to live in them?  Have the members of Chambers Ireland spoken about any initiatives aimed at developing living spaces above shops, etc.?  I would support a review of rates with an emphasis on large multinational industries that could easily pay higher rates, as opposed to out-of-town centres, if that would lead to a reduction in the rates paid by smaller businesses.  The current rates model needs to be scrapped.  I hope the valuation Bill will deal with that when it comes before us.</p><p>  A number of the issues I had intended to raise have already been raised.  I would welcome the delegation's first proposal aimed at kick-starting a whole area within the construction sector.  It is labour-intensive and it has huge potential.  It has been pretty much stalled for a period.  Obviously, the proposal would have a knock-on effect with regard to job potential.  I am interested in the costs in that regard.  Chambers Ireland has pointed out a 5% VAT rate in this sector would be 5% better than the current position, where no VAT is being paid because there is no activity.  I suppose the Department of Finance might look at it in a different way in terms of the potential VAT loss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Talbot" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500007#F00400"><p>I thank the members of the committee for asking such great questions and for taking so much interest in the document.  Senator Quinn suggested that we have could have been more ambitious.  One of the opening points I made was about ambition.  We mulled long and hard over this document because we wanted to be able to stand over it and say it was capable of being implemented.  We did not want it to be stripped away to the point where little of it remained.</p><p>  In the pre-budget submission we made last year, we recommended that the threshold pertaining to the payment of VAT on a cashflow basis, rather than on an accruals basis, be increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million.  The Minister and the Department ultimately decided in the budget to increase it from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million.  The increase of &euro;250,000 was not enough to make a difference.  We felt that an increase to &euro;2 million could have made a difference.</p><p>  We try to come up with things that can be done, that will be essentially revenue neutral and that have great potential for the rebuilding of confidence.  We are trying to get people's mindset away from saving and paying down debt and towards the future.  That might encourage them to pursue the extension they have been putting off for five or six years.  I am sure the Department of Finance will have a view on the potential VAT loss.  That is where we have to examine things like how many households have formed during the last six years of recession, when we have not been doing any building.  Families with two children who are living in two-bedroom apartments and desperately need to move will need new carpets, curtains and televisions, etc.  All of that activity, on which the 23% rate of VAT is imposed, is not happening at the moment.</p> <p> Senator Quinn also mentioned procurement.  As I stated, while Chambers Ireland fully accepts that the Government needs to save money, be smart and so forth, we must represent our constituency, which is business.  Many small businesses which depend on relatively small contracts with local authorities for items such as stationary or paper clips are worried that these contracts will ultimately be provided in a single central contract.  Companies are concerned that local printing contracts may be lost to overseas companies.  I recognise the challenge presented by the requirement to strike a balance between protecting jobs and securing the best price for everything.  We met Mr. Paul Quinn, whom the Government recently appointed as head of procurement.  Mr. Quinn has some great ideas and we will seek to support him in his efforts.  Nevertheless, local chambers of commerce are afraid of the outcome to which centralised procurement may give rise.  This creates an issue for us in any of our outputs.</p><p> Senator Quinn and Deputy Collins raised issues in respect of information.  Chambers Ireland is concerned about information for small businesses.  If one considers the manner in which information is presented to businesses on the Government side, one has the county enterprise boards, which are migrating to local enterprise offices.  Although this migration has commenced, it is a matter of concern that the endpoint is not yet in sight.  The county enterprise boards typically focus on micro-enterprises with up to ten employees.  Enterprise Ireland deals with high-potential exporters and the IDA deals with foreign direct investors.  The vast majority of local businesses do not receive any State support for information content.  The chambers network has the Enterprise Europe network in place in five local offices, which provides additional assistance to those involved in the export market.  In most of the rest of Europe, chambers of commerce are public bodies that receive State funds to provide information to all businesses.  While the chambers network in Ireland seeks to fill the information gap, it is a membership-driven organisation and some companies do not see the value in joining a local chamber of commerce.  Fortunately, many companies do see the value, but they must help themselves.  It is frustrating that people do not read the information we make available or allow it to pass them by.  We will continue to push the Government to work closely with the chambers network as the local enterprise office network becomes established.  </p><p> The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is producing a service level agreement.  We are seeking to actively participate in the process to assist in setting out the role of the local enterprise offices, deciding how they will interact with chambers of commerce and other organisations in the communities and ensuring there is no duplication of effort.  For example, the chambers network could be undermined if a local enterprise office decides it wishes to do nothing more than run free networking events for non-members.  While the development of the local enterprise office network presents some challenges, Chambers Ireland is strongly focused on the need for companies to secure access to information.  We recognise, however, that irrespective of how hard one tries, some people will read information without taking it in. </p><p> On research and development, it is difficult for small companies to find out whom they should contact.  Chambers Ireland produced a book some years ago on in the seventh framework programme, FP7, and how companies can access it.  The latest framework programme is Horizon 2020 and Chambers Ireland will take an active role in this area.  It would be a good idea to impose on groups and organisations that receive a significant block of State funding an obligation to push some of their money out productively.</p><p> Mr. Murphy will elaborate a little on the French model.</p></speech>

This is a significant amount, yet the small and medium-sized enterprises that pay for it receive limited access to it.  I assure members that this will be reflected in our pre-budget submission.  Half of the &euro;330 million figure should be specifically earmarked for owner-managers and their management teams to help them upskill.  The major challenge is that a relatively small number of firms are involved in the export business and many of them are companies established through foreign direct investment.  Chocolatiers and so forth also export their products, but the vast majority of companies are domestically focused.  Training funds should be earmarked to assist companies seeking to export their products.  As far as our members are concerned, they do not receive any return on the levy on salaries they pay to the national training fund.  This money is washed into SOLAS and F&Aacute;S and does not come back to companies.  Our message is that half of the national training fund should be earmarked specifically for owner-managers and their management teams and staff for use in retraining.  While we want the unemployed to continue to receive retraining, ultimately it is viable firms producing viable jobs and taxes upon which the economy is built.</p></speech>

At one point, the scheme had a budget of approximately &euro;25 million, although this has since declined to approximately &euro;14.5 million.  The large sums F&Aacute;S used to spend on training people in employment have been substantially eliminated.  As Mr. Murphy indicated, I am a director of Skillnets.  While it is a very good model, its budget is relatively small in the scheme of things.</p></speech>

As we stated last year, more needs to be done to raise the profile of the seed capital scheme because people are not familiar with it.  Certainty about the scheme is poor, as is drawdown.  I recall a Deputy commenting last year that only one client in a particular operation had ever drawn down funds from the scheme.  There is considerable pent-up demand in this area which could be tapped.  </p><p>  It is sobering to note that whereas &euro;152 million was drawn down from the employment incentive and investment scheme in 2007, only &euro;20 million was drawn down from the scheme last year.  Demand has clearly collapsed.  The Government must take action to address this issue.  Measures it should consider include: the introduction of a seed employment investment incentive scheme; the removal of the high income earner restriction; the reinstatement of the minimum holding period for five years; and automatic qualification for medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas.  We have a number of other suggestions but our main point is that action is needed.  It is clear that something is wrong when the funding drawn down from a scheme declines from &euro;152 million to &euro;20 million.  This ties in with our critique that demand is a major issue.  If demand increased, debts would become much more manageable for everyone.  This is a major issue and must be addressed. </p><p>  As regards the French <i>contribution &eacute;conomique territoriale</i> scheme, having discussed the issue with some experts in this area, our view is that this scheme provides for a more nuanced approach to local taxes.</p></speech>

A retail mix is vital to attracting more consumers.  Certain categories of retail store are proliferating in Ireland.  All consumers, especially the young, have been willing to prioritise data and telecoms over fashions in recent years.  Every kid on the street seems to have a smartphone because that is where children's priorities lie.  This is reflected in the spread of telecommunications and telephone shops.  While such stores are a welcome addition to retail, if one wants to broaden the retail mix to attract mums and dads as well as teenagers, one needs to recognise and incentivise certain types of low-margin, high-employment retailers to locate in shopping streets.  The <i>contribution &eacute;conomique territoriale</i> gives the local taxation authorities more flexibility in prioritising investment in that regard.</p> <p>In terms of the people to whom we talk, our view would be that the northern version is somewhat blunt and could be more nuanced.  We can go into greater detail off-line, if needs be, for the Deputy.</p><p> As regards animating town centres, we are in favour of people living above shops.  However, the perennial problem in this regard is parking.  Letterkenny Town Council, working in conjunction with Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce, developed a great model of incentivising a turnover in respect of car parking.  As I understand it, this involves rotation cameras being used to measure the number of car turnover on the streets of the town.  The pricing model that has been put in place as a result has worked very well.  We can obtain more detail for the committee in that regard.  Ennis is bedevilled by a lack of parking.</p></speech>

The local chamber informs us that the town council has been extremely successful in changing the parking regime there.  Ennis has a very successful living-over-the-shop scheme but the difficulty which arises is that many of the people who now live in the town have their cars parked there all day.  Parking is, therefore, a real problem in Ennis.  As we understand it from our colleagues in Ennis Chamber of Commerce, not enough is being done in respect of this matter.  We should, by all means, incentivise people to live above shops but there is also a need for others to be able to drive their cars into and out of town centres.  Free parking for the first two hours should be mandatory all year round and not just in the three weeks leading up to Christmas.  In this way we could put an end to cars blocking up parking spaces and mothers, fathers and their children would be able to visit town centres.</p></speech>

Then when one earns one's money and pays one's tax, the amount in question would be offset.  It is really a cashflow mechanism - with a cap in place - to assist companies negotiate their early years in operation.  I accept that there are incentives in the first couple of years in respect of corporation tax, etc.  Some of this comes down to psychology rather than the amount of money involved.  We talk to many potential and existing entrepreneurs - people who have established businesses and who are considering setting up others - who are currently of the view that all that is happening at present is that rates are either being increased or maintained.  They are certainly not being reduced to the same extent as other costs.  In addition, they are of the view that new taxes on employment are forcing them to examine the position with regard to their employees' salaries.  Setting up a business is extremely hard work, particularly as the global economy is in such a mess.  The mechanism to which I refer is designed to give people something of a psychological boost to the effect that the State is behind entrepreneurs and is offering them a few incentives.</p><p>  In our critique of the ten-point plan in last year's budget we indicated that too many of the measures did not have much general applicability.  They were real niche mechanisms and hardly anyone qualified for them or the changes they introduced were so insignificant that they did not make a difference to anyone.  We tried, therefore, to come up with a few more targeted initiatives which could be applied more generally to people establishing businesses.  I am not sure that, in general terms, Irish people are disposed to accepting that entrepreneurialism is good.  I am of the view that people do not generally make the connection between entrepreneurs and job creation.</p></speech>

I have never met an entrepreneur or businessperson who set up an enterprise with the intention of failing.  Businesses can fail for many reasons.  Sometimes things may just not go right, the person involved might not have obtained the correct advice or the market might not have been there.  It can be difficult to break into markets, particularly if one is trying to expand and obtain support.  I agree with Mr. Murphy that we must do a great deal more in the context of providing supports and encouraging people to establish businesses.  Employing people is a huge issue for small businesses at present, particularly in light of the costs involved and all the extras which one must put in place.  Small businesses are obliged to shoulder the same burden as multinationals.  The position is similar, regardless of whether one has one member of staff or 2,000.  Obviously, there are far more supports for companies which employ 2,000 people.  Small business owners are obliged to try to do everything themselves, including sales, employing staff, ensuring cashflow, banking, etc.</p></speech>

We must do a great deal more, particularly in the context of providing soft supports.  Everyone present is aware of my interest in this regard, especially in the area of mentoring and how we can assist people.  There is major work to be done in respect of this matter by the LEOs.  I have stated on many previous occasions that we must stop placing people behind structures.  We spend far too much time discussing where particular LEOs should be located.  I really do not care whether they are located in Mallow, Cork city, Dublin or wherever.  I want those involved with them to go out and meet business people and ask how they can assist them.  Rather than networking, there is a need for real and much greater engagement.  Those to whom I refer must meet people face to face in order to discover what are the difficulties they face.  If this is done, we might then be able to solve some of those difficulties.</p></speech>

Retail is clearly facing a massive structural change in terms of the dash to purchasing online.  One cannot stop that so it is a question of how one addresses it.

If one lowers the base - by, for example, 2% - it has a huge effect on such companies.  The owners of small shops would be obliged to pay &euro;2,500 in rates.  This matter has always come down to how one achieves a balance.  For example, it could be linked to turnover.  Perhaps there is a need to separate them by sector as opposed to the rate base being calculated on the basis of square footage.</p></speech>

We addressed the group and the chairman and the president of Dungarvan Chamber of Commerce highlighted that the differential between Dungarvan and other areas of rural County Waterford is approximately 15% to 17%.</p> <p>The Government is sensitised to the issue of the discrete number of town councils wherein the rates are lower than for the county.  For example, the rates of Sligo town council are higher than those for the country and, therefore, their abolition is not of significant sensitivity to our chamber colleagues in Sligo.  This is a big issue in Letterkenny, Navan, Ennis, Dungarvan, Mallow and Midleton.  These are the areas for which the transition is of particular concern.

We have discussed the issue with Mr. Colm Lavery and are due to meet the Minister on these matters.  This is a matter of great concern to struggling towns, including Dungarvan, that have been through a lot during the past couple of years.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the budget with the committee in June, which is probably a first.  Following the presentation, which I will keep short, we are happy to take questions and debate.  We will make a formal pre-budget submission in the normal way this week.  We have not made a formal submission yet, but have a fair degree of clarity on the emerging issues and priorities for business in advance of budget 2014.  To provide some context, it will be useful for me to set out what IBEC is picking up from the business community and our 7,500 members on the performance of the economy over the first half of the year and the issues arising as a result.</p><p>  A useful approach is to discuss our domestic and export economies.  In the domestic economy, the jobs market, earnings growth, low inflation and falling interest rates look better than we thought they would halfway through 2013.  These are the fundamentals facing Irish consumers but improvements in them have not translated into spending.  The confidence genie remains absent from the Irish economy.  People's finances are perhaps in reasonable condition, but they do not have the confidence to spend meaningfully.  While clarity will be provided in the Central Statistics Office national accounts on Thursday, it appears that in the first quarter - and probably in the first half of the year - the consumer market was weak.  Despite things being a little better for consumers, they are not going out to spend.  The domestic side of the economy is quite disappointing.  On the export side, it is a really a tale of two different economies.  Our goods sector is finding trading conditions difficult.  Goods exports are down approximately 10% in the first quarter as our trading partners in the UK and the main European markets remain in a difficult place.  Our services sector continues to perform very strongly.  Exports will do fine this year, but it will all be on the back of services.</p><p>  We have made great inroads over the last couple of years on general competitiveness in the economy but still have a great deal to do.  A number of cost pressures and concerns for business are emerging.  Electricity costs, for example, are becoming a major issue.  On the employment costs front, voluntary health insurance is feeding in as a major cost for employers.  Approximately 70% of our members pay some or all of the voluntary health insurance contributions of their employees.  While it is a big cost for households, it is also a big cost for business.  It is a particular concern at the moment.</p><p>  IBEC is very conscious of the need to avoid coming to the committee with a shopping list of 101 things business would like to see in budget 2014.  We have clear priorities on the important issues and have five key messages on what government should do.  The first recommendation is on the scale of fiscal adjustment.  This feeds back very much to the weakness in the domestic economy.  While fundamentals have improved, spending has not come through.  The Government's plan to is to take a further &euro;3.1 billion out of the economy to put us on the path towards budget balance.  In our view, a great deal has changed in the last year.  Importantly, we have seen concessions in the promissory notes restructuring.  We are ahead of where we thought we would be on our budget deficit targets.  For the first time since the start of the crisis, the Government has a choice.  Until now, we have said the Government had no choice but to live with planned austerity.</p><p>  The Government should choose to implement somewhat less austerity.  We suggest an adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion instead of &euro;3.1 billion and there should be no further additional tax increases.  We accept that &euro;500 million in tax increases are already in the pipeline, but there is no need to announce additional taxation measures in budget 2014.  If we deliver an adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion, we will still reach comfortably the budget deficit target.  The very clear message it would give to Irish households is that the worst of the austerity is behind us, evidenced by a tangible impact of the restructuring of the promissory notes and the strong performance on budget deficit targets.  It would not affect us in the bond markets and we would bring growth back to the economy.  The upside would not be new taxes through higher tax rates, it would be higher tax revenue through buoyancy.  We must focus on growth.</p> <p>If we can create buoyancy by saying to householders there will be no new taxes in budget 2014, it will have a big impact on the Exchequer finances and on employment and activity in the domestic economy.  That is message No. 1.</p><p> Message No. 2 is also related to the domestic economy.  It is about the initiatives IBEC introduced in the jobs initiative package when the Government first came into office.  We think those initiatives, the reduced rate of VAT for the hospitality and related sectors and the lower rate of employers' PRSI for those on lower incomes, have really worked.  We have seen a significant employment dividend, in particular, in the hospitality sector.  It has protected many vulnerable jobs in the cost-sensitive sectors of the economy.  Here we have a stimulus package that has really made a difference.  It has more than paid for itself.  It is being funded through a pensions levy with which we never agreed, but that pensions levy will exist in 2014 as well.  Our view is that the initiatives to which I refer that are working should be retained for at least another year, and then see where we are in terms of the state of the economy.</p><p> Our third priority relates to employment costs.  I mentioned in the overview that while we have regained competitiveness, there are still many competitiveness pressures in the economy, such as labour costs and energy cost, which are a concern for many of our members.  On the employment cost front, we have spoken to the committee about statutory sick pay proposals which we always felt would simply result in job losses in the private sector and in enterprise.  Specifically, the medical health insurance costs are becoming a significant item on the agenda for the chief financial officers and human resources directors in many companies.  Those companies that are carrying the tab for health insurance costs are really noticing those cost increases.  I appreciate households are noticing them as well but from an employment point of view, they now are really on the radar.  They are a high-cost item.  Where we are seeing increases in the region of 10%, 15% and 20%, and perhaps more with further policy changes, it is a real cost concern on the labour cost front for businesses.</p><p> The fourth priority item would be the competitiveness of Ireland's business tax offering.  I suppose the business tax agenda has been very much in the media spotlight and the subject of debate over recent months, but one of the points that maybe has not been picked up as strongly as it should have been is that our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, is becoming increasingly aggressive and successful in competing for mobile investment.  The United Kingdom is probably now our single biggest competitor on many mobile investment projects.  Five or ten years ago, the United Kingdom would not really have been in that place.  It would not have been seen as a serious competitor.  With the United Kingdom's corporation tax rate heading down to 20% and with the type of supports it has brought in on intellectual property and what it is doing for research and development, it has really upped its game.  The United Kingdom has the ability to attract much of inward investment.  It remains to be seen whether the United Kingdom's decisions on Europe will be an advantage or a disadvantage on the competitiveness front.  That has yet a long way to run.</p><p> From an Irish point of view, we need to continue to look at our business tax offering.  Specifically, we refer in our pre-budget process to the research and development tax credit scheme, which has been in place for approximately ten years.  The Department of Finance is conducting a major review of that scheme this year.  We believe it is important that the scheme continues to be supported and that it can be enhanced, as we would see it, in a cost-minimal way.  The scheme is really making a difference in terms of creating jobs in the economy, particularly high-tech, high end research and development jobs.  When one looks at the numbers in terms of the volume of research and development now being conducted in the economy and the number engaged in research and development employment, we have performed strongly.  Here we have a Government initiative that is working, making a difference and making Ireland much more attractive in terms of winning those mobile investment projects, but there is more that can be done and we would see it as a particular area of focus.</p><p> On the final point of our brief introduction, priority No. 5 relates very much to the domestic entrepreneurial investment climate.  There are two specific issues.  Overall, in terms of context, we think that the real growth in this economy, when we head into meaningful recovery, will come from the SME sector.  We think there lies the real untapped potential of the economy.  There are two things we see holding that back: the area of investment finance and investment capital remains a challenging one; and the fact that we are really missing out on the potential of the employment investment and incentive scheme.  The scheme, the follow-on to the business expansion scheme, BES, really is not working.  It is a great scheme in terms of what it could potentially do but what it is actually doing is quite disappointing.  I would love to see us being able to put new energy into that, provide new branding and promotion, and get real strong ownership from Government of the potential for that scheme.  When we look back over the past decade in the economy at how much money we all invested as households in unproductive assets, property, etc., if we could only get a fraction of that funding into businesses, SMEs and start-ups, it could really make a difference to the investment outlook.  The scheme is in place.  There is a couple of tweaks that it needs.  What it really needs is a bit of re-energy, re-branding and promotion.  It could make a big difference.</p><p> My final point on that overall domestic entrepreneurial investment climate is around capital gains tax.  We now have a punitive rate of capital gains tax in Ireland, at 33%.  It has increased sharply over recent budgets.  We would like to see Government give consideration to providing an entrepreneur's relief to make a distinction between speculative investment in the economy and core entrepreneurial investment that supports employment and drives job creation.  We need a distinction between what that cohort of businesses is doing and how it is treated in terms of capital gains versus the speculative sector of the economy.  We would not deny that the low rate of capital gains tax played a role in the speculative bubble, but what we are seeing increasingly internationally is this distinction between the enterprise gains in the productive sector and those speculative gains.  In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a special relief for entrepreneurs.  In Ireland, at present, if a person who has been successful in setting up a company and, as many company founders are doing, sells it, there is no incentive to keep that investment in the economy.  There is nothing in the tax system to encourage investment in a new start-up or in a couple of new growth companies.  The Government is missing a trick there in terms of sending strong messages about the overall entrepreneurial climate, specifically a signal that if one sets up a business and takes the risks, one will be rewarded, and if one re-invests that money, the tax system recognises that.</p><p> We have not come in with a long shopping list.  There are five issues.  I am happy to hear comments, questions and reaction to them, as are my colleagues.</p></speech>

Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne and I had a fairly good discussion with Ms Suonper&auml; and IBEC west members in Galway last week, so I will keep my questions relatively brief.</p><p>  I agree with IBEC's, as it were, austerity-lite proposals.  What would Mr. O'Brien say to the argument that some would put forward that if we go the way IBEC suggests, it will send out a wrong message that we are easing off too early and there is a danger that in doing so because we will begin to lose the confidence of the markets?  On the specific proposal of the suggested adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion instead of &euro;3.1 billion, what forecasted rate of growth for the economy underpins the IBEC proposal?</p><p>  On employment costs, I am completely with IBEC.  My party tabled a Private Members' motion on sick pay last year.  Would Mr. O'Brien reiterate the figures on the health costs, particularly the percentage of IBEC members who pay health costs for their employees?  How does that rate, in terms of competitor countries, for what Mr. O'Brien called mobile investment?  Is that a particularly Irish phenomenon or do all Ireland's competitor countries in this mobile investment area pay health cover as well?</p><p>  On business financing, would Mr. O'Brien update the committee on where IBEC's members are in relation to finance generally and bank credit?  Why, in its members' view, is there a relatively low uptake of the two schemes?  We are trying to get our heads around that in particular.  I welcome IBEC's proposal for an entrepreneur capital gains relief.  How much would that cost in a 12 month period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500012#L00500"><p>I welcome the IBEC representatives and thank them for the efforts they have made to bring forward positive suggestions with regard to the growth of the economy.</p><p>  At the start, I suppose I could agree with Mr. O'Brien that the emphasis needs to be on growth and away from austerity, and that one of the most important elements of the economy right now is expectations.  If people believe that tomorrow will be worse than today, there will be no spending.  If people believe that tomorrow will be a better day, that expectations element is really important.</p> <p>While IBEC is against new additional taxes, what is its view on types of taxes such as the water charge and property tax which are not dependent on income?  IBEC&rsquo;s analysis referred to significant gains in employment in the hospitality sector.  Can the delegation go into more detail on this?</p><p> Our focus has been on reducing businesses&rsquo; cost base before looking at employment costs, because a significant element of society is in poverty.  For example, electricity and diesel costs are the fourth highest in Europe.  There are also issues such as high charges for professional services, rents and rates.  However, sometimes the average wage cost hides the distribution of wages.  One could have variability between upper and lower wages but still have a high average wage.  Does the delegation have any information on this?</p><p> The largest take-up of research and development has been with multinationals.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are key to economic growth.  There is a danger that export growth could be jobs free.  The SME sector is critical for job creation.  How can we incentivise more take-up of research and development by our indigenous SME sector?</p><p> Chambers Ireland also proposed a cut in the capital gains tax rate.  IBEC proposed an incentive scheme to allow for re-investment of capital gains profits into business.  Could the delegation give more detail on how this incentive would work to get entrepreneurs to lock such gains into re-investment?</p></speech>

While the markets are examining how the public finances are being fixed, they are also looking at growth in the economy.  We could keep delivering on market expectations on austerity.  However, if we disappoint on growth rates, one could give up what one gained for good fiscal housekeeping.  We think consumer spending is pent up and it will be unleashed when confidence comes back.  While 85% of the fiscal adjustment is behind us and budgets will get easier at some stage, consumers do not believe that.  The time horizon is so distant for them, it is not influencing their decisions on consumption.  There has to be a tangible benefit and dividend for householders that we have done the hard yards, restructured promissory notes and outperformed in reducing the budget deficit.</p><p>  Will the bond markets penalise us for lessening austerity?  I do not think so excessively.  I believe it would be a strategy worth pursuing in what it would give us in growth and jobs.  Our current growth forecast for next year is 2.5%.  We have a good deal of room for manoeuvre within that in terms of doing less austerity and still reaching a budget deficit target of under 5%.</p></speech>

That is a conservative estimate and does not factor in any growth bounds from lessened austerity.  Conceivably, if a little more was done on the tax side, there would be stronger growth.</p></speech>

The State would get back the revenue on the buoyancy side.</p><p>  Our surveys show that 70% of our members are paying some or all of the health insurance costs of their employees.  It has become a significant labour cost item and has registered with the multinational sector.  It is a concern.</p><p>  There is some unmet demand in access and availability of credit.  Our real concern is where the investment finance will come from when we return to growth.  Have we a sufficiently robust and healthy banking system that can provide that investment finance?  As we have told the committee in the past, Ireland was excessively reliant on banking finance in the past.  This will have to change and we are going to need a much more diverse funding model.  We would see schemes from Enterprise Ireland, such as the employment investment incentive scheme, and other funding mechanisms such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund playing a role in diversifying availability of credit.  The employment investment incentive scheme is not really delivering and it can be adjusted to make it work.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on consumer expectations.  People feel more taxes will be introduced and we are still waiting for consumer confidence to come back.  The savings ratio is still incredibly high and there is no sign of it coming down.  If there were a greater certainty for households, spending would come back because the capacity to spend is evident in the savings ratio.</p><p>  We have detailed analysis of the jobs benefit of the measures introduced to help the hospitality sector.  We are making a submission on this to the Government tomorrow which we will also send to the committee.  Our analysis shows these measures really worked, brought in jobs, revenue for the Government and are worth keeping.  Given the wider fragility in the domestic economy, it is far too early to remove these emergency measures.</p><p>  Electricity costs to business have come to the top of the agenda again.  In particular, large energy users tend to be in internationally competitive sectors.  For some businesses it can be a really large cost item.</p> <p>Very often, it can be non-pay labour costs, for example pensions.  We see many employers who are still trying to work through issues such as defined-benefit pension schemes, which carry incredible costs.  Health insurance costs are also an issue.  While we do not have useful international comparators, we know that in countries where business pays somewhat higher social insurance costs, that buys a great deal for employees in pension and health benefits.  Employers do not have to pick up that tab.  In Ireland, much of the cost is on a certain cohort of employers - the larger ones which are competing internationally.  They are more likely to have pension schemes and health insurance.  They carry a great deal of additional cost in terms of their fully loaded labour costs.  In Germany, social insurance contributions pay for pensions and the bulk of health care.  In Ireland, they do not and much of the cost is left with the employer.</p><p> We have done a great deal of detailed work on the research and development tax credit, feeding into the Department of Finance review.  I will send the details of the work to the committee.  I fully agree on the significant challenge on take-up among SMEs.  We have suggested to the Department of Finance that there would be considerable merit in having what may be termed a &quot;research and development light&quot; scheme for SMEs.  It is complex, involving a great deal of heavy tax analysis and issues of defining research and development activity.  It would be useful to have a simpler, <i>pro-forma</i>scheme for SMEs, published by Revenue and promoted by Enterprise Ireland.  Many SMEs are carrying out research and development but do not realise it.  They are not getting support and a dedicated scheme could make a real difference.  I am happy to send our specific suggestions in that regard to the committee and to engage on them afterwards.</p></speech>

It is always nice to have IBEC in.  We are here in good time.  We have discussed the budget a great deal already.  The Small Firms Association attended in that regard.  The witnesses will be glad to know regarding their first suggestion that the Minister for Finance will report back to us in September to let us know the figures and what he will do with regard to the budget and austerity measures.</p><p>  I agree that VAT reductions for the tourism and hospitality sectors have worked very well.  We would all like to see the measure continued and carried over to other sectors, particularly the building trade.  Employment costs are important, particularly from the point of view of small businesses who take on staff.  We have all realised finally that it is the small businesses that will be the backbone of the country and create the jobs.  I mentioned the research and development tax credit earlier.  It must be extended.  By 2020, we must be investing three times more in research and innovation than we are investing now.  We must start the process.  I agree with the idea of a light scheme for small companies, many of which are conducting research but not getting support.  This goes back to my earlier comment on business supports, of which we do not have enough.  It is time to do more for small businesses and to make supports more accessible.  Now is the time to do so with the introduction of LEOs and the realignment of Leader programmes.  We need far better supports, improved accessibility and improved qualifications among those providing supports.</p><p>  Tax investment is interesting.  I speak about it a great deal.  The employment incentive scheme and the seed capital scheme have not been taken up.  A business has to spend the money before it can recover it through the seed capital scheme.  I wonder if there is an alternative.  A business must invest the money in its capital.  Could not a person who sets up a business just claim it back even if he or she did not invest it in the company?  There should be an easier way to make that happen.  When we changed the old BEF scheme to the employment incentive scheme, it no longer seemed to have the same bite.  How can we improve access to it?  My view is that anyone who invests in a new business should get tax relief.  That is all probably angel investment, which we should have if we are serious about entrepreneurship and growing the economy.  Is it something we could look at in terms of the employment incentive scheme?  I would be delighted if Mr. O'Brien and Ms Fitzpatrick could send me any information they have in that regard.</p></speech>

I attended with Deputy Calleary and others a meeting in Galway a couple of weeks ago at which we went through a number of the points under discussion today.  Does IBEC have a concern about the earlier timing of the budget given that November is the key tax month to plan for things?  Is there a concern about a possible impact on the validity of the budget figures?  It has been noted repeatedly that people have significant savings and that there are issues of confidence.  Despite the deficit narrowing and the assurances which have been made, is the departure of the troika what is ultimately required as the trigger for spending?</p><p>  At the meeting in Galway, a number of issues of concern were raised, including health costs.  Concern was also expressed on the ease of obtaining sick certificates and about litigation costs which multinationals must report back to the USA.  Are those representative of people's concerns?  The witnesses referred to reductions in corporate tax rates and better incentives in the UK.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the impact of uncertainty on the UK into the future.  Is there scope in the period of uncertainty for us to regain some ground, emphasise what we have here and improve it?  There is concern that multinationals might suddenly depart from the EU.</p></speech>

I am thinking in particular of construction.  The bulk of unemployed people are on the construction side of things.  A lower VAT rate for construction was mentioned.  An alternative approach might be a grants system for the extension or renovation of houses.  That would get the smaller operator involved.  We often talk about the small businessman, who in this context is the plumber and small builder.  Nothing has been put in place for them.  Nationally, it is all about large contracts for roads etc.  If IBEC has any ideas in that regard, I would like to hear them.</p><p>  On employment incentives, I have people telephoning me all the time asking if anything is available.  There does not seem to be anything.  I understand about PRSI, but people are looking for grants to take on someone extra.  While they can take a person on part-time, they would like to take him or her on full-time to grow the business.  Could something be made available for that?  People talk to me about information.  SMEs are finding it difficult to locate information.  There is a raft of schemes which are available to them but they do not seem to be all in the one spot.  We have spoken before about creating a portal of some kind.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Collins that there are more schemes to be developed and more creative ways to do things.  Right now, however, we have a great many schemes and supports.  The problem is that small businesses, in particular, including the one and two-man shows to which Deputy Lawlor referred, do not know where to go to access information.  If they do access information, they may not understand it.  They do not have time to look.</p> <p>We must make a real concerted effort, not only in terms of a portal.  We should provide both technical solutions and people solutions, involving bringing people together to work on this over a period of time of perhaps six or nine months, and really target the information to the relevant persons.  We could do that through collaboration between business and Government.  We could work out easily who are the ones who need what particular information.  In a short period of time, we could do something to get the word out there.  Of course, once one business benefits from something, that is the reference and it will travel like wildfire.  People pick up information from their peers.  It would be worthwhile putting a concerted effort into that.  In fact, I am chatting to Microfinance Ireland.  Obviously, it is confident in the scheme but it knows it is not getting the take-up that it should.  They are going to see how we, across IBEC, can pick the relevant persons from the relevant sectors that are the appropriate size that would benefit from that kind of funding.  Those are the kinds of efforts.  They are time consuming.  They take commitment on everyone's part but those are the kinds of lengths to which we must go to get the message out there.</p><p> I would make one other comment, on what Deputy Kyne stated about the troika.  I happen to believe at this stage that the troika is wallpapered to the Irish people, particularly since Mr. Chopra left in a visible way.  I think the people have turned off to that completely.  I do not believe the fact that the guys will not be visible anymore will have any impact whatsoever.  That is merely an anecdotal observation.</p></speech>

On the issue of sticking to the adjustment and using what might be spare for investment, I can see the merit in that.  We need investment in the economy, but there are other ways we can get that investment outside of the Exchequer.  Given what households have gone through over the past number of years, I am not sure it is right to tax people more so that we can pick investment projects.  Because we have done the hard yards on the public finances, we have options for investment.  Companies have money to invest if we give them the right incentives.  We can look at public-private partnerships in the public capital investment projects.</p><p>  I very much agree with Deputy Lawlor on trying to generate activity for the small contractors.  We have a specific proposal for a home improvement scheme.  We have looked at half a dozen schemes internationally.  They all work and pay for themselves, and the cost-benefit analysis is all there.  We will provide that to the committee in the full submission.  From our point of view, one of the great benefits of such a scheme would be one gets a great regional distribution of the activity.  At present, the Dublin economy is doing okay.  Outside of Dublin is not so good.  It is a case of whether we could get something that would really get around the country and get at the unemployment problem, particularly among the former construction workers.  Home improvement has the potential to do that.  We have seen half a dozen schemes that have worked really well and we have a sense of frustration that we have not been able to gain traction on this domestically.  We would be happy to engage with the Deputy on the detail of that.  We have a good deal of detail and analysis on that in a separate paper.</p></speech>

However, that also means that one might not have that investment in place next year or the year after, whereas easing back on the austerity and on the tax hikes has an immediate pay-off in terms of the economy.</p></speech>

It also is taking a little time to gain traction.  Previously, we probably had too many employment support schemes.  Ms Fitzpatrick would be aware of the work we did on awareness and the awareness of the available schemes was poor.  The tidying up into that single jobs plus scheme will help.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Kyne on the points about the timing of the budget, obviously, there are issues around so much of that tax coming in in the key month of November.  I suppose our main reflection is on the potential for giving certainty in the domestic economy.  Having the budget two weeks before Christmas always killed the retail sector over the past couple of years.  We would see significant benefit in bringing the budget back to October and trying to provide certainty.  If, in particular, there was a budget with less or no tax increases, we could have a great Christmas out of it.  Moving it out of the Christmas shopping period is a real positive.</p><p>  We must wait and see whether we will have to go back to look at the timing of some of the tax payments.  Overall, what we would like to see long term is that budget day becomes less of a big issue, that we do not see as many surprises, that we operate more on genuine multi-year budgeting activity and that consumers are not getting surprises or shocks when it comes to budget day.  In the short term, there probably still are some risks.</p><p>  The sick certificates issue has come up with many employers, particularly with all the debate about sick pay over the past couple of years.  It seems particularly easy in Ireland to get sick certificates.  It is commented on by those who have international experience.  We also see it showing up in terms of the numbers of recipients on illness benefit.  When one compares those numbers internationally, they are high.  That is part of the challenge.</p><p>  In terms of the United Kingdom attractiveness for investment, I suppose I am unclear whether it will be an advantage or a disadvantage.  Business does not like uncertainty.  I could see why some deciding on big investment in the United Kingdom, particularly if it is a big infrastructure investment, such as energy, might ask over the coming years where the United Kingdom will be in terms of EU energy policy.  One could see such concerns.  However, it could give them more flexibility.  They have been very aggressive on mobile investment.  They are now a real competitor for us and we need to watch them.  On a regular basis, we see professional services companies from the United Kingdom over here pitching the attractiveness of companies moving to the United Kingdom.  These will not only be foreign companies.  We will see Irish companies potentially move their operations to the United Kingdom as there is a more attractive offering over there.</p><p>  I thank Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins for her comments.  On the seed capital scheme, if one asks, not only those out on the street but small business persons and entrepreneurs, what is the EIIS or the seed capital scheme, they just do not know.  It is a shame.  On the EIIS, we have a couple of specific proposals looking at what they have done in other countries within the state-aid rules.  The issue one runs up against here when the Government is providing tax relief to invest in business is always whether it is within state-aid rules.  We have looked in detail at those state-aid rules and we think there is more we could do on potential risk sharing.  One of the key challenges is that, traditionally, it was a small cohort who invested in BES and we need to widen the net.  We need to get the more typical household investor.  They will have a different risk profile and we need to change the scheme to reflect their risk profile.  There is significant untapped potential in terms of those who might invest in Irish business and jobs, if they were given the rightly packaged and promoted scheme.  I will not give up on it yet.  It is something we can turn around, but it needs to be changed, re-branded and better promoted.</p></speech>

That seems to have significant potential worldwide.</p><p>  If I may, I will ask a question about credit.  One of the initiatives on which we are working in Cork is looking at putting philanthropic donations into a fund to try to fill the gap where people can encounter difficulty in getting funding for entrepreneurship.  Often, where they get a certain amount from the bank or a certain amount from Enterprise Ireland or whatever source from which they get a grant, there is a gap for which they need either bridging finance or matching funding of 50% or 25%.  It is the first time this has been done in Ireland and we are trying to create a philanthropic fund, work on the diaspora, etc.  This is huge in Israel.  I wonder whether IBEC has any thoughts on that or any comments to make on it.  Many have been saying we need far more different types of financing, as opposed to bank financing, for entrepreneurship.</p></speech>

Even though I am an economist who is familiar with the scheme, if I do not think about it for a day I forget what it stands for.</p> <p>It does not convey that it is about investing in Irish SMEs.</p><p> On the sick certificates and sickness pay, it is quite important to note that introducing a sick pay scheme is not an incentive for the private sector to bring down its absenteeism levels.  Our research shows that absenteeism levels in business are already quite low.  Employers find different ways of managing it, through perhaps not giving sick pay for the first couple of days of sick leave where they have a sick pay scheme.  That is to give a little context for the sick certificates debate.</p></speech>

The fact that Irish business is 95% reliant on bank funding for financing is something that simply must change.  We must look at every possible stream.  Ireland has the unique potential of the diaspora.  Very often it is branding, packaging and promoting, and people will support these things and buy into them.  Again, we would be happy to follow up on whatever proposal is being worked on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013062500016#P00300"><p>I thank Ms Fitzpatrick, Ms Suonper&auml; and Mr. O'Brien for coming to the meeting today.  I appreciate the discussion.  It was important that they came.  Last year they had a very significant influence regarding the area of additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, and that was an IBEC proposal.  It was two years old at that stage but they made a presentation to the committee and many members took it on and tried to get the message across, as I am sure the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform did as well.  The Jobs Plus scheme also came through from the witnesses and the Small Firms Association as regards trying to target those schemes.  It is worth our while to invite them to appear before the committee to discuss initiatives that we can try to take on and drive.</p><p>  The issue of trying to get all the information together for business people is something we have discussed a few times at the committee, including with the witnesses.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is working on that document and I understand the Taoiseach's office is trying to finish putting it together.  We believe it will be very presentable and will show all the different services across government to help people in business and in employment.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, will help.  If they are implemented correctly, they should be one-stop-shops to provide that type of service and advice.</p><p>  I believe we need to sell our schemes.  Until the day we have someone going into a business to sell the various initiatives, they will not work fully.  We have to believe in them.  Sometimes we might be afraid there will be too much take-up and we do not talk about them in case people go for them.  However, we need to believe in them and push them because they will create jobs.  There are many good initiatives available if we push them.  Working with the witnesses, it is to be hoped we can do more on that.</p><p>  I have two or three questions.  I welcome the witnesses' key messages and I hope they are all implemented in terms of domestic demand and keeping the cost of business down, even in the area of research and development.  Must we do more to help businesses in exporting?  Can we do more as regards information and networking?  I attended a good event recently when Consulting Ireland launched its cluster initiative in Enterprise Ireland.  It is a programme that will run for the next nine or ten months and it aims to help businesses win contracts abroad.  Every day, there are 200,000 contracts to be won and Ireland does not get its fair share of them.  It appears we are not chasing them.  I realise many of them are through consulting as well, but many of them are public sector contracts.  We are ideally situated for them and they could lead on to more business.  Do we need to do more to encourage that type of work and to encourage network building?  If the witnesses cannot respond to that today, perhaps they could respond to us later.  Last year's budget tried to help people exporting into new markets, but we probably need to do more.  We can never do enough, I suppose, so perhaps the witnesses would give us their thoughts on that.</p><p>  In the same area of business, export credit insurance still seems to be an issue.  The committee has been told it is not, but I believe it is.  Businesses are telling us they have problems and concerns trading abroad.  There are different initiatives in that regard aside from straightforward export credit insurance.  Irish companies do not use invoice discounting or factoring of debts.  There is a very low take-up of that service in this country as well.  Is there a reason for that?</p><p>  To follow up on that, the witnesses might be familiar with the single euro payments area, SEPA, and the area of business to business, B2B.  Irish banks are not keen on implementing that.  Next February there is a commitment to do it for the ordinary domestic customer but not business to business.  Is that something that should concern us?  Is there a reason for it?  I am concerned about it and certain businesses have raised it with me and told me it will leave them at a disadvantage.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  If they cannot deal with it today, perhaps they would refer back to the committee at another time.  It is something the committee might have to take on as well.</p></speech>

At this stage we are communicating with our banking sector members, the Central Bank and the members affected by the changes.  We are trying to work towards a solution on it.  It is a European regulation coming down the tracks and, unfortunately, there will not be a B2B scheme in place by 1 February next year no matter what, so at this point it is a case of trying to work with the concerned parties to try to find a solution.  It is something of which we are well aware.</p></speech>

That does not make sense.  If it will be available for individuals, one would imagine it is possible for business to business as well.  The banks are committed to doing it for individuals next year, but not for business to business, or am I not understanding it correctly?</p></speech>

The issue is that under the SEPA rules, there is a core scheme that is being implemented in all the euro area countries and there is a separate business to business scheme that has different rules and regulations, which is an optional scheme.  Effectively, the banks here would have to implement two different schemes and because of the financial constraints they are operating under, they are only doing one scheme at present.</p></speech>

The particular concern in Ireland at present is that we continue to have very fragile credit conditions and this is potentially something that could further stress the credit conditions of businesses involved in a business to business supply chain.  That is the nub of the problem.  It would be useful for the committee to look at it in detail.  It is very much accentuated in Ireland by the difficult credit conditions we continue to have.</p></speech>

Again, it is a function of the challenging banking conditions we have here and there are also some issues specific to Ireland in that respect.  On the wider system of supports for exporters, we increasingly see more demand for the softer supports.  While Enterprise Ireland does much great work in helping exporting companies, there are obviously only so many clients it can help.  Those wider networks, wider supports and the information schemes are all incredibly important.  We see many companies that were previously solely reliant on the domestic market successfully making that transition, but for many of the small companies with limited management resources it is a big challenge.  The focus in particular should be on those softer supports or on helping the exporters.  A great deal more could be done.</p></speech>

As agreed by the committee at its meeting on 22 May 2013, I propose that there will be no opening statements and that the committee will proceed to consider the Revised Estimate programme by programme.  Each programme will be considered under the following headings: context and impact indicators; key outputs; financial and human resource inputs; and 2014 allocation and targets.  Administration will be considered under these headings when each of the programme areas have been disposed of.  In view of the limited time available in 2013 as a result of the budget being brought forward to October, there may be an element of engagement in respect of 2014 allocations when the 2013 Estimates are being considered.  I propose that questions on the programmes be taken together and the Minister of State can then respond to them.</p></speech>

To what did this cost relate?  The subhead also indicates an increase of approximately 20% in the cost of insurance policies in 2013.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on that matter?  The number of traffic movements at State airports increased slightly during the past two years but this would seem to have been at the expense of some of the regional airports.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  My final question relates to the fact that non-pay administration costs have risen by approximately 12.5% in 2013.  What was the reason for this increase?</p></speech>

I am interested in Knock Airport and I note an increase in numbers there up to almost 700,000.  Will the Minister of State comment on the traffic numbers for the regional airports?</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley asked about the allocation of &euro;10 million.  Between &euro;4 million and &euro;10 million is spent on public service obligation air services and contracts for the Donegal to Dublin and Kerry to Dublin routes.  The operational expenditure subvention is &euro;3.27 million to cover losses in the airports in Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford and to provide core airport facilities, air traffic control, security, safety and emergency services, etc.  The &euro;4 million capital figure will be spent on safety and security-related projects which are necessary to ensure compliance with domestic and international regulations at all four airports.</p></speech>

The increasing capital costs to which the Deputy referred are for some safety-related improvements that are required in certain places.  The question of insurance policies was examined.  It has been provisionally included because there was a larger outturn last year, but we expect it will not be 20% over; we believe it will fall back.  The non-pay administration costs that arose were mostly related to the EU Presidency.</p><p>  Deputy Elllis asked the same question on the non-pay figure.  Miscellaneous aviation services relates to various subscriptions that we must make to various European and international organisations in the aviation area because of the relationships that have to be managed and the organisations that we must be a part of.  That is part of the overall aviation provision.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming raised a query about Kerry.  The PSO will continue, as I have stated, and the position is the same as for the other airports.  All the regional airports are, in one way or another, competing with one another for services and for this reason we monitor the level of co-operation.  They are all competing for passenger services.</p><p>  As the Vice Chairman is aware, there is a plan in place for Knock Airport and we expect a report in the coming months.  I imagine the Vice Chairman is well up to speed on that.  The traffic numbers to which the Vice Chairman referred are the total numbers for all the regional airports.  They vary from time to time for various reasons.  There was nothing too concerning in those figures from a departmental point of view.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State believe it is possible for Ireland's public road network to be maintained when the overall budget is reduced by 24%?  Obviously, the reduction will have a significant impact on our transport network.  Will the Minister of State explain what analysis he has carried out, what strategic thinking has gone into the decision and how he can justify such a significant cut?  There is also a claim that approximately 2,800 km of regional and local roads were maintained and 2,575 km of regional and local roads were improved in 2012.  Can these modest targets for 2013 be achieved given all the cuts the Minister of State has set out?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I realise there has been a considerable drop in road deaths but why are we reducing that figure if we want to maintain the progress we have made?  It is a substantial amount.</p><p>  The public service provision payment has been reduced considerably by approximately &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million.  If we keep reducing the provision the effects in the long term in terms of keeping public transport going will be significant.  I become concerned when we make these reductions while other European countries contribute far more than we do to public transport.</p><p>  Will the Minister of State indicate the position on the public transport investment programme?  The Estimate represents an increase.  Will the Minister of State give an idea of what extras will be included?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52013062500003#B01400"><p>My first question relates to our regional road network.  At the moment we are significantly neglecting the upkeep and general improvement and maintenance of this network of roads.  They are very important to rural Ireland in particular.  There are several instances in my county.  I imagine the Minister of State is familiar with the R577 that stretches from Castleisland in the centre of my county to the Cork border and on to Mallow.  The road is in a sub-standard condition and it epitomises and reflects the situation more generally.  There should be a significant concentration on those roads because they are very important for the whole transport system.  They are important for the rural bus transport system.  It is vital to ensure the upkeep and continual improvement of our local and county road network.</p><p>  There is a form of discrimination.  In a way, I offer my compliments for making available moneys for some of our tertiary roads, but is the distribution consistent and fair?</p> <p>There is the general neglect of rural areas and, on the other side of the coin, in urban areas people are not obliged to contribute towards any service.  Under the new scheme people in remote areas with tertiary roads must pay upfront to get their road improvements carried out.  This is widening the gulf between urban areas and remote rural areas.  We need to strike a balance here.  We cannot tax people out of living in their localities.  In one way I compliment the Minister of State on making this money available as it gives people an opportunity.  However, in these very straitened times it is another burden on people trying to live in the environment where they were born and reared.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-25a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52013062500004#C00200"><p>I will deal with the issue of roads in general.  We never have enough money for roads.  The general Exchequer situation means that we do not have the allocations we want.  We accept that and are trying to do the best we can with what we have.  Given the budget constraints and the impact of reduced maintenance spending, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I decided to channel all available resources to maintenance and rehabilitation work to protect the investment that has been made.  This means that funding for major construction or realignment of schemes for regional and local roads has been discontinued.  In recent weeks, we have found an extra &euro;50 million for regional and local roads, which was badly needed, and I welcome it.  We also put forward a pilot community involvement scheme.  I note Deputy Tom Fleming's comments go both ways on this in supporting it and suggesting people cannot take the burden.  However, it does not need to be a financial contribution and can be in other forms also.  We will see how that goes.  We are trying to get more with less with the budget we have.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley has said it is hard to justify the level of funding but we simply do not have the money.  In the national recovery plan published by the previous Government the total funding allocated to roads over the period was less than we are giving.  From that point of view we are putting in more than the previous Government thought was feasible, but it still is not enough.  We need to work as much as possible with local authorities and we are trying our best.</p><p>  We need to support the local authorities that are doing their best.  While they get substantial funding from central government, they also have their own means of funding.  Some local authorities contribute considerable funding towards their local roads and others do not.  I believe we should give more support to those that are making a greater contribution.  It is depressing that some local authorities have actually dropped their allocation substantially while depending on the Exchequer for more funding.  Given the extent of the road network which is considerably beyond the European norm, we are doing our best with the funds we have.  We are trying a few schemes and we are closing out a number of projects.  At national level we are trying a number of public private partnerships, PPPs, as everyone is aware.</p></speech>

However, recognising that the State now has savings of in excess of &euro;1 billion as a result of the deal on the promissory notes, we are all in a different position.  If we were drafting documents at the moment, the Minister of State and I would probably have two different documents.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not been able to estimate that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will benefit in some way resulting in our citizens benefiting from the savings.</p></speech>

There will be discussions on the matter of the promissory notes.  We will discover the implications of that in the near future.  As the Deputy knows we will have an early budget this year.</p><p>  Deputy Ellis asked a very good question about the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  If this is not viewed in the broader sense, one could imagine there might be a problem.  The real issue is that the RSA is raising more revenue than it ever did, which is why we do not need to allocate it so much.  It is a fantastic organisation and is doing a very good job.  In addition to its good advocacy work, it is also making more money.  The total spend from a safety point of view has not decreased.  However, the percentage of funding it is generating itself as opposed to from the Department is changing.</p><p>  As with roads, we would like to be spending more money on a range of public transport projects.  We have prioritised the Luas and a number of other projects to improve the public transport offering to consumers.  Considerable investment is going towards closing out the Leap card and the real-time passenger information, RTPI, signs.  There is a lot of stuff on technology and improving passenger journeys.  Deputy Ellis is well aware we do not have the funding because Sinn F&eacute;in's budget document did not allocate extra funding to this area.  We are making do with what we have.  While I would love to see more, we are trying to spend it wisely to get more passengers on the rail and bus services we are protecting.</p></speech>

That is the best value for money we can deliver with this funding.  There has been a serious investment in roads.  We had two hard winters and with every hard winter the impact is increasing all the time.  We have asked local authorities to prioritise the roads they feel have suffered the biggest impact because of the severe weather, and that is what we expect them to do.</p></speech>

We were quite happy that we got the allocation of &euro;50 million.  It was discussed at Cabinet and was prioritised as an area that we knew needed extra funding.  The figure of &euro;50 million came out of the total financial situation that was there at the time at which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was dealing with it.  We were happy with the &euro;50 million, which was a considerable amount of money to find.</p></speech>

It was a very complicated expedition, involving landing on an oil rig to refuel, to rescue a passenger, who is not a citizen of the State, from a cruise ship.</p> <p>When it comes to saving lives, the financial aspect is left to the background.  The Minister of State is familiar with the fact that at present if the fire service from a local authority is called out to attend at a road accident, the insurance company of the person driving the car is billed.  Many people travelling on cruise ships and trawlers already have the benefit of insurance in another country.  I am not stating the question should be asked before the rescue takes place, but it certainly should be asked afterwards.  I do not suggest this would make a major dent, but the cost of two aircraft travelling 300 miles south west of Ireland was certainly significant given the cost per hour of flying.</p></speech>

A number of accidents have occurred off the coast and three fishermen drowned recently.  The Minister has indicated he will make an announcement in July with regard to personal beacons which can be traced in the water.  Has the cost of these beacons been factored in?  It is probably a bit early yet.</p><p>  The amount for administration has also increased substantially with regard to the Coast Guard.  Is this with regard to the extra services being put in place along the coast, particularly off the islands on the west coast?  Will the Minister of State give us information on these amounts?</p></speech>

Maritime tourism and activities are becoming more popular and the country has opportunities to exploit them and maximise their benefits for the economy.  This will place increased demand on rescue resources.  Do we have a long-term plan which involves all of the stakeholders?  Do we have a programme to develop this?  It is great to see an increase in activities and the potential which exists and we should take advantage of it.</p></speech>

It is something I have asked about myself.  It is an issue and we will provide the Chairman with the exact figures of how much it costs.  We all despise it.  Not alone is there a cost impact, but there is also an alignment and co-ordination impact if a real issue arises somewhere else.  Much of the time it is difficult to track down these people but if we can, they should be dealt with very severely in my opinion because they put other people's lives at risk.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley and I come from opposite ends of the Shannon, where the serious rescue on Lough Derg took place last week.  I live beside the difficult area in which it happened and saw from my house many people being rescued.  The co-ordination of the various units was fantastic.  It shows the value of the work these people do.  I understand exactly the point made and it is something which raises its head.  We must balance the pendulum and not disincentivise people from being rescued because they think there will be a financial cost.  We must ensure safety is the number one issue.  In 95% of cases a safety issue has arisen, but in 5% of cases somebody needed to be collected.  If the latter figure increases, then from a cost point of view we must judge whether we need to put in place a charge.  We monitor this from year to year.  At present the answer is "No" because we do not want to disincentivise people from being rescued, but it is a valid question.</p><p>  To answer Deputy Ellis, the high increase relates to the new search and rescue contract.  The changes in the figure for administration also relate to this.  Overall, from a departmental point of view, administration costs are decreasing.</p><p>  I take on board Deputy Fleming's comments on maritime tourism.</p></speech>

From the purely balance sheet point of view we are here to discuss today, the obvious answer is that if the funding were withdrawn, of course it would be difficult to replace it.

During the past four years, the  number of British tourists visiting Ireland has reduced by one million.  Also, we appear to be getting only 1% of the German market <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the almost 26 million of the German population who holiday abroad every year.  Previously, Ireland was actively sold abroad by way of exhibition of our excellent tourism product at holiday fairs and so on.  At one time it was the policy of Bord F&aacute;ilte to target English cities, particularly those closest to the airports.  The same applied in regard to the Continent.  There is too much emphasis these days on the Internet and no personal engagement with German and British consumers.  We are probably neglecting this market.  Through proper engagement we could significantly increase our market share.</p></speech>

I worked in that agency for almost eight and a half years.  I take on board what the Deputy had to say.  The US market is looking good, as is the mainland European market.  We expect to meet The Gathering target of over 300,000 visitors and &euro;170 million in revenue.  As a Government, we have been very proactive in this area.  The changes in VAT have delivered thousands of jobs across the country.</p><p>  On the Deputy's specific comment in relation to Germany, which is an important market for Ireland, German tourists are product orientated, be that fishing, walking, cycling and so on.  We concentrate a great deal on those activities.  From a competition point of view, Germany is in the centre of Europe, which means its tourists can travel by car or rail to many destinations.  Tourism Ireland, supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is currently engaged in a great deal of work in the German market.  I disagree with the Deputy that there is an over-concentration on the online marketing of tourism.  Statistics indicate that from a tourism planning point of view people are doing more online.  I believe we need to put more rather than less resources into this space.  From a decision-making point of view, it is the ultimate tool.  The websites <i>discoverireland.ie</i><b><i></i></b>and <i>discoverireland.com</i> , which I registered in a previous life, are the real marketing tools for this country.  We need to promote them as much as we can.</p></speech>
