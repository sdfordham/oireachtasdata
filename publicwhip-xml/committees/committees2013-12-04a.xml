However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  This hearing on a draft general scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 follows its publication.  The Bill will apply to all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools and the proposed regulations aim to underpin a fair, consistent and transparent enrolment process that precludes school places from being allocated on the basis of waiting lists and prevents schools from seeking deposits or payments as part of the admission process.  The draft general scheme and the draft regulations were referred to the committee for consideration and we undertook a process of general consultation on the general scheme which resulted in a large number of submissions that now are under consideration.  Overall, approximately 50 submissions were received.  The hearings give groups an opportunity to present the key points of their submissions to the committee.  In accordance with the notice issued seeking submissions, the criteria used were that those people who had sought to make a presentation were invited to attend and those who had not were not.</p><p>  This is the first of three hearings.  I welcome from the Department of Education and Skills Mr. Martin Hanevy, assistant secretary, and Mr. Hubert Loftus, principal officer; from the National Parents Council Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch, chief executive officer; from the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education Ms Breda Corr, general secretary; from Education and Training Boards Ireland Mr. Evan Buckley, education officer; from the Church of Ireland Board of Education Dr. Ken Fennelly; from the National Council for Special Education Ms Teresa Griffin, chief executive officer; from the INTO Ms Deirdre O'Connor, a senior official; and from the Irish Traveller Movement Ms Brigid Quilligan, director.  The format is that each group will have an opportunity to make a presentation, with only one speaker per group.  The presentation will strictly be for no more than five minutes to allow time for questions from the committee.  I will begin with the Department of Education and Skills and invite Mr. Hanevy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Hanevy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013120400003#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  As she has pointed out, the draft general scheme of the Bill was submitted to the joint committee for its consideration.  This followed from an earlier public consultation process held in 2011.  In forwarding the general scheme the Minister also provided draft regulations on the content of admission policies and the proposed admission process.  While it is not generally the case that draft regulations are provided alongside the general scheme of a Bill, the Minister was anxious to do so in this matter, which clearly was of public interest, to facilitate a comprehensive discussion on the full range of measures to be provided either in the Bill or regulations.  The draft framework proposes a new more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school enrolment policy should operate in primary and post-primary schools.  Its purpose is to improve access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admission policies of all schools and the service they provide for parents.  The framework constitutes a significant public service reform aimed at substantially improving the experience between the public and schools in respect of student admission.  Transforming public services and ensuring the citizen is at the heart of how public services operate is an important objective of the Government.</p><p>  The Department acknowledges that schools will have some concerns about how the enrolment framework will affect them individually.  The draft framework seeks to strike an appropriate balance between school autonomy, on the one hand, and the interests of parents in the education system, on the other.  The Department desires the enrolment process to continue to transact at local school level with a high level of local discretion but within a framework that ensures fairness, transparency and good standards.  Under this framework, external intervention in enrolment will be very much a last resort and will be confined to those most serious cases in which a school does not operate its enrolment in the fair, consistent and transparent manner set out in the draft framework.</p><p>  For the reported 80% of schools that enrol all pupils, that is, that do not have an oversubscription problem, the impact of the framework will be relatively marginal.  For the remaining 20% of schools that are oversubscribed, the framework specifies a small number of oversubscription criteria that will not be permissible.  Otherwise, schools have discretion in how they prioritise applicants for enrolment, provided also that it is lawful from an equality perspective.</p> <p>From the perspective of the parent, the framework makes clear that the enrolment policy will be available to all parents and will be explicit in affirming that the school will not discriminate on grounds of disability, special needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the Traveller community, race or civil status.  Second, there will be a common national earliest date for the commencement of enrolment across the school system and, third, subject to limited exceptions, the default position will be that if a school has capacity, it must enrol all applicants.  Other than recognised fee-charging schools, parents will not be charged any booking deposits, fees or other payments as a condition of initial enrolment or for continued enrolment.  Parents will see in advance from the enrolment policy the oversubscription criteria the school will use if demand exceeds supply.  Schools will have discretion on what oversubscription criteria they use, provided they are not one of the listed criteria that are not permissible.  In the case of a school that was oversubscribed in the previous year or which expects to be in the coming year, parents will be able to see from the information provided by the school which categories of applicants were successful in the previous year&rsquo;s enrolment process.  This will be a useful and early indicator to the parent on the chances of being allocated a school place.  If an applicant is unsuccessful in getting a school place, then the parent will be given the reasons the applicant failed to meet the enrolment criteria and this transparency should bring clarity for a parent and help to reduce appeals.  An unsuccessful applicant will have access to a local appeal process to the board of management, which will be provided for in regulations.  This proposal to have a strengthened local appeal process recognises the limitations of the current section 29 appeal process.</p><p> The vast majority of schools can and do enrol all applicants.  However, where demand exceeds supply for a school, it is inevitable that some applicants will not be able to access their school of choice.  Access to school of choice in such circumstances comes down simply to supply and demand.  The experience is that in situations where demand exceeds supply, section 29 appeals are generally futile, as the school refused enrolment simply because it did not have enough places.  The section 29 process has a significant flaw, as it makes no distinction between not getting enrolled in a school of choice and not getting enrolled in any school in the area in question.  This framework takes enrolment out of the section 29 appeals process and proposes alternative remedies.</p><p> Under the new framework, an unsuccessful applicant must be given clear reasons as to the reason the applicant is not being allocated a school place.  If the unsuccessful applicant considers that his or her application was incorrectly decided upon under the oversubscription criteria the school must publish, then an appeal may be made to the board of management.  Essentially, such an appeal will boil down to whether the school correctly assessed the application under the oversubscription criteria. It is not a forum to submit new information and will not require any oral hearings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013120400004#D00500"><p>While the National Parents Council, NPC, welcomes the draft regulations, I will make some comments on the different heads.  On head 3, the requirement that an admission policy will state the school will not discriminate in admission, the NPC welcomes the explicit statement referred to in this provision and believes this will ensure that all parents and perspective students are aware of the school's commitment in this area.  It is important that in issues such as discrimination, presumption is not made as to what may be implied or known, it is essential that the policy is stated in detail, as proposed.  Under head 4, the amendment of section 33 to set out the powers of the Minister to make regulations regarding the admission of students to schools, the NPC again welcomes the clarity that head 4 brings for regulation on admission to a school.  In particular, we support the requirement of the board to consult with the patron, parents and others before approving an admission policy, the requirement that an admission policy includes the school&rsquo;s arrangements for those pupils who do not wish to attend religious instruction, the requirement that an admission policy includes a declaration that no fees will be charged, selection criteria that will be permissible and non-permissible and the prescription of the format and content of the application form.  However, the NPC has concerns regarding the requirement that an admission policy includes the school&rsquo;s policy regarding the admission and participation of pupils with disabilities or special educational needs.  The admission policy regarding pupils with disabilities or special educational needs is already adequately dealt with under head 3.  While the NPC fully supports the requirement for a school to have a policy regarding the participation of pupils with a disability or a special educational need, we do not believe this should form part of the admissions policy, as this refers to issues following admission and may lead to qualifying or limiting the school's affirmation statement under head 3.</p><p>  The NPC also has concerns regarding the provision in head 4 that states:<blockquote>Prescribe that the admission policy of a school shall provide for an offer of enrolment to be made to all students seeking admission save... where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Health Service Executive has provided in writing to the school its opinion that the admission of the student could have a seriously detrimental effect on the safety of other students and or staff of the school.</blockquote>The implication for children and families could be significant under this provision.  The NPC believes that if a provision such as this is required, strict and specific regulation must be developed and this provision could not take effect until such a time as such regulation was in place.</p><p>  As the next three heads are inter-related, I will deal with them together.  I refer to head 5 on the repeal of section 29, head 6 on the function of a principal to implement a school&rsquo;s admission policy and head 7 on appeals to the board of management against refusals to enrol.  The NPC does not support the inclusion of head 5, based solely on the inclusion of heads 6 and 7.  The NPC does support an appeals process at local level in the first instance and believes that with the improvements to the system the proposed new legislation will bring, the requirement for appeals should significantly reduce.  The NPC welcomes the provision that the appeals process at local school level will be prescribed by the Minister following consultation, which will include national associations of parents.  The NPC believes these procedures must be developed as a matter of urgency if head 7 is implemented as set out.</p><p>  The NPC is concerned that were there to be any delay in the development of this procedure, a similar situation would arise as has happened with the current section 28 of the Education Act.  Where no procedures are prescribed by the Minister in consultation, then other procedures may be drawn up in a non-consultative process to address the void, as has happened in schools regarding parental complaints.  The NPC does not agree, however, that the decision made by the board under head 7 should be final.  While the NPC recognises it is neither practical nor provides the best mechanism for appeal to address all issues to the Secretary General of the Department, we believe there must be an independent appeal process for the possibly small amount of cases that cannot be dealt with adequately either by the principal of the school in implementing a complaint admissions policy or the appeal process at the local school level.  The NPC does not necessarily disagree with the repeal of section 29 as proposed in head 5 but this must only be done if an alternative independent appeal system is already in place.  The NPC suggests the appeals committee proposed in head 9 also has a remit to deal with complaints from parents regarding refusal of school enrolment, only to be accessed if the parent has completed the appeals process at local school level and remains dissatisfied that the school admissions procedure complies with the statutory regulation or that it was applied correctly in his or her child&rsquo;s instance.</p><p>  The NPC welcomes head 9 on the power of the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to designate a school and associated appeal mechanism.  We believe this head gives a reassurance to parents and children regarding a school place.  The NPC welcomes the provision under head 9 that the council shall have regard to the educational needs of the child concerned and the wishes of the child&rsquo;s parents.  However, the NPC believes the views of the child should also be included in this section.  The NPC has some concern relating to the insertion that the council shall have regard for the capacity of the school or centre for education, as the case may be, to accommodate the child and to meet his or her educational needs. This appears to be conflict with principle 1 of the NCSE&rsquo;s policy advice paper to the Minister, Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools., which stated: &ldquo;All children, irrespective of special educational need, are welcome and able to enrol in their local schools.&rdquo;  The NPC believes the provision under head 9(4), should state:<blockquote>In making a designation under section (3), the NEWB shall have regard to the educational needs of the child concerned, availability of places in the schools and centres for education in the locality and the placement that in its view is in the best interests of the child, the wishes of the parents, and the views of the child concerned.</blockquote></p></speech>

I wish to allow enough time for questions and urge people to keep within the five minutes allocated because members do not need the entire presentation again, just the summary.  It is important that this is what takes place.</p><p>  I now invite Ms Breda Corr of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Corr" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013120400004#D00900"><p>While I have to hand a long presentation, I will not go into it now but will simply state that although we welcome many of the suggested changes, we are deeply concerned by the manner in which it does not take into account many of the necessary practices and requirements of boards catering for children with special educational needs.  Our statement has approximately 14 points and I will go through them rapidly.  On the statement of non-discrimination and special schools accepting only certain types of pupils, the NCSE recommends that special schools and units should cater for pupils with particular types of need.</p> <p>In order to maximise resources, that should continue to be allowed.  However, we recognise that regulation 24 might be a mitigating factor in this regard but only in respect of special schools and units.  It needs to be expanded to cover mainstream schools with children with special educational needs.</p><p> There is a further difficulty with regulation 22 in so far as it refers to the assessment of students.  We can only presume this regulation applies where the test is carried out by the school in the absence of an independent psychologist's report.  Special schools and units must rely on the latter as part of their admissions process.</p><p> We have questions about the role of the patron.  Many of our patron bodies are outside the denominational sector and many admissions policies largely depend on the focus of the special need.</p><p> The position on transfer policies is not clear.  Clarity is needed on what is required of the policies that do not relate to the intake group.</p><p> Another question that arises is whether the NCSE and NEWB must respect the transfer and admission policies of a school on which they propose to impose a child.  If they were permitted to transfer students into a school in circumstances where the criteria laid down in the policies were not met, it would be unjust to all applicants who are refused places due to oversubscription, or otherwise.</p><p> The draft scheme is an opportunity for the Oireachtas to legislate for the increasingly common question as to how to deal with a student whose special needs now exceed the ability of the school to cater for him.</p><p> We have questions on catchment areas, because this issue applies to special schools and units.  The timeframe for accepting admissions to special schools and units is intertwined with the NCSE timeframe for the allocation of resources.  We strongly advocate that provision for these interlinked processes be required in admissions policies under the draft head.</p><p> It is of great concern to our members that there is confusion over the assessments of pupils' needs and the engagement with parents as part of the admissions process.  Many special schools and units use interviews as an integral part of the admissions process to ensure that the child would benefit from the specific services.  We, too, are alarmed by the repeal of section 29 of the Education Act.  If the Minister introduced a more transparent, coherent model for the existing process, it could increase certainty for schools and parents and reduce costs and confusion.  I alluded to the only two ways in which people may make an appeal.</p><p> With regard to the expanded role of the principal, we are concerned because some schools require expertise in educational, medical and psychological fields that necessitates the obtaining of external advice during the process.  While the board retains the final decision, many schools use advisory panels or sub-committees to assist in the process of ranking applications.  Obviously, the principal could no longer be involved in the sub-committee.</p><p> My next few points are quite important.  We view the proposed NEWB-NCSE powers to require a school to take a pupil in as an inappropriate stripping of a board of management&rsquo;s authority and power to run its school.  While the NCSE must take account of the capacity of the school to accommodate the child, the scheme does not give any further guidance on this decision-making process.  The NCSE could consider a school&rsquo;s capacity and decide that the need of the child to enter the school outweighs the needs of the school to cater for its existing pupils.  It should be noted that the NCSE does not appear to have any power to take into account the impact of such forced enrolment on other children in the school.</p><p> On the NCSE's powers to recommend that additional resources be made available to the school, it may direct a school to take a child but the additional resources might never become available.</p><p> The powers of the Garda and HSE are problematic and unworkable in practice.</p><p> We note that the role of the SENO in school admissions requires statutory clarification, both in the current regime and particularly in light of the changes in the draft scheme.  Given the proposed enlarged power of the NCSE, the role of the SENO in admissions needs very clear definition.  The scheme needs to state explicitly what the actual role of a SENO will be in the admissions process and the extent to which schools can maintain their autonomy in applying their admissions policy in the face of a particular SENO's recommendation.</p><p> With regard to the development of joint enrolment, we suggest that the drafting of this legislation represents an opportunity to clearly define the process of joint enrolment, whether in a mainstream and special school or in two different special schools.  We strongly recommend that legal guidance be set down in determining practical issues, such as where the capitation grant should go and how it should be split and how and where the child should be formally enrolled.  Joint enrolment is of great assistance to many children in transitioning out of special schools and can be an effective method of fulfilling the mainstreaming objective in the EPSEN Act.</p><p> We thank the members for giving us the opportunity to make this presentation and demonstrate the complications and complexities of the proposed legislation in the context of special education.</p></speech>

Head 4 broadens the admission arrangement to include centres of education.  We welcome that as it will include Youthreach, prisons and some VTOS centres.  It is a good idea.  With regard to the assessment of students' academic or other abilities, there may be some circumstances where it is worthy of consideration, in particular regarding those who might apply to attend all-Irish schools or where pupils might require certain subjects they studied in third year when transferring to fifth year.</p><p>  Head 5 removes the capacity to appeal a refusal to enrol to the Secretary General.  It leaves the decision with the principal and the appeal with the board of management.  We are concerned that a number of such decision could be the subject of judicial review or litigation.  The financial capacity of a board of management to defend such cases is an issue for us.</p><p>  Under head 7, it is stated the appeal decision of a board of management is final.  That is a very stark statement.  It does not reflect ETB structures, whereby the ETB school committee decision must be ratified by the ETB committee itself.  We want this to be examined so the ETB structures are reflected in the requirements.  There are a number of possible solutions to that issue.</p><p>  Head 8 relates to the right of the NEWB and NCSE to designate a school.  This is a big change to the autonomy of the current schools.  The legislation should address this to ensure decisions of the NEWB and NCSE are open, transparent and fair.  It should require a reporting mechanism to be in place and that all publicly funded schools be given equal consideration.  The legislation speaks a lot to the rights of the child designated to a particular school.  It also needs to refer to the rights of existing pupils.  They must be considered, particularly where the appointment of an additional pupil might have an impact on the resources available to existing pupils.  The appeal criterion applies only where the decision is unreasonable.  This is very undefined and unclear.  The criteria should be more defined and they might well refer to a significant negative impact on those already attending a school.</p><p>  Head 10 allows for an appeal of the NEWB decision, but the person to take that decision will be designated by the board itself.  There is a need for an appeal panel, agreed with the board and the others partners from which it selects persons to hear appeals.</p><p>  Head 14 repeals section 19 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  It is the section that allows a school to refuse to enrol a pupil subject to certain conditions in its admissions process.  We are concerned that if the section were repealed, the statutory power to refuse admission at all by a school or an ETB would be removed.</p><p>  There are three specific issues that relate to PLC colleges and PLC courses, namely, fees, interviews and specific entry requirements.  Section 23 of the relevant legislation states there should be no fees or charges in the future.  At present, circular 13/2011 allows for certain charges, including non-refundable deposits.</p> <p>PLC, post-leaving certificate, courses routinely collect insurance, equipment, certification and membership costs in advance of admission.  The fees also include the &euro;200 Government charge.  These fees need to be addressed in this legislation.</p><p> It is also essential to set basic entry requirements with specific regard to the type of course on offer.  It is imperative to interview those participants who indicate they have a learning difficulty for us to expedite disability supports and identify risks.  For example, those seeking entry to a journalism course must have a basic leaving certificate standard of English.  These issues concerning the PLC need to be addressed to meet the needs of the ETB, education and training boards, sector.</p></speech>

The board has some specific concerns about some of the proposals contained in this Bill.  My colleagues present from the other management bodies will no doubt outline issues of common concern.  I will endeavour to do so from the perspective of the Protestant religious minority community.</p><p>  In reflecting on this draft scheme for school admissions, the Church of Ireland board of education considered several proposals to be of a specific concern.  These are rooted in a consciousness of the responsibility on schools and school patrons to ensure the specific religious ethos of Church of Ireland schools is preserved and maintained.  This is a responsibility to the church community generally, but is a specific responsibility to parents who choose a school for its specific ethos.  A respect for the role and responsibilities of both the board of management and the school patron on the part of the State is, therefore, of vital importance.  In that connection, I draw members' attention to head 4 where it is proposed to insert a new section 33.  At this point, the proposals move from the making of regulations to prescribe the format of school admissions policies to prescribing the content of school admissions policies.  It is the general view of the Church of Ireland board of education that at this point the draft Bill is moving into overly prescriptive and perhaps interventionist territory.  Under the Education Act 1998, it is the duty of the board of management to manage the school on behalf of the patron.  It strikes us as incongruous that the Minister would seek to be the ninth member of the board of management and determine the content of the schools admissions policy, as distinct from its format.</p><p>  The committee will appreciate that this role for the Minister in regard to the content of the admissions policy will cause boards of management to question their autonomy in running the school on behalf of the patron.  Clearly in a school which is under the patronage of a religious body, the appropriateness of the Minister seeking such powers, even if they are only to be used as a last resort, is open to question in our view.  The committee might wish to consider how this proposal sits with Article 44 of the Constitution which states that religious bodies have the right to manage their own affairs.</p><p>  Church of Ireland primary schools teach the Follow Me religious education curriculum.  The Bill contains a proposal that the school should put in its admissions policy the school's arrangements for upholding the constitutional right of any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction in the school.  The current situation is that schools facilitate this where possible.  There are various practical issues which arise where a parent wishes their child to be withdrawn from class time.  As we stated in our submission, we are of the view the proposed wording is confused in its allocation of responsibilities on this issue.  It is the parent who withdraws their child from class time.  The right to opt out of religious instruction is a State-given right.  Schools facilitate this on the basis of practicality and within the scope of available resources on the basis of goodwill.  Should this now become an obligation on schools, it will obviously need to be resourced sufficiently.  It is also a concern to the board as to how such a new obligation might be fulfilled in a small rural primary school without extra supports.  The board requests the committee to give the practicalities related to this issue further consideration.</p><p>  Head 11 of the draft Bill proposes that schools should co-operate on admissions within a locality.  Such co-operation and dialogue among schools locally is encouraged by the Church of Ireland board of education and we understand it to be common practice.  A difficulty arises for the Protestant minority schools when such co-operation becomes non-voluntary.  Boards of management of a school can choose to freely enter into such arrangements.  The proposals would compel schools to co-operate.  There is no reference to parental rights in terms of choice of school ethos.  It would be important to schools within the Protestant minority tradition, both at primary and second level, that there is recognition of their focus to serve the expectations of parents from that tradition in any co-operative activity on school admissions.</p><p>  While the proposed abolition of the section 29 appeal mechanism was raised by others, the Church of Ireland board of education wishes to highlight that should this proposal go ahead, it will leave school boards of management in a very difficult position in exposing schools to High Court litigation.  Church of Ireland schools are mainly small in numbers with limited resources.  Even where resources are available, all will agree that such resources should be spent on the education of children and not litigation.  The Church of Ireland appeals to the committee to give careful further reflection to the consequences this proposal will have for both schools and parents.  In our view, it is unreasonable and is not based on a parent-centred premise.  Any appeals process must be independent and have an inherent integrity.  What is proposed in the draft heads is that the same board which sets the policy will hear appeals on that policy for places in its own school.  I am sure the committee will appreciate that such an introverted appeals process will cause difficulties for communities in local areas.  It will certainly pose problems for chairpersons who are involved in both school life and other community activities.  For the Church of Ireland, this poses a real difficulty in the context of smaller close-knit parish-based communities.</p><p>  The position of the Church of Ireland board of education is one of concern about several provisions in this draft Bill.  The consequences of the strong approach of the draft scheme will create a diminished role for school boards of management and school patrons, expose both parents and schools to litigation, and allocate an inappropriate role for the Minister for Education and Skills.  We have set out our specific concerns in our written submission.  In general terms, the Church of Ireland board of education is of the view that the draft bill is overly prescriptive in what it is attempting to achieve.  The board understands the rationale of the Minister and his Department in bringing forward this Bill as it is fulfilling a perceived need for greater clarity, uniformity and transparency in the area of school admissions, which is welcome.  However, the draft scheme raises wider societal questions as to the appropriateness of shifting the power to determine the format, content and manner of publication of school admissions policies from the local school community to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

The NCSE believes all children, irrespective of special educational needs, should be welcome and able to enrol in their local schools.  We know, however, that some parents encounter mainstream schools which are not welcoming of their children.  We also know that some parents do not provide information about their child&rsquo;s special educational needs to schools in case the schools refuse enrolment.  School management has commented, from time to time, that some schools are more welcoming than others.  Some children with very complex needs may require a more supportive special school or special class placement.  None the less, parents seeking a placement for their child should not have to worry about the enrolment process or feel under obligation to a school or feel they have to hide the fact their child has special needs.  The NCSE considers the Bill, and the associated regulations, represents a substantial progressive initiative.  It will remove some of the undue worry of parents.</p><p>  There are several areas in which the draft Bill could be strengthened.  There is a need to ensure both legislative and process clarity.  The committee is aware of litigation that has previously occurred.  It is important, at drafting stage, to ensure the legislation creates certainty in the rights and duties of all parties concerned.  There is also a need to ensure that, whatever the timeframe for the annual enrolment process, schools have sufficient flexibility to plan for specific needs.  For example, a school building may need to be adapted, which can take time.  Schools may need to open special classes where the need for such a class has been identified by the NCSE.</p> <p>The NCSE has the legislative duty to ensure sufficient special class and special school placements are available.  Sometimes we come across schools that do not want to open a special class or that will open only one type of special class, even where there are students from within the school's catchment area who would benefit from such a placement.  This limits our ability to plan for an overall national continuum of educational provision, which is our duty under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  We believe this legislation could be amended at drafting stage to address this gap.</p><p> We also believe strongly that enrolment and school admissions must be meaningful.  We are aware that some students with special educational needs and some students who do not have special educational needs are only enrolled in schools for short periods of time - perhaps for an hour or two hours a day.  There is no national monitoring of the number of schools which have students who attend for short days.  This means we cannot be sure if children are getting a meaningful education appropriate to their needs.  The NCSE notes that the Bill does not provide for an appeals mechanism against a decision by a school to place a child on a short day.  Again, this could be amended at drafting stage.  In our policy advice to the Minister on the education of children who have challenging behaviour, we recommended that schools with students on short days should be obliged to report such situations and that oversight arrangements be put in place in order that the State can satisfy itself these students are receiving an education appropriate to their needs.</p><p> We know schools must provide students and staff with a safe environment in which to learn and work.  I note other commentators have mentioned concerns about the proposed power to be granted under head 4 to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  The NCSE considers that the labelling of children can have very serious life-long consequences and should only be carried out when clinically indicated and by those who are professionally qualified.  We consider that this section could lead to a situation where a child is prevented from attending school without a fair process being in place.</p><p> We particularly welcome the fact that head 9 of the draft general scheme in effect commences the provisions of section 10 of the EPSEN Act, which was passed by the Oireachtas in 2004 and has yet to be commenced.  We know that some school management and other parties may be worried by this.  We have heard some of the concerns today, that the NCSE will be able to designate a school for a child with special educational needs who is unable to find a school placement.  Their concerns are understandable but I can assure all concerned that the NCSE would not take such a power lightly or exercise it unless it is absolutely necessary.  If the legislation is passed, we intend to engage fully with the education partners and the Department before drafting and finalising any NCSE processes and protocols regarding this aspect of the proposed legislation.  The needs of the child and the ability of the school to respond to those needs would be central in any decision.</p><p> We are all aware that, from time to time, parents encounter difficulty in placing their child with special educational needs.  There was an extreme case a number of years ago where a parent applied to more than 20 schools, took section 29 action against all of them and still could not get a school to enrol their child, nor could anyone oblige a school to do so, even where there were places to enrol the child.  We do not think this is a reasonable position for any jurisdiction.  I am quite happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Enrolment in primary schools has long been a concern of the INTO.  The objectives of the organisation include &quot;the support of equal access to full education for all children&quot;.  The principles of inclusivity, equality, participation and parental choice set out in the Education Act 1998 in respect of access to education have been supported by the INTO.  The INTO has supported the enrolment, with appropriate support, of children with special educational needs in primary schools and has opposed the provisions which allow religious-run schools to refuse to enrol children on the basis of the faith of the school.</p><p>  In this submission, I will address the four areas of concern to us in.  We have supplied a full written submission.  Those four issues are the scope of the legislation and regulations, the need for inclusive and non-discriminatory enrolment policies, the proposals to devolve the function of enrolment to the principal teacher and the proposal to end appeals on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act.</p><p>  The INTO is of the view that most schools have effective systems of enrolment.  The majority - about 80% - of primary schools enrol all applicants.  Where problems have arisen, they have largely resulted from a lack of school places rather than any failings on the part of the existing schools to manage enrolments effectively.   The INTO has long sought agreed guidelines on enrolment.  Concern has been expressed that over-regulation would be detrimental to the inclusive spirit of primary schools in that it may have the effect of excluding those parents not familiar with the system.  The development of agreed guidelines would be a more appropriate response.   That said, some of the draft regulations are welcome and could be incorporated into guidelines.  These include those relating to the standardisation of timeframes between schools and the proposed elimination of the first come, first served approach.  There are still a number of issues that require further guidance, including late enrolments, enrolments by parents in multiple schools and enrolments during a school term.  Clear guidance is needed on when a school is full with reference to pupil-teacher ratios, maximum class size, space and the development of sustainable schools.  The INTO is in favour of proposals in respect of transparency in the enrolment process and the publication of enrolment policies.  We welcome the proposal that enrolment may be refused where a parent does not agree to the school's code of behaviour or where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the HSE has provided its opinion that the admission of the student would be seriously detrimental to the safety of staff or students.  We feel that provides an appropriate balance between the rights of the child and parents and the rights of staff working in schools.</p><p>  The INTO is committed to supporting the concept of equal access to full education for all children, and the operation of effective, inclusive, non-discriminatory enrolment policies in schools is key to this.  Where demand for places exceeds those available, schools must use fair, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria to select pupils for enrolment.  We welcome the proposals that criteria which are directly or indirectly discriminatory on any of the nine grounds should not be permitted.  We note that the proposals contained in the draft heads maintain the current exception for religious-run schools contained in section 7.3(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000.  The INTO continues to oppose this exception.  The INTO welcomes the prohibition of criteria for admission related to parents' ability to pay, academic ability or attendance at open days.  Giving priority to the siblings of children already enrolled is seen as sensible and fair.  We welcome the proposal allowing discretion in respect of the enrolment of the children of staff for practical reasons.</p><p>  The largest concern we have concerns the proposal to amend the Education Act to place the principal's responsibility for the admissions policy on a statutory basis.  It is acknowledged that the day-to-day management of admissions to a school is carried out by principals.  However, the development and implementation of school policy, particularly in cases of refusal to enrol, is a responsibility which has been properly shouldered by the board of management.  Any increase in responsibility inevitably increases workload for primary principals, 70% of whom are also carrying out full-time teaching duties.  The concerns about the workload of principals, in particular teaching principals, are well documented by the INTO and others.  In addition, in a context where promoted posts are being dismantled and at a time of salary cuts, reductions in resources and support in schools and the proliferation of initiatives, the negative effects of such a fundamental change in the statutory role cannot be underestimated.</p><p>  I will address the proposed repeal of section 29 appeals.  The INTO has consistently expressed concerns about the operation of section 29 appeals on enrolment, particularly in the absence of agreed guidelines.  These concerns have centred on the lack of transparency and perceived lack of consistency in the process.  The proposal that future appeals would be dealt with at board level are received with caution.  The INTO is concerned that an outcome which parents would regard as high stakes being finally determined at local level would place enormous strain on a volunteer board, in particular on the principal teacher and, as previous speakers have noted, open up the possibility of litigation against schools with consequences for the principal teacher.</p><p>  The INTO agrees that this debate on school admissions is timely and important.  We thank the committee for listening to our submission.</p></speech>

Founded in 1990, the Irish Traveller Movement is a national membership organisation representing Travellers and Traveller organisations.</p> <p>I refer to a detailed submission we have made in response to the draft general scheme of the education (admission to schools) Bill 2013, and before that to a submission on a framework of an enrolment discussion paper 2011.  In that the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, outlined previous practices of segregation and current experiences of refused enrolment and other forms of discrimination, school bullying and other forms of harassment, limited recognition of and focus on Traveller ethnicity in the curriculum and the inadequate response by many educational establishments to cultural diversity, which impact on all educational participation and outcomes for Traveller children.</p><p> While some progress has been made on Travellers in education in recent years, the proposed Bill must be seen in the context of the withdrawal of all Traveller-specific educational supports in 2011 and the 87% cut in the Traveller-specific education budget.  There remains a significant gap between the participation and attainment of Traveller children as compared with their settled counterparts.  More than 8,000 Travellers are in mainstream education.  In 2011, only 3% of Travellers had continued their education past the age of 18, compared with 41% of the settled population, and 17% of Travellers have no formal education compared with 1.4% of the settled population.</p><p> The ITM commends some elements of the proposed Bill but it has not gone far enough and further research is required to determine what the effect would be of the proposed changes on the most marginalised children in society, including Travellers.  Our main concerns relate to the proposals under heads 5, 6 and 7, namely, the parent rule, the removal of the right to appeal a refusal to admit under section 29, the lack of clarity on the National Educational Welfare Board's powers, and the obligation to require co-operation between schools and other related matters.</p><p> Traveller children are statistically far more likely to be excluded from admissions under the proposed 25% parent rule.  The ITM is concerned that this rule, which will disproportionately affect Travellers will, for the first time, be put on a statutory footing which cannot be challenged.  We recommend the abolition of the parent rule in its entirety.  Meanwhile, further clarification is sought, which is not contained in the Bill, on the circumstances where requests for derogations will be refused in situations where the criteria are fulfilled.  We also seek statistics on schools which will be eligible to apply for this derogation and any supporting statistical geographic or socioeconomic analysis carried out while drafting this legislation.</p><p> Regarding the section 29 right to appeal to the Department against a refusal to admit, as currently drafted, the legislation provides that a board of management's decision, following an appeal of a principal&rsquo;s refusal to admit, will be final.  Although the draft legislation provides that the principal must withdraw from considerations relating to such appeals, we submit that the board of management would not be sufficiently impartial or independent to be the final arbiter in appeals relating to refusals to enrol.  The only other avenue then available would be by way of a judicial review in the High Court, an option which is impractical and unavailable to most parents.  The right of appeal and access to justice is thus reserved only for those parents who can afford it.</p><p> Under the proposed draft, the right of appeal to the Department of Education against a decision to expel or suspend remains <i>in situ</i>.  There is a lack of clarity on the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB&rsquo;s powers, the obligation to require co-operation between schools and other related matters.  It is not explicitly stated under head 9, where the NEWB is empowered to force a school to enrol a particular pupil, that schools will be required to co-operate on the designation of schools.</p><p> There is a lack of clarity as to how the Minister will require co-operation between schools pursuant to the legislation and regulations.  The draft legislation does not provide for any mechanism whereby the NEWB can independently ascertain whether a school has places or whether the NEWB or the child will have a choice about which local schools are available.  Perhaps a live database could be initiated and moderated by the Department of Education and Skills to be updated regularly by principals with clear criteria as to when a school considers itself full.</p><p> Alternatively, perhaps a mandatory obligation could be imposed on all schools to take a specific number of such students per year and to account for the ethnic and racial balance of their school and whether it is representative of the local population.  Otherwise, there are concerns that Traveller children will be enrolled in the schools in the area that are traditionally less academic, regardless of the attributes and talents of that particular Traveller child.  Again the ITM has received feedback that some schools have a history of encouraging Traveller students to transfer to Youthreach after a couple of years of second level education, thereby limiting the student subject choices which in turn limits their access to third level.</p></speech>

Could the Department of Education and Skills comment on some of the comments by subsequent contributors, particularly on the independent appeals process and the removal of section 29?  Could the Department also comment on the current rules on deposits and any feedback or statistics it has on that practice?</p><p>  Ms Lynch of the National Parents Council commented on the role of the HSE and Garda as outlined in the heads of the Bill.  Could she elaborate on that?  She also mentioned the need for an independent appeals process, on which most contributors commented.</p><p>  Ms Corr of NABMSE said she does not feel the proposals take into account special needs requirements and supports.  Could she elaborate on that and what she would like to see there?  How does joint enrolment work and what are her views on it under the proposals?</p><p>  Mr. Buckley pointed out that the heads of Bill do not allow for the ETBs to have the final decision, as is the case currently.  How does that sit with current ETB legislation?  I imagine that ETB legislation clarifies that is the way, yet the heads of this Bill suggest something different.  Mr. Buckley had a concern about the removal of the school's power to decide not to enrol a student.  Could he elaborate on that?</p><p>  Dr. Ken Fennelly of the Church of Ireland General Synod Board of Education expressed particular concerns about section 29.  He felt the proposals were overly interventionist and affected the content and not just the format of the enrolment procedure.  Could he elaborate on those concerns and with what parts he has an issue?</p><p>  Could Ms Griffin of the NCSE elaborate on the short days situation and what she feels needs to happen?  She indicated that it is important that the Department be able to assess what is happening and the level of education a child is getting.</p><p>  I take on board the points the INTO made, particularly on section 29.</p> <p>The need for an independent appeal process is something on which there was consensus among the contributors today.  I ask the Department to comment on this.</p></speech>

One of the tables in the presentation document provided by the Department of Education and Skills states the oversubscription criteria to be permitted.  One of these is priority on the basis of attendance in a feeder primary school for enrolment in a post-primary school.  Post-primary schools teaching through the medium of Irish have an issue.  In my constituency all of the recognised feeder schools for such a post-primary school are English-speaking whereas the Gaelscoileanna in the catchment area are not designated feeder schools.  Students taught through the medium of Irish at primary level are not given priority or recognition in terms of being able to enrol at the post-primary school.  Will the Department comment on this?  How we will get over this particular obstacle?</p><p>  With regard to education and training boards, the academic interview process for post leaving certificate courses and FETAC courses was mentioned and this is important.  Has international research been done on how doing away with the interview process can be facilitated under a proposal in this legislation?  Does the Department have any comment on this?</p><p>  With regard to section 29 and revamping the system, initially additional responsibilities for enrolment processes will be placed on school principals.  Perhaps this question can be addressed by Ms O'Connor, Mr. Hanevy and Mr. Loftus.  Any appeal would be made to the board of management.  What is missing is the fact that in many cases, school principals sit on boards of management.  I believe head 7 states where this is the case the school principal will not take part in the appeals process.  This will put boards of management in a very difficult position whereby they will be asked to adjudicate on a decision made by a principal who, for every other purpose, meeting and reason will sit on the board of management.  A board of management is voluntary in nature and contains parents.  What training and expertise will be given to individual boards of management?  This is not to mention the additional pressure of possible litigation against a board of management with regard to an appeals process.  No one will agree section 29 is ideal, and it needs to be overhauled and made more transparent, but what is proposed in the legislation is not the answer.</p><p>  I have a question for my own information for Dr. Fennelly from the General Synod Board of Management of Education on the schools it operates.  Are many of them oversubscribed as it is?  If this is the case the legislation will have a significant impact on its sector.</p></speech>

The Minister is taking a regulatory power.  We published the regulations so everyone could see the thrust of what was being done, but they are fundamentally focused on entry to second level.  There are subset issues, such as arrangements in special schools and interviews for post leaving certificate courses which is about guidance for the students as to the correct course to take. An interview for a post leaving certificate course is not one which could be a soft barrier to admission.  One of the issues we are trying to deal with is soft barriers.  We do not believe parents should be subjected to interviews which might be a soft barrier to getting the child enrolled.  Clearly there is a valid educational reason for interviews for post leaving certificate courses.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of an independent appeals process, section 28 of the Act is all about the desirability of resolving grievances and issues locally and local appeals processes.  As the 1998 Act is structured, section 29 only kicks in when local processes are exhausted.  A section 29 committee should not examine an enrolment issue until local appeals have been executed.</p><p>  At the beginning, of all the issues which could cause grievance between parents, students and schools, three elements were include section 29.  These are expulsion of a child, suspension of a child and enrolment of a child.  The first two of these are life-changing and significant events.  The argument we have put forward in the discussion document, and again here, is the wide broad brush of including enrolment.  There are two types of enrolment problems.  The first is where a child has been refused enrolment by a range of schools, including oversubscribed schools but also schools which are not oversubscribed.  Ms Griffin spoke about a particular case of which she was aware.  The second category is those affected by supply and demand, which is applicable to everyone.  We believe there is a better remedy for a child who cannot get any place.  Instead of a parent being dragged around appeals committees in the case of special needs children, we implement the original power included in EPSEN and create a power for the National Educational Welfare Board.  At present the board petitions schools and assesses and asks with regard to a child who cannot get a place, but it has no ultimate reserve power when it gets the runaround from schools to find a place for the child.  This is why children at risk are out on home tuition without a place.  Rather than putting people through multiple appeals an ultimate call must be made on what is reasonable in the locality with regard to a school taking a child.</p><p>  The other problem is oversubscription.  This is the case for most third level courses and we do not need a statutory appeals process because parents and students have certainty and belief in the process and they know the criteria.  We argue this should be replicated for oversubscribed schools whereby people know the criteria upfront and are told where they fit, and they have information on how far down the list they are.  For instance, at Dr. Fennelly's school the first priority is to enrol Protestants.  Last year the school spent 70% of its places on this and then went on to geographical boundaries.  The people outside of these criteria would know the situation with clarity.</p><p>  The appeals process at school level in the case of oversubscription is about whether the person was treated correctly under the criteria and a parent appealing would have to show an error was made.  One would like to think a school would correct an error without any appeal because it would want to do so.  Section 29 was probably included by the Minister's predecessors in the Oireachtas in 1998 in the belief it would be light touch and easy for parents.</p> <p>However, it has proved litigious, heavy in terms of documentation and a significant burden on a parent attempting to go through the process.</p></speech>

We are seeking greater clarity and possibly regulation.  It has been suggested this should happen where a student entering a school could have a seriously detrimental effect on the safety of other students and-or staff.  If so, we question who in the Garda and the HSE would make these decisions, how they would be made and on what they would be based.  As there is no clarity on what this process would entail, we cannot support its inclusion.  The effect of a refusal of enrolment in a school because of a decision on the level of impact on staff and other children, thereby labelling the child and family and possibly affecting enrolment in other schools, would be significant.  More detail is necessary.</p><p>  The Deputy asked us to expand on section 29.  If many of the Bill's provisions were implemented in schools, the need for appeals would be lessened, as the provisions would tighten current processes.  However, where a parent believes a school's admission procedure does not comply with the legislation or has not been applied to his or her situation, he or she must have somewhere to be heard outside of the school if the local appeals procedure has already been exhausted.  We are not saying someone who does not get his or her first choice should be able to appeal the decision.  The sense is that an appeals mechanism is being considered under head 9 and the powers of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It may be expanded on to deal with this matter.  I take the point that the Minister or patron could apply the ultimate sanction and put in place someone to make these enrolment decisions, but if there is no independent appeals mechanism for parents to be heard, how will we become aware of issues in schools?</p></speech>

Deputy Charlie McConalogue asked about the legislation, the difficulty regarding the sub-committee that is a board of management and the ETB committee.  This issue can be addressed by a small addition to the proposals allowing for decisions of the board of management to be ratified by the ETB committee.  Currently, it is not open to a sub-committee of the ETB, the school board of management, to make independent decisions of its own accord.  They must be ratified.</p><p>  None of us wants an interview process that decides on admission for the wrong reasons, but interviews at the post-leaving certificate, PLC, level are important for significant reasons.  Applicants' skills need to be appropriate to certain types of course.  In the case of outdoor education and water sports, for example, one would need to check whether a person could swim.  There are many adults participating in PLC courses and their previous education histories are important.  If someone is applying to attend a level 6 course, it is entirely appropriate that he or she should have level 5 or equivalent experience to ensure he or she can manage the course's learning requirements.  It is important that these issues be teased out with the applicant in advance.  In practice, if a level 6 course is not appropriate, the person is never refused but directed to the appropriate place.  The key element is the interview process with the applicant prior to admission to the course.  We will seek to have this practice included.</p><p>  I was asked a question about the concern that head 14 would repeal section 19 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, under which a school cannot refuse enrolment unless doing so is in accordance with the admissions policy.  The reverse of this, where a school can refuse enrolment if it is in compliance with the admissions policy, needs to be retained in some way.  This provision might have been lost in the way the Bill was constructed.</p></speech>

This is the reality for many Traveller parents.  I imagine that the number of people using section 29 in respect of Traveller parents, children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with special needs traditionally has been very high.  In our experience, certain schools show a great deal of animosity towards Traveller children.  Traditionally, Traveller children who went on to secondary school were directed to vocational or other schools that might not have had high academic outcomes for students.  Even now, Traveller children are subject to part-time hours in such schools, in that they are seen as a problem rather than someone valuable.  Even before admission, a Traveller child is seen as a problem, regardless of academic ability or background and it is purely because he or she is a Traveller.  Many schools do not want to have Traveller children.</p><p>  When going through an application process, it is difficult for a Traveller parent to know which school is full and which is not.  Traveller parents, including me at one time, applied to several schools in a particular area to get the best outcomes for their children.  We wanted the same educational outcomes for our children as anyone else around the table, yet we received a blanket "No."  There are many barriers for Traveller and migrant children in terms of the parental rule.  A reduction to 25% has been suggested, but this remains a significant barrier for children who historically have had no parent or older sibling attend a particular school.  The only effective means of getting a child into a school is by using section 29, despite the fact that it is ineffective.  When one takes a case, the basis of the ruling is whether a school used its own criteria.  Sometimes, these criteria exclude children from various backgrounds.</p> <p>Other speakers today have spoken about fairness of access.  It is important that the voices of Traveller, migrant and immigrant children and children with special needs, who are traditionally excluded from schools, are heard.  What might appear like a fair appeals process to the general community can be a huge barrier for the parents of these children.  We know this from experience.  There are many people lining up in our law centre to take cases based on their not being able to enrol their child in a school of their choice.  It is hugely important that children who are trying to achieve, particularly children who are at an educational disadvantage, such as Traveller children who traditionally would not have attended school, can access a place in the right school so that they are in an environment where they are supported, loved and encouraged to reach their potential.  Unfortunately, the choice of schools available to Travellers because of enrolment policies is now very limited.  This is limiting Travellers' progress in the education system.</p></speech>

Joint enrolment is provided for in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  However, in practise what happens is that it boils down to the two local schools agreeing how this will operate.  There are no strict criteria in this regard.  The Department does not get involved.  Generally, one school chooses to take the capitation grant and this is then the school where the children is enrolled.  This is a very helpful process in transitioning students into mainstream school or between schools on particular days of the week.  That is important.  This is being done but at good will level.  There is an opportunity for this to be provided for in law.  The current process is working but very much on a local level.</p><p>  I am not sure if the Deputy's next question about resources relates to the NCSE.</p></speech>

It may be the case that the resources are not available.  For example, the ceiling in regard to teacher numbers, SNA numbers and in respect of transport provision may have been reached.  There is a fear that this would not automatically happen, as is often the case.  Some schools will take on students but they may not necessarily get the resources they expect in the psychologists report or generally.  They might expect to get an SNA or additional hours but may not get it immediately.  It is important that resources where a child is imposed on a school resources follow.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate further on the Protestant ethos issue.  I have listened carefully to what everybody had to say.  There are little nuances with which people have a problem and are seeking clarification on from the Department of Education and Skills.  There are also fundamental issues in regard to the Traveller and migrant communities.  I know that the position of the Department is that it is not possible to treat Travellers specifically because everybody should be treated the same.  However, some communities have particular needs.  Where a community's needs are not being met within the education sector, there must specific criteria put in place to assist them.  The Department needs to look at this.  I do not understand why this is a problem.</p><p>  The CSO has data on the number of special needs and Traveller children in this country.  It also has information on migrant children, although this data may not, because of the movement of migrants, be as firm.  Surely it is possible, based on this information, to plan for future educational needs in particular areas.  The Department needs to look at school provision within areas and plan ahead based on CSO information.  I do not understand why doing so is a problem.  Ireland is a small community unlike the United States where it may be difficult to pull this information together.</p><p>  The issue in relation to section 29 is one for everybody.  Perhaps the Department would take another look at that.  Everybody believes it is putting too much pressure on the boards of management.  It has been stated that there is transparency in regard to enrolment and so on, which I welcome, and that as a result the number of future appeals will reduce.  If this is the case, why then cannot an independent appeals process be put in place in this regard?  I am not sure whether that suggestion is practical or whether parents would go straight to this process rather than engage first with the local process.  The strength of the local process and transparency of the system will determine whether cases will be appealed.  I would welcome a response from the departmental officials on the removal of the parent rule as proposed by the Irish Traveller Movement and on what else could be put in place within the Department to ensure that children from the Traveller and migrant communities and children with special needs are specifically catered for.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome Mr. Loftus back again.  We have batted here before.  I consider him a fine public servant.</p><p>  Many of the witnesses have welcomed the draft regulatory framework, which is good.  They also have specific questions about it which need to be answered.  Some very interesting observations have been made, including that 8,000 Traveller children attend mainstream education but only 3% of them go on to third level.  Is that an enrolment issue?</p></speech>

Historically, Traveller children have attended schools in which expectations of them were very low.  Even in my time, children would have been segregated and put into resource classes in which little or no school work was done.  Children often spent time combing the teacher's hair and sweeping the classroom floor.  Naturally then when these children go on to second level they are not at the same level as their settled peers and they slowly drip away from school.  We are lucky if in 2013, Traveller children remain in school up to third year.</p></speech>

I am not too sure they are the reasons.  I would caution against speaking badly about vocational education.  It is outstanding.  One cannot say one school is better than the other.  The Government is now completely if not entirely dependent on vocational educational in relation to the youth guarantee.  It is one of the finest educational aspects of our education system.  I would caution against the idea that because particular children go into vocational education something negative happens.  It does not.  Vocational education is probably one of the best methods of teaching in relation to apprenticeships and education plus trade plus work well done plus labour market.</p><p>  I do not necessarily believe that integration means equality.  Would Ms Quilligan be in favour of Traveller education?</p> <p>There are some other observations I would like to make.  We have all this integration and we are integrating to the point that we cannot breathe.  Half the time we are integrating and calling the process "equality" but it is not that.  I have a question but that was just an observation.  We can have a conversation later.</p></speech>

There are 174 Church of Ireland schools in the country, with another 24 Presbyterian, Methodist and Quaker schools, so there are approximately 200 Protestant primary schools.  Approximately 55 of them are in urban areas, and oversubscription is an issue for them.  It is also an issue for another ten or 15 schools in specific rural areas.  That adds up to 50 or 60 schools from the 200, so approximately 25% or 30% operate on oversubscription criteria.  It is not a major problem in terms of numbers but it is an issue for the specific schools.</p><p>  In terms of content and format, it was one of the first issues that struck us as the board of education sat down to reflect on this.  Head 4 indicates that regulators "may" require that the admissions policy of the school "shall" set out the characteristic spirit and general objectives of the school.  That means the ethos statement of the school will be in the admissions policy that must be given to the parent.  That is fine.  The head also indicates that there will be prescription of the "content" of the policy.  We have a concern that as a board tries to formulate its own policy regarding admissions to its school - it should be remembered that we are considering this through the prism of religious ethos - the Department may stipulate that it cannot ask about whether a person belongs to a particular parish or the denomination of the child.  It seems to be relieving the board of its autonomy or the scope it had before.  That is why I used the term "interventionist", as we feel there is a hand coming into the work of the board from the Department of Education and Skills or the Minister that was not there before.  That feeling was very strongly expressed at our board meeting.</p></speech>

Even for four year olds and five year olds, typically children can be phased into going to school.  For the first week the child might go in for a very short time.  When we did our consultation leading to policy advice on challenging behaviour and the education of children with challenging behaviour arising from a disability, it became very clear that there were a number of cases in which children with disruptive behaviour were only allowed attend school for a short period.  In some cases it was part of a phased programme but in others, parents have told us they had no idea when the process would end, despite trying to engage with the school.  They have no way of appealing to the school and, having spoken to representatives, they are told there may be a change if behaviour changes.  We tried to find out a little more information at that stage but the education of children on short days seems to be nobody's responsibility and there is no way for the State to satisfy itself that these children are receiving appropriate education for their needs.</p><p>  In our policy advice we suggest that there needs to be some oversight, and when the draft general scheme came to our attention, we saw there were grounds for appeal against a permanent expulsion or suspension of a student but there were no grounds for appeal where a student is enrolled and perhaps attending every day for one hour, with the process proceeding <i>ad infinitum</i>.  Therefore the child may not get an education appropriate to his or her needs.  We saw it as an opportunity at the drafting stage to see if the gap could be closed.</p><p>  With regard to planning, I agree with Deputy Joan Collins.  Through our special educational needs organisers we have much information from the HSE and parents regarding children with special educational needs.  We try to supply a national provision of education to ensure there are enough places in special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  Many schools will open special classes but there are cases - I am currently aware of one - in which the special educational needs organiser finds it impossible to open a special class at post-primary level, while another school that already has two classes is willing to open another two to cater for people's needs.  The resources are not shared evenly and we cannot plan for issues.  Students would have to travel for longer in some instances, for example.  There is a gap as schools are not obliged to provide the full range of educational provision, so where there is a need, typically within the school's normal catchment area or provision, the matter could be reflected in the drafting.</p></speech>

I reiterate the point about teaching principals in primary schools, as these are not people sitting in offices.  They are standing in a classroom with 27 or 28 children, and their capacity to carry out additional work is very limited.  Principals are very mindful in schools that they have relationships with existing parents and parents in the community.  They live and work in the communities and take decisions, whether they are regarding oversubscription or whether a child cannot get a school place.  This is a high-stakes decision for a parent.</p><p>  The Department is making a distinction between a situation in which a child is simply not able to get a school place and a parent's choice.  One of the ironies, as I pointed out, is that there are no criteria in these regulations for oversubscription and there is nothing stipulating when a school is full.  Many of the fundamental appeals are an argument that a school has room for a child but has arbitrarily decided not to take the child.  There may be space in fifth or sixth class, if one does a simple sum of dividing the number of pupils by the number of teachers.</p><p>  With regard to the role of a principal, there is also a fear that if a principal took a decision that was subsequently overturned on appeal to a board, the principal would be put into conflict with the board, and no principal wants to be in that position with an employer.  A parent may also believe that a board will back up a principal and uphold his or her decision, so the ultimate appeal line with the board or the primary decision making line with the principal is not satisfactory.</p><p>  With regard to the provision of education for Travellers and children with special educational needs, it is very regrettable that resources for Traveller children were withdrawn in 2011.  It is kind of an unintended consequence of the integration that Senator O'Donnell mentioned.</p></speech>

It is one of the things the Minister is not making impermissible.  Fundamentally, the intrusion these regulations make in the content of admissions policies is being kept to a minimum.  The relationship with feeder schools, where that exists, is not being banned or outlawed.</p><p> The probable answer to the example case is one of two things.  It might be that feeder school arrangements were originally set in respect of a second level school prior to the establishment of some of those Gaelscoileanna or Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;.  However, that is one of the things on which schools have autonomy.  Some of the feeder school arrangements might flow from planning decisions, where a second level school was located due to where people were coming from, transport routes and so forth.  It is a space on which we are not proposing to prescribe.  The issue is that, whether by local co-operation, discussion or agreement, the feeder school arrangements of a school can be updated.</p></speech>

Mr. Hanevy said in his presentation that section 28 was about resolving the issues locally.  However, if one looks at the figures for section 29 appeals, in 2012 there were 355 appeals.  A total of 141 of these were resolved before a hearing, 66 were upheld and 147 were not upheld.  In the previous year, 123 were not upheld, while in the year before that, 171 of the appeals were not upheld.  It is clear there is a value to having an appeals process outside of local structures because, in many cases, the local resolutions are not working.</p></speech>

The committee, as Members of the Oireachtas, will also have similar calls to make when the legislation comes before them.  I am a little worried about the INTO presentation.  If I heard it correctly, it stated that because of the relationship between a principal and the board, a board could never really wish to overturn the decision of a principal.  The ramifications of that are wider than just enrolment.  They are about everything in school life.  The principal is the person who executes the policy of the board, but is accountable to the board.  If parents cannot have an appeal to a board on day-to-day matters, the enrolment is only in the ha'penny place, because that is a far more consequential matter.</p><p>  On the issue of section 29 and where the balance is here, our argument is that there are other remedies.  I will go through one, and this might help with the matter of Travellers as well.  I want to deal with this issue-----</p></speech>

One of the things we are not permitting is the parent rule, but I will return to that.  If a Traveller child or Traveller children are seeking enrolment, we are saying the default position, where there is no oversubscription, is that the school absolutely must enrol them.  That is a huge leap forward.  There are no appeals to flow from that because the school simply must do it.</p><p>  On the point about oversubscription, it might not be clear and it might be a fault in our first efforts at drafting, but we are saying that the school must declare up-front for people at the start of the process whether the school is going to be oversubscribed.  If the school does not do that, by definition it is not.  A school that might think it will be squeezed must say it is going into oversubscription and outline the criteria.  It must also state how many places it will fill.  In every other school, including the vast majority of the 70% of schools that do not have walking principals, the walk load will be much lighter simply by virtue of the fact that they will be enrolling everyone.  First, in 80% of the schools which are not oversubscribed the Traveller child or any other child must be enrolled.  Where there is oversubscription the Traveller child does come up against whatever balance is ultimately struck on the parent rule.  However, the parent rule and the long waiting list are part of the two policy themes here.  One is about special needs children and soft barriers and so forth, and the other is about the person who moves around.  That is the Traveller and the migrant mentioned by Deputy Joan Collins, but also the indigenous population or our diaspora, who might be hoping to return to Ireland in a few years.  People might be in Australia at present and have a young family out there but they wish to return to the Irish schools.  They are also disadvantaged by a certain category of things if they are arriving back and they cannot fulfil the fixture.  One of them is potentially the parent rule.  It could also be a person in this country who loses his or her job and must move elsewhere in the country.</p></speech>

With regard to the derogation on waiting lists and on the parent rule, as it is called here - the past pupil rule is another way to describe it - one must prove one has had it and used it to get the derogation.  It is set at 25%, but that is a just a figure.  It could be 10%, 50% or some other figure.  Equally, there is a lobby arguing that this interferes with the autonomy of the school.  There are tensions in this and there is a balance to be struck.</p></speech>

Rather than community colleges, these were places where there were very low expectations and people would learn sewing, knitting and cooking.</p></speech>

I am from Killarney and two of the best schools in Killarney are community colleges.  They provide the best opportunities and variety of opportunities for students.</p><p>  Traditionally, Traveller children would have been routed into places which had no academic expectations of them.  There was a presumption which persists that they would not do a junior certificate examination and they would not achieve anything or go to college via any route.

Traveller children must have their ethnicity and culture respected and shown in the curriculum in order for them to feel safe, supported, wanted and included.

That is what I want an integration system to comprise of.

What will the appeals committee do if the school has honourably done the right thing according to its own criteria?  I noted the concern expressed by the National Parents Council when it asked what if they have not done so.  It is a different issue when a school makes errors and parents correctly point them out but the school does not refuse to correct its errors.  That is a wider issue than enrolment and is about everything that permeates down.</p></speech>

There are wider issues beyond that regarding the decisions that are made every day in a school that can affect a child's education and whether the school principal and board listens to the voice of the parent.  As the committee will know, the Minister is talking about providing a parental charter to underpin the matter.</p></speech>

The greater level of information for the applicant the better.  When applying for enrolment the applicant will know the criteria, will be self-declaring and provide evidence that they meet the criteria.  Then the school principal will - I do not see it as a major decision - verify whether an application meets the criteria and if there are errors the board of management will act as the appeals process.  We are talking here about a fourth layer above that again.  If there is confidence that the process is done right and it is very transparent and clear, then we think that it is very workable and better than the current flawed section 29 process.</p></speech>

However, the provision of special education, be it in special school classes or in mainstream, needs to be considered.  There is a move towards mainstream in law, the Department and the NCSE and that needs to be taken into account.</p></speech>

The difference when a board makes a decision on enrolment is that all of the stakeholders make the primary decision.  However, there are situations where principals and boards are not in agreement.  This is one measure that does need to start off at that point.</p><p>  We have had some consideration of section 29.  Through the regulatory impact assessment, one of the things that was highlighted by the Department was cost.  It would be very unfortunate if all of the points that were made here, by all of the parties, were overridden by a potential cost of litigation against the Department regarding section 29 appeals.  That matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

In terms of outlining criteria, what if people, especially nomadic people, do not live in the area?  What if the parents have no literacy skills?  What if this is the first member of the family  to enter secondary school?  Supports have been taken away, there are not more visiting teachers and there is no liaison person to inform the parents about the criteria.

Among the matters impermissible in an enrolment policy, there is no mention of a language test.  If gaelscoileanna want to be able to operate a language test criterion, the board of management and a patron can do that.  A second issue, which is a matter for reflection, is considering how it is operated.  It runs against the proposal for not having interviews.  If that involves interviewing parents, interviewing children or having Irish tests, the Minister and the Government must reflect on the desirability of parents being interviewed for anything to do with enrolment.  Having it as a criterion in the admission policy is, by default, permissible as the regulations are drafted.  It is permissible as it is not listed as being impermissible.</p></speech>

I will not name schools but students in my constituency transfer from primary to post-primary on the basis of the sibling rule and from English-speaking speaking primary schools into a post primary school that uses the medium of Irish.  Some 300 yards down the road, gaelscoil students have been taught through the medium of Irish in primary school but are not able to get into the post-primary school.</p></speech>

It moves through its criteria for oversubscription and it made a change about one of the schools.  That is the autonomy question and the Minister is not proposing to be hands-on in every field.  Whether the remedy for that is a discussion between the interested parties, schools are being given a choice to cascade people where they are oversubscribed.  Where they are under-subscribed, they have no choice and that includes a gaelscoil taking on someone who does not meet the language test but who wants to go there.  In the case of oversubscription, patrons have autonomy except on a limited number of criteria.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400003#D00700"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman for the invitation to meet the committee today to discuss the agenda for the next meeting of the EU Environment Council, which takes place on the 13 December in Brussels.</p><p>  As this is my first appearance before the committee on EU matters since Ireland held the Presidency of the EU, I take this opportunity to touch briefly on achievements in the area of environment and sustainable development during our Presidency.  As I said when I addressed the committee in December 2012, our environmental Presidency objectives were quite ambitious in terms of advancing strategic policy, progressing certain legislative dossiers, and leading the EU in a very constructive and progressive way in international negotiations.  I also expressed confidence that we would have a very credible record of achievement under our belts, and l am pleased to report back that we delivered in all these areas.</p><p>  Where strategic policy is concerned, we paved the way for a better environment for the citizens of Europe by securing agreement on the 7th Environmental Action Programme.</p> <p> The agreed programme will guide and drive actions in advancing resource efficiency, the green economy and the environmental agenda generally in the period to 2020 and beyond.  We also succeeded in adopting Council conclusions on a climate change adaptation strategy which outlines how the EU can become more climate-resilient and can share experiences and expertise at EU, national and local levels to plan for a changing environment.</p><p> We achieved significant successes on major legislative files which are critically important to our climate and environment agendas.  l am proud to say that, overall, we achieved no less than seven first reading agreements on environmental legislative dossiers, an excellent legacy of work for the Irish EU Presidency.</p><p> In the interactional arena we also had a demanding agenda, leading for the EU at what were often very complex negotiations.  Here again, there were significant successes, including reaching agreement on a new global, legally-binding treaty on mercury.</p><p> Intensive EU Presidency planning started in my Department over three years ago and has, as I have just outlined, paid great dividends.  This preparatory process included ensuring that the number of infringement cases instituted against Ireland by the European Commission in respect of environmental legislation was significantly reduced.  I am pleased to confirm the number of these cases now stands at ten which compares with a figure of 19 when I assumed office in March 2011.</p><p> Turning now to the Council agenda for next week's meeting, discussions will take place on two legislative deliberations.  First, the Council will consider a proposal for a regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species.  My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, will also attend the Council to represent Ireland in discussions on this agenda item. </p><p> The EU Presidency has posed two groups of questions for Ministers to discuss in respect of the development of a list of invasive alien species of union concern.  This discussion will assist and direct the Council in its work on the proposed regulation over the coming months.</p><p> By way of background to this agenda item, I should state that invasive alien species are species that are transported through human action outside of their natural range across ecological barriers.  They then survive, reproduce and spread with likely negative impacts on the ecology of their new location, as well as potentially serious economic and social consequences, for example, in the area of human health.  Their impact on biodiversity can be significant, being one of the major causes of biodiversity loss and species extinction.  They can also cause serious damage to infrastructure, forestry, agriculture, aquaculture and recreational facilities.  In Ireland, species classified as invasive alien species would include the grey squirrel and mink, as well as particular plant species like certain weeds.</p><p> At the moment, there is no overarching legislative framework in the EU for dealing with this issue.  This lack of a co-ordinated approach can mean that positive work in one member state can be undermined by lack of action in others.  The proposed regulation aims to tackle the problem by establishing a framework for action to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to limit social and economic damage.</p><p> It will seek to do this by banning the intentional introduction of "species of Union concern" into the EU, putting in place measures to combat the unintentional introduction and release of such species, setting up an early-warning and rapid response system, and eradicating, or at least controlling, the most harmful ones throughout the EU.</p><p> Overall, like other member states, Ireland broadly welcomes the proposal as an important framework for managing a particularly difficult and costly problem.  However, there is some concern regarding the resource implications and the availability of funding needed to properly implement the regulation.  That said, the long-term cost of inaction cannot be underestimated.</p><p> There is also concern arising from the commission's proposal to cap the number of species covered by the regulation, which could restrict member states' ability to manage species of specific domestic concern.  In this regard, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Deenihan, will be seeking to ensure that the proposed regulation will not impinge on our domestic legislation and on the systems we already have in place for dealing with invasive alien species of particular national concern.</p><p> The second discussion to take place in Council is on a proposed regulation on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport.  While this is a policy matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, the issue will be dealt with through the Environment Council and I will be representing Ireland at Council in these discussions.</p><p> The main objective of the draft regulation is to establish a European system for the monitoring, reporting and evaluation of CO2 emissions from ships as a first step of a staged approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Member states are required to establish a system of penalties, information exchange and expulsion orders for non-compliance with the regulation.</p><p> There are no major implications for Irish shipping interests.  The scope of the regulation targets ships over a threshold of 5,000 gross tonnes.  There are only eight ships above this threshold on the Irish register at present.  However, there will be some resource implications for the maritime survey office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p> The proposal is currently being examined by the Environment Council's working group and we, along with many other member states, are awaiting clarifications from the commission regarding definitions and implications.</p><p> Over lunch, ministers will have an informal discussion on the implementation of the commitments reached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, more commonly known as Rio+20.  Discussions covering a number of strands are continuing under the auspices of the United Nations on developing a sustainable development framework to apply from 2015 onwards.  Intergovernmental negotiations will commence towards the end of 2014 to agree this post-2015 agenda as a successor to the Millennium Development Goals.</p><p> At the end of the day's business, the Council will consider a small number of items under the any other business heading, during which information will be provided to Council.  While detailed debate is not expected on the items listed, I will briefly touch on them now.</p><p> First, the Presidency will be providing a report on the recent climate change COP held in Warsaw last month.  As members of the committee may know, I attended the high-level segment of the Warsaw conference which was the first of three COPs towards the anticipated finalisation of a new global agreement in Paris in December 2015.  Although negotiations were difficult, the Warsaw COP saw the agreement of a work programme and timeline from Warsaw to Paris designed to deliver ambitious mitigation commitments from all countries.  It made progress towards a framework for parties to come forward with their commitments in a transparent manner, well in advance of the Paris COP in December 2015, and set out a number of ways in which pre-2020 ambition will be enhanced and accelerated.</p><p> The main focus of the EU and other developed-country parties was on securing a clear process and milestones to get all parties, including developing countries, to bring meaningful emission reduction commitments to the table early in 2015.  In that way, there can be robust analysis to see whether we are on track globally to keep temperature increases below two degrees and to see whether there is a fair share of efforts being undertaken by those countries able to do so, especially the larger economies currently outside the Kyoto commitments process, like China, Brazil, the US, India and others.</p><p> The EU had four priorities in Warsaw: sending a clear signal that parties had to start the domestic analysis needed to come forward with mitigation commitments in the 2015 agreement; a timeline from Warsaw to Paris designed to deliver ambitious mitigation commitments; agreement that, when parties come forward with their commitments, they would have to do so in a way that is transparent and allows them to be easily understood, sufficiently in advance of Paris; and agreement on a process to assess proposed commitments to ensure they are fair and sufficiently ambitious.</p><p> The consensus decisions adopted by the parties delivered the first three of these and creates a space to ensure the last objective in relation to achieving the ultimate objective of the convention - the below two degrees goal - is met.</p><p> While on climate matters, let me turn briefly to the domestic front.  First of all, l thank the joint committee for its recently published report on the outline heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill and the associated analysis report by the NESC secretariat.  I am grateful to the committee for facilitating a debate on national policy and legislation through inviting written submissions from interested individuals and groups as well as in conducting oral hearings.</p><p> I welcome the fact that the joint committee acknowledges that Ireland's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the periods to 2030, 2040 and 2050 should be as ultimately agreed by member states as part of any future effort-sharing decision agreed at EU level.  Having said that, we should not be without a clear vision for the future, as proposed by the joint committee in its interpretation of low carbon development.</p><p> Although the joint committee's many possible courses of action remain under consideration, my preliminary view is that reducing the intervals between proposed national roadmaps for emission reductions from seven to five years is a good one, so as to enable rapidly changing circumstances both nationally and internationally to be addressed.  Similarly, I believe that the joint committee's emphasis on strengthening the functioning of the proposed national expert advisory body on climate change is well grounded, and I will be examining closely how this can be achieved institutionally and operationally.  In this regard, empowering the expert advisory body to directly publish its annual reports is a reasonable accommodation which I would like to see in the final draft heads of the Bill.</p><p> In the main, the joint committee's report constitutes a constructive and helpful addition to the debate on the Bill.  I have asked my officials to carefully analyse the report with a view to identifying appropriate changes to the provisions in the forthcoming climate action and low carbon development Bill.</p><p> I will now finish with some brief comments on the remaining AOB items on the Council's agenda.  The Lithuanian Presidency will provide a brief update on a proposal for a directive on promoting the use of energy from renewable sources.  This proposal seeks to amend both the renewable energy directive and the fuel quality directive, with a view to minimising the impact of indirect changes of land use on greenhouse gas emissions.  The Commission published a report in 2010 on indirect land use change, ILUC, related to biofuels and bio-liquids, which acknowledged that ILUC can impact on potential greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with biofuels.</p><p> In relation to aviation aspects of the EU emissions trading system, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, assembly recently decided on the development of a global market-based mechanism for international aviation to be finalised at the next assembly in 2016, with implementation to take place by 2020.  In response to this, the European Commission has brought forward a proposal amending the EU emissions trading system directive.</p> <p>This proposal would apply from 2014 to 2020 when it is expected that a global market-based mechanism would become applicable.  Discussions at a working party level are currently taking place on the European Commission proposal with the next meeting scheduled for 6 December.  In general, Ireland welcomes the proposal as a way forward which allows further negotiations on a global agreement to reduce aviation emissions.  The Commission will present a proposal for a directive on packaging and packaging waste to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags.</p><p> The introduction of a plastic bag levy in Ireland has been one of the major success stories in terms of Ireland's environmental performance in the last decade and we are leading the way in terms of our efforts to reduce consumption.  The levy has been hugely successful and has very significantly altered consumer behaviour.  Our strong performance in this area means that we are to the fore in pioneering progressive policies and in significantly reducing use of such bags. </p><p> Ireland welcomes efforts to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags and we hope that our efforts and successes have been helpful to the Commission in developing its proposals.  However, it will be important that we are not made to suffer as a result of our previous strong performance in this area.  Our progress has been so extensive that further reductions will be more difficult for Ireland to achieve than for other member states.  We will be seeking to ensure that the final instrument takes proper account of our ground-breaking efforts in this area. </p><p> The Commission will be providing an update on the review of the EU's thematic strategy on air pollution.  The review explores options for further mitigating impacts of air pollution on health and the environment based on the most up-to-date science, which indicated that air pollution can still cause harm at very low levels, even below current EU standards.  Ireland welcomes new measures being taken at EU level to protect and improve air quality which will provide increased protection for human health.  Moreover, there is a growing consensus that air pollution policies can better link with climate change mitigation given that key air pollutants such as black carbon and ozone are significant components of atmospheric warming.  During our Presidency, we facilitated an important discussion among Ministers and also with key policy makers and stakeholders and I am pleased to see that these considerations have fed into the proposed strategic reforms and initiatives.  Finally, Greece will present its programme for its Presidency commencing on 1 January 2014.  </p><p> This is a run-through of the main items tabled for next week's Council agenda.  I am happy to deal with any questions which the Chairman or members may have.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I acknowledge the success of the Irish Presidency and congratulate the Minister and his officials on the progress and achievements that have been made.  I will now take questions and remarks from the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400005#F00300"><p>It is valuable that we have reduced the number of areas where we might be subject to fines from 19 to ten.  Could the Minister outline what progress has been made in respect of the ten areas to which he referred, whether we will still be subject to fines and what these fines are?  There is work to be done in respect of the use of forestry and bog land as carbon sinks.  Will that be done in advance of Paris in 2015?  Clearly, that will have an impact on what our obligations will be.  We underperformed in terms of some of that capacity being counted.  How will that happen practically?</p><p>  In respect of our sectoral plans, the Minister stated that this is where the national ambition will stated.  Presumably, each of the Departments such as the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport, Tourism and Sport are working on those.  Is that what we will bring to the table in terms of how we are going to do things or will we be addressing anything in respect of targets?  </p><p>  Obviously, the typhoon in the Philippines focused minds.  There is nothing like a good hanging to get people's attention.  The Minister said in one of the documents that the pace picked up.  What is meant by that in a practical sense?  I welcome the fact that the Minister has acknowledged some of the efforts relating to the work we did on the pre-legislative stage regarding the heads of the Bill.  I thought it was a very useful exercise.  We are certainly more informed.  The Minister is acknowledging that some aspects are likely to find their way into the Bill.  It is really important that this happens if this way of dealing with legislation is going to be a feature in the future because there was quite an investment in terms of the time made by the committee and the research undertaken by those who came to talk to us.  </p><p>  We were talking about how the reduction in emissions might be achieved in the aviation sector.  Is there a rounded discussion of that?  Emissions will be one side of it but as an island, we are very exposed in respect of the means of transport.  If one is on the European mainland, it is noticeable how heavily used the railway system is.  That option is not available to us.  If there will be a reduction in carriers, we need to look at more than emissions.  Is there a rounded discussion on it that takes place in the context of reducing emissions by carriers by reducing the number of carriers and the difficulties that might present in respect of the availability of cost-efficient means of travel?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400005#F00400"><p>We have reduced infringements from 19 to ten.  This includes issues like environmental impact assessments of farms and septic tanks.  We were fined up to &euro;5 million in respect of those two issues and paid those fines.  Those cases are now closed so there will be no further activity on those files.  We are working through others which are at various levels of development with the Commission.  Some are at a reasoned opinion stage.  We hope that we do not have to go to court and are very active on all the files to ensure this does not happen.  Some of them affect our Department while others affect the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We are co-ordinating our responses to the Commission across the three Departments at all times to make sure none of those cases is elevated to the stage where we end up in the courts and are subject to fines.</p><p>  In respect of the climate change discussions, all roads lead to Paris in 2015.  Inevitably, there was an element of "let's wait for the next day" in Warsaw in respect of making more substantial progress than was made in Warsaw.  Nevertheless, the process was agreed in Warsaw where people will make commitments in respect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  We have agreed how they are going to make those commitments, how they can be open and transparent in the way they are made and that they can be evaluated and analysed by member states in advance of Paris.  Warsaw was seen as a staging post along the way to Paris.  I am sure the next round in Lima in Peru will be the same.  Gradually and slowly, progress is being made towards getting larger countries involved in the process.  The European Union only deals with 14% of the greenhouse gas emissions.  Countries like China, the US, India and Brazil need to be brought to the table more assertively and they are slowly  being brought to the table, particularly the US.</p><p>  The sectoral road maps and national road maps will feed into each other.  </p> <p>We are particularly interested in agriculture, transport, energy and building regulations.  I have had very good meetings with the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in recent times.  We have set up a process to get technical back up from the ESRI and UCC in order to ensure whatever comes through is robust and will help the strategic analysis of the draft national roadmaps.  Work in this regard is progressing and I expect that a number of initiatives will be implemented in the coming months.  Once we complete the sectoral roadmaps we will have them evaluated with the help of our technical experts.  We will be able to revise our climate Bill in line with the recommendations of this committee.  I have already signalled the changes I am prepared to introduce in this regard.  I intend to proceed with the establishment of the expert group on an interim basis because we need to make the expertise of certain individuals available to my Department and this committee for the purpose of completing our deliberations.</p><p> I emphasise that the challenges are significant.  The 2020 targets at EU level, to which Ireland subscribes by law, are ambitious and will create challenges for various sectors.  We will have to meet the targets, however, or we will again be brought before the European Court of Justice and subjected to fines.</p><p> The emissions trading scheme for the aviation sector is difficult not just for the industry but also from the point of view of consumers.  There is no point in the European Union standing alone with a solution to the aviation issue that does not involve the big players in the sector globally.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, assembly has made progress in this regard.  I hope a global agreement will be reached with the help of the European Commission, which is at the progressive end of the ambitions for these matters.  Most of the European proposals can be seen as reasonable and should be adopted by some of the major countries.  Major difficulties have arisen during 2013 on reaching agreement on aviation and reducing emissions.  Technology has to come into play and consumers do not want to pay any more than they have to for their flights.  The agreement must be on a global basis rather than among individual EU member states if we are not to be at a competitive disadvantage.</p></speech>

In regard to the plastic bag levy, I welcome that the Minister will fight our corner given the amount of work we have done in this regard.  If we were put on the same level as other countries which have not achieved as much as us and asked to achieve a blanket 50% reduction, it would be unfair on us.  However, we must not be complacent because people easily revert to their old habits.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to clarify the Lithuanian Presidency's plans for renewable resources in regard to land use and the impact its focus on biofuels will have on carbon emissions.  I welcome his comments on the work we have done over the summer on the heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2013.  I hope he will take on board much of what we have proposed.  We had a constructive engagement on the Bill and there is strong interest in its provisions.</p><p>  Will the Council be examining the various public awareness campaigns being conducted in other countries on climate change and its potential impact on societies?  I have been following the discussions on infrastructure development but I fear this topic is being lost.  I am concerned that the eye is off the ball in terms of public discourse.  How successful have we been in spreading the message about the challenges we face in maintaining energy security and meeting our responsibilities that are suffering because of climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400006#G00300"><p>On the plastic bags issue, we are conscious that the ambition with which this country led the way must not be thwarted by some of the unintended consequences of what might be proposed.  Several years ago we were all discussing the huge opportunities for Ireland in biofuel production.  The discussion appears to have gone quiet in recent times because of issues relating to profitability.  An unintended consequence of that debate was the impact of biofuels on land and emissions.  These issues have come into play as part of our discussions on the indirect changes to land use arising from biofuels.  We want the scientific evidence underlying what is being proposed to be set out in an open and transparent way so that we can determine the impact of these measures on biofuel production.  We have to meet renewable energy targets as part of the renewable energy directive but we want the associated risk to be teased out.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy in regard to public awareness of climate change.  I hope the sectoral roadmaps that will be published by the various Departments in the spring set out the practical measures required to deal with these issues, as well as spelling out the implications of not taking action.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the Philippines.  Our television screens bring home to us the potential for trouble but people move on quite quickly and forget about the disasters.  Even in a smaller way, there could be major impacts on our own citizens and coastal areas.  I will be investigating ways of selling the message based on the sectoral roadmaps from the Departments and the practical measures we need to highlight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400006#G00400"><p>The Minister's reference to infringements reminded me of our lengthy discussions on septic tanks.  Has that issue been resolved and has it been costly to the State?</p><p>  As someone who lives near Dublin Port, I have always been interested in maritime transport.  Dirty fuels, or bunker fuels as they are known in the trade, have been banned in certain ports.  Have any discussions been entered into in that regard?</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's remarks on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2013.  The expert advisory group will be very important in terms of giving confidence to citizens that they are getting proper and independent advice.  However, the matter needs to be progressed quickly.  I ask the Minister to outline his next steps.  He only recently received the report but I am curious to learn his thoughts on it.</p><p>  On packaging waste, we in Ireland have concentrated on plastic bags.  However, I am also concerned about over packaging.  We speak about reducing, reusing and recycling but we have not done enough on reducing packaging.  I always take note of the level of over packaging of products in supermarkets.  This consumes resources and it is more about advertising products than the packaging itself.</p> <p>Has the Minister given any thought to that?</p><p> Air quality in Ireland has improved, especially in urban areas.  Mary Harney did well when she was a junior Minister in the Department to ban smoky fuels, which had been creating a major problem in Dublin.  However, a recent report was published on air quality in small and medium-sized towns in rural Ireland.  The ban on smoky coal has been extended but because such coal is freely sold in Northern Ireland, smuggling still presents a problem.  Can this be considered from a European perspective or be discussed with Westminster and the Northern Ireland Executive to address smoky coal on a 32-county basis?  If we continue down the road of the ban, smuggling will increase.</p><p> Bonfires to burn waste, etc., which are illegal, remain an issue for air quality especially in rural areas.  Has the Minister had discussions with local authorities about implementing by-laws in this regard?  More dioxins are produced by a bonfire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013120400007#H00200"><p>We paid &euro;2.7 million in fines to the EU arising because of our inactivity in registering septic tanks.  That would have been unnecessary if action had been taken earlier.  That was a lower figure than was being highlighted to us by the Commission earlier in the process.  Within weeks of becoming Minister, I dealt with that issue but it was a little late in the day from the point of view of heading off some of the fines.  The nonsense uttered at public meetings about ground-water quality associated with septic tanks can be now be seen for what it is.  People in rural Ireland know and understand the necessity for good ground-water.  It is in the interest of public health and jobs, particularly in the food industry.  If people want to campaign against ground-water quality, they are seeking to close rural Ireland in the future in the context of economic activity.  It was a disgraceful campaign and I am delighted that we were able to secure decisions in the Oireachtas and in the European Parliament to show we are serious about ground-water quality and it was flattering to hear some people making representations to Government and Opposition Members about the modest proposals we put through the Houses for a risk-based approach.  People were then seeking inspections to be carried out by local authorities in order that they could access the financial assistance I announced.  However, this is the sort of nonsense that gives us all a bad name.</p><p>  I will establish the expert committee on climate change in the next few weeks and I will do that on <i>ad hoc </i>basis pending the enactment of the legislation.  I have indicated I will take a number of the committee's recommendations on board in the revised legislation and, hopefully, it will be published by Easter next year.  I hope to go to the Government before the end of the year on a new climate policy to reflect some of the issues we discussed here regarding the sectoral map.  A great deal of political activity is likely to happen on the climate change agenda in 2014.</p></speech>

I have no problem with that.  I take expert views from all sources.  The fact that I have taken on board reasonable suggestions shows how valuable the work of the committee is.  The Deputy stated that she wanted the committee set up on the same basis as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and I have no difficulty with that.</p></speech>

We conducted one recently on packaging and I refer members to this on our website.  They can examine it and make recommendations in the context of implementation.  However, I am not proceeding with a packaging levy.  There are ways to deal with this issue without imposing additional costs on retailers and so on.</p><p>  Air quality is a hugely important issue, which I prioritised during the EU Presidency.  The first item on the agenda during the informal Presidency meeting in Dublin was how to make progress on this.  The European Commission has published a thematic paper on air quality.  Side by side with that, I engaged with my Northern Ireland counterpart and an all-island study is being carried out currently.  The work of the consultants on behalf of both jurisdictions is under way and they will report to us by the end of May next year.  Their recommendations will feed into the further actions we need to take on air quality.  It is important this is done on an all-island basis for the reasons Deputy Humphreys outlined, especially smuggling.  Smoky coal is the big issue and I have indicated it will be banned by 2016.  All the distributors and manufacturers know we have set this target date and they can devise alternatives to supply fuel to householders.  We had a positive announcement arising from that in Foynes, County Limerick.  The creation of 100 jobs was announced by CPL, which manufactures alternative fuel products to the ones we have become used to, which are damaging to air quality.  There is a great deal of activity in this State and in Northern Ireland in this regard.</p><p>  We have good engagement with local authorities through the waste enforcement network with the EPA regarding bonfires and so on.  We have continued to emphasise the importance of that for rural areas at our regular meetings.</p></speech>

We have some producer-responsibility initiatives and I announced the public consultation process for two of them in recent times.  One was for tyres.  In a rural constituency, like the Vice Chairman's and mine, they are not all in silage pits.  If we could find the 50% of them that go missing it would be a big help to the environment.  There is also an initiative for end-of-life vehicles.  We are not introducing new green taxes.  Levies are already being imposed on the customer for tyres and end-of-life vehicles to assist in the necessary resources for disposal.  I wanted to correct an erroneous headline that appeared in a newspaper recently suggesting that we were introducing new environmental taxes to deal with these waste streams; we are not.</p></speech>

Earlier he spoke about alien invasive species.  We have an example on Lough Derg where the zebra mussel came in.  While the various European directives and proposals are laudable in one sense, action on the ground to deal with them seems to be very scarce.  There does not seem to be any concrete proposal to address it and it has gone on and on.  The only proposal that is coming forward is seemingly to take them up to Dublin in the water.  Perhaps the people in Dublin might not like the water if they were aware of this invasive species that inhabits Lough Derg.</p><p>  How does the Minister propose to deal with overlapping between Departments?  An example is the ash dieback disease.  One would expect it to be dealt with by the forestry section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  However, it is airborne and has and we can talk about air quality and the impact that has particularly on rural industries like forestry.  Are there proposals to deal with that?</p></speech>

I accept that issues relating to air quality bring about the spread of this particular disease.  We will certainly be glad to take up the Vice Chairman's concern about the necessity to keep in touch with the forestry section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in an interdepartmental way to assist in coming to some conclusions or recommendations to ensure that this disease does not spread unnecessarily because of inaction by agencies or Departments.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to meet them today to review recent discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council in the latter half of 2013.  It has been a busy few months with the Council focusing on a number of important issues, including efforts to reinvigorate the Middle East peace process, the search for a resolution to the ongoing crisis in Syria, instability in the wider southern neighbourhood region and intensive debate about our future engagement with our partners to the east.</p><p>  The eastern partnership summit took place in Vilnius on Thursday and Friday of last week.  I will begin by providing an overview and assessment of developments in the run-up to and following the summit.  The Foreign Affairs Council has had regular discussions on the eastern partnership in recent months in preparation for last week's summit.  A key issue related to whether Ukraine had fulfilled the criteria set out by the Council for signature of an association agreement with the EU.  As members will be aware, in the event, Ukraine opted to suspend its preparations for signature, citing national security considerations and the wish to renew trade with Russia and other members of the Eurasian customs union.  Ukraine's decision is a disappointment to us all as we believe that the prospective association agreement has the potential to support much needed reforms in Ukraine and to help build a better future for its people.</p><p>  Disappointment is also evident in the large public demonstrations taking place in Kiev.  I urge the Ukrainian authorities to respect the right to freedom of expression and assembly and to respond in a restrained manner.  The EU's fair offer stands, and it will be for Ukraine to decide on its future path.</p><p>  On a more positive note, the summit also saw the initialling of the EU association agreements with Georgia and Moldova.  In reviewing the summit at the forthcoming December Council, Ministers will wish to discuss how best the EU can support both countries in following their chosen path in the face of likely external pressure from Russia.  The broader question of the future course of the eastern partnership and its relations with the Eurasian customs union will need to be addressed by Ministers in the coming months and will also have to be factored into our discussions with Russia <i>en marge</i> of the Council meeting and at the January 2014 EU-Russia summit.</p><p>  The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been invited to join us for discussion over lunch at the December Council.  There are clearly areas where we can co-operate constructively with Russia, including on non-proliferation, the fight against terrorism and in our engagement with Iran and Afghanistan.  It is also equally clear that our perspectives and values continue to diverge to a significant degree on other issues, including in the human rights sphere.  Most immediately, and in the wake of last week's summit  in Vilnius, it will be interesting to hear what our Russian colleague has to say about the eastern partnership and specifically Moscow's view on Ukraine's future orientation and aspirations for greater European integration.</p><p>  Turning to the southern neighbourhood, a key issue on the Council's agenda remains the appalling conflict in Syria which is now approaching its third anniversary.  The Council discussed the latest developments in Syria at its meetings in October and November and will do so again when it meets on 16 December.</p><p>  The major recent development was the announcement by UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, on 25 November that the long-planned Geneva II peace conference is scheduled to begin on 22 January.</p> <p>I welcome this announcement and commend Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Joint Special Representative Brahimi, and also Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov for their efforts to persuade both the Assad Government and the Syrian opposition to attend these crucial talks.</p><p> It is imperative that all sides involved in the Syrian conflict now embrace this vital opportunity to achieve a political resolution and promote an agreed transition within Syria.  The challenges of reaching agreement remain immense, not least since both sides continue to believe that they can achieve victory on the battle-field, and at the cost of immense suffering for the Syrian population.  I urge all those invited to Geneva, which should include all significant regional players involved with or able to influence the conflict, to expend every effort in seeking an agreed and just outcome.</p><p> The other vital aspect of the Syrian conflict is the humanitarian situation.  A particularly heavy price is being paid by Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, notably Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, which have had to bear the brunt of coping with the more than 2 million refugees from the conflict.  The Council addressed the regional impact of the crisis in its conclusions last month and recognised the importance of support and financial assistance, developmental as well as humanitarian, to enable the host countries to respond to the growing needs of both refugees and those communities hosting them.  I am pleased that Ireland has been able to respond generously to the major humanitarian crisis confronting Syria and the wider region.  Our total contribution to date stands at &euro;13.8 million, of which &euro;11.15 million has been provided in 2013.</p><p> In my remarks to the November Council, I emphasised the vital issue of access for humanitarian aid.  The UN now estimates there are some 2.5 million people inside Syria in need who have not been reached with any assistance for up to a year.  The UN Security Council on 2 October adopted a Presidential statement urging all sides in Syria to respect their international legal obligations and facilitate access by humanitarian actors to those in need.  Regrettably, this statement appears to have had little impact on the ground.  I will continue to emphasise the urgent need for the UN Security Council to adopt a binding Resolution which might compel all sides, but particularly the Syrian government, to remove obstacles to the delivery of aid.</p><p> The process of destruction of Syria&rsquo;s stock of chemical weapons, which is being overseen by the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, is underway and remains on course to meet the mid-2014 end-date.  Ireland has joined with other EU and international partners in offering financial support to this process.  However, major challenges remain, not least the actual destruction of chemical weapons stocks which is due to commence early in the new year.</p><p> I attended an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 August which considered the widespread disturbances in Egypt following the forced dispersal of supporters of the ousted President, Mohammed Morsi, which resulted in the deaths of many hundreds of people.  The Council has continued to closely monitor developments in the interim and the EU, including through its Special Representative, Bernardino Leon, has remained actively engaged in efforts to try to promote reconciliation and political dialogue, and to fully restore Egypt to a path of democracy and constitutional order.  The Council will discuss the current situation in Egypt at its December meeting.  There have been some recent positive developments, notably the lifting last month of the State of Emergency imposed in August.  However, there are also worrying developments, such as the adoption in recent weeks of a draconian new anti-protest law which fails to safeguard such basic rights as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. </p><p> The interim government of President Mansour continues to follow the 20 August road map aimed at implementing a new constitution before proceeding to hold fresh parliamentary and presidential elections.  The revised constitution is likely to be finalised shortly and submitted to a referendum possibly as early as January, with both elections then due to be held before the summer.  I welcome the invitation extended to the EU to monitor the constitutional referendum.</p><p> Little progress is evident however, as regards reconciliation and launching a genuinely inclusive political dialogue within the country.  Egypt appears more politically polarised than ever between those who supported the ousting of President Morsi&rsquo;s government last July and those who opposed it.  I believe we should continue to pass clear messages to the interim authorities on the need for dialogue, inclusivity and restoring Egypt to a fully constitutional path.  Ultimately, the problems which Egypt has encountered in recent months are political and can only be fully resolved through dialogue. </p><p> Following the tragic sinking of a boat carrying illegal migrants off the coast of Lampedusa in early October, in which several hundred people lost their lives, discussions have intensified at EU level on how to prevent similar tragedies from recurring.  These issues have been recently discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council and the European Council.  Foreign Ministers also discussed the issue at our November meeting, in light of instability in the Southern Neighbourhood and the wider security threat that this poses.  The JHA Council this week will examine a report from the Commission Taskforce established to identify priority actions to address these problems, and the Presidency will report back on this matter to the December European Council.</p><p> Although not formally on its agenda in recent months, the Council has been kept fully appraised by High Representative Ashton of progress in the vital negotiations being conducted by the E3+3, that is, France, Germany, the UK, the US, Russia and China with Iran in regard to its nuclear programme.  As I said in my statement at the time, I warmly welcome the agreement reached in Geneva early on the 24 November by the E3+3 and Iran.  High Representative Ashton and all those involved, including Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif, are to be commended for having fashioned an agreement which was never going to be easy and involved difficult concessions on all sides.</p><p> The Geneva accord, due to run for six months but renewable, represents a first step towards a comprehensive agreement with Iran aimed at resolving the many concerns and questions to which Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme has given rise over the past decade.  It should be welcomed as setting out a road map for resolving diplomatically this vital international issue and helping to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I have no doubt that, if faithfully implemented by all sides over the next six months, it can greatly contribute to promoting increased regional and global security.  I look forward to hearing High Representative Ashton&rsquo;s own personal assessment when she briefs the Council on the Geneva agreement on 16 December.</p><p> The December Council is expected to take stock of developments in regard to the Middle East peace process.  The US-sponsored peace talks began in late July and are now at almost the half-way point of their allotted nine-month time-span.  Both parties are continuing to engage and wisely saying nothing publicly about the discussions to date.  I have on numerous occasions expressed both Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s full support for this process which possibly represents the last chance to achieve a negotiated two-state solution.  It is incumbent upon us to give the parties every opportunity to engage meaningfully in the talks and hopefully make progress in addressing the core issues which are well known.</p><p> No-one under-estimates the scale of the challenge facing the two negotiating teams.  Nor would it be honest to pretend that all has run smoothly during the past four months.  President Abbas is continuing his efforts to persuade his negotiating team, led by Saed Erekat, to rescind the resignations which they submitted some weeks ago in protest at announcements of further Israeli settlement expansion.</p><p> I and many others in the international community have criticised these announcements as not being consistent with a genuine effort to achieve a peace deal.  None the less, my strong advice to both sides would be to stay the course.  These talks are benefitting from the strong personal commitment and involvement of both Secretary of State Kerry and President Obama.  If all sides genuinely engage in good faith in the remaining months and desist from actions counter-productive to the talks process, then I believe that long-sought prize of a just, agreed two-state solution can still be achieved, to the immense benefit of not just the Middle East region but the world.</p><p> EU foreign affairs and defence Ministers met in a joint session at the November meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council for a wide ranging discussion on the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Their discussions were informed by a report from the High Representative and a Commission Communication.  We discussed draft conclusions on CSDP which were subsequently formally adopted on 25 November.  The conclusions cover the effectiveness and visibility of the CSDP, the capabilities required for CSDP missions and the defence industry from where these capabilities are sourced.  The conclusions have been conveyed to President Van Rompuy and together with input from the Competitiveness Council and the EDA Steering Board will form the basis for the December European Council Conclusions on defence issues.</p><p> The December Council is expected to review developments in the Western Balkans region, in advance of the adoption by the General Affairs Council the following day of conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s annual enlargement package.  At our November meeting, we had a good discussion on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.   I joined with my colleagues in voicing my concern at the lack of progress in the country.  We expressed support for the EU&rsquo;s on-going efforts to facilitate agreement among the country&rsquo;s leaders on constitutional reform, in particular on the implementation of the European Court of Human Right&rsquo;s "Sejdić-Finci"  ruling.  I very much hope that agreement can be reached soon on this sensitive issue, which is a key requirement in order for Bosnia to continue to pursue its EU integration path.</p> <p>I expect we will again address the situation in Bosnia at our December meeting, as well as discussing relations with Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia.</p><p> Myanmar-Burma has also featured on the Council agenda in recent months. We were joined for lunch by Aung San Suu Kyi at the October meeting.  Her main request to the EU related to the need to reinforce strong political messages to the Myanmar Government to push ahead with the reform agenda.  At the November Council, High Representative Ashton reported on the first meeting of the EU-Myanmar task force, which took place in Rangoon on 14 and 15 November last.  The task force reiterated the EU's political messages to the Myanmar Government in terms of inclusive and deep democracy, also in view of the elections in 2015.  Bilateral contacts have also intensified in recent months.</p><p> Officials from my Department visited Myanmar-Burma in early July on a scoping mission.  Their objectives were to explore possible economic and trade opportunities and to identify options for a focussed programme of development assistance to help underpin the political transition that is under way in the country.  Having considered the report of that mission, and the reports of recent visits by our ambassador in Hanoi, who is accredited to Myanmar, I have decided to approve funding of &euro;500,000 for a bilateral development assistance programme in Myanmar-Burma in 2013.  This is in addition to the &euro;1.3 million provided to Tr&oacute;caire and the &euro;250,000 provided to GOAL already this year.  In implementing the development programme, we will take on board the comments made by Aung San Suu Kyi at the October Council.  We will focus on support for improved livelihoods for poor rural people, the development of the agriculture sector, support for the peace process and the development of responsible business practice and transparency.  As we embark on this bilateral programme of support, it will be important to continue to monitor and address humanitarian needs and responses in light of the difficult situations in Rakhine and Kachin states.</p><p> High Representative Ashton briefed Ministers at the November Council meeting in advance of the 16th EU-China summit.  The summit, which took place in Beijing on 21 November last and was presided over by President Xi Jinping and Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso, delivered a number of positive outcomes, including the launching of negotiations on an investment agreement.  There have been developments at bilateral level, including a political and trade mission to Beijing and Shanghai, which I led from 30 July to 2 August 2013.  I held a bilateral meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai during his visit to Ireland in October.  Our discussions covered a wide range of topics, including Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery, ways to advance bilateral co-operation across a range of areas and human rights issues.  On 23 November last, China announced that it had established an East China sea air defence identification zone over an area of the East China Sea that covers the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which are also claimed by Japan.  In a declaration on 28 November last, the High Representative expressed the EU's concern at China&rsquo;s decision to establish this zone and called on all sides to exercise caution and restraint.  Ireland would wish to see this dispute resolved peacefully through dialogue and in accordance with international law.</p><p> The December Foreign Affairs Council is expected to endorse the strategic framework for the EU and member states' non-military engagement in Afghanistan from mid-2014 to 2016.  EU engagement will focus on existing frameworks and areas critical to achieving progress in Afghanistan over the next three years.  An EU priority is to promote Afghan ownership and mutual accountability of the Government of Afghanistan and the international community on the basis of the Tokyo mutual accountability framework.  The EU will also focus on further development of Afghanistan's civil institutions to provide the resilience needed to safeguard progress achieved to date.</p><p> It is expected at this stage that the December Council will discuss developments in the Central African Republic, which has seen an escalation of political instability and violence in recent weeks.  This is a cause of grave concern to Ireland and our EU partners.  Our discussions will consider what support the EU might provide and will be informed by developments at the UN Security Council.</p><p> At our December meeting, Foreign Ministers will consider a report and recommendations by the High Representative on the European External Action Service, which was established in 2010 and has been in operation for nearly three years.  The review process has provided a useful opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved to date and to consider what areas might be further improved in the period ahead.  The General Affairs Council is expected to adopt formal conclusions with regard to the European External Action Service review at its meeting the following day.</p><p> I thank the committee for its valuable contribution and support over the last 12 months.  I look forward to continuing engagement with members in 2014.  I will happy to take any questions they might have.</p></speech>

As we have another session with the T&aacute;naiste later today, I ask members to keep their questions and comments brief.  Many people want to contribute to this meeting.  I would appreciate it if members would focus on asking questions rather than making comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400004#C00300"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's detailed statement on the issues discussed at recent meetings and to be discussed at the forthcoming Council meeting.  The eastern partnership is very important in the interests of stability and prosperity in the countries to the east of the EU.  At one stage, the Kremlin regarded the eastern partnership as just another EU initiative.  It seems to have amended its view to one of outright opposition.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us whether there has been any dialogue with the Russian authorities since last week at Commissioner level or at the level of the President of the Council?  I welcome the fact that the Russian Foreign Minister will join the Ministers for lunch at the Council meeting.</p><p>  We appreciate the submission of the detailed briefing note that was prepared by the Department.  According to the briefing note, an EU-Russia summit is "currently scheduled" for the end of January.  That suggests to me that there may be a doubt about whether the summit meeting will go ahead.  It is very important that it does from the perspective of developing relations between the EU and Russia.</p><p>  I would like to comment on the figures quoted by the T&aacute;naiste with regard to Syria.  It is frightening to think that 2.5 million people have not been reached with assistance over the past year, that 6 million people have been displaced and that terrible loss of life and acts of inhumanity have occurred.  We hope some progress will be made at the Geneva II conference at the end of January.  I have seen correspondence from a person who is advocating on behalf of the opposition in Syria.  Obviously, I do not know the accuracy of this suggestion.  The person in question quoted from some noted international commentators on foreign relations who believe there is widespread concern about the "lack of western support for the moderates" and their "effective abandonment" by the west.  They argue that Assad is regaining momentum and suggest that air bombardments and barrel bombings are continuing.  Obviously, I hope this correspondence is wrong in its suggestion that the talks will be "pointless".  It is important that we air this viewpoint, which has been put to us.  I do not know how well based it is.  The humanitarian crisis in Syria has departed the public mind following the desperate typhoon disaster and subsequent humanitarian crisis in the Philippines.  We hope the T&aacute;naiste will continue to encourage the EU and the international community to provide more assistance to the people of Syria.  We should recognise the good assistance that Syria has received from neighbouring countries and the pressures that have been placed on those countries.</p><p>  Having been critical of the European External Action Service in the past, I acknowledge that High Representative Ashton has been praised for her role in achieving an interim agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.  It is important for me to record that at a time when the work of the action service is being reviewed.</p><p>  The outlook for the Middle East peace process is not very positive at the moment.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could indicate to us whether there have been any developments regarding the ban on products from illegal settlements.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the unfortunate increase in violence in the Central African Republic.  I think there was an Irish Aid programme there in the past.  The T&aacute;naiste might let us know whether we are in a position to assist the people of that country at this time.</p><p>  I hope the humanitarian problems facing the people of the Philippines following the terrible disaster there will be considered at the Council meeting.  When Mr. Peter Power of UNICEF, who is a former D&aacute;il colleague of ours, gave this committee a detailed, effective and powerful presentation on the crisis a fortnight ago, he outlined very clearly the difficulties that will arise when the pictures go from our television screens and there is very little international coverage of the difficulties in the Philippines.  We must be very conscious that they will need assistance in the long term.</p> <p>It was brought to our attention that in one area where 90% of the community depends on fishing for an income, practically every boat and vessel had been shattered and broken.  Sadly, the possibility of deriving a livelihood from the sea has been taken from this community.  I hope humanitarian issues in Syria and the Philippines will be at the forefront of considerations when the T&aacute;naiste meets his colleagues at the forthcoming Council.  I thank him again for his detailed presentation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400005#D00200"><p>The T&aacute;naiste referred to events in Ukraine, about which we are all concerned.  The European Union appears to have adopted a zero sum position where the Ukraine must agree to the complete package if progress is to be made.  Could anything else have been done in this process?  For example, should the European Union have engaged in simultaneous negotiations with the Russian Federation?</p><p>  Ukrainians face the possibility of facing freezing winter conditions without gas and power supplies because they may be cut.  There is also a concern that a state of emergency will be called, which would give the authorities repressive powers.  Ukraine has been unstable since the jailing of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko on politically motivated charges.  There are tensions in the country between pro-EU and pro-Russian sides.  Is it possible to bridge this gap?  Many people believe the wider region has the potential to become a bridge between the European Union and Russia but the countries of the region are in a difficult position.  Could the European Union do more in this regard?  Buildings are being occupied and the police are being attacked in Ukraine, which is in a state of unrest.  At the same time, the EU is taking a strong line requiring the country to agree to everything before anything is agreed.  That is how the position appears to an outsider in any case. </p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste confirmed that the Geneva II talks on Syria will take place.  The situation in Syria is deteriorating.  One issue that is being overlooked is the role of the Kurdish people who make up 15% of Syria and is primarily concentrated in the north east and north west of the country.  The Kurds have largely stayed neutral in the conflict, which is a positive development.  Will the T&aacute;naiste support giving a seat to a Kurdish delegation at the Geneva II talks, rather than having the Kurds lumped in with the wider opposition?  The Kurdish aspect of the Syrian issue has not been adequately discussed.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the positive news on Iran.  Is he concerned by the Israeli Prime Minister's extremely critical reaction to the agreement and his statement that the world is being fooled by Iran?  Could his position have a destabilising effect?</p><p>  On the talks on Israel and Palestine, there is some disagreement among Palestinian representatives.  Just yesterday, a Palestinian parliamentarian visited the House to discuss the ongoing difficulties in the region.  To what extent does the continuation of settlement building during the negotiations undermine the credibility of those taking part in the talks and the entire negotiation process?  We hear stories from the Occupied Territories about refuse trucks in Gaza running out of oil, power shortages in hospitals affecting people on dialysis, etc.  Problems of this nature are bubbling up outside the talks and we have no idea whether the negotiations are essentially for show or will lead anywhere.  The United States Administration has expressed confidence that progress is being made.  I am worried about the impact of the expansion of settlements on the process.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400005#D00300"><p>Deputy Brendan Smith stated that other events will push Syria down the agenda.  The issue that has been pushed furthest down the agenda is the Middle East peace process.  It is very much on my mind because I visited Palestine a couple of weeks ago.  There is no doubt that settlements are oppressive and threatening.  Apart from the moral and ethical aspects of the issue, the settlements also give rise to significant environmental and ecological issues.  Large-scale building in such a small area is placing pressure on water supplies and is not doing the environment any good, not to speak of the other effects of settlement construction.</p><p>  It was interesting to meet Israelis and Palestinians during our visit because I did not get a sense that the two state solution is making as much progress as the T&aacute;naiste suggests.  Ordinary people, including left-wing Israelis and Palestinians who are not involved in politics, do not consider a two state solution to be achievable in their lifetime.  </p><p>  While it is welcome to note the chemical weapons issue is being addressed, it has distracted attention from the serious suffering that is being caused by other types of weapons.  We spoke previously about Ireland supporting proposals for humanitarian corridors, where a ceasefire would be called to allow assistance into Syria.  The recent request by Valerie Amos of the United Nations that access be provided for food and medicine does not appear to have been heeded.  After three years of appalling suffering, there is no end to civilian suffering.  While talks have been arranged to discuss political solutions, no one is pressing for humanitarian issues to be addressed in the same way. </p><p>  For the information of members, the EU special representative for the southern Mediterranean region, Mr. Bernardino Le&oacute;n, will visit Ireland at the beginning of February to attend an AWEPA sponsored event on reconstituting constitutions.  Some members of parliament from Arab spring countries who will also attend have been invited to a meeting of the Constitutional Convention.</p><p>  I tabled questions to the T&aacute;naiste about the Rohingya people, one of the ethnic groups in Burma which has suffered serious human rights abuses.  Has this issue arisen in discussions on Burma?  I will raise some points on Africa when the T&aacute;naiste next speaks. </p></speech>

On the eastern partnership, we had hoped to be able to sign the association agreement with Ukraine at the Vilnius summit and work was progressing to that end.  There have been ongoing discussions about the requirement to meet the conditions necessary for signature.  One of the key issues was the issue of what is known as selective justice, at the centre of which were the circumstances surrounding Ms Yulia Tymoshenko.  A process initiated by the European Parliament was under way in which former Irish MEP, Pat Cox, and former Polish Prime Minister, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, were leading discussions which it was hoped would lead to a resolution of that problem.  In the event, it was taken out of the hands of the European Union states because Ukraine decided it would not, at this stage, proceed with the signature of the association agreement.</p> <p>I hope that position will change.  In terms of Russia's relationship with the European Union, the association agreement with all six Eastern Partnership countries, is not only of mutual benefit to the six countries concerned and the European Union but in Russia's interest.  It would strengthen the relationship between the European Union and Russia at a number of levels.  This is one of the issues we will discuss with Foreign Minister Lavrov at the next Foreign Affairs Council.  It is intended that the EU-Russia summit, scheduled for the end of January, will go ahead.  All the preparatory work is being done.</p><p> I am addressing the issues sequentially.  Deputies Brendan Smith, Se&aacute;n Crowe, Maureen O'Sullivan and the Chairman raised issues pertaining to Syria.  We have put great emphasis in our discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council and elsewhere on the humanitarian side of the Syrian crisis.  The chemical weapons issue is in the process of being resolved.  We need to reflect that the chemical weapons issue had the potential to generate further conflict in Syrian.  There was much talk of military intervention in the middle of August.  A date has been set for the Geneva II talks.  I understand there is a degree of pessimism about the Geneva II talks but it is the only show in town in relation to the participation of Kurdish people.  Both Special Representative Brahimi and UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, have urged the coalition to work together and to form a united delegation at the Geneva II talks.  It is ultimately for each element of the opposition to decide on their approach to Geneva II but a divided opposition is likely to make reaching agreement more difficult.  I think the urgent issue is that of the humanitarian access.  The UN President's statement in October is not being complied with on the ground.  That is why we support and have called for a UN Security Council resolution which would be binding and would allow for humanitarian access.  We got a briefing on the situation from Commissioner Georgieva who has responsibility from an EU point of view for the humanitarian contribution that the European Union is making.  The European Union's contribution and that of the member states is by some distance the largest contribution to the humanitarian effort in Syria but, of course, the big burden is being borne by the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  At the December Council I expect we will be back discussing the humanitarian issue as well.</p><p> As I said in my opening statement, the discussion under way on the Middle East peace process is probably the last opportunity to conclude a settlement based on the two-state solution.  The continuing announcement of settlements is undermining the process.  It is physically undermining it on the ground because the more settlements that are built the harder it will be from a geographic point of view to have two states and, of course, is undermining the talks process.  However, internationally we have to encourage both the Israeli and the Palestinian side to remain committed to the talks and to try to get a resolution.</p><p> I answered a question recently in which I confirmed that we are funders of the UN administered common humanitarian fund for the Central African Republic.  For a number of years Ireland and Sweden are the two member states that have supported this fund.  We contributed more than &euro;2 million since 2009.  </p><p> A number of issues arise in regard to Iran.  It is important to recognise that progress is being made.  The E3+3 talks had been stalled for a long period.  I pay tribute, in particular, to the persistence of Catherine Ashton who has done a fabulous job in taking on the Iran issue when nobody else would touch it and has stayed with it.  I pay tribute to the progress she has made on the issue.  I can understand Israeli concerns in relation to Iran's stated intentions with regard to the nuclear issue but there is no alternative to negotiations.  With respect, I regard Prime Minister Netanyahu's assessment as hard to reconcile with the realities of the deal.  What we have to do now is build on it.</p><p> On the question of the Philippines, we have been contributing to the humanitarian effort.  It was not a major item for discussion at the last Foreign Affairs Council.  Clearly there were references to it because, obviously, it was very much in the news at the time.  Other European Union states are mobilising to support it.</p><p> In regard to Myanmar-Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi attended the October meeting where a good discussion took place with her on the position.  On the occasion of her visit to Dublin to receive the freedom of the city of Dublin I had a very good meeting with her when we discussed the development of bilateral relations.  Following that meeting we reactivated our diplomatic relations with Myanmar-Burma and assigned the ambassador in Vietnam to be ambassador to Myanmar-Burma.  A scoping visit by officials from my Department has taken place and we are building on that.  I think that covers all the points.</p></speech>

As the Chairman will be aware I attended, on the Chairman's behalf, the December meeting in Vilnius of chairmen which was taking place last week.  Considerable concern was expressed at the unsatisfactory conclusion of the Eastern Partnership so far as the Ukraine was concerned.  A long and animated discussion took place on the treatment meted out to Ms Yulia Tymoshenko in particular.  It was also pointed out that those on the east of the Ukraine appear to come under greater influence of Russia while those to the west are more oriented towards the European Union, which I suppose is natural.  To what extent can the European Union continue to engage with the Ukraine and, perhaps, the Russian authorities with a view to ensuring that the obvious will of a majority of the Ukrainian people in terms of orientation towards the European Union is acknowledged, provided and catered for?</p> <p>That would be important, considering Georgia and Moldova have accepted and concluded their association agreements.  Had the Ukraine completed its requirements in regard to the partnership and the <i>acquis </i>and to what extent is it influenced by the Russian authorities in this regard?</p><p> I wish to make two or three other points.  The humanitarian issue has been covered, but there is a danger that areas like the Philippines could be ignored because of a series of competing crises all over the globe at the same time.  In such situations, can we be assured an adequate international focus will continue to apply to countries in positions such as that of the Phillipines?</p><p> I want to congratulate all involved in the progress that has been made in regard to Iran. This is of huge benefit to global peace.  While there is still a long way to go, the discussions were critical and will be reviewed over the trial period.  It is incumbent on all concerned to maintain the focus.  I compliment Catherine Nash on what has been achieved.</p><p> What is taking place in regard to the Middle East peace process may not be all that spectacular, but it is taking place.  I urge that everything possible be done to ensure the focus remains on the process, flimsy as it may be, so that it continues, strengthens and is successful.</p><p> Members have covered the other issues.  I believe the review of the European external action service is useful.  It is critical that process is adequately geared up to quickly address issues as they arise.  There is a grave danger that because of the multiplicity of issues confronting the European Union and the international community at any given time, it could be overwhelmed.  I hope the external action process will be able to make provisions to deal with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400007#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his staff.  I want to speak about the Ukraine because that country is of key importance to the region and to Europe.  Should we be surprised by what has happened?  The western media built up the association agreement as being on the verge of being signed, but we suddenly discovered there are other forces at play which have prevented the Ukraine from signing it at this point.  Was the Minister not aware of the power of Russian diplomacy, in whatever guise it takes, in that region?  For example, did he not consider it after Armenia became the first of the six countries to break with Europe in favour of the customs union?  At the time, Armenia's decision was loudly proclaimed to be because of the diplomacy of Russia, which, to call a spade a spade, is fairly forceful when it is dealing with weaker neighbours, particularly around the issue of energy supply.  Does the Minister accept that when Yanukovych cites national security considerations, he may have real grounds for concern?  For example, he may be concerned the Ukraine's energy supply will be cut, which is the formula I think the Russians use in international diplomacy.  If that happened, Yanukovych would have a serious problem.</p><p>  I would like to convey the lonely position I hold.  My view of the West's dealings with the Ukraine is that the West looks at it as though it is two states rather than one.  We have heard the name Tymoshenko mentioned many times.  She is in jail and we all agree she may be a political prisoner.  This country was bankrupted by politicians.  Tymoshenko did a deal on energy that was unsustainable.  She is an oligarch and was allegedly corrupt and tried and sentenced by the Ukrainian system.  I would like to see some of our former leaders, who bankrupted this country, being tried and, perhaps, interned.</p></speech>

What efforts is the European Union making to convey to the Eastern wing, the Russian speaking half, that we do not seek to dominate it and that we recognise a unitary state and that we will have to work overtime to woo it towards the West?</p><p>  Some Minister, perhaps the T&aacute;naiste himself, will travel to Russia in January.  We got a commitment when we were debating the sensitive issue of the Magnitsky case that this would be raised under the issue of human rights the next time we were dealing with the Russians.  Will the Minister give us a commitment that will be done?  Subsequent to that case, we have concerns regarding the obscene treatment of gay and lesbian people.</p><p>  I agree we should be concerned about what is happening and about the diplomacy of the Russians.  The Minister mentioned Georgia and Moldova.  The Georgians should thank their lucky stars - they should be on their hands and knees thanking the Russians for not going all the way to Tbilisi when it could well have done so on the basis Georgia provoked the Russian bear.  Moldova is an incredibly weak and poor country that is sandwiched between Romania and the Ukraine.  The Ukrainian issue is key, not just in regard to our influence in the region, but to give the stability required to the likes of Moldova.  We have a good relationship with Romania.</p><p>  Is Russian diplomacy winning the day?  It seems to have outskilled the West on a number of issues recently.  Was it in the Iranian talks it did so?  I cannot quite remember whether it was Iran or some other country.  In fact it was Syria.  The Russians were diplomatically astute and took the West by surprise.  We have a lot in common with Russia in the sense that it is strongly anti-terrorist and has worked closely with Europe on a number of issues.  The Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov, could be included in discussions.  The art of negotiation is in arriving at a conclusion to these complex issues.  However, I get the feeling that, in regard to Ukraine in particular, we see it as a West-East issue.  We do not see it as a unitary state, but as a divided state.</p></speech>

No doubt he has been extremely busy in the past six months, just as busy as he was during our Presidency.  There is no sign of a let up in the next six months.</p><p>  Most of the points have been made, but I want to go back to the Palestinian issue.  Others have mentioned it and I am sure the Minister is aware of the tightening of the blockade around Gaza and of the huge human misery this is causing because of the limited access to any form of power.  As described by a UN commissioner, the situation has deteriorated to a state where Gaza is virtually uninhabitable.</p> <p>It is approaching that situation now.  The fact that there are talks going on does not mean the Israelis should be immune from criticism.  There is a major humanitarian crisis emerging there yet again.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, at the least there should be humanitarian access to Gaza.</p><p> Meanwhile, in the West Bank and elsewhere the settlement programme is expanding with greater levels of violence, apparently.  I appreciate what the T&aacute;naiste has said about the talks and that they must go ahead.  However, the Israelis should be left in no doubt that if they think this is upping the ante in their favour or that it will somehow improve their negotiating position, then they should be disabused of that opinion.  Unfortunately, I do not believe they want that or that it is their aim.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, what they are doing is totally undermining the talks.  It is altogether counter-productive for anyone who wants a two-state settlement.  Perhaps that is exactly the outcome they want.  Perhaps they want to undermine the talks.</p><p> The Israelis are given support in the sense that, apparently, they appear to be immune to any criticism or international opprobrium, much less international sanctions.  Inevitably, this gives them the idea that they can continue to do what they like to the Palestinians.  I was reading about the EU research grant.  There was a gesture made that perhaps the Union might not give it to firms in settlement areas.  The outcome was farcical.  It was nothing more than a gesture against the idea of the settlement policy of the Israelis.  The trouble is that we are constantly making gestures with no follow-through, with the result that the settlements continue to expand.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, time is running out for a two-state solution, if it has not already run out.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste should let no opportunity pass to let the Israelis know what we think of their policies, especially the position in Gaza where people have been living in misery for years.  I am unsure what the Israelis hope to achieve by squeezing Gaza almost to death but we cannot stand by and simply watch it happen.</p></speech>

I realise previous speakers have raised the same issue.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the EU response to the bully-boy tactics of Vladimir Putin?  Since he became re-elected as president he has tried to flex his muscle.  I have been watching him in the international field with his interference in Syria or the way he has operated in Syria and in the Ukraine.  We can see plainly that they are trying to set up the Soviet bloc again and to stall any other countries from joining the European Union.  What does the EU propose to do about this, especially given what has happened in the Ukraine?  I realise that other speakers have raised the same issue and therefore I will not dwell on it.  I look forward to the response of the T&aacute;naiste on the EU response on the same issue.</p></speech>

I wish to reciprocate the good wishes of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and his staff.  I have been on this committee since it started and I cannot remember a foreign affairs Minister who came in so frequently and dealt so comprehensively with issues.  We are grateful indeed to the T&aacute;naiste for it.  I have a number of questions but I will be as succinct as I can.</p><p>  One question is about Sri Lanka, a matter, I gather, which did not come in to the review.  There is a situation relating to Mr. Jeyasundaram, who is an Irish citizen married to an Irish woman, Deirdre.  The situation seems to be getting more extreme there with the concentration of greater and greater powers in the hands of the President and his family.  I wonder whether pressure is continuing to be applied.</p><p>  I am pleased that the question of the Middle East, the so-called peace process and the less and less likely two-state solution was brought up.  There is a great deal of smoke and mirrors in this.  The Israelis released 52 political prisoners but at the same time they snatched a further 550, ten times the number they released. I am glad that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan visited Israel.  Two of my colleagues from the other House accompanied her.  They travelled at their own expense and initiative.  They are greatly to be commended on this.  They became aware of a situation in which I am keen for the T&aacute;naiste to take a particular interest, that is, the attempted ethnic cleansing of the indigenous Palestinian people.  These are quite primitive farmers, with no real political axe to grind, around Hebron in villages such as Susya and Twaneh.  I hope that we will take an interest in these because there is a real principle at stake.  This is real ethnic cleansing going on at the instigation of the Israeli Government.  Unless we keep a spotlight on it, that government will be successful and will win that principle.  I believe that would be a disaster.</p><p>  While I am on the matter, I will ask a question which, even with his diplomatic talents, the T&aacute;naiste may find impossible to answer.  However, I believe it is important and I have been keen to ask it for some time.  Does the T&aacute;naiste find the efforts of his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who appears to have taken a position of <i>de facto</i> Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, of assistance in this area?  Are they co-ordinated with his Department?</p><p>  One element that seems to have been left out of the Syria situation and which I am concerned about is the fate of children.  There are at least 250,000 children there.  They are in a desperate situation.  They have been forced to work at a very early age, they have no real proper education and their medical needs are not looked after.  I am keen for some concentration on that question.</p><p>  We all welcome the release of the three women in Egypt.  I imagine the Department played a role in this.  I hope pressure will be kept up because I understand the brother is still in captivity, or at least he was when I last heard about it.  With regard to China, I hope that Tibet will never be allowed to slip off the agenda because there are increasingly worrying signs coming from there.</p><p>  I hope my final point is not outside the realm of the thing because I have a broken-down car that I have to attend to and, therefore, I may be unable to stay for the whole meeting.  I understand that the Department is undergoing a review of embassies and staff.</p></speech>

Many of the issues have been raised already.  There is an issue with the common security and defence policy.  A statement by EU High Representative Ashton referred to a more comprehensive and effective defence and security sector.  My question relates to how Irish neutrality sits in that particular area and I have major concerns.  In a report we received there was a reference in the conclusion to the effectiveness and visibility of common security and defence policy capabilities and the defence industry.  My main concern is the term "defence industry".  Clearly the defence industry has a vested interest in expanding and broadening Europe's role in defence and the security sector because there are billions of dollars to be made by doing so.  What is Ireland's response to that given our traditional stance of neutrality?</p></speech>

My apologies for having to leave because of a vote in the Seanad.  We are all reading on a daily basis about the appalling situation in Syria that the civilian population, children in particular, as Senator Norris said, are going through.  Most concerning is a report published yesterday by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which stated that the Assad regime has authorised war crimes against humanity in Syria.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on that?</p> <p>It is very obvious that the Assad regime is not responding to appeals by Valerie Amos to allow humanitarian access to towns under siege in the countryside around Damascus.  Does the Minister feel that we and the EU are not taking a tough enough line on this?  Does the Minister feel that the Western community is demonstrating too much respect for the Assad regime as a result of which the civilian population feels abandoned by the West?  Is the question on sanctions against Syria likely to be on the agenda of the December Council meeting?  What do our Government and the EU think about sanctions?</p><p> Given the delay in implementing the decision on the Sejdić-Finci case is it time for the EU to review its position on, and approach to, Bosnia?</p></speech>

The signing of the association agreement with Georgia and Moldova was very significant.  It is a pity that it was not possible to sign the association agreement with Ukraine, which is strategically important.  It is very important that the EU-Ukraine relationship develop.  There are conditions for the signing of association agreements.  While the European Union understands the strategic importance of Ukraine, it is important that we do not dilute the standards and conditions which the European Union expects of prospective member states.  The EU is based on certain very fundamental principles of rule of law, democracy and human rights, which must be respected.  I believed that it was possible to reach a conclusion on the outstanding issues with Ukraine in advance of the Vilnius Summit and that we were heading in that direction when I left the last meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  I expected that by the time of the meeting in Vilnius we would be in a position to sign the association agreement.  I believed it was heading in that direction.  They were all taken by surprise at the turn of events when Ukraine decided not to sign.</p><p>  Deputies Byrne, Grealish and others raised the role of Russia in all of this.  Deputy Byrne reminded us of the problem in Armenia, which had occurred sometime prior to that.  We do not consider that the relationship between the European Union and the countries east of it is a zero sum game.  This is not and should not be a question of Russia or the European Union because the countries concerned are important to Russia and the European Union, and the Russia-European Union relationship is important.  Therefore, the meeting that we will have with Foreign Minister Lavrov at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting will be very important because we need to have a frank discussion about where Russia sees this relationship going.</p><p>  It is not a question of a competition between Russia and the European Union for the hearts and minds, love and affection of the Eastern Partnership countries.  There is also a critical issue here about the relationship between the European Union and Russia and how that will be worked through in the long term.  This is an issue of wide public debate in Ukraine.  I hope that what we are seeing in Ukraine can be worked through and that we will get to a point where the association agreement can be signed.</p><p>  In the Middle East the continuing blockade of Gaza and the continuing expansion of settlements, and the problem for the Bedouin communities - I visited some Bedouin communities when I was in the Middle East last year - undermine the peace discussions and threaten the prospects for a two-state solution.  It is in the interest of the Palestinian people, Israel and the wider region to have this issue resolved.  There is an opportunity to do this.  There is engagement.  The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and President Obama have taken a very keen interest in this issue and committed themselves to it.  For some time the European Union has sought a robust Middle East peace process through which peace negotiations would proceed.  The European Union has a particularly strong role to play in the economic relationship that Europe has with Israel and Palestine, and the potential for that economic relationship.  That will be an important dimension.  The fact that discussions are under way does not mean that we do not continue to put pressure on Israel in respect of the blockade on Gaza and the continuing settlements.  We must continue to do that.</p><p>  Mention was made of what were described as competing crises.  I did not have the opportunity to inform the committee about our work in the Philippines.  I am very proud that despite the constraints on the country's budget, Ireland was among the first to respond to the typhoon Hayian disaster.  Our contribution to date stands at over &euro;3.6 million.  This week there was a fourth airlift of vital supplies from Ireland which arrived in the Philippines on Monday morning bringing what we have delivered to a total of 166 tonnes, valued at almost &euro;1 million.  Last week, I authorised the deployment of a technical mission which landed in the Philippines last Thursday and has now reached the worst affected area.</p> <p>We are continuing to work closely with the various UN agencies.</p><p> The humanitarian situation in Syria and the fate of the children in particular is our priority for our engagement on Syria.  I will revert to Senator Norris separately on the Sri Lanka case because I do not have the information with me.</p><p> Senator Daly asked about the EU Common Security and Defence Policy.  The European Union Common Security and Defence Policy set out in the Lisbon treaty is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy.  It provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the EU for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations charter.  Accordingly, the CSDP is entirely consistent with Ireland's values and interests, including the primacy of the United Nations in the maintenance of global peace and security.  While the CSDP is an evolving process directed towards the achievement of ever greater effectiveness, successive treaties since the Maastrict treaty have stipulated that Union policy in this area shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.  Ireland's neutrality is not in any way affected by the discussions taking place on CSDP and in any event, Ireland's participation in European common defence is prohibited by Article 29.4.9o of the Constitution.  Any change in that position may only take place with the approval of the people.  </p><p> The question was raised about a review of the policy on Bosnia.  The policy is being reviewed because of the lack of progress.  I expect it to be the subject of discussion at the next meeting.</p></speech>

Ireland's foreign policy is an essential element of government, being the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad.  Through it, we pursue Ireland's economic prosperity and promote peace and security, both at home and in the wider world.  These are important tasks that require careful reflection and targeted action for a small state such as ours.  Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people.  It projects an image which shapes how others see us and engage with us.  It also affects how we see ourselves and our place in the world - our place among the nations, as Robert Emmet famously declared in his speech from the dock.  How we use that place, how we shape our international engagement, the relationships we seek to build, the goals we set ourselves and the resources we provide to pursue them are at the heart of this review.</p><p>  We have just come through an extremely busy period in Irish diplomacy.  Our successful EU Presidency in the first half of this year, our chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe last year and our election to the UN Human Rights Council enabled us to raise our profile, build our international reputation and demonstrate the positive international contribution we make.  The Government is committed to strengthening relationships with our partners in Europe and around the globe through interaction at political level, developing personal ties with key leaders and renewal of our policy engagement across a broad range of issues.  As political representatives, we all recognise the value of building strong relationships that enable us to influence decisions which affect our interests.  This approach has paid dividends in our policy within the EU, as evidenced during the Presidency, and our work in other areas.</p><p>  The Taoiseach is in Japan today leading a trade mission and meeting with Prime Minister Abe and key business leaders.  To mention just a few of my own recent meetings, I hosted the visiting Chinese Vice Premier, Ma Kai, in October for a series of in-depth discussions on the economy, bilateral trade and international issues, and facilitated meetings with Irish companies.  Last month, I hosted the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdullah, and discussed the international situation, trade and economic relations.  I speak with my European counterparts on a range of issues at our regular meetings in Brussels.  We are relentlessly promoting our trade, tourism and investment, using the embassy network and working with State agencies to support Irish business and contribute to the Government's agenda for jobs and growth.  Our embassy network is engaged on a daily basis providing services, support and assistance to our citizens abroad, sometimes in difficult or tragic circumstances.</p><p>  As we look to the future, and as we exit the EU-IMF programme, it is timely to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy, the values and interests we seek to promote through it, and how it contributes to achieving Government objectives.  We are also all aware that our external environment and the international system in which we operate are experiencing rapid change.  For some time, economic and political power and influence have been shifting from the West to the East and south.  The increasing influence of Asian, Latin American and African countries is reshaping the way the world works, as are groups of countries working together in formats such as the G20 or on an informal and <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The global financial crisis has accelerated these trends.  Many of today's challenges, such as cyber security, climate change, and migration, are not defined by borders and regions, but require global solutions.  These facts are not new, but they are coming into ever sharper focus.  The fast-moving pace of the global economy and the need to keep pace with technological change and innovation are also factors with which we are familiar.</p><p>  Through my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am conscious of what these changes mean for how we pursue our international goals.  This is the context in which the review of our foreign policy is taking place.  The purpose of the review, which I launched on 8 October, is to provide an updated statement of Ireland's foreign policy and external relations and identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.  It will consider a broad range of issues which reflect the breadth of our external engagement, including how we set our external priorities, how we engage as an EU member state, how we contribute to economic recovery and growth through promoting our trade, tourism and investment, the pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, the services we provide to our citizens abroad and our relationship with the Irish diaspora, the contribution of our international development policy, and how we ensure Ireland is a respected international actor.  These are all important issues, as are other aspects of our foreign policy which the review will consider.</p><p>  Membership of the European Union is fundamental to our national interests, both in foreign policy and domestic terms.  Indeed, our EU membership is inseparable from the pursuit of our foreign policy, as it is from so many aspects of domestic policy.  As our engagement with the Union is wider than the foreign policy sphere, being at the core of the day-to-day business of all Departments, the review will not examine our EU policy in detail.  Instead, the focus will be on the contribution of our foreign policy and external relations, as well as the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across Government, to the promotion of Ireland's interests within the EU and to ensuring Europe's voice is stronger at a global level.</p><p>  Diplomacy can, at times, seem remote from our daily lives.  However, as the recent breakthrough in the talks with Iran has shown, quiet and skilled diplomacy can yield results.  We know this from our own experience in negotiating peace in Northern Ireland, during our EU Presidency and in the important negotiations in Europe on banking and fiscal issues.  These are important skills which we must preserve and develop if we are to advance our strategic interests, including in the EU and on issues directly related to the growth and development of our economy.  Our embassy network is making a vital contribution to these efforts, building relations, supporting Irish business and influencing decisions that affect us.  It is an important national resource at the service of Government and the Irish people.</p><p>  We must be both flexible and adaptable if we are to influence the international agenda.</p> <p>While international relations can often favour the large, Ireland's flexibility and adaptability have been two of its traditional strengths.  These are advantages we enjoy as a small state and I am of the view that we have used them well.</p><p> I will now comment on how the review will be taken forward.  Given the wide-ranging nature of our foreign policy and external relations, it is important that we consult extensively.  I have asked my Department to facilitate a broad-based consultation process, involving all Departments, the State agencies, academics and experts, business organisations, interested stakeholders and civil society.  This is being complemented by a detailed process of consultation and analysis within my Department, involving our network of embassies and other offices abroad.  Today I will launch a process of public consultation, inviting written input from members of the public and stakeholders with an interest in Ireland's foreign policy.  Details about the review and how to make submissions are available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As stated at the outset, our foreign policy is a statement of who we are as a people and I encourage members of the public and anyone with an interest in our foreign policy to contribute views and inputs.  The review will also take account of a number of recently concluded or ongoing review processes including the Government's new policy for international development, One World, One Future, adopted in May this year; the Green Paper on Defence currently being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Defence; the review of the Government's trade tourism and investment strategy, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy; and the review of our diaspora policy, which I announced at the Global Irish Economic Forum in October.</p><p> The Oireachtas has traditionally played an important role in shaping our foreign policy and holding the Government to account for its conduct and implementation, through debates in both Houses and the work of this committee and those of its counterparts which deal with different aspects of our external relations.  I am of the opinion that our foreign policy is the stronger for this oversight and engagement.  Today's meeting is a valuable opportunity to engage in a first exchange of views and to hear inputs on the issues covered by this review.  I also welcome written inputs from this committee and from individual members of the Oireachtas.  Meetings will also take place with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and the Joint Committee on Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to discuss the Review.  Issues raised at these meetings will also constitute an important input to the review process.</p><p> Our foreign policy is important.  Much depends on our getting it right, namely, our peace and prosperity, growth in our economy, our place in Europe and the world and our well being as a people.  This is a timely and important review.  Its outcome will guide our external engagement in the years ahead.  I look forward to working with the Chairman, members and the Oireachtas in to ensure that we craft the right polices to promote our values and our interests.  I look forward to the discussion we are about to have, to hearing the views of members and to receiving further input in due course.  With the agreement of the committee, I do not propose to respond in detail to policy suggestions at this time.  I assure members, however, that I and my officials will take careful note of all proposals and that these will be fully taken into account when preparing the outcome of the review.</p></speech>

The committee is anxious to have an input, to make a presentation and, probably, to hold hearings.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste's officials will liaise with the clerk to the committee in respect of this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware - from what transpired during the earlier part of the meeting - that we have a deep interest in this issue.  I welcome the review, which is a very good idea.  I hope the committee will be able to have an input and that its views will be taken on board.</p><p>  I wish to ask a couple of questions before opening the floor to members.  Our network of embassies are very important in the context of trade and our affairs abroad.  Following our Presidency of the EU, the T&aacute;naiste announced a review of our embassy network.  Croatia is one of the newer member states of the EU and Ireland does not have an embassy there yet.  I presume the need to open new embassies will be considered during the review.  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated, a new deal has just been completed in respect of Iran's nuclear capability.  Ireland closed its embassy in Tehran some time ago and I presume it could potentially be reopened in the wake of the deal to which I refer.  An issue which is, I suppose, to the forefront of many people's minds is that which relates to our Vatican Embassy.  The latter was closed some time ago but, obviously, this matter could be revisited in the future.  We would welcome positive developments in these areas because, as committee members, we are aware of the very important role our embassies abroad play in the context of trade, bilateral relations and working in conjunction with the development agencies.  We know that our network is small and that only a few officials serve in each embassy.  However, they have an important role to play.  I accept that the officials in question are competing against their counterparts from the larger countries but it must be stated that they work really hard.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on these matters before I open the floor to members?</p></speech>

I invite the committee and individual members to make their views known on the matter.  A number of reviews are taking place and the one to which my presentation relates is an overall review of our foreign policy and external relations.  It is part of a wider review that is taking place.  As already stated, we are also reviewing our trade strategy and, as announced in October, our engagement with the diaspora.  The review is also taking place in the context of the European External Action Service and a number of other developments.  As I have informed the committee on previous occasions, we have a very small diplomatic footprint throughout the world encompassing 58 bilateral missions.  When our EU Presidency concluded, I indicated that we would examine the position with regard to our mission network.  Issues in respect of existing missions and the possibility of opening or reopening other missions will be addressed in that context.  The reconsideration of our mission network and the review of our foreign policy, our trade strategy and our engagement with the diaspora are interlinked.</p></speech>

When we closed three missions in 2011, I stated that the review of the mission network would be an ongoing process.  Work in respect of this matter is ongoing and this is not unconnected to the wider review of foreign policy, trade strategy and engagement with the diaspora.</p></speech>

Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate the timescale relating to it?  I agree with what he said in respect of increased globalisation, interdependency, etc.  However, I do not know if he is over-egging the pudding in the context of his statement to the effect that "The Oireachtas has traditionally played an important role in shaping our foreign policy and holding the Government to account".  If we do have an influence, that is nice but there is a view among Members of the Oireachtas that the Houses and many of their committees do not have much of a say in respect of this matter.  This committee is probably somewhat different in that it operates more on the basis of consensus and that it tends not to have to resort to votes.</p> <p>There must be change in terms of what is happening in regard to the House itself.  One concern that has come up many times is EU scrutiny and we have still not got it right.  I accept there have been recent changes but there is so much information coming across our desks that we must focus on the issue.  It is extremely worrying for anyone who is interested in the European Parliament that a recent survey on the recognition of EU Members of Parliament in Dublin revealed that less than 20% of those surveyed recognised their MEPs.  That is a weakness and the matter must be addressed in the overall context of foreign affairs and the importance of such institutions.</p><p> The increased militarisation of the EU and Ireland&rsquo;s perceived decreased neutrality are of concern, in particular the continued use of Shannon Airport, for example, by the Canadian military, and countries using it while in transit to areas of conflict around the world.  Northern Ireland comes under the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s foreign affairs remit but I am not comfortable discussing the matter in such a context.  Outstanding issues arise in terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace dividend.  Many people feel they have not seen the peace dividend.  Difficulties still remain in terms of dealing with the past.  Other outstanding issues that remain to be addressed include human rights and trying to build an inclusive society.</p><p> In terms of Irish influence, the Chairman referred to the expansion of the influence of embassy personnel.  It would be helpful to the discussion if we had a map showing the location of embassies and the personnel located in them.  Usually, one only gets a sense of an area if one visits it.  In some cases one individual can cover an area involving millions of people.</p><p> We have seen the positive influence of the Friends of Ireland in terms of The Gathering.  Goodwill is evident from the Irish diaspora and others who have links with this country and want it to develop.  Such an approach could be developed by the Department and the Government as a whole.  They are some of the areas we must examine.  We must be flexible and adapt on certain issues but we must take a strong stance on other issues.  People seek leadership that does not come from the United States.  They want small, independent countries and the EU to take a stance in conflicts around the world, including the Middle East.  I welcome the discussion, which has been a long time coming.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will take on board the views of all parties on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400013#N00200"><p>The review that is taking place is both important and timely.  The T&aacute;naiste put his finger on the issues.  The best way to review foreign policy is to review its success in recent years.  If we consider the position we were in such a short time ago, economically, and in the radar of our European colleagues, it has been tremendously successful.  In my time in this House I have never seen the degree of activity by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and individual Ministers in pursuing Ireland&rsquo;s cause internationally at every level.  Every single Minister and their civil servants have all been doing the same thing at the same time for the one cause.  That is hugely important.  I have never seen it before.  I reject criticism from any quarter as to whether we were going in the right direction.  First, we were held up as an example two and a half to three years ago as to what might happen in Europe and in this country.  Not only did the T&aacute;naiste excel nationally but also internationally in establishing an accord and a rapport with the diaspora in a way that has not happened previously.</p><p>  Arising from Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s point on the degree of influence of Parliament, it is not so many years ago when I as a Member of this House was made to feel that Parliament had no function at all and that on a regular basis we were something that should be suffered in silence.  On numerous occasions I was rebuffed by individual Departments to the effect that the Minister had no responsibility to the House.  What a famous phrase.  The T&aacute;naiste would have experienced that as well.  There has been a tremendous improvement.  John Donne said that no man is an island.  I presume he applied that to women as well in modern parlance.  It is true, and now is a timely period for the review both to continue our efforts in that regard nationally and internationally as a small country and as a member state of the European Union carrying with us the importance of such membership.  We should not apologise and pretend we are a substandard, lower class nation.  We are still one of the leading contenders in the globe.  We are one of the seven most sought after places to live in the world at present.  Our GDP <i>per capita</i> is higher than most of our European colleagues with one or two exceptions, for instance Luxembourg and the Scandinavian countries.  That has always been the case.  We also have a higher <i>per capita</i> GDP than France, Germany, the United Kingdom and most other countries.  One of the things that we need to stop doing-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has succeeded and he must take the credit for it.  He also has a serious role to pursue in Europe because there are other countries in the European Union and on the periphery that require the same kind of leadership this country has got in the past two and a half years.</p></speech>

To the best of my recollection the previous review took place some time ago during the 1990s.  Much has changed since then, in particular our circumstances.  It is important to reflect on the fact that this review takes place against a backdrop of this country regaining its economic sovereignty.  It is a timely opportunity to restate, renew and review our values on how we relate to the outside world and our global partners.</p><p>  As Deputy Durkan said, the impact of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been extremely significant in terms of restoring this country&rsquo;s reputation.  The T&aacute;naiste and staff with whom we have developed relationships right across the globe must take significant credit for that.  One could not but be impressed by the dedication and commitment of those who represent us abroad at all levels.  It is extremely impressive.  Such work, by its nature is slow.  It is not immediately evident but it is extremely significant and has a cumulative impact over a period.  We have all witnessed that when we have gone abroad to represent the committee.</p><p>  The inclusion of trade has been a significant development in terms of the operational organisation of the Department.  I have taken the view in the past two and a half years that the inclusion of trade in the remit has not just complemented the work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland but has allowed the Department to do different things and has allowed the State to expand on its trade policy in a different way, in ways that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland cannot do.  The Department engages in longer term diplomatic work which is most effective.  I accept that the T&aacute;naiste will not go into policy detail at the meeting as it would not be appropriate.</p> <p>However, there is huge potential for the Department to extend its remit in terms of promoting and advancing Irish cultural interests abroad.  The Department does that quite effectively, as does Culture Ireland, but there is a range of opportunities in that  area we can exploit.  Personally and as a member of this committee I look forward to being involved in a review to which I will contribute.</p></speech>

However, to my enormous surprise the Holy Spirit managed the impossible and found among the cardinals appointed by the two previous Popes a man of extraordinary prophetic vision and stature.  It would be an appropriate moment to examine the question of the Vatican Embassy, first, because of the man but, second, because of a network of valuable diplomatic contacts there.  </p><p>  When I refer to the Pope himself it is not just a question of the public relations shots, such as seeing him get into a Fiat car.  I could not care less about that but I am interested in his thought and in what he says.  The Minister would certainly agree with him about the current economic system being unjust at its root and uncaring.  He is rather to the left in these areas in terms of the business of financial speculation, the throwaway culture where individual workers are not valued and the talk about excessive clericalism.  While urging Christians to avoid hateful generalisations about Islam, the Pope called humbly on Islamic countries to guarantee full religious freedom to Christians.  That is a very important development.  His approach and the <i>timbre</i> of his words is very interesting and very different from that of his predecessors.</p></speech>

I am just giving a few reasons.  It is important that somebody says that humbly and objects to the vulgar abuse of Muslim people, and I put that in the context of a woman whose name I regret I cannot remember but she is a junior minster in the British Administration.  She is a Muslim Member of Parliament and she has spoken out against the discrimination against the Christian peoples of the Middle East and their practical extinction in certain countries.  This Pope is on the same wavelength.</p><p>  I am not a Roman Catholic.  I am an Anglican because I always believed in being on the right team but when the Pope talks about a church which  is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets rather than a church concerned with being at the centre, and about dispersing power from the Vatican, I believe he is one of the most remarkable people of our generation.  He deserves support because his ideas are humane and politically in the right direction.  They are against power and in favour of humility.  It was the arrogance of the church and its representative here that, if we are honest, helped lead to the closure of the Vatican Embassy.  I find myself in the surprising position of saying that I would welcome a review that took into account the reopening of the embassy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400014#O00500"><p>The review process is welcome and positive.  We saw what happened when we had the review of Irish Aid in terms of the engagement by people and the fruitful discussions that took place.</p><p>  My first question is on the lack of policy coherence between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the matter of biofuels.  We know that biofuels are undermining food security and that they are having major negative effects on food production.  That is at a time when Ireland is extremely supportive of aid to reduce poverty and hunger.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, told me some months ago that Ireland was supporting the 5% figure in that regard.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, appears to have moved to the 7% figure.  The European Commission is supporting the 5% figure, with the European Union Parliaments supporting the 6% figure.  It appears that Ireland will take the 7% figure because the view is that this is the lowest that can be achieved.  That is not good enough.  I ask the Minister to discuss that with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the effect that Ireland will support the 5% figure at the meeting on 12 December.</p><p>  Second, as a member of this committee and as chair of the Irish section of UEPA I made two visits abroad recently.  One was to Ghana, with the Chairman, and the other was to Mozambique from where I returned this morning.  I compliment and acknowledge the work of the two ambassadors, Paddy Fay and Ruairi de Burca, and their staffs for the way in which they are presenting Ireland and enhancing our reputation not just on a diplomatic level but also with civil society and with groups in the two respective countries.  What comes across is that Ireland's reputation is second to none, certainly in Ghana where we saw major interest in pursuing business interests with Ireland.</p><p>  The Mozambique visit was in regard to aid effectiveness and parliamentary oversight about which we could be much more positive.  There is a definite lack of knowledge in African countries on aid in general in terms of where it is coming from, where it is going and the amounts.  We know what we are giving here because we have transparency and accountability but the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Irish Aid, could be more progressive on that by meeting members of the budget committees where they exist because some Parliaments do not have budget committees or finance committees.  Opposition parties certainly do not know the amount of aid going in.  There was a general meeting in Johannesburg of quite a number of the African parliamentarians at which we pushed the idea that there would be a debate in African Parliaments on aid because there is not doubt that there is a change in the aid relationship.  It is no longer the case that we are just the giver and they are the receivers.  There is much more of a partnership in that regard and because of Ireland's reputation, I believe we can do very well with African countries.  We know the resources they have compared to us.</p><p>  It was interesting that because there are tensions in Mozambique we had requests from opposition parliamentarians that Ireland would engage in facilitating discussion between the two parties, such was Ireland's reputation, and that Irish Aid would meet the members of the committees and opposition leaders to ensure they would know exactly what is going on.</p><p>  My third point, and Latin America was mentioned, is on Colombia.  There are major human rights issues in Colombia, particularly regarding trade unionists and community activists.  Trade agreement talks are taking place.  Ireland must commit to human rights being very much part of any trade agreement.</p></speech>

I note the external arrangements and engagements we have in terms of EU member states, and I thank the Minister for coming into the Seanad to take the EU Scrutiny and Transparency in Government Bill.  I note he made some comments on the legislation, one of which was on our EU scrutiny.  Our scrutiny of EU legislation has been appalling, although it was generally a failing of previous Governments also.  In his response the Minister referred to the innovation of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in giving the members of the transport committee draft statutory instruments prior to that Minister signing them.  That should be an automatic process.  It is a fact that 596 statutory instruments were signed by Ministers without anybody ever seeing them, including the Minister for Health.  Not one Member of the Oireachtas saw our first law on organ donation in the history of the State prior to it being signed into law.  The EU scrutiny committee admitted that in the first six months of this Government's term there was no scrutiny of any EU legislation because the committees were not established.  Our structures in terms of EU scrutiny are sadly lacking.</p><p>  The Minister also raised the issue of the yellow card system where EU member states can comment on EU legislation proposed by the Parliament and stated that of the 428 submissions made by EU member states on 139 legislative measures from the EU Parliament, Ireland managed to make one submission in the first two years.</p> <p>This is how poor is Ireland's scrutiny in this area.  The T&aacute;naiste might comment on that because it is necessary for all committees and Ministers to do what the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, are doing.  Statutory instruments must be seen by the Parliament before they are signed with the most extreme example being the first law on organ donation in the history of the State.  No Member of the Oireachtas had sight of it before the relevant European Union directive was signed into Irish law.  The Minister made all the changes he desired, put in place all the infrastructure and no one saw it in advance.  My concern pertains to the process.</p><p> Second, I agree with the T&aacute;naiste's statement that consideration should be given to having a Minister responsible for the Irish overseas and the diaspora.  On foot of his meeting with the French equivalent, who is Irish born and who encouraged Ireland to follow suit, perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will comment on how he would envisage this in the next Government?  He might be in the next Government himself, perhaps with Fianna F&aacute;il and our new-found member from the Labour Party.</p></speech>

How does the T&aacute;naiste envisage such a Minister working?  Is this Labour Party policy?  In this regard, does the T&aacute;naiste envisage votes for the Irish overseas and those in the North in a reformed Seanad?</p><p>  On the North, I note the appointment of Richard Haass but is progress being made with the White House and the State Department on the appointment of an ambassador from the United States to assist him on this side of the Border?  Finally, in respect of the Weston Park Agreement, members noted the report that was published today.  The aforementioned agreement is an international agreement, signed by both governments, which made specific reference to the Pat Finucane case and stated there would be an investigation into that.  Although it is an international agreement, however, that never happened.</p><p>  Finally, I refer to a documentary, which I am sure the T&aacute;naiste saw-----</p></speech>

I believe it is on the agenda because I read a press statement in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which I brought to the attention of the joint committee asking what it was all about.  Consequently, the debate has now started and it is very important.  I can apologise for being a relatively new Member of the D&aacute;il but to this day, I still do not fully understand the structures <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> trade.  For example, the Taoiseach is currently engaged in wonderful work in Japan, creating trade links and so on.  I am unsure how this task in respect of the T&aacute;naiste's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is broken up between the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.  In addition, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, keeps leading trade delegations, while the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, has led trade delegations to Ghana or Nigeria.  As for this committee, which carries the title &quot;Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade&quot; do its members lead trade delegations?  I ask this question because the issue of trade and how it is handled should be considered centrally.</p><p>  On foreign policy, I concur with many of the sentiments expressed.

The quality of Ireland's embassy staff is second to none.  They are liked, they interact wonderfully and do a great job for Ireland.  The problem is that there are too few of them.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the joint committee regularly meets visiting delegations and the ambassadors.  There have been pleas for embassy representation and one country has been mentioned here in this regard, namely, Croatia.  However, the good news is the joint committee is planning to visit Iran and India in the near future.  Whatever about the Vatican, Iran is in the centre of a region that has 800 million people.  Markets can be developed, as can international foreign policy and we can influence the region if we open an embassy there.  I note it already has been closed but given the way Iran is opening up, this is coming down the line.  The question then focuses on trade.  I believe Ireland has missed out by being very traditional in where its embassies have been located, that is, in traditional African countries, some French-speaking, some English-speaking.  Members are almost embarrassed when dealing with embassy officials who tell them of huge potential markets of 126 million people or 80 million people and I do not believe we have really tapped into them as yet.</p><p>  As for the diaspora, I have a suggestion.  As a politician, it is an embarrassment for me to know the embassies of some countries, about which we always are talking in a negative way, perhaps Ukraine, Romania or Bulgaria, open their door for their expatriates to vote.  As a sophisticated First World country, Ireland has not got that far yet.  The Seanad is sitting in a state of semi-suspension upstairs and perhaps consideration -----</p></speech>

It is also timely, in that the T&aacute;naiste is undertaking it from a position of strength having had a successful Presidency of the European Council, the chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, as well as Ireland's membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p><p>  I presume that what is sought from the review is a policy that will ensure Ireland inserts even greater influence on the world stage, particularly where it can make a contribution to peace, that is, in the troubled parts of the world.  I remind Deputy Eric Byrne the reason so many Ministers are involved in trade is that the Action Plan for Jobs specifically places an onus on all Departments to make a contribution towards economic recovery and towards the efforts at job creation.</p> <p>I am certainly pleased to see so many of the Ministers are involved in promoting the country and our companies throughout the world.</p><p> I very much share the T&aacute;naiste's positive view of the contribution the embassies make to trade throughout the world.  I welcome his intention to look at the missions to see where he can possible improve, and maybe open some new missions.</p><p> Senator Norris made a strong case for reopening the embassy to the Holy See.  Generally, the people would like to see us seriously consider that.  Traditionally, there have been strong links and the performance of the new pontiff, to which Senator Norris referred, should put pressure on us to look at that again.</p><p> There are several successful embassies and missions throughout the world, but I have one question for the T&aacute;naiste.  Is he satisfied that there are sufficient resources in all of them to promote the level of trade that we would like to see?  I got an indication recently that the staff are stretched in many of the embassies throughout the world.  I am aware the Government wants to increase the number of missions, but are the ones in place adequately resourced?  We are heading in the right direction.  I assume that the committee and Members of the Oireachtas will have sufficient opportunities to contribute to this review process in the coming months.</p></speech>

Some of the suggestions had nothing to do with the foreign policy area and I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to answer any of those questions.  The T&aacute;naiste stated at the beginning of his remarks that he did not want to go into these in detail but if he wants to make a few closing remarks on some of the issues, he can do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013120400016#Q00300"><p>First, the purpose of today's exercise is to set out for the committee the nature of the review of foreign policy and our external engagement that we are conducting and to locate it also in the context of the review of trade, the White Paper on development, the review of the EAS and a number of other developments that are taking place.</p><p>  I join members of the committee in paying tribute to the staff of the Department and the staff of the embassies.  It is encouraging to hear the complimentary remarks that have been made here by several members of the committee.</p><p>  We are stretched.  We have 58 bilateral missions and a total of 73 missions altogether when one takes into account the multilateral organisations.  Compared to countries of similar size, it is small.  They do a great job.  They have had a particularly difficult job to do - Deputy Durkan made reference to this - over the course of the past couple of years where we had this moment of crisis and we had to try and restore the country's reputation.  They have very successfully done that.  We have talked a great deal about exit from the bailout, the renegotiation of it, the terms of it, etc., and one cannot do that successfully unless one has had strong diplomatic engagement, both with other countries and with international organisations.  That has been successfully done.  The success of the European Union Presidency, the OSCE chairmanship and Ireland's election to the Human Rights Council all have added to our reputation as a country and we can build on that.</p><p>  We now must look forward to where we are going.  As I stated earlier, our engagement with Europe is hugely important.  That is one part of our external engagement.  If one looks at where trade is developing, and one looks at Asia and Africa, for example, we have an Africa strategy.  One may look at Latin America.  These are all parts of the world where the potential for expanded trade is quite significant.</p><p>  In response to the point that Deputy Eric Byrne made, there are a range of Departments that have a trade dimension to them.  There are obvious ones such as Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department, but, for example, in the Department of Education and Skills, which would not have been traditionally been regarded as a trade Department, there is now a significant level of trade in education.  My Department brings together all of the Departments and State agencies and representatives of the private sector, including the Irish Exporters' Association, into a single Export Trade Council, which I chair, where we consider trade strategy, etc.  For example, trade missions are co-ordinated by us.  Those are agreed between myself and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Proposals are made, mainly from Enterprise Ireland, but from some of the other agencies as well, and we look at them.  We have a co-ordinated strategy across government in terms of how we do our trade.  We have a joined-up approach to it.</p><p>  For the first time in six years, there is a recruitment process underway for third secretaries in the Department.  The intention is to recruit 40 third secretaries.  That will assist in the exercise.</p><p>  I will not get into individual embassies or missions, other than to say that the decision on location of embassies is not based on whether we agree with the Government or leadership of the country concerned from time to time because these aspects will change.  Some of the decisions that we have had to make in recent years have had to be made for financial reasons.  Given that we have a small team, we must be focused and adaptable and we have to be willing to change.  We will continue to make those changes and to ensure that we have a presence where it matters and that is appropriate to the size of our overall diplomatic effort.</p><p>  On a practical question, the closing date for public submissions is 4 February.  My intention would be to have the review of foreign policy completed in the early part of next year and I hope to be in a position by the middle of next year to set out an updated statement of Irish foreign policy and our external relations.  The last review of this kind was done as part of the White Paper exercise in 1996.  The country has changed, the world has changed and Europe has changed since 1996 and we need to update it.</p></speech>

As we are in public session, all mobile telephones should be switched off as they cause interference with the recording equipment even if in silent mode.  Before beginning I congratulate the Minister on the inaugural national missing persons day today.  I attended the ceremony, which was terrific.  On behalf of Deputies I pass on our congratulations to the officials who worked so hard on this and did a great job.  It was a really moving and important inaugural event, and I hope it is the first of many events relating to that most important issue.  I pass those words to the Minister on behalf of colleagues, and I know Senators would also like to be associated with those remarks.  It was amazing.</p><p>  The meeting has been convened to consider a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  A Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il by 12 December.  The role of the committee under Standing Orders is to consider the Supplementary Estimate and then report that we have done so by way of a message to the D&aacute;il.  I thank the Minister for attending and assisting our consideration of this Supplementary Estimate and the briefing material which has been circulated to members.  I propose that the following arrangements apply to the debate.  The Minister will address the committee, after which each of the Opposition spokespersons will have the opportunity to respond and we can then have an open discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Order 161, discussion should be confined to the items in the Supplementary Estimate, so they should try not to wander into other areas.  I will be quite strict about that, as the last time we had a meeting people wandered far and wide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013120400003#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks about the inaugural national missing persons day, and I will pass on his comments to officials in my Department.  They did an extraordinary amount of work in bringing together what I think was a very important event and which will become a regular occurrence.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their support and engagement in the context of the pupils from Davis College in Cork, who took a very important initiative which very substantially contributed to the decision made to hold the event.</p><p>  Turning to the matters on the agenda before the committee, I thank members for the opportunity to present for its consideration the 2013 Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, which is for a net sum of &euro;9.4 million.  The 2013 Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;208.8 million; however, net out-turn this year is expected to be &euro;218.2 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;9.4 million.  At the outset, I should say that this Supplementary Estimate for the army pensions Vote will be met by an appropriate saving on the Defence Vote.  There will be no extra demand on the Exchequer over what was initially voted for the Defence Vote group for 2013.  This Supplementary Estimate is therefore Exchequer neutral.</p><p>  Expenditure under the army pensions Vote is provided under a single programme entitled Provision for Defence Forces Pensions Benefits.  The army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The numbers of Defence Forces pensioners have continued to increase during the past year and currently there are almost 12,000 pensioners of all categories paid by the Department of Defence.</p><p>  Subhead A2 is the main subhead of the army pensions Vote and covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions expenditure, including gratuities, and it is primarily demand-led and non-discretionary.</p> <p>The original provision of some &euro;204.4 million for this subhead will be inadequate to meet all requirements for the year and a gross shortfall is estimated at &euro;9 million.  The principal reasons for the shortfall in this subhead are the continued increase in the number of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote; and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the exceptionally high number of retirements on pension in recent years.  In addition, many retirees are in the &quot;long service&quot; category and therefore entitled to maximum retirement benefits, which contribute to the increased costs.</p><p> Permanent Defence Force retirements on pension more than doubled annually in the five years up to 2012, and that is reflective of public service trends.  Some 1,520 military personnel have retired on pension between January 2010 and the end of 2012, approximately two thirds of them during the 12 months or so prior to expiry of the &quot;grace period&quot; on 29 February 2012.  At the end of 2012, there were 11,329 retirement pensioners - that is, retired members and dependants - and the current corresponding number is some 11,400.  It is expected that by the end of December 2013, some 260 military personnel will have retired on pension over the course of the year.  Overall, the provision in subhead A2 will not be sufficient to meet projected costs.</p><p> The number of surviving War of Independence spouses on pension is currently 157.  The last Old IRA veteran in receipt of a pension died in 2006.  A shortfall of &euro;400,000 is also expected in appropriations-in-aid.  This is also related to the much higher numbers leaving the Permanent Defence Force in recent years, and who are no longer paying employee contributions to the pension schemes.</p><p> Under the rules of the new public service single pension scheme introduced on 1 January 2013, contributions of single scheme members, including military personnel recruited to the Permanent Defence Force from that date onwards, will not be paid into appropriations-in-aid in the Army pensions Vote but are instead to be paid directly into central funds.</p><p> The overall supplementary requirement on subhead A2 will be offset by expected savings of &euro;880,000 in subheads A1, A3, A4, A5 and A6 and when these are taken into account, the net shortfall on the Vote is &euro;9.4 million.</p><p> On the subject of recruitment, the personnel turnover rate in the Defence Forces is among the highest in the public service.  During 2013, some 355 personnel had left the Permanent Defence Force by the end of October for various reasons, including retirement on pension.  The regular recruitment of young soldiers is an absolute necessity to ensure a pool of fit personnel to fulfil all the operational tasks assigned to the Defence Forces at home and abroad.</p><p> At the end of October 2013, the active strength level of the Permanent Defence Force was 9,222.  On a positive note, general service recruitment to the Defence Forces is ongoing from the existing competition panels.  To date, a total of 339 recruits have been enlisted for general service.  Recruitment this year has included a medical officer appointed in September and an intake of 34 cadets, who commenced training in October.  Competitions to recruit Air Corps apprentices and Naval Service engine room artificers are currently under way, from which it is proposed to enlist 20 and 15 personnel respectively.</p><p> Targeted recruitment will continue within the resource envelope allocated to defence to maintain numbers and it is expected that by the end of the year the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be in the region of 9,400 personnel.  It is planned to run a new general service recruitment competition in the first half of 2014.</p><p> Finally, I wish to acknowledge and thank individual members of the Defence Forces for their continued efforts during the year.  I am conscious that we have members of the Defence Forces located in 14 different UN missions globally.  All of those currently <i>in situ</i>are likely to be abroad over the Christmas period.  I wish them a peaceful Christmas and a happy new year.  I wish that to their families who will not have loved ones at home with them over the Christmas period.  I wish to extend my good wishes to all members of the Permanent Defence Force at home.  I thank members of the committee for their attention.  I am happy to deal with any issue that might arise.</p></speech>

I also commend the Cork students who were responsible for the inaugural missing persons day.  That is a worthwhile development.  I know two of the families that have been devastated by virtue of losing a loved member and I know how difficult the situation is for them.</p><p>  The Supplementary Estimate serves to highlight for us the fact that the shortfall of &euro;9.4 million can be found from within the overall Vote of the Defence Forces.  It shows how effective the Defence Forces have been over the years in adapting to the changing climate that has prevailed.  I frequently said to the Minister that the Defence Forces have learned how to be slim &ndash; lean, mean and effective &ndash; in how they did their business long before other elements of the public service ever began to think about the need to do it.  We support the Supplementary Estimate as we want pensioners to be paid their due allowance.</p><p>  We were told by the Minister that &euro;880,000 in savings have been achieved in subheads A1, A3, A4, A5 and A6.  The Minister said he intends to save approximately &euro;9 million overall.  Will he give a sense of where the savings will be achieved?  If he could do that to our satisfaction I would have no difficulty with the proposal before us.</p><p>  I further commend the Minister on his recruitment campaign.  It is encouraging to see in excess of 300 young people joining the force.  That is a good thing.  We need to have ongoing recruitment.  At the same time, PDFORRA has raised some concerns about people on the 21-year contracts who remain fit and able, who are in good health and who are well capable of continuing to give service.  The Minister should think long and hard before forcing people out of the Defence Forces into an environment where their chance of future employment is slim.</p></speech>

In the context of recruitment, I gave the exact number of recruits this year up to October.  By the time we reach 31 December we will have recruited an estimated 430 new members of the Defence Forces during the course of 2013.  That is very important as well in terms of maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces, which moves up and down a little with retirements and competitions.  It is also important that there is a constant sense of renewal within the Defence Forces in regard to the age profiles of individuals.  I note what the Deputy said about the arrangements concerning compulsory retirements after 21 years&rsquo; service.  They were put in place some years ago.

That was an issue that was very carefully addressed.  It arose at one of the meetings of this committee, perhaps when considering last year's Estimates.  I do not envisage that position changing.  If it were to change, we would have an ageing defence force.  It would not create the openings for recruitment and would not allow vigorous young people to enter the Defence Forces.  We must maintain some age-appropriate balance within the Defence Forces.  I am sure we could all have an interesting conversation on whether 19, 20, 21 or 23 years would be most appropriate but the age was fixed some years ago and I do not envisage a change in the shorter term.  The current arrangement affords young people an opportunity to join the Defence Forces and bring value to the organisation.  I am conscious that all those retiring have given great service to the State.  Some have specialist expertise in specific areas.  That is important to acknowledge but, as I said to the Deputy, I do not foresee a change.</p><p> The Deputy was right about how we are in a position to fund pensions from within our resources, as opposed to drawing on some major additional allocation.  In recent years, it has been usual on the defence side to have a recalibration of the type described at the end of the year, for a number of reasons.  First, one does not know for certain in any one year how many members will retire.  Second, as vacancies arise and people are recruited, numbers move up and down a little.  The number has dipped a little but, by the end of the year, it will be back up to 9,400.  We will progress that into the new year.</p><p> Effectively, the savings have been effected by very careful marshalling of resources.  I agree with what the Deputy said in that regard.  I am not patting myself on the back in that what I say applies equally to my predecessor and to the manner in which the Defence Forces themselves and the civil side within the Department have managed resources.  It is done with great efficiency.  Over time, the careful stewardship of defence spending has meant there is no substantial over-expenditure that can be identified in any area.  On occasion, we have succeeded in operating at a lesser cost than might have been anticipated when the original Estimates were agreed.  It is basically good management.  It is a tribute to the work of the officials in my Department and to management within the Defence Forces.  These matters are dealt with very carefully.  That is why we are in a position to deal with matters in this appropriate way.</p><p> I hope I have answered most of the questions raised by the Deputy.  Since what I have outlined is the case, there are no operational issues concerning the cross-transfer of funding between the two different Votes.</p></speech>

My second question is on the Minister's report on the 339 recruits.  Are many applying to join the Defence Forces?  From my constituency, I understand many young people are interested in joining but feel they have not got a chance.  While the number of recruits is listed in the report as 339, is a figure available for the number of people applying to join the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

There is enormous international respect for our Defence Forces.  They do a really good job and the training is excellent.  A member of the Defence Forces can acquire expertise in a variety of areas such that job opportunities become available on returning to civilian life.  Even in the current climate, there will be job opportunities for some of those retiring after 21 years.  A number of very skilled individuals will be available for employment.</p><p>  We are working from an existing panel at present but we will be advertising again in 2014.  I encourage people to apply.  There is a very fair system with regard to recruitment.  Inevitably, the number of applicants will be large.  I will get shot by the Chairman for saying this but I believe I should share with the Deputies the fact that the formal advertisements on Garda recruitment will be in the newspapers on 12 December.  This is proceeding as planned.  While there were 10,000 applicants on the last occasion for the Defence Forces generally, there are over 30,000 expressions of interest from individuals to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before formal advertising.  I expect that the number of applicants will exceed that.  The application forms will be available to individuals online.  There will certainly be no shortage of applicants.  I encourage those who are interested to duly apply.</p></speech>

There are regulations in place with regard to this.  As I explained, it concerns ensuring that the Defence Forces are truly fit for purpose.  There are very good people who will have served their time in the Defence Forces and who will have made contributions that will be greatly appreciated, but it is important that there be a turnover and that a certain age profile be maintained in the force.  A very considered decision was made some years ago in this regard.  I believe it was right and I support it.  I do not envisage that arrangement changing in the short to medium term.</p></speech>

I will start where the Minister ended and acknowledge the very fine work our Defence Forces carry out, in particular those who serve abroad on various UN missions.  Given it is December I will take the opportunity to wish them all a very happy Christmas.</p><p>  With regard to the funding of the 9,500 members, I wish to mention a group of 800 in the Air Corps, some of whom I met last week with the Chairman and Deputy Mac Lochlainn at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  It was a very interesting visit with the brigadier general and his colonels which showcased the excellent work they do with some very fine equipment.  I could not get over the relatively young age profile of the equipment they use, with the exception of the Cessna aircraft which is a discussion for another day.  I was very impressed with the professionalism and display put on for us during a two and a half hour visit.  It was an eye-o pening experience for me.  I had been in Casement Aerodrome as a child back in the 1980s when the aeronautical displays used to take place with the Swallow aircraft among others but this has not happened in a while.  Seeing the Air Corps operate, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na helicopter unit which is also based there, was a great experience and the Chairman, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I greatly enjoyed our brief visit.  I wish to take this opportunity to mention it and commend them on their stellar service to the State.</p></speech>

Our visit was very worthwhile and I thank the Department officials who were with us and the personnel who gave of their time to brief us on the work they do.  I was very struck by how professional the air ambulance service is.  It certainly shows the value of these visits because one can speak all day but it is very useful to see what happens.  I had a problem getting Deputy Farrell out of the cockpit of one of the aircraft.</p><p>  I am a small bit puzzled about the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister stated the Supplementary Estimate is Exchequer neutral, but &euro;9.4 million is being sought.  The Minister stated it will come from another Vote.  From what other Vote is it coming?  Am I missing something?</p></speech>

I notice there are 12,000 Army pensioners and an active strength of a little over 9,000.  This year there are 339 recruits and 260 have left.  When was the last year there was recruitment?  With how many years is the Minister catching up?  Is a strength of 9,000 sufficient for the Army to meet all its commitments, particularly international commitments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013120400006#E01400"><p>No, we have agreed the objective strength is 9,500.  I gave the exact figures a moment ago.  At present there are approximately 9,250 in the Defence Forces.  By the time we get to 31 December it will be 9,400.  Each year there are a number of retirements and I went through the various retirement figures a moment ago.  It is important we continue with our recruitment campaign.  I stated there will be a new recruitment campaign in 2014.  The Government made a decision the objective strength should be 9,500 and at present we are approximately 250 below this.  It will increase to 9,400 by 31 December and we will continue this into the new year.  Every year different numbers retire and are recruited.  Recruitment in 2011 was 526 and in 2012 it was 633.  We have different numbers each year, which are substantially dictated by the number of retirements . A number of vacancies can become available and after a little time lag we recruit.  The object of strength is 9,500 and there will always be some variant and movement up and down.  I am satisfied the numbers we have at present are sufficient to enable us to carry out our duties at home and abroad.</p><p>  Deputies Anne Ferris and Alan Farrell mentioned the missions abroad.  We sometimes lose sight of the fact we are a small country.  It is extraordinary we have engagements throughout the world in 14 different locations all of which are conflict zones or troublespots.  In some of these we have only small numbers of our Defence Forces, but they are there because they are in leadership positions.  For example, last week I visited the Lebanon, Jordan and Israel and I met Major General Mick Finn of the Defence Forces who heads up the truce observer group in the Middle East covering the Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria.  The group was put in place following the 1973 war in the region.  The 250 soldiers engaged in the group come from a broad range of countries but someone from Ireland is in charge.  This is replicated elsewhere, for example EUTM Somalia where Brigadier General Aherne is in charge of the mission.  Again we have very small numbers there but they do very important jobs.  Without doubt we have the capacity to continue to engage in this way and bring our niche skills in peacekeeping and dealing with the neutralisation of improvised explosive devices.  In some instances we are in teaching mode for bigger armies.  These are very important tasks and the Defence Forces are certainly up to them.</p> <p> The Defence Forces get good training in these areas and do an important and good job which gets worldwide praise and recognition.  When I travelled around the Middle East last week, various Ministers in different Governments praised the contribution we are making and the value of our engagement.</p></speech>

It should be noted that some of them are experiencing hard times.  The committee will be meeting the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women next year.  I commend the work it does in supporting retired members of the Defence Forces who have may have fallen on hard times.  Sometimes one can get institutionalised when one is in an organisation for some time and then have difficulties adapting when one retires.</p><p>  There was an expectation among many Defence Force members when they joined up initially, that after 21 years&rsquo; service, there would be an opportunity for promotion to sergeant and beyond.  I understand that this is not happening and this is why it has become an issue.  This might have to be taken into account.</p></speech>

It was to go down to 9,000 and be reduced further to the 8,000 mark.  Having regard for the financial realities of the State and our defence needs at home and abroad, a decision was made to create an objective strength of 9,500.  With a smaller force, of course, there is a somewhat reduced opportunity for promotions.  These are issues which must be dealt with in the public interest.  We must make decisions, within the strength we have, to ensure the numbers are fit for purpose in the context of age profile.  An interesting statistic is that to date in 2013, a total of 51 officers were promoted but 550 enlisted personnel were also promoted.  There have been quite a number of promotions.  However, these issues have to be addressed by having regard to the public interest and ensuring the capabilities of the Defence Forces in their varied tasks.

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not criticise of make charges against a person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing rule of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  I now invite An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, to address the committee.</p></speech>

Is trua liom a r&aacute; go raibh orm tr&iacute; cinn eile de thuarasc&aacute;lacha a thabhairt le gairid do Thithe an Oireachtais i gc&aacute;s eagrais st&aacute;it nach ndearna achomhairc i gcoinne cinnt&iacute; a rinne m&eacute; ach f&oacute;s f&eacute;in n&aacute;r chur i bhfeidhm na molta&iacute; cu&iacute;.  Is iad larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Comhairle Contae na hlarmh&iacute; agus Oifig na nOibreacha Poibl&iacute; na heagrais a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Faoi Thithe an Oireachtais at&aacute; s&eacute; anois cib&eacute; c&eacute;imeanna eile is mian leo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il, m&aacute;s cu&iacute; leo sin a dh&eacute;anamh.
  C&eacute; gur f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh athbhreithni&uacute; ar Acht an dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la i m&iacute; na Samhna 2011, breis agus dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin, agus gur mhair pr&oacute;iseas suntasach comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in phoibl&iacute; go dt&iacute; deireadh mh&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir 2012, is beag at&aacute; cloiste go poibl&iacute; go dt&iacute; seo faoi thortha&iacute; an phr&oacute;isis seo.  N&iacute;or chuidi&uacute; ar bith &eacute; an fol&uacute;s seo.
  Rinneadh cinneadh Rialtais i m&iacute; na Samhna 2011 m'oifig a ch&oacute;nascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman faoi Phlean Athch&oacute;irithe an Rialtais don tSeirbh&iacute;s Phoibl&iacute;. Rinneadh an cinneadh sin i ngan fhios dom f&eacute;in agus don Ombudsman ag an am.  N&iacute;l aon mhionsonra&iacute; ar f&aacute;il go poibl&iacute; faoina bhfuil molta n&oacute; faoin bhealach a cheaptar a n-oibreodh s&eacute; agus bheadh imn&iacute; orm faoi inmharthanacht na hoifige amach anseo, agus na himpleachta&iacute; f&oacute;irne a ghabhann leis sin.
  T&aacute; oifig s'againne ar cheann de na heagrais st&aacute;it is l&uacute; d&aacute; bhfuil ann, agus buis&eacute;ad againn at&aacute; n&iacute;os l&uacute;, fi&uacute;, n&aacute; r&uacute;n-sheirbh&iacute;s na t&iacute;re. T&aacute; foireann reatha de 4.4 st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;seach ag obair inti, t&aacute; tr&iacute; cinn d'fhol&uacute;ntais f&oacute;irne againn faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; muid gan sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir le blianta agus t&aacute; &aacute;r mbuis&eacute;ad tite 45% &oacute;n bhliain 2008.  N&iacute;or tugadh don oifig riamh na hacmhainn&iacute; riachtanacha lena c&uacute;raim&iacute; reacht&uacute;la a chomhl&iacute;onadh go cu&iacute; agus go hioml&aacute;n.
  Go ginear&aacute;lta, d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; gafa go gairmi&uacute;il n&oacute; go deonach le cosaint n&oacute; cur chun cinn na teanga, is tr&eacute;imhse &iacute; seo at&aacute; l&aacute;n le h&eacute;iginnteacht.  N&iacute; fhaca m&eacute; in imeacht 30 bliain mar iriseoir n&oacute; mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga an oiread &iacute;sle br&iacute; agus lagmhisnigh.  D'ainneoin taca&iacute;ocht ollmh&oacute;r ag tromlach an phobail i gcoitinne sa t&iacute;r don teanga, t&aacute; s&iacute; &aacute; ruaigeadh go lean&uacute;nach chuig imeall na socha&iacute;, agus &aacute;ir&iacute;m anseo cuid mhaith den riarach&aacute;n phoibl&iacute;.  N&iacute; bheidh s&eacute; furasta &iacute; a thabhairt ar ais go h&aacute;it n&iacute;os l&aacute;rna&iacute;.
  Mar bhunch&eacute;im riachtanach agus Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la &aacute; leas&uacute; mar chuid de chl&aacute;r an Rialtais, creidim go l&aacute;idir go gcaithfear for&aacute;il shoil&eacute;ir a chur ann a chinnteoidh go mbeidh Gaeilge ag fostaithe an St&aacute;&iacute;t a bheidh ag freastal ar phobal na Gaeltachta, gan cheist, gan choinn&iacute;oll.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir lean&uacute;int ag tabhairt ar chainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais Gaeilge an B&eacute;arla a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus iad ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; st&aacute;it.  Agus comhthreomhar leis seo, caithfear athchuairt a thabhairt l&aacute;ithreach ar cheist na teanga san earca&iacute;ocht agus i gcom&oacute;rtais arduithe c&eacute;ime sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; i gcoitinne.  Go simpl&iacute;, n&iacute;l bealach ar bith go n-oibreoidh na beartais is deireana&iacute; at&aacute; f&oacute;gartha ina leith seo.
  Munar f&eacute;idir leis an St&aacute;t aghaidh a thabhairt ar an d&aacute; ghn&eacute; sin nuair a bheidh an t-Acht &aacute; leas&uacute;, is &eacute; sin &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge i mbun cumars&aacute;ide le pobal na Gaeltachta agus cinnti&uacute; go mbeadh d&oacute;thain f&oacute;irne le cumas sa Ghaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras riarach&aacute;in phoibl&iacute;, creidim go dtuigfear ansin gur mugadh magadh, briolla brealla n&oacute; br&eacute;aga a bheas i gceist.  Tr&aacute;th a bhfuil muid ag teannadh len&aacute;r bhflaitheas eacnama&iacute;och a fh&aacute;il ar ais, ba mh&oacute;r an feall &eacute; d&aacute; gcaillfimis &aacute;r bhflaitheas teanga, bunchloch d&aacute;r bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht chult&uacute;rtha, d&aacute;r n-oidhreacht agus d&aacute;r n-anam mar n&aacute;isi&uacute;n.  Creidim gur measa mar bhaol &eacute; sin anois n&aacute; riamh.
  Beidh deich mbliana caite agam f&eacute;in i mbun oibre mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga i ndeireadh mh&iacute; Feabhra seo chugainn.  C&eacute; go bhfuil dh&aacute; bhliain eile f&aacute;gtha i mo thr&eacute;imhse ceapach&aacute;in, creidim i mo chro&iacute; istigh i bhfianaise na faisn&eacute;ise at&aacute; curtha in bhur l&aacute;thair agam anseo inniu gur beag eile a d'fh&eacute;adfainn a bhaint amach go pearsanta sa tr&eacute;imhse ama sin i dtaca le cearta teanga phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Is trua liom a r&aacute;, mar sin, go bhfuil cinneadh d&eacute;anta agam seasamh siar &oacute; mo cheapach&aacute;n mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ar an 23 Feabhra seo chugainn.  T&aacute; an cinneadh seo curtha in i&uacute;l inniu agam i scr&iacute;bhinn do Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann mar a leagtar sios sa dl&iacute;. 
  Ba mhaith liom ag an tr&aacute;th seo mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d ar fad a chuidigh liom le linn na mblianta at&aacute; caite agam i mbun ch&uacute;raim&iacute; an phoist seo, go h&aacute;irithe foireann bheag dh&iacute;ograiseach na hoifige.  Glacaim bu&iacute;ochas leo sin ar fad i r&eacute;imse na polait&iacute;ochta agus sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras a thacaigh len&aacute;r gcuid oibre.  Ba mh&oacute;r agam an taca&iacute;ocht in imeacht na mblianta &oacute; na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide, go speisialta iriseoir&iacute; na Gaeilge, &oacute; na heagrais Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, &oacute;n lucht acad&uacute;il, uathu sin a chuir comhairle orm go gairmi&uacute;il n&oacute; go deonach, &oacute; choimisin&eacute;ir&iacute; teanga eile as gach cearn den domhan, &oacute; bhaill den st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus den tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;, &oacute; chairde agus &oacute; gach duine eile a chuidigh linn.
  Thar aon n&iacute; eile, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas &oacute; chro&iacute; a ghlacadh le pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta as an mhuin&iacute;n a chuir siad ionam f&eacute;in agus i bhfoireann na hoifige le deich mbliana anuas.
  Mo bhu&iacute;ochas fosta leatsa, a Chathaoirligh, agus le baill an chomhchoiste as &eacute;isteacht liom inniu.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh..</p></speech>

T&aacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.</p><p> Chuir s&eacute; ceist an bhfuil cearta teanga ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute;, ach t&aacute; siad an-teoranta.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le cearta teanga a bheith ar f&aacute;il &oacute; St&aacute;t ch&oacute;ras na t&iacute;re muna bhfuil daoine ag obair ann a bhuil Gaeilge acu.  T&aacute; polasa&iacute; nua earca&iacute;ochta &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge &aacute; thabhairt chun cinn, rud nach n-oibreoidh.  T&aacute; m&eacute; l&aacute;n chinnte de sin.  Theip ar an bpolasa&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann roimhe seo.  Teipfidh n&iacute;os measa ar an bpolasa&iacute; nua.  N&iacute; &eacute;ireoidh leis daoine le Gaeilge a cheapadh sa ch&oacute;ras poibl&iacute;.  Cuireann s&eacute; foireann peile i gcuimhne dom.  Muna bhfuil peilead&oacute;ir&iacute; le dul amach ar an bp&aacute;irc n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an cluiche a imirt.  Mar a d&uacute;irt Jos&eacute; Mourinho, agus &eacute; ag caint faoi peilead&oacute;ir&iacute;, "No eggs, no omelette".  T&aacute; se mar a ch&eacute;ile i saol na teanga.

T&aacute; an d&aacute; rud sin l&aacute;rnach m&aacute; t&aacute; seans ar bith le bheith ag an teanga maireacht&aacute;il.  Muna nd&eacute;anfar &eacute; sin n&iacute; f&eacute;idir a bheith ag s&uacute;il go mairfidh an teanga mar theanga beo phobail sa Ghaeltacht n&oacute; stadas a bheith aici mar theanga ar fud na t&iacute;re.

I l&aacute;thair na huaire braithim go bhfuilimid an-ghar do dhul i dtreo B&eacute;arla &eacute;igeantach le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Beidh compulsory English ag teacht isteach in &aacute;it Gaeilge &eacute;igeantach, mar a bh&iacute; tr&aacute;th den saol.  S&iacute;lim, c&eacute; nach maith liom &eacute; seo a r&aacute;, go mb&eacute;adh s&eacute; n&iacute;os on&oacute;ra&iacute; agus n&iacute;os misni&uacute;la ag an St&aacute;t a r&aacute; go bhfuil B&eacute;arla &eacute;igeantach.

I l&aacute;thair na huaire n&iacute;l seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il ar ard chaighde&aacute;n do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus go dt&iacute; go mbeidh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin ar f&aacute;il n&iacute; bhainfear &uacute;s&aacute;id astu.

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam, le cabhair an chomhchoiste seo, go m'fh&eacute;idir go dtabharfar aghaidh ar chuid na ceisteanna seo.</p><p>  Go raibh maith ag an Seanad&oacute;ir ar&iacute;s as a chine&aacute;ltas</p></speech>

I regret that he should resign now, on what he describes as matters of policy.  It is regrettable.</p><p>  Notwithstanding everything that is said, I see a massive bureaucratic nightmare here under our current regulations.  All public documents must be translated in every part of the country and on every occasion, when everyone knows they will not be read.  There are areas where there just is a waste of money.  I do not say that lightly.  I would prefer translation on request, as a better option.</p><p>  It is 40 years since compulsory Irish for the Civil Service was abolished.  I am not sure about the workings of the replacement.  I would like to ask the Coimisin&eacute;ir, what is the object of the exercise at this stage, 40 years later.  He speaks of developing State services through Irish.  What is the ultimate development?  What is the goal?  We should look at Wales and Scotland, and perhaps at Wales in particular where there has been more targeting, which may be more beneficial.  </p> <p>Speaking of targeting, I was not aware of what the Coimisin&eacute;ir describes as compulsory anglicisation of parts of the Gaeltacht.  I find that surprising and regrettable.  Having said that, I would like to see more practical engagement.  We should have annual scholarships for young people, or indeed older people, in areas like my own constituency to go to the Gaeltacht where we would engage in the practical aspects of spoken Irish as well as the language and culture and everything that goes with it.  We now have language officers in every county.  I am not sure of the benefit to the people of County Laois of having an Irish language officer in Laois County Council.  We saw the same thing in the HSE and in the translation of documents and signs, not only in Gaeltacht areas but throughout the country.  This is particularly the case in a time of recession. </p><p> It would be unfair to say that the Irish language has been unduly or unfairly treated in our current economic difficulties.  The Coimisin&eacute;ir speaks of lack of staff and resources and budget cuts.  That is all true but it is not something that has impacted on An Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta more than other Departments.  It would be unsustainable for any Department to opt out of all budgetary adjustments.  It would be unfair to cite budget cuts over and above general cuts made in all Departments in the past number of years.  </p><p> I wish the Coimisin&eacute;ir well and acknowledge the work he has done over a number of years which, in spite of what he says, is significant.  I wish him well.   </p></speech>

There is a myth that all public documents must be produced in Irish.  A small number of core documents are required to be published simultaneously in Irish and English.  I did not decide this.  The Houses of the Oireachtas decided it in the Official Languages Act.  My job is to ensure that is complied with.</p><p>  D&eacute;anann an Teachta tagairt do ch&oacute;ras n&iacute;os fearr a chur ar bun.  Aonta&iacute;m leis go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an Acht agus ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os fearr.  Rinne mise sraith molta&iacute; thart ar dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin agus d&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur cheart f&eacute;achaint c&eacute;ard iad na h&aacute;iteacha a bhfuil seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il agus go n-oibreofa&iacute; amach ord tosa&iacute;ochta d&oacute;ibh.  Ar&iacute;s, t&aacute;imid ag fanacht dh&aacute; bhliain leis an toradh air sin.  Deputy Flanagan talks about a targeted translation of material or provision of services.  More than two years ago, I published a paper suggesting that we needed to prioritise the services we provide in Irish.  The paper was presented as part of the review of the Act, but it is hanging somewhere and I know not where.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mb&eacute;adh tosa&iacute;ocht tugtha do sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &aacute;irithe.</p><p>  Cuireann an Teachta ceist c&eacute;ard &eacute; an rud is m&oacute; a bh&eacute;adh ag teast&aacute;il in ndeireadh an lae.  The Deputy asked what is the ultimate development.  S&iacute;lim gur cheart go mb&eacute;adh deis ag an teanga stairi&uacute;il seo maireacht&aacute;il sa t&iacute;r seo.  Le sin a dh&eacute;anamh, n&iacute;l aon chiall d&uacute;inn a bheith ag m&uacute;ineadh Gaeilge i gc&oacute;ras oideachais na t&iacute;re munar f&eacute;idir le daoine ina dhiaidh sin an teanga sin a &uacute;s&aacute;id go furasta agus iad ag pl&eacute; leis an St&aacute;t.  The ultimate development is that the State provides services in Irish for those who choose to use that language, be they in the Gaeltacht or outside it.  If we teach Irish as a required subject in schools up to leaving certificate it is hypocritical, in the least, to tell people they must study Irish and then refuse them the right to deal with the State in that language.  We are teaching them a language but not facilitating them to use that language with ease afterwards.  I see a huge disconnect in those two things.</p><p>  Luann s&eacute; ciorraithe airgid agus buis&eacute;id.  T&aacute; ciorraithe buis&eacute;id i ngach cuid den ch&oacute;ras.  Bh&iacute; ciorraithe buis&eacute;id de 45% in oifig s'againne.  Is oifig an-bheag &iacute;, n&iacute;l ach 4.4 f&oacute;irne ag obair innti, agus glacaimid le ciorraithe &aacute;irithe.  Ach t&aacute; teorainn leis an m&eacute;id oibre a dh&eacute;anann t&uacute; le foireann beag.  Yes, all Government Departments and agencies have had staff cuts and budget cuts.  We have had a cut of 45% over the last five years, which is significant.  We are reduced to 4.4 civil servants.  That is the sum total of the staff of the office.  It is a very small office and what one can do with a staff of that size is very limited.  I am not asking for any special privilege or favour.  C&eacute; gur daoine maithe agus d&iacute;ograiseacha iad t&aacute; teorainn leis an m&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir leat a bhaint amach.</p><p>  Go raibh maith ag an Teachta Flanagan freisin as na focla cine&aacute;lta a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios agam nach bhfuil an Coimisin&eacute;ir chun chaint ar an &aacute;bhar seo, ach i rith an d&aacute; bhliain sin n&iacute;l feabhas tagtha ar an fhadhb.

N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin ach n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; &eacute;inne a raibh a chro&iacute; sa nGaeilge ag d&eacute;anamh casaoid ariamh faoina chuid oibre, a dh&uacute;thracht n&oacute; a chur chuige.  N&iacute; beag an m&eacute;id &eacute; sin, mar n&iacute; dream iad lucht na Gaeilge i gc&oacute;na&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn ar aon intinn.</p><p>  Bh&iacute; t&uacute;ir d&oacute;chais ann.  Bh&iacute; an-obair ar bun ar son na Gaeilge agus tortha&iacute; &aacute; bhaint amach.  Sa ndaon&aacute;ireamh deireannach n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go raibh l&iacute;on na ndaoine a d&uacute;irt go raibh Gaeilge </p><p>acu m&eacute;adaithe, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mb&eacute;adh amhras ar dhaoine faoi sin &oacute; thr&aacute;th go ch&eacute;ile, ach bh&iacute; l&iacute;on na ndaoine a d&uacute;irt go labhra&iacute;onn siad Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il, taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras oideachais, imithe i m&eacute;id.  Agus bh&iacute; m&eacute;ad&uacute; beag i gcomhth&eacute;acs Gaeltachta.  Ag deireadh an lae, is mar theanga laeth&uacute;il labhartha a mhairfeas an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&eacute;adh Gaeilge ag an oiread sin daoine agus is f&eacute;idir ach n&iacute; mhairfidh teanga gan lucht labhartha laeth&uacute;il.  </p><p>  Goilleann s&eacute; orm, i ruda&iacute; beaga agus i ruda&iacute; m&oacute;ra, go bhfuil dul i gc&uacute;l laeth&uacute;il &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Is minic a thugann na ruda&iacute; beaga nach bhfuil aon airgid ag baint leo l&eacute;argas n&iacute;os fearr ar dhearcadh n&aacute; mar a thugann na ruda&iacute; m&oacute;ra.  T&aacute;, mar shampla, an cinneadh an rinne, tar &eacute;is an m&eacute;id achain&iacute; a rinne Conradh na Gaeilge le mo leith&eacute;id agus le daoine sa Teach seo gur Uisce &Eacute;ireanna a bh&eacute;adh ar Irish Water.  T&aacute; an cinneadh a rinneadh, don ch&eacute;ad uair &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t, go mb&eacute;adh ainmneacha B&eacute;arla ar bh&aacute;id an Chabhlaigh.  Go traidisi&uacute;nta, ainmneacha Gaeilge a bh&iacute; orthu mar Aoife, Emer agus Eithne, a bhain le miotaseola&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge, a thaispe&aacute;in gur n&aacute;isi&uacute;n Gaelach a bh&iacute; ionainn agus a thaispe&aacute;in, ar bhealach an-deas, gach &aacute;it a ndeachaigh na b&aacute;id ar fud an domhain gurb &iacute; an Ghaeilge ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il an St&aacute;it.  Bh&iacute; an cinneadh ann deireadh a chur le Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha a bh&iacute; a feidhmi&uacute; &oacute; buna&iacute;odh &eacute; ins na ceathrachada&iacute;.  N&iacute;or buna&iacute;odh brainse na logainmneacha go dt&iacute; na caogada&iacute;.  </p><p>  Ach ba &eacute; an cinneadh ba mh&oacute; a thaispe&aacute;in treo na gaoithe n&aacute; an cinneadh c&oacute;nascadh a dh&eacute;anamh, nach c&oacute;nascadh a bh&iacute; ann i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re ach oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga a chur isteach in Oifig an Ombudsman.  Nuair a bh&iacute; Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in mar Choimisin&eacute;ir th&oacute;g s&eacute; c&aacute;s in aghaidh an Ombudsman.  C&eacute;n chaoi a d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh d&aacute; mb&eacute;adh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ag obair in Oifig an Ombudsman?      </p> <p>Is d&oacute;igh liom gur thaispe&aacute;in s&eacute; sin go raibh forl&aacute;mhas faighte ag an dream at&aacute; sa Rialtas buan sa t&iacute;r seo ar an bpolasa&iacute; agus go raibh &eacute;irithe leo go coinsiasach.  N&iacute; raibh aon ch&uacute;is eile leis.  Go coinsiasach, s&eacute;ard a bh&iacute; i gceist le seo &oacute; th&uacute;s - agus is sean mholadh ag dul thart sa gc&oacute;ras &eacute; seo - n&aacute; go mbainf&iacute; na fiacla as Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara agus gur coimisin&eacute;ir mantach a bheadh ann, gan fiacal ar bith.  </p><p> T&aacute; imn&iacute; orm tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na go bhfeicfidh an Rialtas in &eacute;ir&iacute; as oifig an choimisin&eacute;ara, deis neart leasuithe teanga a thabhairt isteach, agus iad ag cur locht ar an choimisin&eacute;ir.  Feicfidh siad anois deis an deas n&eacute;ata deireadh a chur le Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga mar oifig neamhsple&aacute;ch.  T&aacute; s&eacute; suas anois d'fhoireann na Gaeilge agus do phobal na Gaeltachta, is cuma c&eacute;n dearcadh polait&iacute;ochta at&aacute; acu, a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte nach dtarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am acu d&uacute;iseacht don mh&eacute;id at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.</p><p> Luaigh an coimisin&eacute;ir lochta&iacute; ar an Acht Teanga.  Bheinn ar an ch&eacute;ad duine a deirfeadh go bhfuil g&aacute; le Acht teanga.  Siar sna d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; nuair a tugadh isteach an tAcht Teanga, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; ag an am gur chreid m&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh Acht teanga ann, ach go bhfaca m&eacute; &eacute; ar n&oacute;s an br&eacute;ag&aacute;n Lego a bheadh ag gas&uacute;r, mar bhunchloch a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; t&oacute;g&aacute;il air.  N&iacute;or chreid m&eacute; riamh go r&eacute;iteodh s&eacute; gach fadhb a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de, ach chreid m&eacute; san ailtireacht a bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh a chur in &aacute;it.  Chreid m&eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh Acht ann - caithfear rud &eacute;igin a bheith againn le cur i bhfeidhm - agus d&aacute; mbeadh "enforcer" ann, duine leis an Acht a chur i bhfeidhm a bheadh neamhsple&aacute;ch ar chuile duine sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; go leor a bhaint amach.  Chreid m&eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh an tAcht ann, go mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca &eacute; a leas&uacute; agus a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os foirfe de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile, go c&eacute;imni&uacute;il, ach &eacute; a bheith ann, n&aacute; gan Acht ar bith.</p><p> Mar is eol d&uacute;inn, n&iacute; raibh an tAcht achtaithe nuair a thosaigh sc&eacute;al na h&aacute;ibh&eacute;ile, go raibh s&eacute; ag cosaint na milli&uacute;n ar an St&aacute;t aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is d&oacute;igh liomsa gur sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il an tAcht na milli&uacute;n ar an St&aacute;t seo.  Sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il s&eacute; an t-uaf&aacute;s airgid, mar an costas is m&oacute; a bhaineann le c&aacute;ip&eacute;is ar bith a r&eacute;iteach n&aacute; an bun scr&iacute;obh agus na leaganacha agus na dr&eacute;achta&iacute; ag dul &oacute; dhuine go duine taobh istigh den ch&oacute;ras, rud nach n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear go br&aacute;ch.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig an tAcht, giorra&iacute;odh go m&oacute;r cuid mhaith den scr&iacute;obh a bh&iacute; ar bun sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  T&aacute; a fhios againn, &oacute; bheith ag breathn&uacute; ar an mh&eacute;id focal a bh&iacute; i chuile rud, nach raibh sa gcostas aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in ach c&eacute;atad&aacute;n an-bheag de chostas r&eacute;iteach agus cur I l&aacute;thair.  Is d&oacute;igh liom, &oacute; dhul thart ar fud na t&iacute;re, go bhfuil an Teach tar &eacute;is tionchar &aacute;irithe a imirt at&aacute; dearfach, mar shampla, &oacute; thaobh comhartha&iacute;ochta de.  N&iacute;l le d&eacute;anamh ach dul go T2 in aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath anois go bhfeicfear gan dua dea-chleachtas agus feachtas gur f&eacute;idir a chur i bhfeidhm.  De r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile, &oacute; tharla go bhfuil siad dubh agus b&aacute;n, is f&eacute;idir iad sin a chur I bhfeidhm.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an cheist is m&oacute; gur g&aacute; d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis &ndash; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a bheith ar f&aacute;il, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in do phobal na Gaeltachta ach do phobal na Gaeilge.  An t-aon dream go bhfuil aon seirbh&iacute;s foirfe ar chor ar bith acu n&aacute; na Coimisin&eacute;ir&iacute; Ioncaim.  Is bunt&aacute;iste d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo si&uacute;d i nGaeilge.  Faoi dh&oacute;, tharla s&eacute; d&uacute;inn nuair a ghlaoigh muid orthu go raibh muid ag pl&eacute; le duine n&aacute;r bhain an t-&aacute;bhar leis, ach in ionad a r&aacute; n&aacute;r bhain an t-&aacute;bhar leis, fuair s&eacute; an t-eolas ar fad agus bh&iacute; freagra againn laistigh de ch&uacute;pla uair a chloig.  Bheadh fonn ar dhuine, mar sin, an tseirbh&iacute;s a lorg tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, mar ba bhunt&aacute;iste d&oacute; &eacute;.  Ach i gcoitinne, tharraing an tseirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute; a gcos ina ndiaidh i dtaobh na ceiste seo. </p><p> An f&aacute;th gur cuireadh isteach sna pleananna &eacute;, n&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; deacair, leis an easpa chumais Gaeilge at&aacute; sa seirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;, riail ghinear&aacute;lta a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ach n&iacute; raibh i gceist ariamh go gcaithfeadh na pleananna sin a bheith ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il bliain i ndiaidh bliana, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r do lucht na Gaeltachta.  Seo an &aacute;it a thagann trasna ar an l&iacute;ne tana&iacute; idir dl&iacute; agus feidhmi&uacute;.  T&aacute; codanna den Acht - n&iacute;l aon amhras faoi seo - at&aacute; ag brath go hioml&aacute;n ar dea-thoil an Rialtais.  Nuair at&aacute;im ag caint ar an Rialtas, t&aacute;im ag caint ar an gc&uacute;igear d&eacute;ag at&aacute; timpeall ar bhord an Rialtais.  Brathann s&eacute; go m&oacute;r ar an Taoiseach.  An f&aacute;th at&aacute; agam le sin n&aacute; seo, san ailtireacht a chur muid le ch&eacute;ile, bh&iacute; an tuiscint ann d&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh Roinn faill&iacute;och i dtaobh a chuid c&uacute;raim&iacute;, mar shampla, plean nua a aont&uacute;, go raibh dh&aacute; chosaint in aghaidh &eacute; sin a tharl&uacute; ag an gc&oacute;ras.</p><p> An ch&eacute;ad chosaint n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfadh an tAire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta gear&aacute;n ag bord an Rialtais leis an Taoiseach agus go n-ord&oacute;dh an Taoiseach don Aire a bh&iacute; freagrach as tarraingt na gcos d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, an fhadhb at&aacute; ann go praitici&uacute;l n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon Aire Gaeilge n&oacute; Gaeltachta ag bord an Rialtais n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  An dara chosaint a bh&iacute; i gceist, agus n&iacute;or ceapadh riamh go mbeadh Rialtas ann leis an m&oacute;ramh at&aacute; ag an Rialtas i l&aacute;thair na huaire, n&aacute; d&aacute; dteipfeadh ar rogha a haon, go bhf&eacute;adfadh an tOireachtas seo tionchar a imirt ar an Rialtas le nach mbeadh aon &eacute;al&uacute; ag an Rialtas ach gn&iacute;omh&uacute;.  D&uacute;radh linn anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na nach mar sin at&aacute; s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute; agus go bhfuil teipthe ar an bpr&oacute;iseas sin.  T&aacute; g&aacute; d&aacute; bharr seo breathn&uacute; ar an reachta&iacute;ocht as an nua agus a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte go bhfuil na beala&iacute; &eacute;alaithe ar fad at&aacute; aimsithe ag an gc&oacute;ras d&uacute;nta ar fad.</p><p> Is droch rud ceart &eacute; seo do phobal na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; obair na mblianta curtha ar gc&uacute;l.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; a raibh taca&iacute;ocht l&aacute;idir tras-ph&aacute;irt&iacute; &oacute; dhaoine a bhfuil dea-thoil acu don Ghaeilge curtha ar neamhn&iacute;.  Rud eile a fuair mise amach nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; mar Aire, taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras agus na me&aacute;in, n&aacute; go bhfuil daoine ann, cuid acu a deir gur maith leo an Ghaeilge, at&aacute; glan in aghaidh aon chearta a bheith ag saor&aacute;naigh &oacute;ga n&aacute; sean gur &iacute; an Ghaeilge a rogha teanga.  Faigheann siad leithsc&eacute;al i gc&oacute;na&iacute; le r&aacute; n&aacute;r ceart rud ar bith a dh&eacute;anamh, ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anfa&iacute; i dt&iacute;r eile ar bith ar domhan ina bheadh an Ghaeilge mar an ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il.  T&aacute;thar glan in aghaidh go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; na ruda&iacute; sin.</p><p> T&aacute; naimhde don Ghaeilge ann agus t&aacute;thar fairsing agus cumhachtach.  Muna dtuigfidh pobal na Gaeilge &eacute; sin, beidh thiar orainn sa deireadh.  Is oth liom a r&aacute;, faoi l&aacute;thair t&aacute; forl&aacute;mhas acu si&uacute;d ar an gc&oacute;ras ioml&aacute;n, an c&oacute;ras Rialtais agus an c&oacute;ras buan sa seirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  T&aacute; go leor le d&eacute;anamh againne mar ionadaithe tofa an phobail le troid ar ais ina n-aghaidh.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas le Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in as gach rud a rinne s&eacute;.  B'fh&eacute;idir as seo go m&iacute; Feabhra, go dtuigfidh an Rialtas gur glaoch d&uacute;iseacht &eacute; seo agus go gn&iacute;omh&oacute;idh s&eacute; ar bhealach go mbeidh an coimisin&eacute;ir in ann a intinn a athr&uacute; ar an cheist seo.</p></speech>

T&aacute; comhthion&oacute;l an-mhaith bunaithe againn anois agus b&iacute;onn cruinnuithe againn go rialta. Casann muid ar a ch&eacute;ile ar a laghad gach r&aacute;ithe.

I will try to go through the presentation in as much detail as I can.  Obviously, we will be happy to answer any question that may arise.</p><p>  I propose to talk a little about EirGrid's role.  I will then discuss the Grid25 programme, examine some of the emerging issues related to it and outline international practice.  If there is time at the end of the meeting, I will be happy to take questions on anything included in the presentation or anything else members wish to talk about. </p><p>  EirGrid is a semi-State company and its objective is to keep the lights on.  We carry out that work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Our control centres in Dublin and Belfast manage the job in a real-time environment.  We also look to the future to make sure we have the necessary grid to ensure the lights will stay on ten, 20 or 30 years hence.  That is important work.</p><p>  Electricity is ubiquitous and an essential part of a modern economy and society.</p> <p>A secure, reliable and affordable power supply is absolutely essential in a modern economy to support businesses, competitiveness and jobs.  As we look to the future and consider the grid which will be necessary, where we identify a deficiency, we first consider the extent to which we can upgrade the grid using existing infrastructure.  In this regard, we have a massive programme under way.  Inevitably, sometimes we will need to build new infrastructure to cater for future needs.  When we identify this need, we consider all of the options available, be they overhead or underground.  We have no vested interest in a particular technology solution.  We are looking for the right answer to fit future needs for all of the people of Ireland.  That is our role and what we try to do.</p><p> The Grid25 programme is a strategy published in 2008 to consider future requirements.  It includes massive investment in transmission infrastructure.  The infrastructure is essential to ensure balanced regional development to support industry and jobs throughout the country.  It is also essential to ensure a competitive market which will put downward pressure on prices.  It will also ensure we facilitate meeting Ireland's target of 40% renewables by 2020.  We have a huge natural resource in wind energy and set ourselves a target of 40% by 2020.  To do this we must ensure we have the necessary infrastructure in place.</p><p> Grid25 is a significant investment of &euro;3.2 billion over its term.  It includes more than 200 projects throughout the country from the very small to the very large.  It has been under way for a number of years, with a number of significant successes and projects delivered.  As I mentioned, we look to upgrade existing infrastructure in the first instance.  We have a programme to upgrade more than 2,000 km of transmission lines.  To put this in scale, it is approximately one third of the existing transmission system which makes this a very significant upgrade programme.</p><p> We also have approximately 8 km of new transmission build.  It is fair to say it is the large 400 kV projects outlined on the next slide which have generated significant interest throughout the country and in the committee.  I will speak about the three 400 kV projects which are at different stages of development.  We have been developing the North-South interconnector, linking county Meath to County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, for a number of years and it is in the final stages of preparation for a planning application which we hope to submit in early 2014.  </p><p> The next project is Grid West which extends from Carrick on the River Shannon to western county Mayo and will significantly reinforce the grid in the west.  It will also enable the harnessing of what is a very significant natural resource in wind energy on the western seaboard and getting it on the grid.  We have identified a preferred corridor and are consulting people along the route.  We hope to submit a planning application for the project at approximately the end of 2015.  We have quite a way to go on this project.  </p><p> The Grid Link project will extend from County Cork to County Wexford to County Kildare.  It was launched in 2012 and we have spoken to people in the larger study area.  Most recently, earlier this year we published a number of corridors which took into account the feedback we had received in the earlier consultation.  The consultation period, at the request of the committee, has been extended and will close on 7 January 2014, after which we will reflect on all of the feedback and input we receive.</p><p> The next slide sets out the project development roadmap we have put in place for the development of transmission projects.  We realised they were significant in terms of scale and scope and that it was important we set out how we would consult and engage with people.  We set out the steps and analysis in which we would engage, the information we would make available, the opportunities for public consultation and the decision points along the way.  We were very clear with people up-front about what the process would involve in the development of these projects.  The consultation process and engagement are above and beyond anything put in place to date for an infrastructural project, be it roads or telecoms.  Notwithstanding this, we recognise that there is a degree of concern about the information available and are always looking to improve.  By way of illustration, the slide shows we have held more than 30 open days and have information offices in five locations.  We have held public information events at marts and shopping malls.  We have engaged with every local authority along the route.  We continue to meet elected representatives, local councillors and community groups on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Notwithstanding that the consultation on this project is ongoing and will be until early January, we recognise a number of issues have been raised through the consultation which also appeared in some of the other projects.  These are to do with health, undergrounding, visual impact, impact on property, community gain and the consultation process.  I spoke a little about the consultation process and have a few slides on the health and undergrounding issues.  I will speak about these issues because they have received the most attention.  I will be happy to take questions on the other issues later.  </p><p> We seek to mitigate visual impact through all of the work we do and engage on individual projects with all of the statutory bodies, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland which received media attention recently.  We are also aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are examining community gain proposals, of which we are very supportive.</p><p> In the interests of time I will discuss undergrounding and health, but I am happy to speak about the other issues.  It is important to point out that the pylons do not create electric or magnetic fields.  It is electricity which creates electric and magnetic fields.  It is the same electricity around us every day in this room, our homes and our appliances which causes electric and magnetic fields.  Because electricity is so ubiquitous in the world today and has been such an important part of the economy and society, it is one of the most studied health issues of our time.  The wealth of studies do not indicate any cause and effect relationship with any health issue.  The World Health Organization reviewed this issue and has a set of guidelines which outline the safe exposure limits and transmission is a factor of 50 below the safe exposure limits.  The World Health Organization's guidelines have been reviewed by public health bodies throughout the world and endorsed by the European Commission and adopted in this country.  We are 50 times below the limits set.  These limits are set by bodies the sole objective of which is the protection of human health.  The slide includes a quote from the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser.  In 2007 a report was published by the Department with responsibility for energy matters and which was responsible for this issue at the time.  It was reviewed in 2010 by the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser and the quote is taken from the paper published as part of the review.  It states it is simply not possible for the level of energy associated with power lines to cause cancer.  </p><p> I have pulled out a graph which is part of our communication on electromagnetic fields for anyone who has seen the booklet we produced to inform people.</p> <p>The top line shows the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection's guideline which is the World Health Organization's guideline of 100 &micro;T.  The exposure to various appliances and transmission technologies is shown further down the side.  The one at the bottom is for the underground cable which comes in at half of the guideline figure, whereas transmission lines come in at 50 times lower than the guideline.  These international guidelines are based on a large body of scientific evidence that is continually reviewed and updated by all of the various organisations involved.</p><p> Turning to the question of overhead versus underground, ours is a State company which has no vested interest in a particular technological solution.  We consider all of the available options to find the best solution to meet a particular need of the grid and Ireland Inc.  In 400 kV alternating current, AC, backbone transmission projects it is possible to underground short lengths along the route.  We determine whether doing so is appropriate, as a cost is added and reliability is degraded to some extent.  For significant distances of more than 20 km or 30 km, it is not possible to underground AC transmission systems.  A different technology - high voltage direct current, HVDC - would be required.  We are intimately familiar with it, as it is the technology we delivered for the east-west interconnector.  Using this technology involves inserting converter stations that are larger than Croke Park's pitch and nine storeys tall.  Energy is converted from the AC grid to DC and shipped via cable to another location were a second converter station is required.  It is also worth pointing out that tapping into the energy along the route is difficult and expensive.  As such, it does not support the communities and regions along the way by providing them with access to a reliable power source or reinforcing their grids.  Notwithstanding this, we have used this technology.  The HVDC interconnector with the United Kingdom is one of the most advanced in the world and won engineering project of the year this year.</p><p> We conducted a detailed study of the cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector project.  This was followed by a review and a study commissioned by the Government and comprising an independent panel of international experts that examined the cost of undergrounding.  The panel concluded that the cost would be a factor of three.</p><p> The graph on the next page shows the European transmission system and is drawn from readily available statistics.  The majority of the existing grid is overhead AC transmission lines, as is the majority in the planned development, some 97% combined.  People often quote Denmark as an example of what can be done in undergrounding.  It took a decision to underground its lower voltage transmission network, 132 kV and 150 kV.  As these lines reach the end of their economic lives in 2040, it will replace them with similar voltage underground cables.  However, it is placing its 400 kV AC circuit overhead.  Overhead transmission is the standard technology used across the world, both in terms of what has been deployed to date and what is planned for the future.</p><p> Ours is a semi-State company with the role of providing a safe, secure, reliable, economic and efficient grid, having due regard to the environment.  Grid25 is a significant investment in the infrastructure underpinning society and the economy.  We recognise that public consultation is essential to its successful delivery.  We understand a number of issues are emerging from that consultation process and we are listening to and aware of them.  However, the process is ongoing and will be until early in the new year, at which point we will take all of the input and feedback on the specific questions that we asked and any other issue that arose about the project's elements or our approach to same.  We ask people to raise these points as part of the consultation.  We will address all issues raised with us in a fair, balanced, open and transparent way.  We encourage people to engage in the consultation process and provide feedback.  A number of key themes are already visible, notwithstanding the fact that the consultation process has not closed.  We will seek to address them quickly following the closure of the process on 7 January.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and hope I have not taken too much of their time.  I apologise for the delay in supplying the presentation.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer members' questions or address issues they wish to raise.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I have been told mobile phones are interfering with the online coverage of the meeting.  I ask people to move their phones away from the microphones.</p><p>  We will move on to the next stage.  Many Members who are not members of the committee are present, as they want to ask questions.  I want to give everyone a fair run.  During yesterday's debate with the chairman designate, we limited contributions to five minutes but some took 12.  I propose that the leading member of each group or party ask his or her questions in just four minutes.  I also ask the officials to give direct answers.  We must complete the meeting by 12.30 p.m., when we must leave the room.  As I must also ask questions, I intend to stick to the same rules.  I ask everyone to be patient in the interests of allowing people to ask their questions.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Slye's presentation.  I also welcome EirGrid's extension of the consultation period to 7 January to allow for the receipt of submissions following a request from the committee.  Mr. Slye mentioned the word "consultation" many times in his submission.  What is his view of the fact that, as public representatives, the widespread feedback we are receiving is that there has not been meaningful consultation?  In my constituency of County Mayo, I am acutely aware that questions are not being answered or that different answers are coming from different officials.  The N26 proposal was turned down because of damage to the environment and its effect on Whooper swans, yet a grid line will run through the exact same area.</p> <p>There is no meaningful response.  As regards the North-South interconnector, there was no consultation with the people of Meath of the type currently being held with other areas.  While a decision was taken in 2006 to proceed with this project, the people were not made aware of it until October 2008.  The feedback we are getting is that some of the information provided in the booklets supplied to the committee this morning is at minimum confusing and at maximum misleading.  For example, it states in regard to the magnetic field that the overground 400 kV lines should be erected 30 meters from where people are living but underground cables are located directly below where people are living.  The feeling is that this is not comparing like with like.  </p><p> I would welcome the witnesses view on the need for independent information.  In my view, independent information and a cost-benefit analysis on the underground proposal would be of assistance to all the stakeholders, including EirGrid, the communities and Government.  It would provide information on which a decision could be based, which it is not possible to do at this point.  I would also welcome the witnesses view on the statement yesterday by the chairperson designate that he would not like to live beside a pylon.  Would any of the witnesses like to live beside one?</p></speech>

The first issue raised by the chairman was about questions not being answered as part of the consultation process.  Obviously, if this is the case, that is not something we want.  We are committed to responding to people's concerns.  We will look at that issue and see if there are specific concerns that people want to raise with us.  Where queries have not been responded to, we will happily engage on them.  We make every effort as part of the consultation process to respond to people's concerns.  Often if a request requires detailed analysis it will take some time.  We are committed to responding to people and informing them of how long it will take us to pull together whatever information is required.  If we are not doing this, we need to improve.  From my perspective, it should not be the case that people are left waiting for answers.  If specific queries have been raised and not answered, I am happy to look at that and rectify the situation.</p><p>  Ms Meghan will respond to the question on the North-South interconnector and the consultation in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deborah Meghan" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400006#F00300"><p>As discussed earlier, there is a roadmap which lays out the consultation process.  The North-South interconnector project has been ongoing since 2008.  Following the application in 2010, we sought to re-evaluate all of the work that had been carried out since 2008.  There have been a number of different reports on the matter, including by the independent expert commission and the Government in terms of its policy statement on energy.  In 2011, we published a preliminary re-evaluation report on the North-South project, which went to public consultation for the purpose of feedback on all work carried out to date, including work that had been part of the previous planning application.  Since then, we have published a final re-evaluation report, taking on board the feedback received on the preliminary report.  The final report also went to consultation for a number of days, including on our website and by way of online telephone calls.  This summer we published a third report, which is our preferred project solution report, which again identified the design as it has evolved.  It too has been put out for consultation.</p><p>  We have received a great deal of feedback on this project, which we hope to take on board so that we can complete the process and bring forth a planning application.  There has been a significant amount of consultation.  There are challenges and obviously concerns have been concerned by the general public.  However, when decisions are made information in that regard is presented to the public for feedback and consultation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Slye" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400006#F00400"><p>The chairman also commented on the EMF booklet.  In general, feedback on the booklet has been particularly positive.  However, I will take on board the chairman's comments and see if there is a better way to present the information.  We appreciate the feedback and will take on board the chairman's comments in the context of a review of the booklet.  The chairman also asked about the provision of independent information with respect to undergrounding.  We did extensive analysis of the undergrounding option during the North-South project.  An independent commission of experts was appointed by the Government to look at and report on it.  One of the themes of the Grid Link consultation is a desire for more detailed information around the undergrounding option.  Notwithstanding that the consultation has not yet concluded, we need to reflect on how best we can meet that and ensure that the information is presented in a manner that is understandable by the public and accepted by it in terms of impartial objective transparent information.  We need to reflect on what we are hearing in the consultation process on Grid Link.  We need to address this.</p><p>  The final question was about pylons.  Personally, I would have no issue living next to a pylon, first, because I know it is safe to do so and, second, because I am in the industry and I understand the direct link between the power on that pylon, keeping the lights on and keeping jobs in my community.</p></speech>

I will take questions in the following order: Deputy Dooley, Deputy Coffey, Senator Cullinane, Deputy Ann Phelan, Deputy McGrath and Deputy McEntee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400006#F00600"><p>I thank Mr. Slye and his officials for their presentation.  The documentation sets out the impact of the magnetic fields and appears to suggest that one would be more affected by an electric blanket or razor.  The chairman designate of EirGrid, Mr. O'Connor, appeared before the committee yesterday, at which time he stated that there was an impact on the lives of individuals in terms of loss of amenities and in the value of properties.  While I accept the scientific case being made in respect of electromagnetic effects and so on, what is less forthcoming is information on the other impacts of the transmissions lines on communities and individuals, which is in the main the reason people are interested in lines being moved or undergrounded.</p><p>  Perhaps Mr. Slye, rather than just mollifying people through EirGrid presentations or interface around the issues of public health, would elaborate on how EirGrid intends to overcome these issues, which are a real concern for some people.  I accept the science does not support this but I believe there are significant issues arising in terms of visual impact, utilisation of properties and loss of value of properties.</p> <p>The witness speaks about an independent report that effectively suggested the cost would be three times greater if the cables were placed underground as opposed to overground.  Taking the lifetime of the project over the decades it would be amortised, what is cost per unit of electricity?  Specifically, what would the difference between overground and underground?  Of all the major projects identified under Grid25, how many have been completed, how many are under construction and how many are at a planning stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Slye" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400007#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  He asked about impacts aside from the health issue around overhead transmission.  We seek to minimise any of the impacts in a number of ways.  In the first instance we seek to keep new transmission towers 50 m away from dwellings as we site the route.  As we engage in the process of routing a transmission line we work with all of the statutory bodies to take into account their concerns in addition to working with specific landowners and communities.  Where we site a transmission line or tower on somebody's land, we work with the specific landowner to compensate for the fact that the tower is on the land.  We make every effort to mitigate the impact these structures have on the visual environment, and part of that in particular areas of scenic beauty may include undergrounding short stretches of the line and, as the Deputy noted, potentially moving the line as well.  We do all this to try to mitigate the impact as we go through the process.  Part of this includes taking feedback from the consultation process, and we respond to any of this in detail.  That is spelt out in a very open and transparent way, and we articulate in clear terms how we have dealt with that feedback as we go through it.</p><p>  The Deputy's second question concerned the difference in cost.  The figure of a factor of three was stated by the independent panel of experts.  Taking the three 400 kV projects I noted on the map and assuming for a second that they could be undergrounded and that one is prepared to live with any technical limitations, it would add approximately &euro;2 billion to the cost of electricity.  That in turn would add cost to both household bills and domestic energy bills.</p></speech>

That is &euro;2 billion over the lifetime of the transmission network.  How does EirGrid amortise the cost?  Is it over 30, 40 or 50 years?</p></speech>

The Flagford to Srananagh 220 kV line has been completed.  There is a significant 220 kV line around the Cork Harbour area to reinforce the connection and facilitate the connection of ESB and Bord G&aacute;is generators in the harbour area.  The Lodgewood station was completed 18 months ago, which reinforces the area on the east coast.  In the area between the Shannon Estuary and Cork, there are a number of 220 kV stations and some line work that currently has full planning permission and is under construction.</p></speech>

It is important for public confidence and public information that this engagement continues at every level.  I wish to take it a step back to before the consultation period and the very formation of the Grid25 strategy, as well as its strategy.  I understand this was adopted in 2008.  The witnesses have spoken in general about the need for this grid and investment in order to keep the lights on, and it is also good for jobs.  These are generalities that we can all understand and they sound very good, but they are not convincing the public.  This is where I see much of the problem.  We must get back to the justification for this investment in the first instance, and it must be demonstrated clearly by EirGrid why the strategy is needed.</p><p>  In this regard, is the investment based on growth figures from 2006 to 2008?  It seems fairly logical to think that the economy was booming at that time and there was a much higher demand then than now, as we are in a slump or recession, despite strong signs of recovery.  Has the strategy been re-evaluated to analyse the immediate need for the grid and future requirements?  In other words, has the strategy been updated?  It is a very important question for public information and I am interested to hear the views of the delegation.</p><p>  Before going to consultation, any reasonable person would expect that a full cost-benefit analysis of all technologies, including overhead, underground, alternating current and direct current would have been carried out and readily available.  Has that cost-benefit analysis, including full life-cycle analysis of all extraneous costs, been done?  I am sure the delegation has read the committee's discussions in which the concerns of communities were expressed.  It is not just the cost of constructing the line, as there is an additional cost for legal proceedings or challenges in the courts, etc.  Are these taken into account in the full cost-benefit analysis?  That is necessary in order to gain public confidence.</p><p>  There must be more specific details.  The delegation mentioned the North-South interconnector and how the cost-benefit analysis used a factor of three with regard to cost.  I am from Waterford and one of the proposed lines would go right through the county.  There is an existing corridor in the form of the N25.  If a DC cable were put along the route, what would be the cost?  I am sure the cost would be smaller if there were no land access issues, because we already have a public highway.  These are the kinds of specific detail that should be put on the table so people can clearly see and understand them.  This should happen before the next step - where EirGrid is now - in establishing overhead lines.  The public cannot understand why we have arrived at that stage without full consideration of the cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>  I have some criticisms of the consultation stage.  We have heard from groups around the country that it seems EirGrid is ticking boxes and going through the motions as meetings are being held.  In County Waterford it is proposed that a line will go right through from west to east, but there is no public office there.  The people of the county find that very strange.  If EirGrid is talking about real engagement, surely it should address basic issues of access to information, and I recommend that it does so.</p><p>  It was mentioned in the opening statement that EirGrid has no vested interest in any particular technical solution.  Is that correct, or does EirGrid have a vested interest in building a line at the smallest cost?  I understand that is the policy, and if that is so, it is clear that EirGrid has a vested interest in building the line at least cost, which would utilise overhead lines.</p> <p>There is a conflict there and we must clarify that, in the interests of public information.</p><p> My final question relates to the UG.  The witness showed the EMF fields on the various areas and I note the 400 kV AC underground cable is included.  Why is the DC not demonstrated?  I understand it has much less EMF.  That is, as the witness said, possibly the only technically feasible underground solution for long distances.</p></speech>

The first question was about Grid25 and the fact that it was published in 2008, at a time when the economy was very different from the economy we have today.  The Deputy is correct about that.  As we take each project forward it is re-evaluated with the best up-to-date information.  While Grid25 was a strategy that dealt with the entirety of the grid over a number of years, as we take that down to project level, such as, for example, the Grid Link project mentioned by the Deputy, we study it in the context of the best information we have available.  In addition, at each of the stage gates throughout the project we re-evaluate it with better, more up-to-date information if we have it.</p></speech>

This is generalities again, but is that specific information available to the public?</p></speech>

In terms of our projections of demand growth, every year we publish what is called the All Island Generation Capacity Statement, which contains our view on demand growth for the next ten years.  The most recent one was published last January.  There is another under development and it will be published in January.  That contains our prediction of demand growth across the island.  It is based on ESRI data, usually, with scenarios on high and low.  That is publicly available information.  We use the most up-to-date information to evaluate and re-evaluate projects through it.  To the extent that we get better information either in terms of changes on the power system or changes in demand, we factor them in so we are sure that the projects remain robust and the best answer.</p><p>  The second question, if I understood correctly, was about the analysis of different options that should be carried out and presented on Grid Link before we get to the stage of route corridors.  I will ask my colleagues to discuss the analysis carried out on Grid Link and the assessment of the options that was published in the stage one report.</p></speech>

With the Grid Link project, we start with general study areas and constraint mappings that lead us to route corridors.  We publish a number of reports.  Within reports, for example, the stage one report which gets us to the point of corridors, we demonstrate the need for the project and how that was developed.  We also talk about the alternative technology types, for example, in the Grid West project there are technical reports and summaries on consideration of alternatives.  Again, they are developed and continually evolved through the stages of the project.  When we produce another report for the next step in the process, the need would again be addressed and the analysis and consideration of alternatives would continue.  It is an ongoing process.</p><p>  We must bring a real project to the public.  Rather than saying we have a problem with the grid, we must bring a project that can be understandable so we get to a point where it is understood that we need to link the points from Cork via Wexford up to Dunstown in Kildare.  Therefore, it is a project that is understandable.  We must then bring through the roadmap we designed to deliver on that piece of infrastructure.  It starts at quite an early stage in the process and it is beholden on us, as the Deputy points out, to explain the work that has gone before.  We attempt to do that in our stage one report and every report subsequent to that.</p></speech>

The public cannot understand why a route would not be taken on a public corridor, such as a motorway or a national road.  That is not dealt with anywhere in the stage one report.  EirGrid goes across country.  It dismisses it and moves on.  Unless EirGrid practically and specifically carries out a cost-benefit analysis on the options that are available for undergrounding, it will be very difficult to secure public confidence.  That is the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Slye" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400008#H00700"><p>That is something we definitely see coming through in the consultation process.  There is a desire for greater information on the costs of undergrounding.  A suite of studies was carried out by us and the independent commission on the north-south one but, as the Deputy points out, there are specifics associated with each of the projects.  That is one of the themes we see coming through and we are acutely conscious of it.  When the consultation closes we will look at how best we can address that and respond to it.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy that it is causing some concern among the public.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the consultation process and a perception in some quarters that we were just ticking boxes.  That is absolutely not the case.  This is a huge programme.  Each of the projects are massive infrastructural investments in their own right and we have a huge consultation engagement process in place.  The purpose of it is to consult and engage with the communities.  We continue to learn from that process and we continue to seek to improve it.  The comments and suggestions we get here will also feed into that.  We are still in the consultation and listening phase on Grid Link.  I hope we will be back before the committee some time early next year to talk about, perhaps, what was a difficult consultation phase but the improvements that were made to address the concerns raised through that consultation process.  However, we are still in that process and still listening to the concerns.  In fairness to the people who have not yet had an input, we have extended the process to 7 January next.  We must get all that feedback.  I assure the Deputy we are aware of those themes and not immune to them.  We are acutely conscious of the need to ensure this is done properly.</p><p>  The Deputy raised the question of vested interests.  We want to get the best solution.  We are charged with delivering a safe, secure, reliable and economical grid, with due regard for the environment.  Whatever is the best solution that fits that requirement and meets the needs of the electricity system and the people of Ireland is what we are seeking.  The phrase "least cost technically acceptable" is one that is used largely with regard to how people are charged for access to the grid.  It is an engineering term around that.  What we are seeking is the best solution.  Ultimately, we must take it through two independent bodies, the energy regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to get it approved, so we have no vested interest in one technology over another.  We are just seeking the best answer, albeit that it can sometimes be hard.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy asked why a DC cable was not on the EMF A5 brochure.  I will ask John Fitzgerald to comment on that.</p></speech>

All of these fields are 50 Hz fields.  A DC field is a zero frequency field.  This was developed in response to questions and queries on the DC EMF.  The fields that are directly above the east-west interconnector cable are of the order of 50 &micro;T at zero Hertz.  That is the nature of the fields at full load.  The reason some of these are different is that we tried to be true to what they are.  The overhead transmission lines are typically away from public areas whereas underground cables are typically in public roads.  DC cable is predominantly in the road where possible.  The Deputy mentioned the N25.  Obviously that is a public space so the general public could be in close proximity to it rather than if it is in a field.  That is why they are set out.  We could put it on it, but we would need a caveat to say that it is a zero Hertz field.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400008#H01000"><p>I welcome the representatives from EirGrid and welcome the opportunity to have this discussion.</p> <p>Yesterday the committee held a discussion with EirGrid's chairperson elect but I was unable to attend.  Two weeks ago we met a number of campaigning groups from across the State and many genuine concerns were raised.  I have also attended public meetings, received e-mails and been in contact with people who live along the proposed corridors and routes and people who are concerned about the impact the projects will have on the landscape and built heritage.  People are also concerned about potential health risks.  Despite what EirGrid says, there will be an impact on the environment and the value of land and property.  People have a range of issues and concerns about the matter but I will park them for a second to deal with the immediate priority of the consultation process.</p><p> I believe the consultation process is flawed for a number of reasons.  The CEO has said that EirGrid does not have a vested interest and he might be correct.  However, EirGrid has a very clear policy objective in the methodology used for all of the various projects, including the Grid Link project.  We have not held a genuine consultation process on the methodology and whether it will be overground or underground.</p><p> I have read the Stage 1 report and know that EirGrid plans to use overhead power lines and pylons in all of the areas, especially for the Grid Link project.  We have received different and often slick presentations from EirGrid that stated its nuanced positions.  EirGrid representatives have used very clever terminology when they have spoken to the media.  We have received different information or certainly I have when we have met EirGrid representatives one to one.  For example, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> published an article that quoted senior company executives as saying that EirGrid had no objection to the project going underground.  It also quoted EirGrid's transmission project manager as saying:<blockquote>We are not anti-underground.  As part of the assessment of the project we will look at it.  We look at cabling, we look at undergrounding &ndash; we must consider alternatives.</blockquote>That gave public perception that EirGrid is genuine about examining the use of undergrounding.</p><p> Last week, briefing sessions were held for Oireachtas Members and I met EirGrid representatives who clearly stated that undergrounding is not an option for the Grid Link project that covers the south and south east.  They said that it was not technically possible.  They said that were it to be used, it would only be over short distances of a maximum of 15 km across the entire grid and State.  That is its maximum limit for underground AC cables.  The perception given to the public and us varies.  EirGrid must be clear and honest with people.  It must confirm whether undergrounding is suitable for the projects.  If undergrounding is unsuitable, then we can have a political debate on alternatives, funding and so on.</p><p> EirGrid's argument has a credibility problem.  Mr. Slye has said the underground option would be between three and three and half times more expensive.  In 2007, EirGrid launched the North-South interconnector project and said it was 21 times more expensive.  EirGrid also said it was not technically possible, yet the international expert commission contradicts its statement and claims the project is a viable alternative.  Either EirGrid was wrong then or it is wrong now.  Which is it?  I want an answer.  The public will need to know that information to make up their minds on the issue.</p><p> The CEO has said a number of converter sites and stations will be needed if DC cables go underground and that these could take up the size of the Croke Park and so on.  How many pylons will be stretched across the State?  What will be the average size of pylons?  I understand the pylons could be up to 43 m high.  The CEO said he would not mind living next to them but many people do mind.  Many people are concerned about the visual intrusion and the nature of pylons.  It is okay to cite a need for a number of converter stations.  What about the number of pylons that will stretch across the countryside?  Pylons will pass through the Comeragh Mountains in my county of Waterford.  The erection of pylons in the Comeragh Mountains is a sore and contentious issue for the people who live in Waterford.  Why is the project necessary?  Is there a possibility that the electricity generated will be exported and not for domestic use?</p></speech>

I shall try to deal with the issues he raised.  His first question was on the consultation process and, if I understood him correctly, the assessment of the underground option for each of the projects.  Let me take the North-South project first.  We carried out a detailed technical analysis of the undergrounding option and commissioned a report by the international firm, PB Power.  The report was updated this year and we have published the results.  The Government commissioned an independent expert panel to examine the costs and case for undergrounding.  It was the Government that came up with the factor of three for the undergrounding option.  As part of the assessment of the project, undergrounding has been extensively evaluated by us and the independent committee that examined the option.</p><p>  Let me use the Grid Link project as the next example.  The project was mentioned because it is in Senator Cullinane's area.  It was also mentioned by Deputy Coffey.  At the start of the process we examined the matter and assessed different options, including undergrounding using the HVDC technology.  We ruled it out and confirmed that in the Stage 1 report on the project.</p><p>  Notwithstanding, the report that followed a consultation process and the comments and feedback received here earlier, it is apparent to us, and as various Deputies mentioned earlier, that there is a need for further information on the undergrounding option for the different projects.  That is one of the themes that came through on the Grid Link project, notwithstanding that consultation on the project has not closed.  We need to examine how we can best address the matter.</p></speech>

It is either going to be considered or it is not going to be considered.  Is it true that EirGrid will only consider short patches of undergrounding with a maximum of 15 km?  Is that EirGrid's official position?  Mr. Slye said he understood the need for more analysis of the costs and so on and accepted that the project is three or three and a half times more expensive.  Was EirGrid wrong in 2007 when it claimed that the project would be 21 times more expensive?</p></speech>

They have very different characteristics and uses.  Perhaps we have not been good enough at explaining the differences but I will articulate them.</p><p>  With regard to AC technology, all of the grid is AC.  All of the power generated in the generators located around the country is AC power, as is every single part of the power that goes through the transmission and distribution systems, flows into every home and is used for all the appliances.  The grid has an alternating current of 50 Hz.</p><p>  One can underground the voltage that we are talking about.  With a backbone transmission of 400 kV, one can underground short sections of AC.  One cannot technically underground the lengths we are talking about for any of the projects, be they North-South, Grid West or Grid Link.  The lengths are far beyond what is technically possible to underground using AC technology.  The longest AC 400 kV cable in the world is in Tokyo but it is in a large purpose-built tunnel that stretches from the outskirts to the heart of the city.  No-one else in the world has built anything even close to that length.  In London, one cable just short of 20 km has been built in a tunnel.</p> <p>That is what is possible in terms of the technology.  The amount we can put underground is dependent on two things, one of which is the specifics of the circuit.  A line from Carrick-on-Shannon to west Mayo, which is what Grid West is, has a different set of characteristics from a line from Meath to Tyrone.  The part of the network it is in is very different, as are its characteristics.  That dictates how much we can put underground on a specific circuit.  There are technical limits.  There is a system-wide limit on the overall amount of cable of this type due to issues such as harmonics that arise with large amounts of cable on the system.  That is the situation in respect of AC cables.  For any specific individual project, we look to see whether it is being developed as an AC overhead line and whether there are specific sections that should be underground for reasons of special scenic beauty.  We will look to see if it is appropriate to put it underground.  That requires a compound at each end where we come down off the towers.  There is a compound with a cable line interface and it goes underground for a number of kilometres before coming back up.</p><p> The other technology is called high-voltage direct current, HVDC, technology.  It is a different technology, using direct current, and is different from the power that comes out of the all the generators in our transmission system and is used in our appliances.  We need large converter stations to convert the power in our grid into this other form of power and to transmit it over cable.  The advantage of DC is that it can be transmitted by cable over long distances, and that is primarily why it was developed - to link transmission grids, typically undersea, over long distances.  That is its origin and that is largely where it is deployed today.  It was deployed in the east-west interconnector, connecting Meath to Wales.  It requires large converter stations on each side.  This requires putting in a cable and transmitting it over large distances.  Inserting it into the middle of a grid means it has a different set of characteristics and uses different technology from an AC connection between two points.  There are significant technical limitations to using HVDC in the middle of an AC grid.  We can use undergrounding for short sections of AC without materially changing the fundamentals of the solution being deployed, but changing to DC introduces a whole range of technical issues to the solution, notwithstanding the cost issue, which the independent commission pointed out was a factor of three.</p><p> Sometimes we are not good enough at explaining the difference between the two underground options.  To go for these long projects underground means adopting and inserting this new and different technology into the middle of the grid, as distinct from short lengths, which can be done as part of the AC grid.  I hope that explains the difference between the two and the nuances, or what is perceived to be nuance, of our position on it.</p></speech>

Among everyone who has spoken, one of the themes is a desire for more information about the underground options.  The consultation is still open and there was a debate in the D&aacute;il last night.  We must reflect on it and work out how to provide the information or ensure it gets to people and respond to the theme of the consultation.  We are acutely conscious that it is one of the things coming through.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane asked a question about exports.  Of the projects under discussion - Grid25, the north-south interconnector, Grid West and GridLink - none is connected with the renewables export initiative that is part of the intergovernmental agreement negotiated between the Government here and the Government in the UK.  They are completely separate.</p></speech>

It is important to continue to tease out the issues.  There are two aspects to what we are dealing with, the first of which is the need for infrastructure and the second of which is the question of where infrastructure goes.  One does not need to be an expert to know that pylons do not look nice.  Pylons have a downside from the point of view of visual amenity and tourism.</p><p>  There is broad agreement that we need infrastructure and the case can be made for how to build up the grid so that we have a proper secure energy supply and to address the deficit, particularly into the west and in the area I live, which is Mayo.  That is the idea of Grid West.</p><p>  We can talk about consultation and use words that are clich&eacute;s because we trot them out so often.  We are not getting to the point.  The EirGrid presentation states that overhead lines remain the best solution at 400 kV.  The EirGrid witnesses are the experts and are telling us this is the best solution.  Sometimes we get confused between what is an option and what is not.  An environmental statement examines the environmental impact underground and overground.  Different options exist.  Committee members will not be electricity experts or health experts and we are trying to do our best for the people who elect us.  For GridWest, I would like to see EirGrid set out the options from the technical, environmental, visual amenity and tourism, energy security and<b></b>accessibility points of view.  We should hear the pros and cons of each option for overground and underground.  This should include running a DC line from Moygownagh to Flagford.  What is the downside to that and what are its costs?  The advantage is that we will not have to look at pylons in what is an attractive area.  EirGrid is not giving people the options.  In respect of the Corrib gas fields, we have learned to our cost in County Mayo what happens when experts come from outside.  Perhaps the nation has learned too.  EirGrid has already thought about this, and I do not want to detract from their expertise, but there are pros and cons in all the options.  The EirGrid representatives have not set out the pros and cons other than in generalities.  We need a document that explains the costs of putting a project underground and explains that we will lose out because a certain business will not be able to connect.  If a business wants to connect and we only have a DC line, this is what it will mean, with a different type of pylon.  EirGrid is not doing this.  We can talk about things in this meeting but we need to see the options set out in a paper document.  It is a complex matter but it can be set out for people.  We will accept EirGrid's points about a constraint on the AC line and the fact that we cannot put more than 15 km underground on the network.  If we had point-to-point DC cabling, what would we lose out on?  What are the cost implications?  It can be called a cost-benefit analysis or whatever, but it should be set out to people.</p> <p>People see the need, but they differ on the detail.  Mr. Slye has said it is three times more expensive.  I ask for a paper document setting out the options to let people see the upsides and the downsides.  EirGrid is in a position to do this and it is its job to do so.</p></speech>

There is not much with which I could disagree.  One of the things coming through in the consultation process and, as I said, the comments here is the need for more detail around the underground option, in particular, for the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  As I said, it has been studied in depth for the North-South project, but for the Grid West and Grid Link projects, the detail provided as part of the reports - the stage 1 reports - which looked at a number of options, including HVdc, does not seem to be sufficient or adequate to address the appetite among the public to understand all of the issues involved.  Despite what has been a huge effort on our part in the consultation process, it obviously has not met that need and we need to recognise this.</p><p>  The consultation on Grid Link is ongoing.  We will come back to people very soon after the process is closed and articulate how we will deal with all of the concerns expresed.  As I said, I hope we will be invited back by the committee early in the new year to talk about the changes we have made to all of the processes to address all of the concerns expressed, perhaps look back on what has been a difficult consultation process around large-scale and very important infrastructure and talk about how that feedback has been incorporated.  I take the Deputy's comments on which we will reflect.  They are very sensible and we will-----</p></speech>

They are very busy people who are trying to do a day's work and make sense of this issue.  I welcome Mr. Slye who has apologised for not providing the material for us in advance.  He has apologised a number of times for the way EirGrid has got the consultation process wrong.  Will it not go back to basics?  I have been a member of the committee since 2007 and saw what happened in the case of the North-South project and know what stage it is at.  Quite frankly, EirGrid is going nowhere with it and the cost will be huge.</p><p>  I have been to the control centre in Dublin twice with the committee.  It is a very impressive building and much good work is done there where it diverts power.  During the height of the Celtic tiger years I never heard any alarm bell or saw flashing amber lights indicating that power was going to be switched off.  Will EirGrid be honest with the people?  That is very important at this point, given the threat of an outage before Christmas.  It should stop using the new mantra - keep the lights on, or ensure the lights are kept on, which is total nonsense.  Those involved in EirGrid have not engaged and it is time for them to get down and dirty with the people, stand in their kitchens, take off the suits, put on the wellies and go into farmyards to talk to the people instead of talking over and at them.  They have told us about all of the meetings held and the consultations they have had at race meetings, marts and such places.  These are not the places in which people want to discuss with EirGrid.  If people are at the mart, they want to do business - to sell or buy an animal - and if they are at the races, they want to enjoy themselves.  I am being serious.  EirGrid is making a mockery of the issue.</p><p>  Mr. Slye went on national television and spouted a lie about an advertisement carried in the <i>Dungarvan Leader</i>.  It was not an advertisement and he apologised off air to the people in the audience after the programme.  I want him to apologise at this committee.  EirGrid has to become involved.  How did it pick the study area?  Where was the consultation about which Mr. Slye talked?  He talked about all of the meetings EirGrid held and all of the feedback received.  What was the feedback?  Why was Cork excluded and did the study area not travel out to sea and around to County Wexford?  Who chose the study area?  In the eyes of the people, all of this is underhand and they are very annoyed and becoming even more annoyed by the lack of engagement.  </p><p>  I met Mr. Slye this day last week in Buswells Hotel when he told me that he would get back to me within a couple of days to arrange a meeting with ten people, but I had said 20 people in a dignified meeting.  He does not attend public meetings, although he said he did and wanted to confine the meeting to ten people.  However, I have not heard one word from him since.  There is no engagement with us either.</p><p>  EirGrid must build trust.  We need to keep the lights on, but it should stop the untruths and answer questions.  Senator David Cullinane asked Mr. Slye twice if EirGrid was wrong in 2007 and 2008 when it stated it would be 20 times more expensive and then ten times and seven times.  It is now three times more expensive.  Can EirGrid admit it was wrong and that it made mistakes?  It should empathise with the people.</p><p>  Yesterday the chairman designate of EirGrid said he would not like to live beside a pylon.  He had an outing yesterday, but Mr. Syle is having a more high powered one today.  These projects are stuck in the mud where they will stay and sink.  EirGrid will not have to underground them because they will be buried.  I only hope some of those involved in EirGrid will not be buried with them.  I do not mean anything bad by this.  The projects are going nowhere; this is a mess.  </p><p>  EirGrid saw what had happened in the economy and how the bankers, regulators and politicians had got away with everything.  It thinks it can in a cavalier way ride roughshod over the people.  Will it consult meaningfully, engage and stop using highfalutin language which I do not understand about HDdv and so on to confuse people?  It should be up-front and honest.</p><p>  At some of its engagements EriGrid told us we would not have power in Clonmel.  Deputy Ann Phelan said yesterday that people in counties Carlow and Kilkenny had been told it would not supply some industries there.  Mr. Slye has said clearly that it will not connect with wind farms.  It is all a big game played by big business and EirGrid is part of it.  Obviously, it will be privatised and the profits will go into somebody else's pocket.  The public is not ready for this and will not accept it.  I am a Teachta D&aacute;la, a messenger of the people, and giving EirGrid the message loud and clear.  </p><p>  Will Mr. Slye answer the questions asked?  If he only answers one question, will he answer the one Senator David Cullinane asked him twice, that is, did EirGrid get it wrong when it stated it would be 20 times more expensive, then eight times and seven times?  Now the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who seems to be EirGrid's chief spokesperson is saying it would be three times more expensive.  Will Mr. Slye come clean with the people?</p><p>  EirGrid received an award from Engineers Ireland for the technology used in bringing the interconnector across the sea.  Why will it not consider that option in my area and not be selfish?  Why will it not bring it along the sea from County Cork to County Wexford, given the novel expert technology used for which it has received awards?  EirGrid is not codding me or anybody else.  Will it, please, answer the question as to whether it had got it wrong.  Did Mr. Slye tell a lie on television about the advertisement carried in the <i>Dungarvan Leader</i>?  The newspaper is published outside my area but comes into my parish.  EirGrid did not advertise; there was an editorial in the newspaper.  Mr. Slye told the many watching that television programme that EirGrid had advertised in that newspaper and I want him to withdraw that statement.</p></speech>

Deputy Mattie McGrath has said he was in the control centre a few times and that there were never amber lights flashing.  Our whole existence is dedicated to ensuring there are no amber lights and that the lights stay on.  I know it is trite to say it, but it is incredibly important.  It is only when the lights go out that people realise just how important it is.  If there is a threat to supply for whatever reason, that is a huge barrier to business, business coming into the country and investment.  That very point was echoed by Mr. Barry O'Leary of IDA Ireland recently.  We take our job of keeping the lights on incredibly seriously and will continue to do so.  We have a large number of people dedicated to this task.</p></speech>

As I indicated earlier, we probably have not been good enough at explaining the detailed engineering difference between what are two very different technologies and how they are used in the grid.  I think we need to get better at trying to explain that to people.  AC and DC have very different characteristics and uses and different advantages and disadvantages.  I accept the Deputy's point that it can be confusing at times.  The onus is on us to ensure we explain it properly.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to profiteering and privatisation.  EirGrid is owned by the Government and the Government has been explicit in stating that the networks will remain in State ownership.  In any event, we are only the operator of the grid.  We do not own it; we do not make profits from the assets that are built.  Choosing one solution over another does not change the bottom line.  We act only in the interests of the State and the people on the island.</p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of wind farms and the export for sale of renewable energy.  All I can do is reiterate my earlier comment that none of the projects in Grid25 is associated with or will connect any of the wind-based generation that is being developed under the renewables export programme, which is part of the intergovernmental agreement being negotiated currently between this Government and that of the UK.  They are separate from that.</p><p>  The Deputy's final question - I apologise if I missed a question earlier - was about the multiple of times for an AC solution versus a DC solution.  The figure of a factor of three is not just our number but the number arrived at by the independent commission.  In the early stages, the independent commission reviewed - this is available in their report - all of our previous reports and acknowledged that they were sound and robust but that technology had moved on in the period since those reports were produced.  The reports to which the Deputy referred were reviewed by the independent commission and was validated by them as robust analysis, notwithstanding the fact that technology had moved on in the intervening period.  In recognition of that we had PB Power update the cost in our report and we published that earlier this year.  All of that information - the earlier reports and the report of the independent commission, including the commentary by the Independent Commission on our analysis - are available  on our website for anyone to read.  I am not giving our view of it; I am giving members the view of the independent commission.</p></speech>

I have said this 20 times, ten times, seven times at committee meetings.  What is wrong with W R O N G?  The man who never made a mistake never made anything.  This is why he continues in fooling the people.  Mr. Slye must admit he got it wrong.  That is the reason we need total independent analysis now.</p><p>  This year many of us were at the National Ploughing Championships in Ratheniska in County Laois.  A ten-acre sterile area was maintained under lines that are there at present.  EirGrid did not want tents, ploughing with horses or machinery, or people underneath their lines.  Why was that?</p></speech>

However, technology and the associated costs have moved on, so these costs would be the incorrect now.  A multiple of 25 would be incorrect now, but at the time it was sound analysis of the situation as it pertained at that time.  That has been backed up by the independent commission, and that opinion is available on the EirGrid website.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the sterilisation of ten acres around the site of the National Ploughing Championships.  I will ask my colleagues if either of them were aware of that.</p></speech>

I was at the National Ploughing Championships and there were various events adjacent to the existing 400 kV line that ran through the site.  The main entrance was at the point at which the line crossed the site.  The only work that had been done was in relation to the height of the equipment used for log chopping, as EirGrid needed to check for limits of close proximity to avoid electrocutions and to ensure that high equipment was a safe distance away from the line, as it would be from any power line, whether it be a 400 kV line, a low-voltage line or a 38 kV line.</p></speech>

Technology has evolved how many times since that evaluation was done.  I imagine the difference in cost would now be much less than a factor of three.  By the time EirGrid goes to break ground, the cost of the two options will nearly be on a par.  I think Mr. Slye has admitted that himself.  He will not say the word "wrong", but that is what is wrong with the thing.  EirGrid cannot be wrong.</p></speech>

As the Deputy and others have pointed out, we were the people who developed and implemented the east-west interconnector, one of the best examples of modern HVDC technology anywhere in the world.  We are intimately familiar with its capabilities and what it can be used for.  Because we deliver it, we are completely comfortable operating and using it in the right circumstances.  Notwithstanding that, we also went out to international consultants to update the cost information.  In fact we have in-house some of the foremost experts, the people who are most familiar with modern HVDC technology.  We are at the edge of that technology and we understand it.  As I said earlier in response to a question, as we progress projects we always look for the best and most up-to-date information, including updated forecasts of demand and economic growth, changes in project needs and what is happening on the system, and also progress in technology.  At each stage we examine what has changed in terms of the project, the need or the technology, and we continually keep these things under review.</p></speech>

Obviously this is a very emotive and contentious issue, but I recognise that it is very important.  We all recognise the importance of updating and expanding the national grid.  EirGrid has an extremely important job to do, but we, as public representatives, have the job of representing the people who have elected us.  The people who have elected us do not agree with the process and unfortunately there is no acceptance of the manner in which this is happening.  I am speaking about the public consultation process for the North-South interconnector.  Mr. Slye stated that it was essential that the process be ongoing and that the issues would be taken into account, but realistically that did not happen for the North-South interconnector following the collapse of the oral hearing in 2010.  The public consultation process has been and gone and been and gone again and EirGrid has not addressed the main issue, which is the undergrounding of the cables.  If this issue had been addressed there would have been a possible underground route the second time the public consultation came around.  I know Mr. Slye has raised issues, such as the need for EirGrid personnel to get on the land and need for environment impact assessments, but that needs to be done for the overhead lines again.  I do not have any questions.  I think Deputy Mulherin hit the nail on the head.  I acknowledge that EirGrid did offer to do the cost-benefit analysis along one of the overhead routes, but this process covers much more than just the North-South interconnector.</p> <p>We need to see the issues Mr. Slye and others have raised, including the health aspect of the matter, the cost analysis, the visual impact and the impact on land, in black and white.  Deputy Mulherin hit the nail on the head when she said we have not yet seen it in black and white.  Many people, including those involved in the North-South interconnector and the other proposed routes, would be happy if that were facilitated.</p></speech>

There has been a detailed analysis of the underground option in that case.  We conducted a detailed technical analysis that included an examination of a route.  The independent commission, which was appointed by the Government, also reported on the underground option.  In the cases of the other projects, questions are being asked about the detail of the information about undergrounding that is available.  It is being suggested that such studies were not done.  We need to look at that.</p></speech>

No underground route was given to people along with the overground routes that were proposed.  That is the problem here.  If this issue had been raised and addressed, there would have been a possible underground route, even if it would have cost 20 times as much.  Perhaps some of the proposed route could have been overground and some of it could have been underground.  It was not there.  That is the issue.  Many people are angry and annoyed that hundreds of thousands of euro were spent on oral hearings over five or six years without an underground option being offered at the end of that process.  That needs to be addressed.  We need to see that happen as we move forward because it has not happened to date.  It may happen in the cases of the other routes that are now being proposed, but it has not happened in the case of the North-South interconnector.  Many people do not agree with this process because they were not presented with an underground route.  The main issue was not addressed.</p></speech>

An underground route was considered as part of the PB Power report that was developed in 2009.  The report examined issues like landscape types and how many times such a route would have to cross a road.  That was all costed and assessed.  The report in question was published at that time and has been updated.  The costings were updated earlier this year.  That report continues to feed into the process.  It will form part of any planning application that is submitted as part of the North-South project.  The work that was done regarding an underground cable route, at the time when corridors were being considered as part of the development of this infrastructure, was similar to the work that would have been done for an overhead line.  It formed part of the PB Power report, which was open for public comment and has been made available.  We will take on board again what Deputy Mulherin said about the need to do this in a manner that makes it easier for people to understand and directly equate to.  We will take that feedback on board.  The work has been done.  The work is still there.  It is available and will form part of the planning application for the North-South project.</p></speech>

If that is happening, it is not coming across to people on the ground.</p></speech>

Deputy Mulherin made a number of useful points.  She suggested that a comparison between the overground and underground options should be laid out clearly in front of people.  If that had been done in advance of the consultation process, people would have been able to compare all the options and the costs associated with them.  The consultation process would have meant much more in such circumstances.  People could have referred to that comparison when offering their opinions.  The problem I have is that we are now a bit behind as a consequence of the failure to do this.</p><p>  I wonder whether the use of the road network as part of the underground or overground options, or a combination of those options, has been examined carefully.  It could involve having to run these lines a little out of the way.  Has careful consideration been given to that possibility?</p><p>  I was contacted recently by a concerned person in Midleton who has a son with autism.  He is hypersensitive to certain noises and anything like that.  It is not a question of being 30 m or 40 m away from one of these lines.  People will have to cross underneath them, stand underneath them or drive underneath them.  Have the effects of one of these lines on individuals like this person's son been assessed?</p><p>  The visual impact of these towers must be considered given that many of them are the same height as the Spire in O'Connell Street.  If someone asked me whether I would like one of them to be built 30 m from me, I would definitely say "No".  Anyone who is honest would say "No".  I do not accept that one would look at what will benefit the country.  If someone was proposing to run one of these lines through one's family farm that is in one's history, one would have problems with that.</p><p>  Will EirGrid have any additional powers to access these lands?  Will it have more powers than the NRA or Bord G&aacute;is?  Will it have any additional powers when it is trying to commandeer lands to develop these lines across a certain area?</p><p>  When Mr. John Fitzgerald was speaking about the map I am now holding, he said it was a like-for-like comparison.  I am a technician by trade.  I note the reference to the 400 kV underground cable in the document.  We can see the &micro;T effect in that case.  It relates to the effect of standing 30 m away from a 400 kV power line, rather than standing underneath it.  The comparison would be off the radar if one was standing underneath the line.  It would certainly be a hell of a sight more than what is being shown here.  It is very deceiving to see that.  A television emits a certain level of &micro;T.  We can see in the document how much a razor emits.  I ask people to imagine the emission one would encounter if one was standing underneath a power line while going about one's business, driving or otherwise.  The difference would be massive.</p><p>  I would like to ask about the company's communications with Members of the Oireachtas.  Is there any way we can use a special e-mail address or a special telephone line if we want to put forward ideas?  It would be very important for people here who are trying to make a further impact.  It would be helpful if a dedicated line of some description were made available.</p></speech>

Is the board satisfied with the process as currently carried out?

I have been watching the proceedings in my office for the past hour and a half.  I have a number of questions to which I want answers.  There are also a number of observations I wish to make.  Following the submission made by Deputy Michelle Mulherin, I believe the Minister would be agreeable to a cost benefit analysis of all three projects.  The Minister has said that it is not necessarily accurate to say that if the North-South Interconnector costs three times more to go underground that would be site-specific to Grid West.  Will EirGrid conduct an independent analysis of each of those projects?</p><p>  The witnesses repeatedly say EirGrid cannot go underground for long lengths.  Why is that the case?  Will EirGrid issue a full report as to the reasons in order that it can be reviewed independently by somebody outside of EirGrid on behalf of the committee?</p><p>  At all of the consultation processes that I attended, EirGrid continually denied this had anything to do with wind energy.  At each consultation process EirGrid said it has nothing whatsoever do with it.  When Mr. Fintan Slye was pressed on the issue he mentioned the wind for export.  The Grid West project is there to complement the wind energy sector.  </p><p>  Slogans which are selling points state that this is needed for balanced regional development.  We do not see balanced regional development outside of Dublin and the major cities here.  If we did, projects like this might be more palatable.  In my home town, EirGrid say we need the energy.  The largest user of electricity in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, is Arriva, formerly Shannonside, which uses more electricity than the whole of Castlebar.  It has installed its own biomass plant to deal with its needs, therefore it does not need the energy.  </p><p>  Mr. John O'Connor said he would not live beside a pylon.  Why should anybody be asked to live beside one, if he or se is not willing to do so?  Surely his words have damaged the EirGrid project.  I do not know if EirGrid understands the huge anger there is over this and the fact that people are getting mobilised on the issue.  The delays here will cost quite an amount.  In any cost benefit analysis are the costs of the delays being factored in?  </p><p>  The whole consultation process has been seriously flawed.  EirGrid should start again.  In my area, EirGrid sent out 10,000 letters that were never received.  All it wants to do is blame An Post while An Post said it never got the letters to send out.  To date, I have not got an answer as to where those 10,000 letters to households went missing.  When I get an answer to the following question, I may have to come back to it.  Who is funding this project?</p></speech>

I invite Ms Deborah Meghen to said a few words about routing along roads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deborah Meghan" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400015#Q00700"><p>When we look at routing power lines, we look at routing along roads.  As part of the Grid Link project one will notice that one or two of the corridors do, for sections, parallel along the M9.  As Deputy Ellis pointed out, the start and end points are slightly different to some of the roads and the routing principles in regard to the development of power lines is slightly different from that of a road.  With roads one is looking for low land to minimise cut and fill.  It is a different design process to that of an overhead powerline.  We are trying to reduce the visual impact.  Again, we look to different landscapes where we can look to absorb the powerline within that landscape.  Sometimes it is in the higher ground in the background in which one could screen existing powerlines.  Therefore, we must take into account all of the different types of routing principles.  The Deputy is correct - we look at the existing road network in respect of all our projects.  There are sections which parallel but usually for the full length the line is not suitable because of the different end points and different routing principles.  It is very much a different type of infrastructure.</p></speech>

We did that for the East-West Interconnector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fitzgerald" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400015#Q00900"><p>This comes back to another point made in regard to the EMF descriptions.  With underground HVDC we put them predominantly in the roads where we can as it gives easier access.  That is the practice.  On the East-West Interconnector, 90% of it on land in Ireland is adjacent to the public roads for that reason.</p><p>  Perhaps I can move on to the EMF question.  We have tried to represent it as one would encounter it.  Typically the pylons are not in public areas and would be at a remove of 20 m or 30 m.  The Deputy said that if it was underneath it would be off the radar.  It would not; it would be comparable to an underground AC cable.  Perhaps if one was standing underneath it might be 45 microtesla.  Depending on the loading of the line, the current on the line is what drives it, but even at full load, the maximum one will ever see on these lines if one was standing underneath them, would be about 40 to 50 microtesla which is a millionth of a tesla, which is the unit.  For the AC cable, it is probably the same-----</p></speech>

If one was standing underneath when one's car broke down or somebody was working there it is not comparing like for like with what Mr. Slye originally said.</p></speech>

We will take that feedback and reflect upon the brochure and the representation of the information.  That is good and helpful feedback.</p><p>  There was a question about hypersensitivity to autism which is caused by noise.  As part of the planning application we have to deal with any noise effects off the lines and comply with any regulations and to explain that.  That will be dealt with as part of the planning process which we have to deal with in a comprehensive manner.</p><p>  There was a question about additional powers that we may have in terms of access to lands.  Perhaps Ms Deborah Meghan will speak about them.</p></speech>

The power of the ESB to construct and build electricity lines at the varying voltages is based on the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927.  It is a way-leave power as opposed to the compulsory purchase order power which is traditionally used for road projects.  It is the right to place an electricity line across people's land.  This is an unusual power<i> per se</i> compared to what most people are used to dealing with in terms of roads and CPOs.</p></speech>

Should I interpret what has been said as that EirGrid will take that into special consideration when the lines are being decided?  Is EirGrid saying that if there is engagement from a family of a child with autism, it will give special consideration to that in its planning application?  In other words, will the pylon be placed farther away or removed due to that?</p></speech>

I do not know the specifics of the case to which the Deputy has referred.  However, we will make every effort to address such issues and will engage with the specific family in regard to its concerns and will make every effort to alleviate any concerns it has.

I hope this addresses that issue.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan asked whether we had employed consultants.  We have consultants employed across the Grid25 programme.  They assist us with the consultation process and the routing process and we use them for deep expertise in areas such as ecology and the like as we prepare planning applications and go out to consultation.  We discussed earlier the issue of the contract costs for each consultant but I am not in a position to provide information on how much we pay specific consultants.  That is a commercial matter between us and those consultants.  The Deputy also asked about our ongoing reporting to the board, so that is fully briefed on the Grid25 programme in general and specific projects, in particular the three projects most of this conversation has been about.  The EirGrid board has a specific committee, the grid infrastructure projects committee, established to ensure that there is monitoring and oversight of all of the projects and that EirGrid is up to date on where they are.</p><p>  In her contribution, Deputy Mulherin made some good suggestions on how to improve the consultation process.  We have put a consultation process of an unprecedented scale in place and have attempted to engage with people and communities across the affected regions.  We continually look for ways to improve that process.  I would encourage people to respond to the ongoing consultation, not just in terms of the specific questions asked but to put forward suggestions.  We will take on board suggestions on how to improve the process and will get back to people on their concerns.  At each stage of the project we reflect on how the consultation went and review it.  We will continue to do that and will continue to examine how we can improve our processes to meet the needs of communities.  We do that on a continual basis.</p></speech>

Mr. Slye has said EirGrid has a specific committee or sub-committee of the board that deals with grid infrastructure.  Did that committee ever engage with the people affected.  Has the committee ever sat down with the representatives of these communities and groups to hear what we have heard over the past month?  I am sure the members of the board are honest, decent people who have the best interests of the company at heart but have they have had engagement with people outside of the company, other than consultants, on this?</p></speech>

Earlier this year we were in Cork, Derry, Longford and Galway.  It has been out and has engaged with people.  Board members are acutely conscious of the scale of this project and the need to ensure we engage properly with the public and communities.  To that end, we continually review how we are doing.  I report to the board on that and update it.</p></speech>

Senator Kelly posed number of questions, the first of which concerned independent analysis for Grid West and Grid Link, in terms of the undergrounding option.  As I said earlier, we need to reflect upon what is coming back from this committee and on the debate in the D&aacute;il last night.  We also need to reflect on the commitments the Minister gave in terms of feedback in the context of how we can improve our consultation process and how to address the need for detailed information on the underground option.  This information was prepared by us and the independent commission on the North-South interconnector.  We need to look at how best we can deal with that information for the other two projects.  I take the message from this meeting and contributions of members that we need to do that.  We do it in a way that provides assurances as to its objectivity, balance and fairness.  I accept we need to reflect on this.</p><p> A question was asked referring to my earlier answer on a question on the difference between AC and DC and the comments I made about it not being possible to underground long lengths of AC transmission lines.  The question asked concerned whether that response could be verified externally.  This was the only conclusion of the independent expert panel report commissioned by the Government.  That report concluded it was not feasible to do the lengths envisaged in the North-South interconnector as an underground AC line.  That is clearly, emphatically and unambiguously stated in the independent expert commission report.  Therefore, the issue has been reviewed and externally verified.</p><p>  With regard to the interrelationship between Grid25 and renewable energy, in particular wind energy, I stated earlier that none of the projects in the Grid25 programme are connected with or have anything to do with the wind export projects, which are centred largely around the midlands.</p> <p>Those projects are designed to fall under the intergovernmental agreement currently being discussed between the Government and the Government in the United Kingdom.  However, as I outlined in my presentation at the start, GRID25 does facilitate the harnessing of renewable energy for domestic purposes.  The example was correctly quoted of the Grid West project.  While Grid West serves to reinforce the network around the west and in County Mayo, a key part of it is to harness the renewable resources and the wind farms along the western seaboard in Mayo that are planned and under development.  The comments on that were correct.  This renewable energy will serve domestic needs to meet our 2020 target of having 40% of electricity generated from renewable resources.  I reiterate that it is completely separate from the renewable export projects, which are being developed to serve and export to the United Kingdom market under an intergovernmental agreement.</p><p> There was a question around balanced regional development.  We take seriously our obligations to ensure there is a grid in place throughout the country.  Part of the commitment is to facilitate balanced regional development such that the infrastructure is in place to allow companies to invest, grow and provide jobs.  Given the fragile recovery we are in at the moment, we take that particularly seriously and we are particularly mindful of it.  In advance of the projects going out we engaged with many communities and, in particular, county councils.  There was a major desire among those constituencies to have infrastructure brought to areas which had in the past perhaps less than adequate infrastructure.  Part of the purpose of GRID25 is to address that need.  If a firm is investing in a particular area there are several factors, including access to water and labour, which go in to a siting decision.  Another factor near the top of the list is always the quality of secure affordable energy.  However, there are other factors which affect any decision.</p><p> There was the question about the statement by the chairman designate at this committee yesterday on living close to a pylon.  My understanding is that Mr. O'Connor indicated that he would not like to live within 50 m of a pylon.  Currently, we keep the pylons 50 m away from people's houses.  That is part of how we seek to route transmission lines.  When we are going over-ground we seek to route them and keep them-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor initially said that he would not like to live beside a pylon.  At some stage later on in the questioning he indicated the issue of the 40 m or 50 m distance.  It is important to give the correct interpretation of what happened yesterday.</p></speech>

As I said, we seek to keep pylons 50 m from people's houses and in the current projects we are considering that is the case.</p><p>  There was a question about who is funding the projects.  Ultimately, these projects end up on the transmission asset base, which is, ultimately, with the ESB.  They are funded over the long term by all electricity customers.  Those in the ESB are the people who pay, ultimately.  The projects involve capital outlay in the first instance and that is funded during the construction process.  For example, there is the cost of building the project and that is funded by the ESB, which actually builds the infrastructure.  Then, it transfers to what is called the transmission asset base and the ESB gets a rate of return which reimburses the company for the investment over several years.  Reference was made earlier to the fact that typically the projects are depreciated over 30 plus years.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

It was a general maildrop to over 200,000 homes.  We asked An Post to do the maildrop for us and to cover the entire study area.  Within that process an element of the study area, as Senator Kelly correctly noted, corresponding to approximately 10,000 letters, missed out on the maildrop.  We looked into it.  As soon as we found out about it we reissued the maildrop to that area.</p></speech>

He said the project was funded by direct payments from wind developers as well as the bills of the electricity users.  Could we get a breakdown of the figures relating to what the wind developers are paying towards this project?  Then we will know how much the billpayer will have to contribute.  Seeing as the billpayers are contributing, surely they have a right to reject or accept a pylon which they believe to be too close to their home or which could possibly devalue their property.  Is that not so?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, the Gird West project in particular facilitates the connection of several renewable energy projects on the west coast.  Those involved pay a portion of the costs.  I do not have the percentage before me today but we can get back to the committee on that.</p></speech>

There are very much depending on the committee to be the buffer between them and EirGrid and to try to exhaust all the possibilities that exist before we set the landscape with 43 m pylons.</p><p>  I am keen to move beyond the consultation process because it does not really matter how long we talk.  All that will come out of the consultation process is one question, that is, whether to underground or over-ground.  That will be the major and main theme of the EirGrid consultation process and this is the area on which we need to concentrate.</p><p>  Yesterday, I asked Mr. O'Connor if this was the main theme that comes out of the consultation process whether he would give the committee a commitment that EirGird would consider an independent cost benefit analysis.  That would allow us to consider this in an independent way in order that there might be some public acceptance of this project.  From where I am standing, there is zero public acceptance at the moment.  That is not because people want to be unreasonable for the sake of being unreasonable; they simply believe their concerns and fears are not being addressed.</p> <p>We really have to do this.  Mr. Slye has to take what Deputy Michelle Mulherin suggested on board.  He needs to set out for the public every option with its pros and cons, why it can or cannot be done.  Will Mr. Slye give us a commitment today to give us an independent cost-benefit analysis of overground versus underground cables?</p><p> This grid project will be of no benefit to the resurrection of the beet industry in County Carlow.  I want that addressed.  I also want the issue of childhood leukemia addressed.  Is EirGrid engaging with any oncologists to allay that particular fear?</p><p> EirGrid needs to issue a statement pointing out that this project has nothing to do with the project to export wind energy to the United Kingdom because that is in the mix and does not help the situation.</p></speech>

We did not get an answer from him on how close is close.  He said "maybe" 50 metres.  "Maybe" is not the best word to use when trying to reassure someone.  I advise Mr. Slye to read the Official Report of yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings.  I am disappointed that he has not already done so.  If the incoming chairman is not comfortable with what EirGrid plans to do, what is the minimum distance at which Mr. Slye would site a pylon?  If something does go wrong will EirGrid indemnify the people of Ireland against any potential damage?  When Mr. Slye says that it is three times more expensive to go underground than overground, is that after the route has been decided?  The incoming chairman did not answer this question yesterday.  Surely before EirGrid decides on a route it decides whether it is going underground or overground?  If it is going overground surely it would prefer fairly flat ground, whereas if it is going underground it would want ground that is easier to excavate.  The figure seems to change every day but the latest figure that Mr. Slye has come up with is that it is three times more expensive, when EirGrid has already chosen the route that is completely unsuitable for going underground.  When did EirGrid decide that it was three times more expensive?</p><p>  I am not the slightest bit shocked at what Mr. Slye says about commercial sensitivity.  This has been said to me several times, whether about Coillte or Roscommon County Council.  The only thing that surprises me is that a Government Deputy has a problem with it because I never see any of them rowing in behind me when I say that it is ridiculous that commercial sensitivity should be used as a cloak to cover up for something, when our job is to get this information and bring it back to the public.  I am delighted to see a Fine Gael Deputy who is upset about commercial sensitivity.  I hope they will be consistent across the board because before today that was not the case.</p></speech>

The part of the slide comparing the different sources of magnetic fields is the sort of thing that drives people mad.  I am a Deputy for Kildare South which means that the Grid Link project is the one of most interest to me.  The last line refers to the 400k VAC underground cable.  Everyone accepts that AC underground is not the best way.  That diagram is disingenuous.  There should be a figure to show what underground DC would be or else do not show it at all.  Many groups argue that AC underground will not necessarily work over a long distance.</p><p>  The reliability of the primary constraints identified and used for mapping by EirGrid is inconsistent in identifying different routes in different parts of the country.  Why is that?  Is EirGrid trying to identify primary constraints to match potential preferred routes?  Great Island in the south east has increased capacity but apart from short-term jobs provided during the construction of pylons, how does this assist job creation in the south east?  Is it not misleading to say that it will assist job creation in the south east when, rather than powering down to jobs and job creation there is too much power there, which EirGrid is trying to move away on the 400kV lines?</p><p>  There are two gas-powered electricity generating systems in Huntstown in Dublin, which I am led to believe do not generate power currently?  Why not?  Does Mr. Slye agree that this project is about bulk movement of electricity from one point to another?  EirGrid&rsquo;s forecasts for increased demand indicate only approximately 1.3% per annum expected growth in demand over the next seven years.  How then can Mr. Slye justify the huge investment in Grid25?  Where will the additional revenue be generated by EirGrid to pay for this expenditure?  Why do we import rather than export electricity when we have an interconnector and an excess of supply?  Is that a matter of cost?</p><p>  I agree with what others have said about consultation.  The point has been hammered home to day so I do not need to repeat it.  I believe that a cost-benefit analysis will happen.  It has to.  I and all my colleagues here today have called for it.  Five options for the grid link project are before us but they are all over ground.  We want EirGrid to give us a clear analysis of the difficulties involved in over and underground.</p><p>  The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, ENTSO-E, report of 2012, updated in 2013, stated that project 106 will build an interconnector from Dunstown near Kilcullen to Pentir in the UK with a possible third party involvement, a wind generator, to reduce the cost of shared infrastructure; project 107 from Great Island or Knockraha also indicates that an interconnector will be built, linking to France.  Will the potential development of the interconnectors at either end of the Grid Link project be factored into the cost of going underground?  Will property devaluation be considered in any cost-benefit analysis?  EirGrid imports electricity from the UK, based on half hourly pricing, using the HVDC interconnector which does not seem to cause any problems for the grid.  Why can we not use that elsewhere?</p></speech>

There are very few who would disagree.  Some might argue with it when we are reaching oversupply but I would be much more critical of under supply.  The benefits are not the problem.</p><p>  We need to learn from what happened in Rossport.  If it taught us anything it is that walking over people&rsquo;s concerns leads to project delays, major cost overruns and reputational damage for this country in respect of project development.</p> <p>If the situation in Rossmore teaches us anything it is that walking over the concerns of people leads to project delays, major cost overruns and reputational damage for the country in project development.  Like the delegate yesterday, I would not like to have a pylon within 100 m of my house.  It really annoyed people to hear the argument being made in a television debate that there was no evidence that house prices had been devalued because of the proximity of pylons or wind turbines.  It is a self-evident truth that house values are devalued if in close proximity to pylons and the opposite opinion should not be used as an argument.  </p><p> We should examine the actions of government rather than attack individual companies.  In the absence of a landscape management strategy from the Government, we will constantly be responding to the actions of individual companies.  We are allowing companies to take the initiative rather than the Government and telling companies what we want to do.  </p><p> I am astonished to hear that this work has nothing to do with wind energy production.  Does this mean that electricity generated using wind turbines will never travel on these lines?  Does it mean that other sometimes parallel lines will be used to carry power generated by wind energy?  I do not understand these things because I am not an engineer.  Ten years ago when I was a county councillor in County Leitrim I proposed that any road development should include a roadside service duct.  That motion was accepted by Leitrim County Council and presented to the then Government, the response of which was that it would be too expensive.  Would it still be as expensive today?  Is that not the strategic planning in which we need to engage for this and other projects?</p></speech>

She asked about the consultation process.  She referred to Deputy Michelle Mulherin's contribution and the analysis of placing lines underground as opposed to overground.  This is one of the themes emerging from the meeting, communities and the ongoing consultation process.  It was also raised during the D&aacute;il debate yesterday evening.  We need to reflect on the issue and work out how to provide the information for the public and communities in an objective, understandable and balanced way.  Once the consultation process has concluded, we will reflect on the issues raised and address that concern.  The consultation process is ongoing and was extended at the request of the committee.  We need to hear people's views.  As I said, we will be happy to come back at the conclusion of the process to articulate the changes we plan to make.  It is hoped it will be a conversation about the positive changes that will have come about from a difficult consultation process as a result of the feedback received from the committee and through the various channels used in the process.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan specifically asked about County Carlow and the sugar beet project.  The infrastructure being constructed across all of the projects will reinforce the grid and improve its ability to support industry.  On the question of the most appropriate way to connect a specific project such as looping into one of the lines under construction or running it from an existing sub-station which has been reinforced by the new infrastructure, it would depend on the economics of the project.  I would be happy to discuss the specific case with the Deputy in an offline setting.  This infrastructure reinforces and improves the grid and its ability to support new demand.  By way of context, there are 19 customers around the country who are connected directly with the transmission system.  They tend to be very large users of electricity or for whom a high quality supply is particularly important.  Otherwise, people tend to rely on the grid to provide power through the distribution system.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am using the sugar beet industry as a specific example in my community that if we support the project, we may be able to deliver jobs.  The community needs to know how this can be achieved by the project.  There is no point in Mr. Slye or me going to the community and asking about specific requirements.  If EirGrid wants to have the goodwill of the community behind a project such as this, people have to see the benefits.  If they do not see them, why would they want the project in the first place?  That is my argument.</p></speech>

I have noted in other contributions the need for EirGrid to improve communication of information on the specific details.

I spent 13 of those years involved in the specific field of EMF.</p><p>  This is an important issue because we are surrounded by electricity. Therefore, we are exposed to EMF, mostly during the day, and the issue of potential health effects is of public concern.  In the past 35 years literally thousands of studies have been published of the potential health effects of EMF on the human population.  A number of national and international expert panels organised by health or scientific agencies have examined the evidence in the body of studies available and they have all concluded that there is no cause and effect relationship between EMF and any health outcome.  More specifically, the World Health Organization has concluded following its in-depth review of the scientific literature that the evidence does not confirm the existence of health consequences from exposure to EMF.</p></speech>

Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan had several questions, including one as to whether power lines will be sited at a minimum distance from houses.  We do not locate those lines within 50 m of residences.  In the case of the North-South interconnector, for example, the planning application for which we are finalising, there is provision whereby no towers will be located less than 50 m from dwellings.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan also asked whether it was appropriate to use an overhead corridor for the assessment of an underground route.  I hope I understood the question correctly.</p></speech>

EirGrid, having chosen its route, is now saying it is three times more expensive to go that route.  That does not seem to be a logical approach.</p></speech>

In the case of the Grid Link project, for instance, we looked at all of the options, as set out in the stage 1 report, and concluded that an overhead line route was the most appropriate.  That is the genesis of the route corridors that have been put out to the public, which are overhead route corridors suitable for an overhead line route.</p></speech>

If we were to look in detail at an undergrounding option, we would not just assume that any of those overhead corridors would be the underground route.

There is a variation in the constraints when one looks at the different county development plans across the various projects.  We take on board all the feedback from those county development plans and input it into each of the projects.  As I said, there is perhaps a little consistency between some of the county development plans and how they apportion different landscape types, visual amenities and so on.</p><p>  We take all of those data on board and input them into our geographic information system, which is a multi-layered system that analyses all the different constraints.  These would include primary constraints such as, for instance, the Comeragh Mountains, Wicklow National Park, the Blackstairs Mountains, towns, special protection areas and so on.  Then we look at all the other layers of constraint below the primary.  In the case of the Grid Link project, we are talking about a data indexing system that has nearly 120 different layers of information and data that are inputted into the process of evaluating and identifying potential corridors to route power lines.  It is an open and transparent system.  All of the information on constraints mapping - where it comes from and how it is developed - are available in the stage one report.  In addition, the constraints reports that were published for both projects sought feedback and input as to how we should evaluate those constraints.  We also sought input, as part of the stage one report, on how we might evaluate the corridors.  It is an ongoing process and there is a huge amount of work and information available on it.</p></speech>

As we speak, that plant is coming on stream and I understand it is due to enter operation early in the new year.  Power from the plant will feed into the transmission system.  Obviously, the Grid Link project will also move some of that power around the country.  The project will also provide support and the highways of power to ensure that the grid right around the area will be reinforced and capable of handling the additional load which might arise as a result of a large industry that needs access to large amounts of power siting its operations there.  It serves the dual functions of the movement of generation out to load and supporting and reinforcing the grid in the area.</p></speech>

Deputy Ann Phelan referred to the possibility of a sugar beet plant being developed in Carlow.  This could be also developed in Kildare, one never knows.  If it were developed in those locations, it would not be able to access the 400 kV line because it is bulk transfer.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

This, in turn, supports and reinforces the grid in the area.  Typically, a specific industry would not connect to a 400 kV line.  It can do so but typically it would not.  There are many more 110 kV and 210 kV lines around and large industries would usually connect into these rather than a 400 kV line.  However, it provides a bulk in-feed that supports the entire area.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to Huntstown, which is near Finglas in north Dublin.  He is quite right in that there are two generating stations at this location.  I do not know if the stations are running today.  They bid in, as do all generators, regarding the price at which they are prepared to generate power.  What we do is select the most economic set of those generators on any given day in order to supply power.  Depending on the price they bid in, they would or would not run on any given day.  To be honest, I just do not know if they are running today.  Information on whether they are running is available through the Single Electricity Market Operator, SEMO, website.  After the fact, people can visit the website in order to discover what was the actual output of any of the generators available.  If there is a specific query, I can discuss the matter with the Deputy afterwards.  I am not sure whether I have fully answered his question.</p></speech>

The Deputy also inquired about growth forecasts.  When Grid25 was developed and published, the economy was in very different shape than is currently the case.  As I articulated earlier, we always use the most up-to-date growth forecasts available and we continually examine individual projects to reassess their needs, the technology involved and anything else that is changing.  I also mentioned the fact that these forecasts are published.</p><p>  Deputy Heydon also inquired about importing and exporting power on the east-west interconnector, which has been running since earlier in the year.  The majority of the time it imports energy from the UK into Ireland.  That is price driven and, as a result, it is driving down prices here.  We carried out an analysis in respect of its first two months of full operation which indicated that it was leading to reductions of the order of 7% in the wholesale price.  When it is relatively windy here and if there is an excess of wind energy or if the wholesale price of energy here drops, the flow reverses.  This is particularly the case overnight when demand here is lower.  That is how the east-west interconnector operates at present.</p><p>  The Deputy's final question related to Grid Link and to a number of possible further interconnection projects that are currently being explored.  He referred to the ENTSO-E ten-year network development plan in this regard.  We are actively looking at the possibility of establishing a new interconnector to France from either Waterford or Cork.  We carried out initial feasibility analysis on this matter approximately two years ago and this indicated that such a interconnector would deliver benefits to consumers on the island of Ireland as a whole and, potentially, to consumers in France.  We have since taken that analysis to the next level of detail and are working with our colleagues at RTE - not to be confused with the national broadcaster here - the system operator in France.  We are seeking to further develop the detailed desk-top analysis of what an engineering solution for an interconnector to France would look like, what would be the costs involved and what would be the benefits to users in both countries.  We want to see if it stacks up as a project and the current indications are that it does.  Any developments in respect of this matter will feed in to our consideration of other projects, as has been the case to date.</p></speech>

Obviously, one of the main deterrents against running HDVC lines underground is that which relates to the cost of building new interconnectors.  If we are considering building interconnectors at either end of the Grid Link project and particularly if we allow for the fact that this will probably happen in any event, surely this would greatly diminish the cost of putting lines underground.</p></speech>

What needs to be taken into account in the context of a HDVC scheme is the fact that there are converter stations at either end and that there is a cable running between them.

I will be happy to discuss the matter with the Deputy after the meeting and indicate why I do not believe it will have a huge material effect.</p><p>  The final set of questions came from Deputy Colreavy.  The Deputy expressed general concerns with regard to the consultation process.  As stated earlier, the consultation on Grid Link is ongoing.  We will need to reflect upon what emerges from that and there are certainly some themes coming through, both from what members are saying today and from communities.  We will be obliged to reflect on all the feedback we receive.  When the consultation process is complete, we will also need to consider the major themes that emerge and seek to address them quickly and expeditiously.  We are committed to doing that.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy also referred to wind energy.  This comes back to Deputy Ann Phelan's point.  We obviously need to become better at explaining the position in this regard, particularly as questions continue to arise.  None of the Grid25 projects, either the three under discussions and any of the others, is associated with the wind export projects being developed or progressed by a number of developers and that are envisaged to fall under an agreement between the Irish and British Governments.  Those are the facts of the matter with regard to Grid25.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility that there will have to be parallel lines to carry wind?</p></speech>

It reinforces the grid all around that area and a key part of it is that it does facilitate the harnessing of the considerable renewable resource on the western seaboard and bringing it into the rest of the grid.  Renewable energy is a key part of the grid and the transmission system and the power system we have and that will continue to grow as we look to meet our 2020 targets.</p></speech>

There is a wire carrying electricity and windmills creating electricity.  Is Mr. Slye saying that because the electricity is designated for export that either technology or people have decided it will not be carried on those wires?  If it is not to be carried on those wires, will there be a parallel set of wires to carry electricity for export?  Why do we need two sets of wires instead of one?</p></speech>

Some people referred to a 23 yd. or 25 m distance based on the Electricity Supply Act in terms of limits of close proximity to power lines.  In other words, from a safety point of view - to prevent electrocution - one must take care if one is building something very close to a line.  There has been some confusion about the limit.  In EirGrid we try to maintain as big a distance as possible from existing houses when we design new lines.</p></speech>

I wish to speak about County Monaghan in particular because it did not get the early consultation process that is now being afforded to the Grid South and Grid West projects.  In 2007, three corridors were presented at a meeting of Monaghan County Council and there has been no consultation on those study areas.  It has been said that the North-South project is the same one that was initially proposed but given the fact that there is no substation in Kingscourt it could be argued that it is a new project and that it should also receive the same consultation on the study area as the Grid South and Grid West projects are being afforded.  Government policy states that early consultation with local communities must happen but it did not happen in the case of the North-South project in terms of County Monaghan because there was never consultation on the study area.  I urge EirGrid to carry out consultation because the people of County Monaghan deserve to be consulted on the overall study area in the same manner as Grid West and Grid Link south.</p><p>  It has been established that the North-South interconnector can go underground.  EirGrid&rsquo;s own report, the PB Power report, did an analysis and a detailed costing saying it would cost five times the amount.  The independent expert commission report said it would be three times the cost.  Both reports state that it is feasible to put the lines underground.  One can only do a cost-benefit analysis if it has been established that it is feasible to do it.  In terms of the North-South interconnector, this is the only one where it has been confirmed as being feasible.  Each project is unique.</p> <p>In terms of a cost benefit analysis it would make sense to carry it out on the North-South interconnector project to take into account the different issues, including the impact on tourism and the restrictions on future land use.  Mr. Slye might comment on those issues.</p></speech>

Following the aborted oral hearing in 2010 EirGrid introduced a new methodology of engagement; it was all about the consultation roadmap.  That had not applied in the previous engagement with the people in the communities who were to be affected along the Meath, Cavan, Monaghan corridor.  Deputy Humphreys makes an excellent point.  It is not a case that can just be argued.  Factually, what we are looking at in terms of what Mr. Slye has now presented is different from what had previously presented.  The substation at Kingscourt is gone, and if we examine the trajectory as presented in the most recent mapping, it clearly is not reflective of what had been previously considered.  We are looking at what may be a common intent in terms of a North-South 400kV interconnector but in terms of what EirGrid is doing and how it is progressing that, it is a different project.  The people of the north east are equally entitled to the same engagement as has applied or is to apply in regard to Grid West and Grid Link south.  It is very important that we are treated with equality and that our position and concerns are equally respected.  I again make the case to Mr. Slye that it is hugely important that that process is reopened for the people of the north east and that that is done as a signalled intent out of today's engagement.</p><p>  We should make no mistake that we were presented with what is to all intents and purposes a <i>fait accompli</i> in terms of the approach.  At no time was there any public engagement as to the overground or underground options; it was this way or no way.  We were told we could have our input on the route but at no time have the communities affected been engaged with regarding the real options, and there has never been a costing carried out on the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector.  There is no substantive independent international opinion on the actuality of costs to be incurred by an undergrounding approach.  It is important that EirGrid has significantly reduced its own evaluation of the comparative costs of overground-underground from anything up to ten or 12 times.  It is now down to the international expert commission's view of some three times but it has never factored in, nor did the commission, the potential costs in regard to delays, court challenges, appeals and so on.  We should make no mistake that because EirGrid has succeeded where politics has failed for over 90 years in uniting whole communities irrespective of their political differences, I can assure Mr. Slye, without any question, that that is something he should factor in to the real costs that will present in regard to EirGrid's stated intent.</p></speech>

I put it to Mr. Slye that the public is of the view that EirGrid has made up its mind that the lines will go overground.  Moreover, a large section of the public are of the view that EirGrid has made up its mind on the actual route.  I put it to Mr. Slye that unless the line is put underground, EirGrid will not be in a position to satisfy the demand of the public.  Regardless of the consultation process that takes place, that is a circle that cannot be squared.  We can discuss the various aspects of this but, ultimately, people want the line put underground but EirGrid will not do that unless it is directed to do so by Government.</p><p>  Mr. Slye stated that the full line could not be put underground but can part of the line be put underground?  The Kilcullen to Cork route is approximately 216 km.  What proportion of that route can be put underground on a continuous basis?</p><p>  The motion also calls for an independent international assessment of EirGrid's proposals.  Would Mr. Slye be happy with that?  Would it help EirGrid's case if an independent assessment was done because the public do not believe that EirGrid is impartial in this project?</p><p>  When I met Mr. Slye at the one-to-one briefings in Buswells Hotel I stated that EirGrid representatives should attend the public meetings in addition to the one-to-one meetings.  It is important that it hears what the members of the public have to say on this issue.</p><p>  On the point Deputy Flanagan made about the three to one comparison, that may not be an accurate comparison because EirGrid is doing a comparison based on the overground route chosen between South and North and the cost of that if the line were to be put underground.  If the line were to be put underground that might be done on a different route where the same constraints might not be encountered.  Is it fair to say that the three to one factor is built on sand, so to speak?</p></speech>

I will put my questions as we are pressed for time.  What is the cost per linear metre of the UG 400kV HP DC cables running from Rush, County Dublin, to Woodland, County Meath?  What compensation would be given to each landowner per pylon and what would be the annual remuneration, if any?  Will there be any additional compensation during the construction phase similar to the Bord G&aacute;is and National Roads Authority, NRA, guidelines?  Has an assessment or analysis been carried out of the health implications in terms of how close a dwelling can be to overhead 400kV power lines, with particular regard to the electromagnetic field, the extremely low frequency, the maximum allowable decibel level at the dwelling nearest the overhead 400kV power lines in the worst weather conditions, for example, fog, winds greater than 80 km/h or heat above 25o Celsius at distances of, say, 50 m, 100 m and 400 m to allow us draw comparisons in that regard?</p><p>  I asked Deputy Ellis to put a number of questions as I had to leave the meeting for half an hour.  If Mr. Slye has answered them I will read the transcript.  One was about a health analysis and the implications for children with autism who have hypersensitivity.  That may have been dealt with.  The other question was whether EirGrid has any powers beyond those currently enjoyed by the NRA and Bord G&aacute;is relating to access and entry rights to land.  The final question was on a dedicated e-mail address for Oireachtas Members.  If those questions have been addressed I will read the transcripts for the replies.</p></speech>

Before calling Mr. Slye I will ask another question that has arisen with regard to Grid West.  EirGrid is ignoring signs people have put up outside their houses stating that they do not want EirGrid officials visiting them.  Mr. Slye might clarify that as it is an issue that has been raised with us as public representatives.  I ask Mr. Slye to be as direct as possible with the questions from the four Deputies because we are caught on time.</p></speech>

When we withdrew from the application process in 2010 we went to a re-evaluation process on the entire project and part of that was publishing a number of reports, which closely equate to the reports we publish today on the existing projects such as the stage 1 and stage 2 reports.  We published a preliminary re-evaluation report in 2011, which gave all the information about the project from the study area, all the route corridors to the preferred corridor and we asked for comment and feedback on that.  We then issued a final re-evaluation report this year in which we sought comment on all aspects such as the study area, the corridors, technology and everything that had gone before in that regard.</p> <p>During the later part of the summer, we moved to the final stage, in line with Stage 3 of our roadmap, which is about confirming design, when we issued the third project solutions report and looked to doing the detail, that is, considering the devil in the detail at that point, by considering specific design requirements and communicating and dealing with landowners in that regard.  We now move into Stage 4, which is the preparation for our planning application.  Although some reports may not state they are Stage 1 or Stage 2 reports, they have been quite closely aligned to the new roadmap, taking into account the history of the North-South project itself.  There has been quite extensive consultation on that in the past two to three years.</p></speech>

We asked for feedback in respect of the specifics of the study area.  Obviously, a study area is determined first and foremost by one starting point and endpoint.  As those two points must be included, one is talking from Woodland, County Meath into Turleenan in County Tyrone.  Again, we asked that question, as we do of all our projects.  In general, we generate the study area ourselves based on the simple A to B principle, as one must take into account those two points.  Thereafter we asked for and sought feedback on whether the study area was big enough or otherwise.  We did this as part of the preliminary re-evaluation report in 2011 with the North-South project.</p></speech>

This is, for all intents and purposes, a new project.  It is not a continued trajectory and the people of the affected counties deserve to have the engagement that applies in each of the other two instances.  Such engagement has not been afforded to those who reside across counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, that is, the affected and unwelcoming host communities.</p></speech>

Consequently, I ask Mr. Slye to answer the questions as quickly as possible.  If some of them remain unanswered, I ask him to revert directly to the Deputies concerned because it is important to close out the meeting.  I apologise for this but we are under pressure of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-04a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Slye" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120400024#Z00800"><p>That is all right and I am happy to engage with members outside in the hallway, if necessary.  On the issue of consultation regarding the North-South project, we have gone back out and have sought to consult people.  We examined the study area and went through all those processes over a recent period in this regard.  We believe we have gone through this with the people in the area and perhaps we can have a discussion in detail about this outside this room.  It was suggested that a costing of proceeding underground was never undertaken.  EirGrid carried out a detailed costing, which we commissioned from PB Power.  We published it and updated it recently.  In addition, the independent commission provided a cost of going underground for the North-South project.  This information has been published and is available.  Moreover, as was stated earlier, it will form part of EirGrid's planning application.</p><p>  There was a question from Deputy Timmins about how much of the Grid Link project can be placed underground.  If we use AC grid technology, we can place short stretches of it underground but one is talking about distances of approximately 10 km.  However, as the Deputy pointed out, this is a 260 km project and consequently, to place it all underground, one must insert a different technology, which is high voltage direct current, HVDC, technology.  While partial undergrounding is possible and while EirGrid does and will continue to consider it, it is relatively limited, particularly in a project of the scale referred to by the Deputy, and EirGrid is being upfront about that.  The Deputy spoke about the assessment of the undergrounding option and I reiterate we are conscious this is one of the themes coming through in respect of both the Grid Link and Grid West projects, namely, that such analysis of undergrounding, which was done in respect of the North-South project, must be done.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the motion tabled by the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night about providing impartial analysis of engineering solutions.  We must reflect on that, as well as on the feedback we get as part of the Grid Link process.  Once such consultation has closed, we must revert and articulate to both the joint committee and the communities affected how we intend to respond to that.  We are acutely conscious of the desire to have this additional information and to have it presented in a manner that is objective, fair, balanced and transparent.  There was a question about an underground route and, as I might have mentioned earlier, the route one would use for an overhead corridor is not necessarily the one that is appropriate for an underground route.  In our assessing of undergrounding for the North-South project, we considered a specific route for the undergrounding in that regard, which did not necessarily always follow the overhead route.</p></speech>

Consequently, I ask Mr. Slye to revert directly to Deputy McLellan with a response.  I also ask him to revert to me on a question I asked about consulting people who obviously do not wish to engage or to give access to the land.  I hope I have given everyone a fair chance to ask questions.  I thank the witnesses for the presentation and their answers.  Obviously, I imagine there is much for EirGrid to reflect on after today's meeting and I look forward to Mr. Slye's reflections in this regard at a later time.  The message coming through clearly from the joint committee is that the consultation must improve, there must be independent analysis and many other issues must be addressed that have not been addressed heretofore.  It is an ongoing process, I thank EirGrid for this presentation and I look forward to engaging with the witnesses in the future.</p></speech>
