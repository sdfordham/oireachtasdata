The impact of unemployment at both an individual and household level is felt where no one is working or has limited access to work.  While there has been a decrease in unemployment in recent times, there is still a significant issue with household joblessness.  We will discuss this issue, with the findings of the report by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, in June 2014, Jobless Households: An Exploration of the Issues.</p><p>To assist the committee in this regard, I welcome Dr. Helen Johnston, senior policy analyst, NESC; Dr. Peter Rigney, industrial officer, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU; Ms Br&iacute;d O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Robert Lynch, Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Johnston" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#H00200"><p>Unemployment is one of the most devastating impacts of the economic crisis.  While the focus of unemployment tends to be on individuals, there is a related concern, namely, the impact on households where no one is working or has very limited access to work.  It is very different for an unemployed person to be living in a household in which others are employed as opposed to living in one in which no one works.  There is a need to address the issue of household joblessness for the households themselves, especially in terms of the future of their children, to reduce poverty, for the productive capacity of the economy, for the common good and societal well-being.</p>  <p>  Jobless households are defined in two ways.  One is based on working adults living in a household in which no one is at work, using the Central Statistic Office&rsquo;s labour force survey.  The other is based on low work intensity where a household is considered jobless if the total time in work in the past year by all working-age adults, excluding students, is less than 20% of their working time using the Central Statistic Office&rsquo;s survey of income and living conditions, SILC.</p>  <p>  On both measures, Ireland has an above average share of the adult population in jobless households.  In 2012 the labour force survey showed Ireland had a 16% share of jobless households compared to an EU average of 11%, while the 2011 SILC showed that nearly one quarter of households in Ireland were described as jobless, twice the EU-15 average.  A particular feature of Ireland&rsquo;s jobless households is the likelihood that they contain children.</p>  <p>  There was a sharp increase in the number of jobless households in Ireland following the economic crash in 2008.  </p>  <p>         This increase has been attributed to a combination of factors.  These factors include the increase in unemployment, changes in household structure and other characteristics such as having a disability or caring responsibilities.  In Ireland jobless adults are less likely to live with at least one working adult than in many other European countries.  The working patterns in couple households have changed in that there has been a decline in what are described as traditional male breadwinner households, in other words, one-earner households.  At the same time, there has been an increase in dual-earner households and a growth in households where neither partner is at work.</p> <p> The complexity of jobless households is reflected in their composition.  Children make up nearly one third of people living in jobless households, while those who are officially described as unemployed make up a further one fifth of those living in such households.  A further 18% of people in jobless households are people who are in home duties, while 12% are sick or disabled persons and 13% are students aged over 16 years or adults who are otherwise inactive in the labour market.  Those who live in jobless households are more likely to have no educational qualifications, have never worked or be in the unskilled social class.  They are also more likely to be parenting alone, have a disability or live with someone with a disability.</p> <p> Why does Ireland have such a high rate of household joblessness?  The various explanations put forward to explain the causes of household joblessness can be summarised as follows.  The first reason is the operation of the tax and welfare system, which can result in disincentives and traps for those trying to make the transition from welfare to work.  A further reason is the state of the labour market, in which there is a lack of jobs or a mismatch between education, training and skills and available jobs.  The characteristics of jobless households, which may make it more difficult to access jobs, are a further reason.  Such characteristics include lone parenthood, disability, caring responsibilities and low levels of skills and education. </p> <p> A number of responses have been made to address the problem of unemployment, if not specifically household joblessness.  They include the Pathways to Work programme, the Action Plan for Jobs and the work of the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  Notable reforms include the transformation of both the public employment system and education and training services and the reconfiguration of the one-parent family payment.  Given the diversity of household joblessness, however, the issue will not be resolved through single solutions but through packages that reflect the complexity of jobless households and their needs.  This means the emphasis on participation and activation must extend beyond those who are on the live register.</p> <p> Responses should include the provision of more tailored services that respond to people's needs and circumstances.  This will require connectivity and co-operation between service providers at the local and national levels, an understanding of the issues and the provision of appropriate supports at local level.  Some degree of devolution and flexibility may be required within an overall framework of accountability.  The National Economic and Social Council is planning further research to explore these issues and identify solutions to address them.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#J00200"><p>The concept of workless households has come to us courtesy of Europe and EUROSTAT.  It is a metric on which Ireland does not perform particularly well in an international context, for reasons which are not entirely clear but which are pointed to in a recent report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  There is some confusion and overlap between workless households and what are described as very low work intensity households.</p>  <p>  ICTU cautions against devising policy measures which focus exclusively on workless households.  A recent ESRI study shows that very low work intensity households are inextricably linked with the problem of working poor.  </p>  <p>         In our view there are two priority areas in tackling this: long-term unemployment and NEETs, which are young people who are not in education, employment or training.<br/><br/>In 2009, the proportion living in low-work intensity households, including workless ones, varied from 26% in Ireland, far larger than in any other EU country, and over 16% in both Belgium and the UK, to 7% in Sweden and just 6% in Cyprus.  It is worth noting that according to a recent Dutch study the proportion of those living in very low-work intensity households who had an income from work in Ireland was 1.2% in 2006 but had risen spectacularly to 20% by 2009.  In the same year the comparative figure for EU 12 was 12.7%.<br/><br/>Those in very low-work intensity, VLWI, households have a more disadvantaged educational and social class profile, which means that a larger human capital investment will be needed to enable them to take an active part in the labour force.  In addition, they are more likely to be lone parents or to have a larger number of children.  Child care and its costs are a key issue in addressing labour market participation in workless and VLWI households.<br/><br/>A Swedish man and his Irish wife decided to move to Sweden because they felt Ireland was not going to work out for them.  The most immediate thing they noticed was that their child care costs went from &euro;800 per month down to &euro;80 a month.  Ireland is therefore an outlier and if we want to address participation in the workplace by women that issue has to be addressed.<br/><br/>There are many similarities between the risk factors of being an adult in a jobless household and long-term unemployment.  Profiling models indicate that the risk of long-term unemployment is greater for those with low levels of education, larger numbers of children and for older age groups.  In addition, unemployed men who have a spouse in employment are less likely to become long-term unemployed.  That 2009 research was carried out by Philip O&rsquo;Connell late of the ESRI and now of the Geary Institute.<br/><br/>If access to active labour market programmes was allocated on the basis of the probability of becoming or remaining long-term unemployed, this would already go some of the way towards targeting resources towards adults in jobless households.<br/><br/>The ESRI goes on to makes the following observation about jobless households:</p><blockquote>	Personal life-course decisions on living arrangements and family formation, on the other hand, are less amenable to policy intervention.  However, designing policies requires an understanding of the full range of factors that are important, even if not all of them are amenable to policy intervention. </blockquote> <p>I do not fully know what that means but perhaps the Oireachtas has a translation service which could get that translated.<br/><br/>There is no quick or easy solution to this new problem which Europe has brought to our attention.  The high level in Ireland is linked to a mix of factors, of which the following are prominent.  The first is the cost of child care.  Ireland is one of the costliest countries in the EU for child care.  This will tend to lock women &ndash; especially those who are lone parents - out of the labour market.<br/><br/>The second factor is household means testing.  People on low incomes will be less likely to take risks.  If the perceived best way of protecting household income is through having the same social welfare status as the rest of the household, people will react in an economically rational way and will stay where they are.  There was an illustration of this two Christmases ago.  The system of dealing with people in economically precarious positions should have been taken as a guarantee, particularly pre-2007.<br/><br/>The third factor is access to job information.  We are suffering here from the weakness of our public employment service &ndash; now being addressed in Intreo.  However we are also reaping the long-term effects of policies on public housing specifically the infamous surrender grant of the 1980s, which cleared much public housing of most of those who worked.  </p>  <p>         In other words, as much information on jobs is provided by word of mouth through friends, neighbours and family, this means the chances of a person living in a workless estate receiving information on jobs is concomitantly less.</p> <p> In the view of congress, the new emphasis on joblessness and very low work intensity, VLWI, households is welcome and should direct us towards further action in what are, in our view, three priority areas, namely, long-term unemployment, young people not in employment, education or training, NEETs and the cost of child care and the possibility of support for this cost being targeted at VLWI households.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#L00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today to discuss the issue of jobless households.  Like the previous two speakers, the INOU views jobless households as consisting of young and older people who are long-term unemployed.  The issue of long-term unemployment among older people is one often raised with the INOU.  Many people in this category have a disability, are parenting alone or are working in piecemeal, part-time or low work intensity jobs.  In terms of the many issues facing these people, access to adequate income is a critical one.  A variety of research has highlighted the importance of social transfers in addressing the poverty that many households experiencing joblessness face.  Another critical issue is reliance on public services, including community services.  In rural areas, lack of transport is a critical issue.  Accurate and timely information on jobs and supports provided through the social system is also critical, as illustrated in some of the points made earlier by Dr. Rigney.  A lack of access to sustainable and decent employment is another issue.  This is particularly striking in areas outside of urban areas.  This point was made to us by affiliates living in rural areas in the context of our preparation of this submission.  Outside of certain sectors there is a lack of decent employment.  Another issue is that of mismatch, in that many people do not have the skill-sets or experience required for particular jobs.  Also, the cost of participation is particularly high, especially for people with disabilities and those with caring responsibilities.  There is a need for a strong commitment to meeting the social targets set by the State.<br/><br/>In terms of adequate income, social protection is critical to many households struggling with the issue of joblessness.  Accurate and timely information, particularly for those moving from social payments to employment and <i>vice versa</i>, when employment comes to a natural end or does not work out, is a critical issue and an area in which great improvement is needed.  An issue that many unemployed people and many of our affiliates have raised with us is the need for constructive and respectful engagement so that people do not have to seek information and are treated in a manner that will facilitate them in making the journey from welfare to work.  In terms of the recession, the perception of people who are without work and how these issues are discussed in the public arena can have particularly negative implications for people and can impact on them and their daily lives.  As stated by previous speakers, for many people work is not always, unfortunately, a route out of poverty because much of that work is only part time or piecemeal.  A recent example is that of a gentleman from a small rural town in a particular county who found work in a larger town in the next county but for whom the cost of getting to work was prohibitive, particularly because of the hours offered to him.  That is a huge issue.<br/><br/>The quality of work is critical.  The cycle of welfare and low pay and the precarious nature of much of the available work is a particular issue for those living in households struggling with the issue of joblessness.  </p>  <p>         Alongside this, we have an increasingly flexible and piecemeal labour market and a social welfare system that increasingly insists on people making a choice either to be on welfare or to work when, in fact, they need the supports necessary to manage the two.  We would love to see everyone having full-time, decent work.  We are conscious that for many of those who are long-term unemployed, have a disability, are parenting alone or caring for other relatives accessing full-time work, if it was available, would be an issue, but that should be the goal we set for ourselves.</p> <p> Persons who are living in jobless households tend to live in poorer communities, where people are reliant on public services or local community organisations.  The recession has had a huge impact on the provision of many services, particularly by community organisations.  Intreo and Pathways to Work are not open to everybody of working age but only to those in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  This throws up issues for persons who are unemployed and not in receipt of a payment, for those who are parenting alone and for people in receipt of a disability payment.  </p> <p> There are strong links between housing tenure and joblessness.  The housing crisis also impacts on jobless households.  If one lives in an area in which there is little or no work available and is aware of an area in which there is work on offer, one may not be able to move because one would be moving from a secure to a very insecure housing tenure.  The lack of affordable transport presents particular issues for those living in rural areas and those with a disability.</p> <p> In terms of what we would like to see in increasing access to employment for people living in jobless households, there is a need for supports for them to re-skill and re-educate, as there are strong links between educational and employment status.  </p> <p> One issue that was brought to our attention by affiliates working in the local employment service was that the mediator fund which had been part of the service since its foundation was no longer as flexible as it had been and that there was an increasing focus on participants making a contribution.  The local employment service had always asked people to do this, but it had always ensured it took place in a way they could afford.  They are concerned that the rules that have been introduced will make accessing some of the supports very difficult for households with little or no income.  The public employment service which is to be rolled out by the State through Intreo needs to be open to everybody of working age.  Joblessness is closely linked with the issues of exclusion and discrimination in the labour market.  Even at the height of the era of full employment, there were geographical communities, communities of interest and ethnic communities in which the level of unemployment remained very high.  I refer to particular urban and rural areas in which there are issues of class, people are struggling with issues of disability and groups such as the Traveller community which experience huge exclusion within the labour market.  The issue of employment outside large urban areas must be addressed.  Attention must be given to overcoming barriers to participation such as child care costs and accessible transport, smoothing the path from welfare to work and the need to work with employers to ensure they will give serious consideration to employing people on the live register, people with a disability and others living in jobless households.</p> <p> In terms of social targets, if we are serious about having a more equitable and inclusive society, we need integrated policies.  We must ensure policies right across government are assessed from a social inequality perspective, that social inclusion, equality and human rights principles are built into policy design, roll-out and delivery and subsequent monitoring and evaluation.  Within the revision of the national poverty target set in 2012, there was a sub-target to reduce the level of poverty facing jobless households.  To meet these targets, we need policies that are integrated and serious about addressing social exclusion and discrimination.  We had jobless households at the height of the Celtic tiger.  However, the levels have increased as a result of the very serious job losses we experienced, but if we do not get to the heart of the structural issues underpinning them, we will leave many people behind when the economy starts to take off.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#N00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their concise presentations.  It is a topic that does not allow itself to be very concise because there are so many issues involved.  As Ms O'Brien just said, even at the height of the Celtic tiger there were jobless families, so it is not a new phenomenon and we never managed to fully address it, even when there was additional money in the coffers.  One of the key things for me is how to make work pay.  Part of that is addressing low pay, job displacement and zero-hour contracts.  It is not in our gift as members of the joint committee to address all of this.  There was a report that highlighted two groups in receipt of social welfare who, if they went back to work, could end up with less money and in deepened poverty.  Those groups are one-parent families and families with quite a number of children.  Part of the problem was that they would lose their benefits.  Some of the transitional arrangements were cut back by this Government and lately some of those cuts have been reversed in acknowledgement that they were wrong.  What transitional arrangements are required to make it easier for jobless families taking up work?</p>  <p>  I usually speak on social protection, but the other part is education.  What additional educational supports can be put in place to break the cycle?  It is accepted that education is a vehicle for getting out of poverty.  In my own area, I met a number of school principals in Ballyfermot last year who were concerned about cuts to the Traveller education project.  They could see that the days of young people staying out of school were returning very quickly.   They felt that when there had been investment in Traveller teachers and extra supports, a pathway had been set for a group which was very marginalised and often very poor.  If that was identifiable, I presume the same can be said about the families discussed in the three presentations today.  What are the additional supports?  What framework do we need to put in place now to ensure that as the economy grows in the future, supports will be in place so that if we have the supposed 100% employment - which never really happens - it will also benefit jobless families, especially those that have been jobless for a number of generations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#N00400"><p>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  It is very difficult to be specific because it is so huge and so complex.  Dr. Johnston mentioned that we need employment to reduce poverty for the productive capacity of the economy and for the common good and societal well being.  I would also add in number four there, for personal value.  I think that is terribly important.  Paragraph four of Dr. Johnston's presentation states, "the working patterns in couple households have changed in that there has been a decline in 'traditional male breadwinner' households".  That is accepted.  "At the same time, there has been an increase in dual earner households and a growth in households where neither partner is at work."  I am very confused.  Could she tell me what is the increase and decrease there?  What are the statistics?  </p>  <p>               Dr. Johnston also told us that the operation of the tax and welfare system plays a huge part and she talks about disincentives.  Will she outline them specifically?</p> <p> Dr. Rigney's paper was excellent and I thank him very much for it.  Will he outline or does he have any way of outlining what he considers to be low quality jobs?  What does this all mean?  Will someone tell us what is meant by that?  He asks this question, and I remember Ms O'Brien coming in here in 2011 and giving a very good paper on supporting unemployed people.  I ask Ms O'Brien if anything has changed.  I understand that 2008 was a disaster; we all understand that.  We are now in 2015.  Is the incantation, if one wishes to call it that, still the same?  What has changed?  Is there no sustainable unemployment?  Are there no opportunities?  What has the Department of Social Protection been doing in education, through Intreo, Gateway, Springboard and the education and training boards, ETBs?  Have any inroads been made?  I wish to find out what is the other side of the actual semi-depression I am listening to that is happening to people.  </p> <p> It was said that a job will not necessarily get a person out of poverty.  Can that be elaborated on?  Tell us about quality jobs and any changes in 2015, 2014 and late 2013-2014.  Have any inroads been made into tackling this enormous, evident and wearing problem?

My first question is for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.   Dr. Johnston talks about disability with respect to joblessness.  I am looking for a definition of what she describes as disabled.  Are we talking about those who are educationally disabled, medically disabled or is it a mix of both?</p>  <p>  We talk about a mismatch of skills.  Typically, when a large employer leaves an area and there is a mismatch of skills, who is responsible for matching the skills up?  I am trying to come to terms with this.  Is it for the IDA or a local enterprise scheme to bring in industries that meet the skills that are already there or does Dr. Johnston see a role for ETBs and SOLAS, if one wants to start a skills transition programme, to be immediately activated?  For example, if an IT industry pulls out of an area and there is a chance of bringing in chemical industries or some other one, should training programmes be put in place?  It strikes me, having come from the ETB sector, that there is not enough cross-departmental co-operation or discussion between the IDA, for example, local enterprise schemes, the ETBs and SOLAS.  We tend to operate within our own little areas.</p>  <p>  It is good to see Dr. Peter Rigney here.  On the ICTU side and on the issue of the minimum wage, as he and I well know, the zero-hours contract has become the poison in Irish employment.  We talk about the minimum wage and how it can influence someone's decision to take up work on offer.  He referred to the rural issue - Ms O'Brien made the same point - where someone in one town may have an opportunity of getting a job in another town but the cost of commuting renders that job useless.  That can be said of getting a job in west Galway city as against living in north Galway city or living in north Dublin and being offered a job in south Dublin.  All of these things are relative, if one wants, to the individual.  When we look at someone being offered a job, should we be offering some sort of discounted travel to entice him or her?  </p>  <p>                 On the issue of child care, some of the State-run cr&egrave;ches have closed in recent times, including in particular the ETB-run facilities.  I spend my time trying to figure out why this happens.  Reference was made to the Swedish example of charging &euro;80 per month for the cr&egrave;che system, compared to &euro;800 per month here.  This would probably work out cheaper and cr&egrave;ches might be located beside the local national or secondary school, thereby permitting a one-stop drop-off for children.  Issues that are of concern for me include transport, education and the role of the ETBs and SOLAS.</p> <p> The issue of Traveller education was raised.  I had the privilege of visiting Traveller training centres around Dublin over a two-year period.  I was stunned by the level of work and commitment demonstrated by students in those centres.  Closing them down was the most regressive step ever taken in this country.  I do not intend to genderise the matter but typically these centres were attended by the mothers who lived on the sites where they were located.  As I recall from my own youth, if Mammy is into education, it is likely that the kids will follow.  I recall being told that the boys tended to attend training until the age of 16 or 17 years, at which point they withdrew.  An issue probably arises in regard to how we engage with them.</p> <p> In regard to upskilling and bringing people back to education, only &euro;200 was provided to meet the cost of returning to further education.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  I taught in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where the &euro;200 charge was only part of the issue because the cost of course material was more than &euro;1,000.  How do we help people to manage that?</p></speech>

Our strategy has changed in recent years by moving away from merely issuing cheques to providing a more respectful service by engaging with people and establishing Intreo offices and other labour activation measures.  Rightly or wrongly, there is a perception that a cohort of people just do not want to work irrespective of what is done for them.  Many employers feel frustrated at being unable to recruit people for jobs that offer reasonable pay.  We can debate what constitutes good pay but many employers are frustrated by the difficulties they encounter filling positions.  They have interviewed people but were told it does not pay the individuals concerned to work.  Do the witnesses believe that a cohort of people just do not want to work and, if so, are they exploring a solution to that issue?</p></speech>

We had not fully resolved the situation.  For people who were unemployed, in general there were jobs available and pathways into work.  However, for people with issues such as child care or disability the necessary supports for them to move back into employment were inadequate in some areas.  A case worker approach was taken to try to move those people on when the crash came.  Although Intreo is trying to move to this model, the volume of people requiring such supports has meant it has been very difficult to move the people furthest from the labour market back into it.  The fact that the people with very long-term issues are there with people who have lost their jobs more recently is adding to the complexity, as all the issues must be addressed.</p>  <p>  On the transitional arrangements, a number of actions could be taken.  One that has been found to work is the retention of some social welfare payments for a period of time while people move from welfare into work.  As a number of speakers mentioned, there is a risk in moving from the security of a social welfare payment that may come with a medical card and a housing supplement.  If one loses those payments as one moves into work, perhaps in a temporary, low-paid job, people may be unwilling to take the risk, for the good of their families.  Supports can be kept in place for a period of time, during which a person may be able to get better, more full-time work, and transition into a more permanent position.  This has happened before.  People have retained part of their payments or their medical cards for a certain period of time.</p>  <p>  I have been doing some more detailed work in Blanchardstown and in a rural area of north County Meath, talking to people who provide educational supports.  There are many issues around basic literacy and English language for people who are not Irish nationals.  Often, the educational supports are at a level with which they may be unable to cope.  They may need very basic levels of training at level one to progress to level two or level three.  Often, people are put into level three and are unable to cope.  In some households, particularly where young people may have had very little structure to their day, the expectation that they will turn up every morning at 9 a.m. may need to be addressed.  A comment was made about the need to consider personal value.  Perhaps I did not spell out the issue of personal value and confidence, which needs to be addressed in some areas.  It is not a simple solution but is a combination of personal development and capacity building along with a range of different educational supports starting from a very basic level before progressing to more advanced levels, and the retention of some payments as people make the transition.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donnell's point-----</p></speech>

However, in the report I produced for NESC there was a reference to work done at European level, because this is an international, European phenomenon, not just an Irish phenomenon.  In general, because of the reduction in gender barriers, in many households in which there are children, both parents work.  </p>  <p>         Increasingly, this is necessary to be able to pay mortgages, child care and so on and in consequence, there is that trend.  However, for some households with low levels of skill, poor work histories and so on, it can be quite difficult to get jobs and there then is a tendency for jobless households, as well as for dual-earner households.  Whereas previously the majority were single-earner households, they are migrating towards the dual-earner model but in some cases, there also has been a growth in no-earner households.  This also relates to some studies that have been done on, for example, marriage and partnering behaviour in which those most likely to be jobless are more likely to find a partner who also may be in a similar situation because of the social networks in which people move and so on.  It is a complex phenomenon.</p></speech>

For example, people in receipt of social welfare and who avail of the medical card lose the medical card when they take up a job.  People may be in receipt of a housing supplement but lose it when they take up a job.  A further example involves people in receipt of jobseeker's benefit who then move from that onto jobseeker's allowance, which is means tested.  If such people have means or if their partner is working, they may not get that payment, which then disbars them from participating in a number of different jobseeker or employment support schemes.  There are several disincentives and they may also lose their child-----</p></speech>

My understanding is that it is medically defined so that people are unable to work because they are in receipt of a disability payment.  While this is not to say they cannot work without supports, obviously one then needs employers who are willing to take on people with disabilities, to provide adequate supports and so on.  This is an ongoing challenge, particularly at present, in a time of high unemployment, where more people are available to work than there are jobs available.  This challenge must be addressed.  Moreover, one can look at other countries in which those supports are in place and where people with disabilities are well able to work.  However, that has not happened to the same extent here.</p>  <p>  In respect of a mismatch of skills and who was responsible, clearly Senator Craughwell answered the question himself in that both are responsible.  The education and training boards, SOLAS and education and skills providers must consider the jobs that will be available in a particular area and should ensure there is training and education available to take up those jobs.  On the other side however, there also is an onus on employers where they are being located as to what kind of jobs are being provided and where there must be linkages between them, which has not always been the case to the extent one might wish.  I believe I have probably answered most of the questions.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Peter Rigney to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#R01500"><p>I will try to deal with a number of the themes.  The first point to make is this is deep-seated and its causes go back over the lifetimes of a number of Governments.  From the point of view of the Oireachtas, it is probably best dealt with by a committee with a tradition of cross-party working, rather in the Chamber where there is a more adversarial tradition.  One question one must ask oneself is why did we go through the boom years with such a high proportion of people not working?  If one reads a National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report, what jumps out and hits one is that when the boom hit, a high number of people were depending on social welfare.  One almost must go through this deliberatively, in a no-blame way to ask how did we get to that point.  That leads me to the question as to what interventions work or what interventions should be in place.  </p>  <p>         The interventions that work are the ones that have been evaluated and that we can prove work.  As the original agenda was to evaluate them, an EU evaluation unit, the ESF evaluation unit, was set up.  Then we grew up and got plenty of money and told those in Brussels to go and take a running jump.  We disbanded the evaluation culture, never mind disbanding the unit.  The people involved in it were sorted out elsewhere.  While we stood down the culture, there is a need to examine and evaluate programmes.</p> <p> Programmes are seldom evaluated against each other, particularly if they are initiated by opposite Departments, as it were.  I will give an example.  The back to education allowance scheme is funded by the Department of Social Protection, while the back to education initiative is funded by the Department of Education and Skills.  They are roughly the same size and provide the same benefits for the same number of people, but nobody will evaluate one against the other.  Under the JobBridge scheme a common or garden employee is taken on with the same rights as everyone else and the person concerned is given a cheque in the post for X number of weeks.  From a trade union point of view, it has the benefit of the State expressing an opinion on what is a decent threshold of work - it is 30 hours.  Many people are being offered a lot less than 30 hours of work and many have no certainty in their working hours.  Traditionally, if a person was offered a part-time job, he or she was told he or she would work, say, seven hours a week.  He or she could then approach another employer and seek a further seven hours of work.  However, the problem now is that an employee can be told an employer can offer him or her a few hours each week but that the employer wants him or her to be available outside these hours.  That means the person concerned has no market power to seek employment from another employer.  This is related to the issue of job quality.  </p> <p> Normally when unions raise issues such as this, somebody will say we will kill the small and medium enterprise, SME sector, but, by an large, this is not an SME sector problem but one related to large companies.  A question was asked in the House two summers ago as to who were the major employers employing persons in receipt of family income supplement or jobseeker's assistance.  It was a roll call of the large service sectors.  There is no point in increasing the minimum wage if at the same time we increase uncertainty with regard to the number of hours people work.  </p> <p> If we consider this issue from the point of view of the social insurance system, it works on the basis of pricing risk.  The person who smokes 40 cigarettes a day is charged more by VHI, Laya or another provider than somebody who has never smoked.  From the point of view of risky behaviour in terms of hours worked, the employer's contribution is the same; therefore, the system does not price risk.  That is what I would say about quality of work.  Although the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has not stated all that much, it has expressed an opinion by indicating 30 hours is a decent level when it comes to having a full-time job.</p></speech>

Craughwell raised an important point in relation to travel.  The first point to remember is that people on a disability payment will have free travel but one can use the tax saver ticket, which means that the price of the ticket is deducted from one's wages before tax is deducted.  I see quite a number of complaints on social media from people who cannot get their employers to sign up to avail of the scheme.  That issue might need to be addressed because it is not administrative cruelty and one can halve one's travel to work costs.</p></speech>

We must find out how we got here and make sure we do not reach this position again.  We forget that these things can turn around fairly fast.  I remember a couple of years ago listening to a programme on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta where someone from the Donegal &Uacute;dar&aacute;s area said we had a real problem because we had run out of labour which was a time just before the bust so things do move up and down.  People now think we are great because we have full employment.  Britain had military and civil conscription in wartime but it also had an unemployment level of between 2.5% and 3%, which is full employment.  I hope Ireland has full employment again.  That is the time to look at what is happening in the labour market and why people feel they cannot take up employment.</p> <p> The question was asked if there is a cohort of people who do not want to take up an employment offer.  If there is then very few rational employers would wish to employ such people.  That is the problem and that is the contradiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#T00200"><p>In terms of the questions posed by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, schemes like the back to work family dividend would be useful in addressing some of the challenges that arise.  In many respects, the re-introduction of the back to work allowance could help the transition because invariably jobless households have children.  The dividend is a welcome development.<br/><br/>In terms of educational supports to break the cycle, particularly to address issues that face young men, there needs to be a link between education and potential work.  It would mean that a lot of them could see the rationale for engaging and would feel there is something concrete at the end of the process.  We have not been so good at creating that linkage or doing it that way.  We need to address this issue, particularly in respect of the young men who live in areas where unemployment or joblessness have become a structural issue or remain an issue.  We need to ensure that happens. <br/><br/>In terms of Senator O'Donnell's questions, today we are looking at the issue of joblessness.  It is an issue of people who are very distanced from the labour market, be it because of their ethnicity, class, disability or parenting alone.  Of course the individual may fit into all those four boxes.<br/><br/>We are not looking at the issue of unemployment <i>per se</i>.  Overall the statistics on the live register are all moving in the right direction.  However, we still have 165,000 people who have been on the register for more than a year and, within that figure, an astonishing number of people have been on the register for more than three years.  Those people belong to households and communities that often deal with the issue of joblessness.<br/><br/>Things are beginning to move in the right direction.  How do we ensure that this time around people who are often left in the margin are not left in the margin?  We need to be honest about the issues of discrimination and exclusion in the labour market and try to address these issues.  That means trying to get employers on board, to win them over so they will look at the live register.  Currently, a lot of observations are made about the live register that do not stand up to scrutiny because there is an extraordinary cross-section of society on it.  The register consists of people with all kinds of experience and backgrounds.  Older unemployed professionals face the issue of ageism.  We need to address a variety of issues in the labour market.  <br/><br/>In terms of the mismatch of skills, that is an ongoing challenge and one which we need to address in the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, SOLAS, the further education training strategy and in initiatives like Springboard.  Some of these schemes are starting to address some of the issues but often a particular programme does a particular job.  The challenge is to get the system to work without the necessity of a programme.  </p>  <p>         The Senator gave the example of when a large employer pulls out.  In that case there is a need for a whole variety of agents to click in, to look at who is now unemployed, what are their skillsets and their experience and how transferable are they.  Some people might just need to be told how to apply for a job as they may not have done it for 20 years while others might need to be reskilled.  There will also have to look at the types of jobs needed, where are they and how do people access them.</p> <p> The issue of transport is something that our affiliates living and working in rural areas raise with us.  The tax saver scheme like the free travel scheme is great if one happens to live in an area where there is public transport but not otherwise.  That is an ongoing and huge issue that needs to be addressed as is the whole issue of jobs in rural areas.  One national executive committee member asked me to make that point strongly.  It is a huge issue for many people.</p> <p> The provision of child care by the State is an interesting and pertinent point.  Given that currently many services are being contracted out and the role of the State, as a provider, is being diminished, many services will suffer.  The State has a clear role to play, the community and voluntary sector has a clear role to play as has the private for profit sector.  All three have a role to play and we need to keep that in mind.</p> <p> Traveller unemployment statistics, even at the height of the Celtic tiger, were horrendous.  The unemployment statistics for people with disabilities are horrendous as they were at the height of the Celtic tiger, so we have huge structural issues to address.  At a time when we had technically full employment, the employment levels of people with disabilities was only 34% and for Travellers less than 20%.  We have huge issues that we need address.</p> <p> We did not go into the specifics of labour market activation measures today because we were looking at the issue of joblessness.  The reality for many people who are jobless is that unfortunately those measures do not apply because they are not on the live register.  We would be delighted on another day to discuss them with the Deputy.  Colleagues of ours will appear before the committee in two weeks to discuss the work we did around Intreo and peoples' experiences of it.  Much has happened.  Again the question is how do we ensure it is delivering what we would all like to see.  It is a person-centred service that tries to support the individual, be they unemployed, have a disability, or parenting alone to move from where they are into work.  That journey takes longer for some people than others.  </p> <p> A huge challenge faces us around programmes such as community employment which provide a very important role in the community and underpin many services, such as T&uacute;s and others.  The progression from those into sustainable decent jobs is not anywhere near what we would all like to see.  How do we address that issue?  Often programmes are used to help people get back to work or to get to work in the first place or to get into the habit of going to work.  We need more employers in the wider labour market to say it is great that one is on such a scheme and to regard that as a tick.  Much of that is perception and those perceptions need to be addressed and challenged.  Much of it requires the Department engaging in the serious marketing of its own programmes, for example, by letting it be known it has 20,000 people on a particular scheme who are doing great work and that these are potential staff for employers.  The Department is no longer a provider of income.  It now incorporates the public employment service.  At times I feel certain elements of the Department are keenly aware of that because they are in the middle of rolling out Intreo, but I wonder about other elements.  In some ways it is regrettable that the Department's name was not changed in order to make all of this more visible.</p> <p> When people raise the whole issue around perceptions that people do not want to work and employers saying they cannot find people, lots of people contact us asking where are all these jobs that people are talking about.  Many people tell us they have applied for jobs but have not heard back from anybody and have never been called for interview or have never got a chance.  </p>  <p>         I can safely say that for all the stories cited by the Deputy of employers having a perception that some people do not want to work, we could match, if not exceed, those with stories of unemployed people asking where the jobs are and saying that they have not heard back, that they are not getting a look in the door and that they could do the job in question.  That is where the matching within the Intreo service or the employment service now under the Department of Social Protection comes in.  Those involved need to up their game and provide the service for anyone in receipt of a working-age payment as well as those in receipt of no payment.  This issue arose during the Celtic tiger because so many couples worked.  Many men experienced something that many women were very familiar with.  A person would get to the end of the jobseeker's benefit payment but because of household means he did not progress onto jobseeker's allowance.  Then, the person was left with access to nothing because he was not in receipt of a payment.  Many women were already familiar with that dynamic but men began to go through that during this crisis.</p></speech>

I want to raise an issue about education and training.  Obviously, nothing beats having a job, especially if it is reasonably well-paid and draws on a person's skills.  Nothing is more satisfying.  There are benefits to social interaction in the workplace as well.  However, in the absence of that there is a role for education and training and I wish to explore this aspect of the whole equation.</p>  <p>  These are important interventions in the lives of people who are not working.  Perhaps they do not have the skills, equipment, competence or whatever.  Let us consider what the former vocational education committee colleges have been doing.  They have taken several initiatives in recent years.  In Dublin, many of them are situated in working class areas where there are high levels of unemployment, including Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Finglas and Crumlin.  It is interesting to consider a profile of the interventions in this regard.  I was wondering if any evaluation or assessment has been done.  I have been struck by the number of people who would never have thought of themselves as likely to go to college.  They flock to these places, which are packed to overflowing.  Luckily, many of the colleges are drawing on people from the local community and people come out of the colleges with a significant enhancement of their personal sense of themselves, quite apart from new skills and so on.</p>  <p>  I know the colleges have been assessed in the sense of people getting certificates and doing examinations and so on.  However, has there been any objective assessment by groups like the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, which has an interest in being able to quantify what works, what is effective, where the most effective interventions are happening and how to marry job preparation with educational and various other skills, as well as how to make a more creative intervention in people's lives?  It is not simply about jobs, although jobs are very important.  It is probably in the nature of the VECs that they have changed and developed, depending on the challenges in the wider working community and environment and they have done this successfully.  Perhaps that might be of interest in terms of the results the INOU has for quantifying the success of such interventions.  Has anything like that been done?  It might be worth considering.</p></speech>

There is a lot going through my head.  It is complex, as someone else said.  I offer my support to the Intreo office, the idea behind it and the idea that people can sit and talk to someone.  I am not referring to someone being behind a screen but a set-up whereby a person can sit in a room and speak to people at a one-to-one level.  I have had this experience on several occasions in respect of people I have sent to the Intreo office in Ballyfermot, with which Deputy Conaghan is familiar.  We are aware of the good work those employed there are doing.  They believe their job is not simply about talking to people through a screen and this has made a major impact.</p>  <p>  For myself, this is complex.  There is a lot of stuff going on in my head.  Anyway, I will bring this back to myself and where I came from.  </p>  <p>               I came from a street of 35 houses and the majority of the children on it left school at 14.  It was just the way at the time.  I left school because I could not pass Irish and, accordingly, could not pass my intermediate certificate.  I was thrown out to the wolves.  I left on a Friday and had a job the following Monday.  I lived in an area with which Deputy Conaghan is familiar that had many manufacturing companies such as Lamb&rsquo;s jam factory, Rowntree Mackintosh and Lyons Tea.  Those without skills could automatically go into a job in these companies.  My parents were fabulous, rearing eight of us and getting us from one stage to another before they passed away without any of us ever getting into trouble.  That is a compliment we must pay to those of the older generation.  They did not have much but Friday was an important day in our house when the wage packets were put on the table and everything was divided out whether it was for the gas, ESB or food bills.  My poor Dad never got an awful lot but the money for a few smokes at the end of the day.</p> <p> The area in which I live is deeply affected by poverty.  It is not just family but individual poverty.  There is nothing wrong with being poor.  No one should be ashamed to say they are.  The one word I detest the most is &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; because it means much.  For those who are told they live in a disadvantaged area, it throws them over the edge.  When tackling long-term unemployment and dependency on social welfare, we have to make it worthwhile for people to decide to get the skills to get a job.  Unfortunately for many caught in that bracket, we do not have the manufacturing companies that we did in the past into which they could slot.  If I were starting over again tomorrow, I would insist everyone stays in school and that its structures would facilitate those who are not academic but have other qualities.  Deputy Conaghan taught in a VEC college in my area.  Many kids who did not have a strong academic leaning entered that college, came out with expert skills in woodwork or metalwork and were subsequently able to get jobs.</p> <p> We need to rethink the whole idea of how we tackle long-term dependence on social welfare.  Progress has been made in this area by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  She introduced a measure whereby those on the lone-parent benefit will have to come off it after their child reaches seven years of age.  Several weeks ago, I met a young girl, a lone parent with two children, who has gone back to third level education to do catering.  She informed me this was the best thing that ever happened to her.  It has given her a confidence that she did not have before to ensure her children stay in school and go that extra bit.  She does not get much, only &euro;270 a month for maintenance.  However, that little bit has given her the initiative and restored her self-esteem, a problem for many in such circumstances.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has allowed it for those long-term unemployed to retain &euro;29.50 of their benefits if they go back into employment.  Hopefully, that will gather pace as it goes along.</p> <p> Dr. Peter Rigney is correct about JobBridge and other schemes in that Departments do not talk to each other.  One end does not know what the other is doing.</p></speech>

Dr. Johnston noted that people need to retain some benefits when they return to work.  People returning to work can avail of the back to work family dividend and may also retain their medical card for three years.  The forthcoming introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, will also be critical in allowing people to stay in their homes when they enter the workforce by paying the differential in rent to local authorities.  Pilot HAP projects are in place but it is vital that the payment is introduced quickly because it will have a significant impact in terms of the opportunity to return to work.</p>  <p>  Ms O'Brien referred to ethnicity and the need to move in the right direction.  I represent the Dublin North constituency which has two significant population bases, namely, Balbriggan and Swords.  In the year ending October 2014, unemployment declined by 17.2% in the Swords area and only 7% in the Balbriggan area.  One of the differences between Swords and Balbriggan is that the latter has a significant population of non-Irish nationals.  I was interested in Ms O'Brien's remark that we must address this issue.  Has the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed done any work on the employability of this cohort of the population?  Does it have any suggestions about how to address the issue?</p></speech>

One of the most pernicious effects of the property boom was that it made manufacturing unprofitable in areas surrounding large cities, not on the basis that the figures on production did not stack up but because companies were being offered incredible amounts of money to sell up.  I dealt with a redundancy scenario in a company, which I am not at liberty to name, that moved operations to Warsaw, not because it was uneconomic to manufacture here but because it had received an offer from a property developer that it could not turn down.  We were told that a very generous redundancy offer would be made.  Deputy Byrne referred to the Lyons Tea site on Davitt Road in Inchicore, which is now a wasteland.  That is a further pernicious aspect of the property boom.</p></speech>

If one takes the tragic events in Paris last week, the subject was young males with an Algerian background.  This issue has been discussed in the French press for more than a decade.  French society has become disconnected from many young males, primarily those from a north African background who do not know if they are north African or French and are locked out of the labour market.</p>  <p>  Ireland is lucky that employment levels are high among its ethnic minorities, which are mainly eastern European and Slavic.  However, I am hearing anecdotally that a number of those who worked throughout the boom had virtually no English when they were made unemployed in the bust, despite having worked here for nearly ten years.  Their children are under-performing in school because English is not the first language in the home.  While I do not profess to be an expert on this issue, Ireland must avoid the mistakes that were made in the United Kingdom and France.  Large influxes of migrants normally occur when there is a labour shortage.  For this reason, people tend to believe everything is grand because there are jobs for everyone.  When the bust comes, however, people are made unemployed and their children become alienated.  Ireland may not yet have experienced this problem but it is the job of deliberative committees such as this one to anticipate problems. </p></speech>

Geography played a key role in this regard as the immigrant population is not centred on the larger cities because migrants went to live all over the country.

On the different levels of education, there is significant emphasis on third level education, degrees and higher degrees because many jobs of the jobs available require these.  However, we also need to look at more vocational type education and the jobs that might be available in that area.  One of the issues that has come to my attention, which we have discussed a little, is the role of apprenticeships.  We have limited apprenticeships here now whereas there would have been more opportunities in this area previously, such as in the building industry which has collapsed.  A group has reported on this issue and a new kind of apprenticeship scheme is being put in place.  This could contribute to addressing some of the gaps that exist.  Apprenticeships do not exist only in the building industry, but in other sectors of the economy that require a more practical rather than academic application of skills.</p>  <p>  A related issue is the role of social enterprise, which is not as strong here as in many other countries.  There are significant advantages to social enterprise, though there is an issue of the commercial viability of social enterprises and the extent to which they can be supported by the state.  These enterprises can provide an important service in certain communities and also provide a start-up in employment to people. One example I have come across of such an enterprise is the Flexibus system in County Meath, which takes people on as drivers who then train other drivers.  The service provides community transport for people in various areas and it has now started up an associated company which will fix the buses and is taking on people to train them in skills to do this.  This is just one example of a social enterprise, but we have an opportunity to think more about social enterprise and how it might work.</p>  <p>  I wish to comment now in regard to ethnicity and housing, based on experience I have of what is happening in Blanchardstown where there is quite a large non-national population.  While this is quite small on a European scale, there is a concentration of non-nationals housed in some housing estates in Blanchardstown which are almost all non-national housing.  There are issues in regard to ability to speak English, such as parents being unable to speak English and being reliant on their school children to interpret for them and English not being the spoken language in the home.  There is an associated issue of English language training and who should provide this.</p>  <p>  This seems to be an issue that is shifted from one Department to another, but I understand it is currently within the remit of the education and training boards.  However, they do not have the capacity currently to deliver the level and amount of training required.  Therefore, the responsibility is falling on the local partnership companies and others to provide that training.  They are not funded for that and must seek separate funding from European sources, which is restricted.  There are gaps in this area.  There is a demand for English language training, but it is not always available.  There are reasons for this but if the issue is not addressed we could face the issue of generations of people becoming long-term unemployed and of ghettoisation, which is something we do not want.  Therefore, there is some urgency in regard to identifying and addressing the issue.</p></speech>

These tend to be related to programmes the Department of Social Protection has rolled out or for which it has responsibility.  There is a gap in regard to what is being provided by the education service <i>per se</i>, such as where people are going and what is happening.  The one programme I am aware of which has been evaluated is the Springboard programme.  One of the striking features of that programme is that once people go beyond the age of 45, their employment rate drops like a stone.  As a person over 45, I find that scary.  This, therefore, is a challenge.  </p>  <p>         Further work on some of the education programmes that are provided would be useful, particularly the personal and communal-family impact of people's engagement with those programmes and how we ensure that engagement results in people being able to find employment.  It is important we are able to get a better sense of that.  Some of the limited work that has been done suggests that some of the outcomes are not what we would all like them to be.  As I said, more indepth work is required, focusing particularly on some of those interventions from a broad educational perspective and the value to the person of their engagement.</p> <p> Deputy Byrne raised the issue of the language used.  I appreciate that she does not like the word "disadvantaged" and can well appreciate that sometimes people do not like issues being articulated in a particular manner.  However, we must be careful to avoid not laying out the issues to be addressed.  On compulsory school attendance or compulsory engagement in anything, I,  personally, and the INOU as an organisation do not agree with it.  One of our concerns is that as a result of some of the changes currently taking place the system is becoming more directive and is not necessarily matching up people with the most appropriate opportunity for them.  Often people take up opportunities because they fear that if they do not accept them their payments will be cut.  For this reason, people are agreeing to take up opportunities that are not in their best interest.  Again, we need to ensure that we develop services that are good at engaging with people and sifting through with them what is the most appropriate intervention-support to enable them to access paid employment sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Again, a far better use of resources is ensuring that people end up participating in initiatives that are most suited to them and will help them progress onwards.  The service is beginning to move in that direction but, again, because the Department of Social Protection has dual responsibility for the employment service and the control of its expenditure the two are pulling against each other.  That needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I agree that the back-to-work family dividend is an important development, as is the retention of medical cards.  Again, what is important is that people are made aware of this when making considerations about returning to work.  Likewise, it is important people are also informed about the family income supplement, FIS.  The vast majority of people are better off in work.  Often what is at issue is that information is not being given to them at the right time.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is an important development.  The big challenge is whether landlords will buy into it.</p></speech>

I would welcome their views on the current system in respect of previously self-employed now jobless people and whether they would welcome a new system.  </p>  <p>               Many people who were self-employed are now jobless and nearly had beg to get their payment.  Thankfully, the Minister and this Government reduced the threshold levels, so that self-employed people could get a payment, but we need a new system for self-employed people.  I meet many jobless people who were self-employed and who have great ideas but are frightened of becoming self-employed again.  It is sad that we have people who became jobless through no fault of their own and will never be self-employed again.  We need a new system for self-employed people.  </p> <p> Many men or women who have stayed at home to mind their children for many years come to my constituency office.  The children grow up and go their way, get married or go away.  These people want to re-educate or re-skill themselves and they cannot because they cannot get onto social welfare.  They cannot sign on because perhaps their partner is working and they cannot register to be on SOLAS or to participate in back-to-work or education schemes.  It is very sad to tell these people that.  They are very disheartened because they have given a great service to the country by raising their children and have made sacrifices.  We are saying that there is nothing there for them and there is nothing we can do.  That must be looked at.  Perhaps it is due to Governments diddling the books because they are afraid to put these people onto social welfare even though they will be entitled to nothing, for fear that it might put the figures up and show that there are more people unemployed.  I cannot get my head around that.  We must look at a new system for women or men who raised their families and want to go back into the workforce to re-educate or re-skill themselves.  Something must be put in place.</p> <p> Perhaps I was an 1980s, 1990s or 1970s child, but apprenticeships were a huge thing when I was growing up and from a national point of view, the Government should be looking at a new roll-out of apprenticeships.  There was a great deal of exploitation when it came down to apprenticeships and people not being paid a proper wage.  Thankfully we now have the minimum wage.  What are the view of the delegates on apprenticeships?  It would be a way of getting jobless people back into work and learn a new trade for themselves.  The JobBridge and JobsPlus schemes, etc., have been a huge success but we have Departments that are not talking to each other.</p> <p> I know of one company that has employed 18 new people plastering.  The company's cashflow is not great because the owner remortgaged and refinanced and the banks are not playing ball and will not give him an overdraft.  He may have to wait six to eight weeks to get payment for a job he has done.  He has employed 18 men and when a payment has not come in from a Department, that leaves things very tight.  We must look at the banks, but that is for another day.  The Departments should be talking to each other and making sure that these payments are there for these men who are employing people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#AA00200"><p>I have young girls who have come out of school and gone to college and one of the things I saw when they were coming through the house with their friends was that they were all at different levels of skills.  Some of them were more academic and some had other skills.  I saw the connection they had with the teacher in the classroom and the teacher's ability to look at people's different skills.  </p>  <p>               It is of huge benefit that we have teachers who are so in touch with what is going on in the classroom and are able to identify the different skills young people have.  I would be concerned that there are a lot of projects out there doing the FETAC papers, and some young people think they are an easy way out of the structure of sitting in a classroom.  I see that on the ground with young people.  Some of them cause as much trouble as they can in the mainstream setting in order to go into the project down the road, get a few bob and get the FETAC.  This issue has been dominating the last three years of my public life as I have been dealing with young people who have left school when really they would have been better off staying within the mainstream classroom system and not going into the local project, not only for the academic end of it but for many other reasons as well.  Sometimes when they go back out into the project doing FETAC - I think Dr. Johnston might have said it - there is no point giving people certificates if they are not going to be given something to do afterwards.  I have met so many young people who have gone through FETAC levels 1, 2, 3, who are at FETAC 5 and are still not doing anything.  I wonder if it is really a good idea to put them into those situations.  Perhaps we should keep them in the classroom and facilitate their needs rather than put them out into a project that at the end of the day - I am not saying this is true for all young people - can be an easy way out of the structure of the classroom.</p></speech>

I was out looking at community employment schemes in my area recently and local community groups put a big emphasis on getting people to get the FETAC certificate.  It means that they have a qualification, they do not need to worry any more about not having the leaving certificate because what they have is as good.</p>  <p>  We are going to conclude at this stage so I invite any final comments or outstanding questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015011400002#BB00300"><p>Deputy Byrne has identified a real issue, and that is why it is so important that we evaluate everything to get a better grip on what is delivering for people.  Some local projects, schools and teachers do deliver.  We need to get a better sense of all that, particularly in terms of meeting the needs of those who do not fit into the mainstream or for whom the mainstream is not delivering.</p>  <p>  One of the difficulties for self-employed people is due to the nature of the social insurance payment.  They have been paying into the social fund for themselves as employees, so to speak.  There have been a variety of discussions around that.  One of the proposals we had was for the self-employed person to pay for himself or herself as both employer and employee and have that option to build up social insurance entitlement.  We would be aware that some people have met the means test criteria and have ended up on a jobseeker's allowance payment, and others have not because of family circumstances.  They are then in a very similar space to the unemployed people whose period on jobseeker's benefit has come to an end and who, because of family circumstances, now find themselves in a limbo.  It is similar for the person who has worked in the home and now wishes to go back out to the labour market.  They are all now in a limbo and without a service because unfortunately one of the things that happened in the downturn was those services were cut.  In the past there were some openings, but those doors have all been closed.  That is an issue.</p>  <p>  Getting the system to work more effectively is important so that we can smooth out any welfare-to-work issues for the individual and also for the employer, particularly the smaller employer who has those cash flow issues the Deputy outlined.  That could make a massive difference to so many people and they are probably relatively small changes that would result in huge savings for the system overall if we could get that right.</p></speech>

When somebody has a new idea and wants to set up a new business, it has been quite difficult for SMEs and so on.  This is about the interconnectedness of the system, which we talked about earlier.  If somebody has a new idea and wants to get started up again that is something that needs to be further looked at.  I know it is recognised.  </p>  <p>           Another issue involves those who want to go back to work after their children have left home.  Some will take the volunteering route and in so doing will have social interaction and develop skills.  However, if they receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, they must be available for work which can impinge on their ability to volunteer.  It is a question of how the system deals with all of these issues in maximising the potential for the person who wants to get back to having a paid job.</p></speech>

That is a high premium to pay.  One can also declare one is unemployed at particular times.  These issues all lead to a debate about the price point.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Catherine Byrne&rsquo;s point about apprenticeships, there is a gender problem.  There are problems with young men.  What works better for them is a programme that links them with the workplace.  As teachers will inform us, they will not give the same amount of guff - for want of a better word - in the workplace as they do in the classroom.  We need to find out which programmes work, evaluate and replicate them.  One cannot run programmes without evaluating them.  It is not a question of money going astray but of evaluating the opportunities in terms of what one could do better with the money if it were spent in a better way.</p></speech>

For years migration has been an issue in Europe.  The expansion of the European Union and the increasing numbers of migrants from various parts of Africa and Asia have added to the issues arising from it.  </p>  <p>               Migrants' health is an inter-sectoral issue which includes a significant foreign affairs involvement.  In the past few months the committee has discussed the impact and consequences of the Ebola outbreak in countries in western Africa.  In addition, members have concerns about the health issues affecting some members of the Diaspora.</p> <p> The format of the meeting is that we will hear Dr. Severoni's opening statement.  We will hear the responses of members and bank all of the questions raised and then hear a final response.  The normal warning about the use of mobile phones applies.  I ask members to decommission their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting because they affect the sound and recording systems and create numerous problems.</p> <p> While members of the committee have absolute privilege, guests, on the other hand, have qualified privilege.  Members and guests should always try to ensure they do not mention persons outside the Houses who are not in a position to defend themselves or their interests in a way which might be derogatory or defamatory.  I ask them to observe this rule.</p> <p> I welcome Dr. Severoni.  The issue he is about to discuss with the committee is one on which it has engaged previously.  Obviously, given current and developing circumstances, the issues of the past six months serve as a useful backdrop to his presentation.  The normal presentation lasts ten minutes.  I ask members to ask their questions and make their comments in a way which will facilitate the satisfactory and efficient conclusion of the business to be conducted.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be accompanied by three Irish colleagues, partners of the WHO, from the mental health services of Cavan and Monaghan which have been collaborating with the WHO since 2001 in implementing major mental health reforms in the Balkans.  I thank them for accompanying me.  </p>  <p>         We all know that the overall health of the population across Europe has improved in recent years, but we also know that these improvements have not been equally shared within and among the different European countries.  Migration is a key factor in influencing these avoidable and unfair health inequalities.  The main contributing causes of migration are natural and man made disasters and social, economic and political disruptions.  An estimated 8% of the total population of the WHO European region, which comprises 53 member states, is composed of migrants, with women accounting for 52% of the overall migrant population.  This influx represents an increase of 5 million people since 2005 and accounts for almost 70% of the population growth between 2005 and 2010 in Europe.</p> <p> In this context, the project - Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe, PHAME, - was created by the WHO regional office for Europe in 2011 to respond to the public health needs of migrants.  It was precisely in 2011 that the crises in north Africa and the Middle East started posing significant challenges to the health systems of European countries in the Mediterranean, as a result of the large influxes of migrants arriving to Europe from across the sea.  This WHO project on health and migration was defined with the aim of supporting member states in strengthening health systems to address the public health needs associated with migration, consequently improving the health of the migrant and resident populations.  Its objectives are also to contribute to a productive debate on migrants&rsquo; health at all levels within and outside the government, sharing knowledge and increasing awareness throughout the European region. </p> <p> With these same objectives in mind I am appearing today before this committee. The phenomenon of migration and its consequences in the health of the migrant and resident population affect the European region entirely, but manifest in different ways.  For example, our region is characterised by three main challenges in dealing with migration, where the southern part of the region must confront undocumented migrants arriving across the sea.   The member states of the eastern part of the WHO European region must confront increasing movement of labour migrants, while northern Europe is a major attraction for people requesting asylum and protection and governments face the challenge of integrating these asylum seekers.</p> <p> In the southern Mediterranean region, WHO-Europe has already established collaboration with the ministries of Portugal, Spain, Italy, Malta, Greece and Cyprus.  Health system assessments have been conducted jointly with the ministries of health in these countries and similar exercises are also under preparation with the ministries of health of Bulgaria and Turkey.  These missions have the aim of supporting the work of policy makers, health planners, national, regional and local health professionals and all those responsible for providing quality health care to migrants.  The final objective is to develop expertise and capacity and to identify and fill potential gaps in health service delivery, including services for the prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and management of disease, and to share best practice among member states.  As a result of these exercises, several reports have been published indicating key findings and areas for future collaboration.  These activities and publications have initiated a dialogue among southern European countries towards a common understanding of the phenomenon of migration and public health.</p> <p> In order to address the complexity of migration health, it is important to raise awareness on migrant health and of the need to address the issue in an equal and inclusive way.  In this regard, WHO-Europe is producing a number of publications that will contribute to bringing relevant stakeholders within and outside the health sector together and start a cross-sectoral and region-wide dialogue on migrant health.  There is also a growing demand by member states to strengthen health information for decision making in the field of migration and health.  Responding to this need, the European advisory committee on health research is currently working on the development of three reports to synthesise the best available evidence on the public health responses to migration and identify potential gaps in order to inform policy makers. </p> <p> At this stage, anyone could ask himself or herself why I am addressing these questions to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The answer is that migrants&rsquo; health is an intersectoral issue that not only involves professionals working within the health sector, but also the ministries of foreign affairs, interior, employment, education or social affairs.  </p>  <p>         The diversity of actors involved in the process and the political sensitivities attached to this field of work make of migration a challenging field for public health.  At the same time, the intersectoral nature of this area brings an opportunity for the health sector and governments to explore ways to work horizontally and transform migrants' diversity into greater health equality and sustainability in Europe.  By promoting an intersectoral and intergovernmental approach to migration, the WHO project supports the implementation of the European policy framework, Health 2020, signed by all 53 European member states, including Ireland, and the implementation of the World Health Assembly resolution 61.17 on the health of migrants adopted in 2008 and also ratified by Ireland.</p> <p> Migration is an international phenomenon which manifests in different ways but affects all countries regardless of their borders.  As a consequence, there is a growing need for a more comprehensive and systematic approach, recognizing countries' specificities while identifying regional priorities and agreeing on a common strategy to address migration and public health.  During the last WHO Regional Committee for Europe session, a technical briefing on health and migration was held - and attended by member states - by the standing committee of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe for the preparation of a European action plan on health and migration.  This is a remarkable new initiative.  While we have already engaged in discussion and consultations with southern and eastern European regions, we are looking now at the northern countries in order to add all voices to this regional dialogue on migrants' health.  More specifically, we would like to strengthen our collaboration with Ireland in this area of work, following the example of the national strategy, Healthy Ireland, in which the objectives of the Health 2020 European policy framework have been successfully applied to the national context, aiming at the improvement of everyone's health with a focus on the most vulnerable through whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.</p> <p> Ireland is a country with a huge experience of emigration and immigration which understands the challenges related to this phenomenon.  Ireland also has great experience in the area of health inequalities and vulnerability.  The WHO is looking for success stories and best practice approaches on migration health.  Ireland could be a northern European champion in this regard.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

I have some knowledge of the collaboration between Cavan-Monaghan mental health services and the WHO, particularly the work that was carried out in the Balkans, particularly Albania, where a model and a template was established for the provision of mental health services.  In his concluding remarks, Dr. Severoni asked if Ireland could be a northern European champion on the exchange of best practices among countries with regard to the health issues affecting migrants.  It is a good question to pose to us.  Dr. Severoni's presentation was very interesting in highlighting to us an issue that may often not be given the attention it deserved.</p>  <p>  In the formation of the new EU college, the Home Affairs Directorate General is now Migration and Home Affairs.  I presume the WHO regional office has ongoing contact with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumers.  Dr. Severoni referred to the need for collaboration in northern Europe, noting the collaboration already happening in the Mediterranean area.  All of the countries in northern Europe with significant immigration are within the European Union.  I presume the Council of Ministers configuration with responsibility for health, whatever the title now with the change of directorates, would be useful in that respect.  I assume the WHO has ongoing contact with it.  </p>  <p>               My understanding is the leading relationship between us and the WHO is through the Department of Health in respect of other ongoing health issues and through Irish Aid in the case of developing countries.  The significance that we as a country attach to the WHO lies in the fact that it is one of six UN priority partners.  This denotes its significance from an Irish perspective.</p> <p> As to whether the WHO has ongoing contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish Aid, a unit within that Department; and the Department of Health, the delegates have outlined issues that are extremely important.  Perhaps the committee might write to Deputy Sean Sherlock, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Irish Aid, to suggest he be in a position to meet those in the regional office to hear at first hand its particular suggestions in dealing with these health issues because this country has a very proud tradition of providing significant funding in overseas development aid, despite the economic challenges.  Before the State began to give assistance, it was provided in many countries going back many decades by Irish people, both missionaries and lay people.  Perhaps the committee might suggest as a useful follow up having a meeting with the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Irish Aid division. </p> <p> I appreciate the presentation from the regional office and can see why it sought a meeting with the committee because the issues raised cross many sectors.  As I said, I have some knowledge of the work done in collaboration with the Cavan-Monaghan mental health services.  I commend Ms Margaret Fleming, Mr. Brian Clerking and Mr. Damien Murray on the great commitment they have given to these programmes during the years.</p></speech>

It is suggested in the presentation that the regional office appreciates the role Ireland plays with the WHO, despite being a small country.  The regional office has been head hunting countries and Ireland has been mentioned.  We are very proud that it has suggested Ireland could act as a champion.  It is quite capable of doing so.</p>  <p>  I also congratulate the Italians.  Dr. Severoni is the second serious Italian we have had here in the past two days.  We have also heard from the EU High Representative, the European Union's foreign Minister.  She is a very fine woman and was most impressive.  I congratulate Dr. Severoni on his role.  </p>  <p>  On the statistics given, I am surprised that 52% of immigrants are women.  It strikes me that we always thought they were predominantly men.  I do not know why I thought that, but I certainly did not think 52% were women.  Is there an explanation for this?</p>  <p>  It is interesting that Ireland has transformed itself in the past 30 years from being a monocultural society.  We were white and Roman Catholic and that was it.  Now Ireland is extremely diverse.  The Government has just made 70,000 people from 120 countries Irish citizens.  Citizenship ceremonies are still taking place.  We see the impact at hospital level, particularly in maternity services where the health authorities have identified a particular difficulty for the children of African women.  I cannot remember its name, but there are rumours or perhaps statements of fact that there is an antibiotic-resistant strain of TB.  This could be exploited by those who are nervous about the influence of immigrants, but a particular problem, at least for children of African women, has been identified because of a particular strain of TB.  </p>  <p>  We are at the forefront in addressing the health issues of immigrants.  Notwithstanding all of the criticism of the direct provision system, we provide an excellent medical service for asylum seekers and immigrants.  </p>  <p>                 I record my appreciation of the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Africa.  In particular I highlight the role of our ambassador, who is female and her two female staff members in Sierra Leone, a country at the epicentre of Ebola outbreak and riddled with the disease.  We have three very brave women in our embassy.  Irish Aid has provided funding of &euro;12 million to fight this deadly disease. </p> <p> Sierra Leone is coming out of a horrendous war, where young boy soldiers in the army were engaged in terrible deeds during this war.  We must applaud the work of the ambassador and her staff.  None left during this period.  They were offered a break and did not take it but stayed and worked.  They are still engaged with the country.  It is indicative of the deep engagement of the Irish embassy staff in the fight against disease.</p> <p> May I ask the witnesses to comment on the situation regarding polio?  The World Health Organization in conjunction with the Pakistani Government has been attempting to inoculate the children in Pakistan.  Some of their health workers have suffered death as a result of rumours that the polio vaccine is doing something weird to their population.  If it is a fact that health care workers who were working in the field of public health have suffered a dastardly death as a result, I would like to extend our condolences to their families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#F00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  There is no doubt about the challenging and very demanding nature of the work of the WHO.  Its staff are facing new challenges in Syria, with the migration of the people from Syria which is adding to the difficulties of the countries that are taking in the Syrian refugees.  The Ebola virus is also causing difficulties.  No doubt migration has played a role in the spread of the virus.  I would like to hear their views on the way the virus is being treated.  There are concerns that when people who have the virus and are moved out of their communities to a so-called treatment centre, it is almost like their death warrant has been signed.  It is managing the illness as opposed to really getting to treat it with the hope of recovery.  We are seeing far more deaths from the Ebola virus than there should be.</p>  <p>  I am aware that much of the funding goes to the major NGOs but how much is trickling down to the local community groups who are active on the ground in the community and have direct contact with the people?  They are much more effective with people who are in danger of contracting the Ebola virus and could prevent the disease from spreading further.</p>  <p>  We must address women's safety before we can talk about women's health.  We know from migrant women that their safety is very much at risk at times.  HIV-AIDS, the story of the time for so long, has disappeared off the agenda in certain areas.  We know it is still a major factor and migration contributes to that.  There are a great number of men who have to move from their country to work in mines and who then contract HIV-AIDS and bring it back to their home.</p>  <p>  I am involved with a group of polio survivors in Dublin.  The WHO talks about eradicating polio, but what level of support is being provided for the survivors of polio?  This one of the areas that the WHO deals with.</p>  <p>  When we speak about health we tend to concentrate on physical health with mental health having lower priority.  However, we should give equal concern to mental health issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#G00200"><p>I also welcome the group.  I do not want to repeat any of what has been said, but I wish to raise two issues.</p>  <p>  As Dr. Severoni is aware, we attended refugee camps in both Jordan and Ethiopia in the past two years and, having visited them, one is very conscious of the health issues in them, including sanitary services, the fact that ten people are sleeping in one tent and the general health issues that are present, despite the best efforts of the UN commission for refugees.  Will Dr. Severoni comment on this issue and involvement in dealing with it?  When we were there, we did not come across the world health authority.  We were there as guests of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  The other point concerns what we found in some of the refugee camps.  There were people within the refugee population with a lot of medical skills.  What usage is made of their skills to improve or try to manage the issue in some way?  It is almost impossible to talk about an improvement other than trying to maintain a reasonable level of health.  One would be absolutely frightened of an outbreak of any contagious disease in some of the places we saw during our visits.  The camp in Jordan appeared massive - the camp in Ethiopia was probably a little more manageable - because of the flood of refugees from Syria into Jordan.  To me it looked like a very serious health issue or a potential health issue.  Will Dr. Severoni comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#G00300"><p>I welcome Dr. Severoni and thank him for his presentation.  I have three very quick questions.  He mentions that the integration of asylum seekers is a challenge facing northern European countries.  Given what we have seen in Paris recently, for example, and Britain also, many migrants have become segregated rather than integrated.  What is Dr. Severoni's view or does he have a policy on inter-culturalism versus multiculturalism, which is probably at the root of some of the difficulties?  There is, obviously, a significant difference in the approaches adopted.  The multiculturalism approach which has been embraced during the years seems to have failed and there has perhaps been segregation as a consequence.</p>  <p>  Mention has been made of our system, how we handle asylum seekers, in particular, and our system of direct provision.  It can take up to nine years in many instances for the process to be completed.  This means that people are living in these facilities together in what are probably overcrowded conditions.  Is Dr. Severoni familiar with the process?  Will he comment on the delay in processing applications?  Does he see implications for the mental health of migrants in that scenario?</p>  <p>  My third question concerns Ebola.  Some medical staff who were very brave and good to volunteer their services are returning from affected areas having been infected.  They comprise a very small number, but we have seen this happen in the United States and Britain.  Presumably, it has happened elsewhere.  There has been a debate in some places, particularly on the neighbouring island, about quarantining those who come back having given their service.  Will Dr. Severoni comment on this?  </p>  <p>               Has that debate in any way inhibited volunteers or is the WHO happy with the number of medical volunteers going to affected areas?  One of these cases appeared to arise in this country but it transpired that the individual concerned was not affected.  The individual was shunted from one hospital to another, which did not appear to be a good approach.  Has the WHO issued clear guidelines on what should take place in such a situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#H00200"><p>I join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of WHO and commending the people of Cavan-Monaghan on the good work they are doing.  The service is often held up as an example for how good mental health services could be provided in the regions.  The witnesses indicated that the number of migrants increased by 5 million people since 2005.  What is the total number?  Can they outline any best practice in other countries that they would like to implement as part of this project?  I hope Ireland can take a lead in helping on this project.  Is the funding adequate to makinig a serious impression on the challenge that the team faces?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#H00300"><p>Members have raised an interesting range of subjects.  As the witnesses can probably ascertain, members are familiar with the subject matter and Mr. Clerking, Mr. Murray and Ms Fleming are well known to us.</p>  <p>  Several members raised the issue of health and development workers going abroad in the current environment.  They face considerable risks and are making a huge sacrifice but they remain dedicated to their tasks.  We should consider the degree to which we can learn from their experiences, and how they can learn from our experiences.  I commend those people, including the witnesses, who have made a massive contribution to dealing with ebola and other challenges.</p>  <p>  In regard to the health of immigrants and the reason there are more women than men here, this is self-evidently due to health and safety concerns, including traditional practices in certain countries which appear barbaric to us.  An issue also arises in regard to the mistreatment of young women and girls.  I note the ongoing situation in Nigeria.  Even though that country is geographically distant from us, these issues arrive at our doors in various shapes and forms.</p>  <p>  A third group of migrants who were not mentioned came here a number of years ago either as visitors or on stamp one or two clearance.  During the economic boom they had full access to employment, some legally and others without authorisation.  They now present serious problems for themselves and for us as a country in terms of dealing with their situations.  It is difficult to deal with them because of their lack of documentation and status in many cases.  This is something we have to attend to.  Once a girl or a women with a child is in that situation, health is the last issue to be addressed because the more pressing issue is feeding the family.  </p>  <p>               We have all dealt with direct provision in Monaghan and the other centres all over the country.  One of the issues that worries us is the fact that the undocumented people have no status and have very pressing health requirements which are obvious even to a non-medical person.  We need to consider this and would be interested in the witnesses' comments on the issues they raised and those the members raised, based on their one-to-one dealings with people who have come here for whatever purpose.  Direct provision is not ideal and although it is supposed to be temporary, in some cases it has dragged on for years.  In some cases there is a clear explanation while in others it is not so readily explained.  We must remember that the health and welfare of a person who is in the country, whether legally or illegally, has implications for our society, the health of our society and our need to be alert to the kind of situation that can emerge very quickly and tragically in some cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Santino Severoni" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#J00200"><p>We have heard a large set of very interesting questions.  I was impressed and very pleased by the committee members' interest in and openness to the concept of placing Ireland as a country that could lead or inspire the policy debate on the public health aspect of migration in the European region in the years to come.  It is very important to us and is one of the main reasons I have been asking to be here today.  We have set up a process for the next two years in the WHO European region aiming to map out with all member states the priorities and problems, identify gaps and strengths, and formulate an action plan and resolution in order to offer all 53 member states of the WHO European region a rational, harmonised, co-ordinated approach on how to deal with many of the issues addressed today.  The issues are recurrent in any country I go to because they are concrete issues related to daily life and the challenges associated with public health.</p>  <p>  A relationship with the European Commission and the European Union is a must for us.  Our region comprises 53 member state, half of which are EU member states.  Non-EU states which are our member states include the former Soviet Union states up to Kamchatka.  For us it is very important to have a co-ordinated interlocutor.  We are working very closely with the European Commission and 2014 was an extraordinary year because we had been organising some of the key activity on migration and health in Greece and Italy during the two Presidencies.  We also have a daily relationship with agencies of the Commission such as the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers, EAHC, in Luxembourg and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  We are working hand in hand on many public health issues, particularly on the public health aspects of migration, which is a new area of challenges for many countries.</p>  <p>  I would be delighted to continue to meet different parts of the Irish Government because the nature of our work is inter-sectoral.  We cannot succeed if the other sectors do not understand our concerns and priorities and if we do not understand theirs.  </p>  <p>         The most successful stories we have collected across Europe and the countries with which we are working were driven by situations in which we had very close collaboration with the ministry of the interior or of public order that had the mandate to manage the migration system and flow into the country.  This interaction and understanding of the public health concern, both with the ministry of health and with us, has allowed the setting up services which are fair, equal and respectful of human rights, as well as the setting up of conditions that are meaningful from the public health point of view because we must not forget about protecting the resident population.  Ultimately, I am a technical person and a public health specialist.  When one talks about public health, one is talking overall about people in front of one and one does not differentiate because if we have a reservoir of unprotected people within our population, we have a problem.</p> <p> I thank Deputy Byrne for his nice words.  We would be delighted to have Ireland really take the initiative because what we still observe across our region today is that countries tend to be concerned about migration only from their own national perspective.  We realise, with communicable diseases, for example, that there are no borders to stop certain diseases.  Migration is a structural, global phenomenon that probably cannot be stopped because it is connected with demographic changes, economic trends, globalisation and information.  With global issues - which probably are major triggers for migration - although countries are concerned from their national point of view, they tend to only co-operate when they recognise the similarity.  In reality, innovation in the future will help in the process by which northern Europe and other parts of Europe understand the challenge of the south and for south and north to understand the east because the reality is that while we read in our media every day about the influx of migrants to European countries, we must recognise that today, Russia bears the largest share of migrants in our region.  We are talking about close to 15 million migrants with which it must deal, as well as all the related consequences and issues.  We must deal with this issue as a whole region and for this we thought the time was right to bring member states around the table.  While our entry point is the ministries of health, we also wish to talk with other sectors because this is the time to have a common approach and an action plan to assist and support our member states.</p> <p> I hear it every day, and it is normal, but an important emphasis has been given to migration and to this kind of mathematical equation between migration and communicable disease.  The Deputy is right in that migration is a bridging phenomenon that is bridging people and populations with different health profiles.  However, if he is asking me whether it is true that migration increases the incidence of communicable diseases in the country of arrival, my response is "No" and we have evidence to prove that.  Moreover, it is not true that migration is responsible for or is contributing to the spreading of the Ebola virus.  Ebola has reached this disastrous condition because the health systems of the countries affected basically were destroyed by ten to 15 years of civil war and consequently, no capacity was in place.  I challenge the members present, were they living in a region or place in which the nearest doctor is 250 km distant and is the only doctor available for between 50,000 and 200,000 people, as to how they could get support.  There is no system and therefore, there is no parachute and no protection for public health measures.</p> <p> It is true there has been an arrival of certain diseases, which either were considered to be disappeared diseases or arise from a phenomenon of tropicalisation due to climate changes in Europe.  Consequently, one sees the appearance of malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya and so on.  Moreover, I like to stress that the movement of people and not migration is usually the most risky position in this regard.  </p>  <p>         Why is this the case with the movement of people?  One instance involves those who travel by plane, which allows a person infected with a disease to travel infected within the contagious period.  </p> <p> The migration phenomenon is characterised by journey and in certain cases it can take years.  Unfortunately, it is sad to say that there is a kind of natural selection where only the strongest and the healthiest make it and reach the other country.  It is true that in certain cases, people infected have come in.  We have data, which I would be happy to share with the committee in future and to provide some numbers.  We have started to look at what happened in the past, especially in south Europe where people arrived directly from Africa, the Middle East or Central Asia.  They brought with them certain issues, but the statistical incidence in that respect is not concerning.  It does not change the routine business we implement or are supposed to put in place every day.  The focus or the important aspect here is that we need to have health care workers and a health system that are informed, trained and capable of dealing with this situation.  </p> <p> When I discuss this issue with ministry of education colleagues or non-health care people, I like to provoke discussion by saying that 8% of the European population are migrants.  If I would were to tell a doctor of a health Minister that 8% of the European population is suffering from diabetes, we would start tomorrow in the medical universities to focus on training doctors to treat diabetes.  Why are we still licensing training and offering job positions to general practitioners who have not been trained to deal with issues related to multiculturalism or migration in terms of public health issues?  The future lies there.  We need to invest resources in the training and education of that profession to ensure its members are ready to deal with those issues.</p> <p> However, that is not enough.  I have been here before and have spoken about preparedness.  A specific request was made inquiring if guidelines had been offered to countries to ensure that they would be to deal with arrival of a person who had contracted Ebola.  We have not excluded that sporadic cases of Ebola could be brought in by migrants.  The short answer to that question is "Yes".  Guidance has been provided to ministries of health.  We have been co-ordinating with the Commission and instructions and information have been provided.  All WHO EU member states are committed and, I would say, obliged as per their own commitments, to implement international health regulations.  This involves building up a certain level of capacity at country level to activate a mechanism of alert and having a response to deal with possible outbreaks.  It also involves having a national focal point, the appointment of a national co-ordinator who not only co-ordinates nationally but networks with all the member states.  This country's national focal point has the pulse of the situation on a daily basis and knows what is going on in all WHO members states in Europe and in Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan because those people receive all that information.  Guidance has been provided but there are structures in place which, thankfully, were developed prior to that.</p> <p> TB is another recurrent issue that has being raised at many meetings and it is a big concern, especially antimicrobial resistance to TB, which is a major issue.  We have heard complaints from member states that migrants with TB who arrive in a country will require treatment for six months or longer, which involves a cost and the allocation of resources, and they ask who will pay for that.  If a service is offered in a country, there will be an increase in the number of migrants who will go to that country for treatment.  We observe this every day and we are working on it.</p> <p> This links in with an issue we need to address, which is to find a way to deal with this problem in a rational manner.  </p>  <p>         Certainly, we are thinking about TB.  If one decided not to accept migrants due to a fear of contracting TB, and someone else would have to deal with TB, then I do not think we would move too far and too fast to resolve the problem.  TB is one case, like Ebola, where we need to work without borders and adopt a co-ordinated global approach as was done for polio and other communicable diseases.</p> <p> Reference was made to the important work done by health care workers from all over Europe and the rest of the world in West Africa in response to the Ebola outbreak.  I was also asked whether the resources that have been put on the table are enough.  Members will know better than me because of their involvement with public administration that there are never enough resources to fulfil one's desires or plans.  That is an easy question for me to answer.</p> <p> I would like share a thought with the committee.  Each western member state has realised that Ebola could threaten Europe and rich countries and is not a problem that nobody cares about because Ebola has existed in West Africa for a number of years.  Unfortunately, now we are starting to suffer the pressure of media and public opinion.  Even in Europe, despite having very efficient and capable health systems and having resources and everything in place, an additional injection of resources was made at European level to enhance preparedness.  That is fine but the immediate consequence is that resources have been shifted from responding, which was done in the middle of a response process, to being prepared.  I hope I have explained myself properly.  That is like buying an extinguisher for another vacation apartment when the house is burning.  We should remain focused on the problem and I shall leave that as an openended issue.</p> <p> Senator Mullins asked the pragmatic question of whether we have best practice and I shall talk about best practice.  Today, reference was also made to mental health and why mental health patients and their families have always suffered the stigma surrounding mental health.  However, in this case we are talking about a political stigma.  Migration is also a very difficult subject at all levels and one which is very politically sensitive.  More attention is given to problems and negative things rather than to best practice.  Yes, we have adopted many best practices and we are collecting them.</p> <p> One of the main objectives of our work at regional level is to facilitate the bridging, twinning and interaction between member states in order to boost the exchange of knowledge, know-how and best practice.  For instance, representatives of the WHO went to Portugal to study the situation there because we could not figure out the driving force behind certain political decisions that were made by governments which were completely different from one another.  In Portugal the government realised it was cost effective to have a simplified management of migration.  The first benefit for the country was a saving in expenditure.  The system also simplified the life of migrants and somehow facilitated an integration process.  For example, there is a beautiful story about the establishment of a one-stop-shop type of services.  Public services were concentrated in one place in a one-stop-shop structure which is an example of best practice.  I always like to mention this important example.  However, it is not the only one and there are many examples.  We have cases where a ministry of interior or health has approached us seeking help to revise standards and services they must offer, according to the EU norm, in centres for migrants because these countries realised they had created an inequity between the migrant and resident populations.  </p>  <p>         The operations were initially driven by the ministry of interior and have been listed among the successful stories.  Again resources is an issue, it is not rhetoric.  This is really a new area of work.<br/><br/>The WHO has been ratifying resolution 61.17 in 2008, thanks to the EU Presidency, the Irish Presidency and the Spanish Presidency but not much happened afterwards for a number of reasons.  We have been monitoring the implementation of the resolution but not much was done by a single member state.European member states are suffering huge challenges relating to immigration and we decided to step in a very concrete manner.  We are not a bank, we are not a Government<b></b>so we do not have taxation mechanisms.  We are receiving funding from our member states.  Members say they have pledged some resources and that was the start to the process.  Certainly if it is possible to expand and identify resources that could be allocated on a strategic intervention which could support the two-year process that we envisage for the future for our region this would be extremely helpful, not only for us but for all the member states.<br/><br/>We have been appraising a great deal in collaboration with Ireland in regard to mental health.  That is an example of best practice, a successful story.  Our colleagues from Monaghan and Cavan were in touch with our colleagues in the regional office and we started to change our experience and opinion and involved them in the situation in Albania.  Through this Ireland became the leading country.  We have succeeded in implementing probably the most successful mental health reform in the Balkans in Albania, thanks to Irish taxpayers, its resourceful co-operation and its wonderful professionals, some of whom we meet today.  We are seeking the same with migration.  We are looking for a country responding to this challenge to work with us, maybe offering secondment of highly qualified professionals from the Government, because we believe that the exchange of experiences can be fruitful for everybody and also to see whether we can engage in one specific strategic area in the future.  <br/><br/>There was a reference to mental health.  Mental health is a major issue.  This was mentioned in reference to the length of the process of protection and the gender and type of migrants arriving in Europe.  Perhaps I did not mention that in 2014, out of 150,000 people who arrived in Sicily, there were 14,000 unaccompanied minors.  The issue is not only a gender issue but I feel very uncomfortable about those numbers because I cannot stop thinking what is behind them.  I cannot believe it is only a question of family reunion.  This is something that is very important.  When I am asking for is a leadership commitment on an issue of huge pressing relevance in terms of respect for vulnerable groups of population and human rights violations.  That 14,000 unaccompanied migrants were crossing the sea in a sinking a boat, I leave it to the committee to imagine what was behind that.<br/><br/>Mental health is one of problems about which we have been thinking a great deal.  Despite the process of releasing the protection to asylum seekers, the management of migrants is not enough to be able to trace mental health problems while the person is moving from a reception centre, then to a centre for request of asylum or even a detention centre because they need to be expelled.  </p>  <p>         We know that a number of suicides have been attempted and that the statistics are high.  Today I discussed the matter with Irish colleagues.  We have agreed that we need to start looking at a systematic way to assess and study the situation, as well as to plan strategic interventions to address mental health issues.  It is the case that the length of the process is markedly influential in respect of mental health repercussions.</p> <p> When I was a young student, my professor of mental health explained the explosion of emotions a mental health patient could feel once he or she was admitted to a mental health hospital in terms of being a refugee.  The person suddenly loses contact with his or her community, family, environment, habits and lifestyle.  He or she is living in a depersonalised environment with other people in a place he or she never wanted to be.  He or she is completely contextualised.  My professor used the example of a refugee to explain the drama a mental health patient faced once he or she was admitted to hospital.</p> <p> The region where I was born and grew up is proud of its protection of rights and vulnerable persons.  It is certainly the best place in which to be born and live.  We are also proud because our mental health services are supposed to involve innovative management, particularly in community mental health services.  The reintroduction of patients into community life is the best treatment.  It is even more effective than drugs and pills and preferable to keeping them in hospital.  However, in the case of migration we are doing the opposite.  Our policies are inclined to boost or stimulate the institutionalisation of the management of migrants rather than facilitate the opposite, that is to say, access to society, communities and families, which would bring about proper integration.</p> <p> I work in the area of public health and like to call myself a country doctor.  Therefore, I am unable to say whether the integration process in Europe was a failure or a success.  I have observed what the committee members observe every day and read what they read every day in the media.  Some consideration could be given to the matter.  There is probably space to be brave and try new approaches.  I will leave it at that, but I hope I have somehow answered the question.</p> <p> I will address the remarks and comments of the Vice Chairman on the risks health care workers are facing in getting involved in response operations.  This is going to be a challenge for the entire continent of Europe, as it has been in the case of Ebola, because the only cases we have had involve returnees who were infected abroad and imported back to Europe.</p> <p> Migration presents a risk for the population and, again, it is not a simple question.  If we were to do the right thing and apply the correct approach, there would be little risk.  The problem is that we are more concerned about border protection.  Sometimes the paperwork prevails over public health issues.  Sometimes it does not even consider public health issues.  Where public health aspects are not considered by the migration management process, there can be big risks for the rest of the population.</p> <p> Out of respect and professionalism I will not name the places we have visited, but we have observed in places where so much emphasis was put on the management and control of the migration flow that all of the attention was shifted to police activity and that no attention was paid to the fact that immunisation was not provided for in the case of people coming from Syria.  The Vice Chairman referred to the polio outbreak in Syria.  The solution is not to condemn or declare that a given approach was wrong or right; it lies in what I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation.  We need to set up a table to seek collaboration and co-ordination not only at international level but also at country level.  We must support initiatives to open dialogue between sectors, particularly the non-health sectors, on these matters.  </p>  <p>         I am very pleased to be here because Ireland is a champion country on this issue.  Healthy Ireland is exactly what we are preaching, promoting and inspiring across Europe where the non-health sectors are able to understand the health issues and the health sector has been able to be understood by the non-health sectors.</p> <p> I hope I replied to all the questions.  I am sorry if I took a long time to do so; passionate issues were mentioned and I could not refrain from touching on them.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

How would Dr. Severoni define success in dealing with Ebola if, as one of the non-governmental organisations tells us, there is a 30% survival rate for people in the management centres?

I had questions for the Minister in the Chamber.  Dr. Severoni spoke about the common approach needed to deal with the issue of immigration but I will give him one example of what works and what does not.  A boat arrived at the Canary Islands recently from Africa.  It was surrounded by police.  The boat was set on fire.  The immigrants were left on the strand.  This is an area where people are on holidays and taking photographs on their cameras.  For seven hours people were sitting in the sun surrounded by police, with the boat having been set on fire.  That is the panic that occurs with regard to people coming from Africa in terms of the possibility of them being a danger and so on.  That is something that does not work yet we have the idea that there is a common approach.</p>  <p>  Those of us in Ireland have no sense of the difficulties facing many countries, even in Europe.  People visiting the Canary Islands would see clothes on a beach or even a body swept onto a beach, which is an awful situation.  That is unknown to us but we still have a sense that we are being swamped or that there is an influx.  That is the language being used relating to migration.  We do not take huge numbers of immigrants but we try to help out in different ways.</p>  <p>  With regard to the common approach, it must be common across Europe in terms of how we deal with people coming into the country.  There was mention of the direct provision centres here where there are huge difficulties, but other countries would have a different approach.  Some keep people in camps while others integrate them almost immediately into the community.  I see the witnesses having a role in that regard in terms of best practice and what is and is not working.  Do the witnesses see themselves having a role and making recommendations to countries?  </p>  <p>  In terms of the direct provision centres here, the witness mentioned mental health and the food the people are eating.  Culturally, their backgrounds are very different.  Many of them do not recognise the food and find it unpalatable.  They are mixing with groups that are alien to their own values.  People from a criminal background outside the centres are preying on them.  Those are the difficulties, and they are being experienced across Europe.  As well as dealing with the issue, would the witnesses accept there is clearly a role for them in that regard?</p></speech>

I know it is difficult to do so but we have to try.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Santino Severoni" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015011400002#P01000"><p>I will try to be quick.  Yes, there is a role.  We have this role and we have been trying to play it in the best way we could.  I agree with the Deputy that we have been seeing all sorts of situations but there is something that is still not properly understood across Europe, and I am telling him this because once a year we meet all member states so we have a chance to see the different positions.  </p>  <p>           I mentioned during my presentation that southern European countries need to deal with an emergency response.  This means they need to be ready to receive and manage a large number of people who, unfortunately, will probably arrive suddenly overnight, which is likely to disrupt the services of the receiving country.  The more the country wants to have border controls, registration and police inspection of those people, the heavier their distress will be.  Basically, a bottleneck will be created unless properly prepared plans and intersectoral collaboration between police and the ministry of the interior in that sector have been put in place.</p> <p> We realise that this situation was not present everywhere.  The only country with a meaningful preparedness capacity was Cyprus because in 1996, it had to face an influx of people from Lebanon.  When we say we have a role, we mean we have been working with ministries of health and ministries of the interior in most of the southern European countries to help them set up capacity, preparedness facilities and procedures in order to manage the migrant process.  Police control or registration procedures from the ministries of the interior cannot do everything and we want to help these countries to set up a common plan to manage this situation, which has not arisen before.  It seems a very simple, banal issue but it was not being dealt with, although the flow of irregular migration has been happening for at least two decades.</p> <p> With regard to the other questions, in particular the question of public health, we are deeply concerned about hard-to-reach groups of population which would not be covered or would not have access to services because, for us, this would be a failure.  I was the director of the WHO country office in Tajikistan, which had the largest polio outbreak in the world in 2009.  It was a very serious situation.  Basically, the polio outbreak happened because the country was unable to immunise children in remote areas in the valleys and the mountains.  They had been immunising children year by year but the number of unvaccinated children was growing and this exploded like a bomb, not only in Tajikistan but in all of Central Asia and Russia.  It was something that could have been managed with a few hundred thousand dollars worth of vaccines but it has cost the community more than $50 million to respond to the tragedy.</p> <p> With regard to the Ebola virus, I am not involved in the response procedures so I am in a difficult position but I do have some experience of emergency response.  During an emergency, there is only the response.  The evaluation of what has been functioning or not functioning, and whether there has been a failure or not, comes only when we have finished saving lives.  More than rating success or failure, my colleagues should be and are focusing on trying to respond to this question, which is still very complicated.  A committee member asked whether we have enough people going there and the answer is that we do not.  If anyone opens the vacancies page on the WHO website, they will see that two thirds of vacancies for the West Africa Ebola response have not been filled.  We are continuing to recruit and would welcome colleagues going there.</p></speech>

I wish to thank the staff who have worked with me in making this event possible.  It is an interesting day on which to have this presentation because, as members will know, in less than an hour's time Parliament will formally move that the association agreement between Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will revert back to this committee next week.  We are therefore in on time.</p>  <p>  My interaction with embassy staff has in the main been with Georgia and Ukraine. Unfortunately, I have not yet met the Molodovan representatives in Ireland.  I am going to present my own personal view and interpretation of what I experienced when I was an election monitor in Moldova.  I have monitored Moldovan elections twice.  </p>  <p>               At the most recent election I have represented the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly of which I am a member.  Coloured by my previous experience in Ukraine where I have covered two elections, one in the controversial areas in the eastern region of the country, I note that we should collectively learn some lessons from that to apply to Moldova.  There are very interesting comparisons.  I covered elections for ODIHR in Luhansk and Donetsk and am very familiar with the region in conflict currently.</p> <p> We are conscious collectively, as we keep talking about it, of how this terrible disaster unfolded and what role Europe played in the association agreements with Ukraine, asking if something went wrong.  There are many things which have not gone right which we hope will never be repeated.  I was very impressed by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, on Monday when she spoke about the Eastern Partnership countries being our friends.  They are friends along with the southern partnership countries and we have friends of neighbours and neighbours of neighbours which Europe must relate with.  In the Eastern Partnership, there was another country involved, which was Armenia, and it pulled out.  The Russians started to feel threatened by the growth of European sentiment in former Soviet republics and created a customs union called the Eurasian Economic Union.  Sadly, Armenia opted - under pressure - for the union.</p> <p> We are now about to debate three very important countries in the Eastern Partnership.  I emphasise my personal belief that they share many things in common, but one aspect in particular.  For example, Georgia has a disputed territory called South Ossetia.  Ukraine has Crimea and the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk and Luhansk to contend with.  Moldova has a territorial conflict around Transnistria.   Each of the three countries we are talking about has territorial and geographical problems.  Russia is involved to a lesser or greater degree as is the issue of language, particularly the Russian language.  Given the geopolitics of the region, language is a very important issue and it has to be addressed.</p> <p> The official figures are that there are 3,421 Moldovans in Ireland.  While those are the official census results, I do not believe them.  It is fascinating when one gets to know the Romanian or Moldovan community how it can be very blurred as to whether people are Moldovans or Romanians or whatever.  It is important to point out that Romania got into the EU much more quickly and is a full member.  It would have been opportune for many Moldovans with a relevant mother or father to claim their Romanian passports.  It gave them greater flexibility and mobility.  In that, we can prove that hundreds of thousands of Moldovans opted for the choice of a Romanian passport.</p> <p> I am not sure how many members have been in former Soviet republics, but I emphasise the obvious communist influences that I noted when I was in Kyrgyzstan and Luhansk and Donetsk.  One sees huge statues of Lenin, the term CCCP, and hammers and sickles everywhere.  As a westerner from a liberal democracy who sees that for the first time, one is made to think about the attitudes of people, their understanding of world politics and their aspirations.  It is fascinating and anyone who gets the opportunity to travel under whatever guise to these countries should note that the world is rather complex.  </p>  <p>               In respect of the culture, language and the position on wars of those countries emerging from under the Russian yoke, we know the position on the right in Ukraine and should be very conscious of the fact that the Russians lost so many in fighting for the liberation of these countries from Nazi control.  </p> <p> I will move on to the main presentation which will not take that long.  </p></speech>

In fairness to the Moldovans, we should respect in this presentation the fact that Moldova is an independent state.  This is their national emblem and this is their national flag.  I thought we should show the flag as the first symbol of Moldova.  These are on the screens if anybody wants them.</p><p>In respect of the next slide, it is important for us to see where Moldova is <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the region.  I understand that Moldova was formerly part of Romania and that there would be people in Romania who would try to reunite Moldova with Romania.  This does not go down too well with the Moldovan Government but the facts are that they speak essentially the same language.  Although it is called Moldovan, it is actually Romanian.  Geographically, it is important to know that it is sandwiched between the huge countries of Ukraine and Romania.  It is important to be aware of the geographic location of Moldova.  Despite the fact that the language is officially known as Moldovan, according to my interpretation, it is actually Romanian.  There is a political force in Romania that would argue that Moldova should be reunited with Romania.  </p><p>I experienced the number of Moldovan shops in Dublin.  They are extremely well stocked.  The range of goods and the business they do are phenomenal.  This indicates that there are more than 3,400 Moldovans living in Ireland because over 100,000 Moldovans got Romanian passports and as members know, Romania has been a full member of the EU for some years.  </p><p>The next slide shows the ballot paper for the Moldovan election.  Members do not have to count them but there are 25 candidates, some of who were independent.  I wish to draw members' attention to the one with the blue stamp in it which is ten up from the bottom.  Ten up from the bottom represents the cancellation of a political party's presence in the election.  There were 25 candidates.  In this election, they had to reach a threshold of 6% so these candidates must reach this threshold to survive.  The one that was removed is a party called Patria.  My understanding is that this party was controlled by a very wealthy Moldovan living and making his money in Russia.  About 14 hours before the actual casting of votes, this party was struck off the list by the Supreme Court of Justice of Moldova on the basis of financial irregularities.  It was discovered that over &euro;1 million had been flushed into this party's campaign, which broke the electoral laws.  The leader of the party subsequently went to Russia.  There were suggestions that raids were carried out on the homes of his supporters and that arms, munitions and other subversive tools were discovered.  The party was struck off the list.  At the time, it was suggested that Patria was polling at about 14% in polls, which would have given it seats in the Parliament.  Others suggested that the party was on target to reach as high as 24% so it obviously had a degree of popularity.  It is interesting that 14 hours before the casting of votes started, this party was suddenly struck off the list.  </p>  <p>               Members will notice that some complaints were made about the emblems.  The Communist Party uses the hammer and sickle, but a reformed community party also used the hammer and sickle.  The major Communist Party fought to have the reform party struck off the list on the grounds that the emblems were the same.<br/><br/>The liberal party had a split and there was some debate on whether the other party could stay on the ticket.  During this election, given the geopolitical complexities of the area, complaints were made about regional interference, for example that the Ukrainian president appeared before a Liberal party meeting, ostensibly giving support to the Liberal party of Moldova.  Russia<b>, </b>in retaliation because of the many Moldovans who earn a living as illegal workers, decided to allow the illegal Moldovan emigrants to return to Moldova to vote and be allowed the right to return to Russia.  One can see the game that was being played by the President of Ukraine and how the Russians retaliated.<br/><br/>We might note that when we start to talk about the votes for our diaspora, that this tiny country, deemed to be one of the most impoverished countries in Europe opened 95 polling stations throughout the world.  There were substantial complaints emanating from the Russian Federation that there were insufficient polling stations for the Moldovan workers who were resident in Russia.<br/><br/>The election took place on 30 November 2014, but Moldova still has no government.</p></speech>

The party on the right is the PLDM, Pro-EU Liberal Democrats, the second largest party that got 20% of the vote.  The banners are those of the Patria party, which was struck off.</p>  <p>  On the next slide, we see the Socialist Party.  In the West, we think of socialists as social democrats but in Moldova, this is the most pro-Russian party in the campaign and one can see the image of Mr. Putin on its campaigning literature.  This party won the election achieving 20.5% of the vote and winning 25 seats.  One clearly sees the geopolitical issues at play, as the Socialist Party is linked to the Russian Federation. </p>  <p>  The next slide shows the Communist Party that came third, winning 21 seats and achieving 17% of the vote.</p>  <p>  In summary, the Socialist Party is the largest party in Moldova.  There were two electoral blocs, an electoral bloc, called Moldova's choice for the Customs Union Russia.  There was a clash between the parties that supported the Customs Union and those that supported the European Union.</p>  <p>  The next slide has a heading unify the family of NATO and EU and is the bloc in favour of the EU.  This party won 13 seats and was the fifth largest party in the election.</p>  <p>  The next slide shows the reformed liberal party which received nearly 2% of the vote, which was not sufficient to do anything.  </p>  <p>                 The next slide shows an interesting party.  It is officially affiliated to the socialist group in Europe, they claim to be social democrats, now there were other parties of social democrats in the election.  The group in this slide did quite well, coming fourth.  It achieved 15.8% of the vote winning 19 seats.  There were complaints about this party, which I will read out.  The complaint was that the General Media Group, a company associated with the deputy chairman of the PDM - who was also a candidate in the election - controls four out of the five national television stations.  He also controls the largest advertising company in Moldova and therefore it was alleged that he was given a disproportionate amount of air time by his own stations.</p> <p> The next slide has an image of the Mafia, which plays a role in Moldova.  This was an anti-Mafia party that achieved 1.7% of the vote.</p> <p> The following slide is the most important as it shows the area of conflict.  It shows Moldova but it also shows that the problem area of Transnistria has a demarcated area on both sides of the River Dniester.  The Russians patrol it.  Transnistria is officially part of Moldova.  It has broken away from Moldova but the Moldovans want to reunite it with Moldova.  The Russians are involved.  Given the political problems in the area, and what happened in Ukraine, Moldova would have some concerns about interference in its desire to progress towards Europe.</p> <p> In conclusion, Moldova is a fascinating country.  It produces wonderful wine.  We will have a wine competition one day to see if those who say it is better than wine from the Georgian Republic are correct.</p> <p> During the Irish Presidency we particularly targeted Transnistria as a region.  We had made some progress in getting people to talk around the table.</p> <p> Let us hope that very soon Moldova will have a government.  In this context what is interesting is that the Communist Party, unlike the Socialist Party which is pro-Russian, is more Moldovan nationalist and prefers to represent Moldova as a nation, not in favour of Europe or not in favour of the Russian Federation.  We must wait to see what happens.</p> <p> Thank you, Vice Chairman</p></speech>

As we have other serious matters on the agenda, which will take time to deal with, I will not delay much longer but I have a quick question.  Does Moldova have direct access to the sea?  Does it have a seaport?  I see that Odessa is nearby, but as far as I can see the inlet does not give access to Moldova.  From a trading point of view sea access is very crucial.</p></speech>

He obviously put a good deal of work into it.  All the political parties seem to be left wing parties.  I wonder if there were any parties that were centrist or to the right.

As Moldova progressed the Communist Party split and other democratic forces came into play.  Among the minority groups that got no seat there were probably some right wing parties with which I am not familiar, but they are not to the fore.  </p>  <p>               I suppose one could say the Socialist Party might be one of the most right-wing parties given that it is affiliated to such an extent to Mr. Putin.  I have studied the map but I do not really have the answer.  I was wondering about the same question.  The Liberal Party and the coalition that has been in power during the past four years has been strong and has moved more towards the European Union as against the Russian customs union.  The Russians cut off a major outlet for the country.  It is a poor country that produces a great deal of agricultural produce.  Agriculture is the main sector.  Russia banned the importation of vegetables, fruit and wine.  Moldova has a major wine industry.  Did someone ask about the price of wine?  One can get a fine bottle of Moldovan wine for &euro;5.</p></speech>

I hope everybody had a good break and I wish members and their families all the best for 2015.  I hope we will have a good year and that we will get as much work done this year as we did in 2014.</p><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Anne Ferris, Alan Farrell, Fergus O'Dowd and Niall Collins. </p><p>The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with the Garda Inspectorate on the published report on crime investigation 2014.  A briefing has been circulated to members on this.  I wish to warmly welcome Mr. Bob Olson, the chief inspector, as well as the deputy chief inspectors, Mr. Mark Toland and Ms Debra Kirby.  I thank them for taking the time to be here and engaging with the committee.  The format is that we will ask Mr. Olson to make a brief opening statement of about five minutes' duration.  We will then have a question and answer session.  I realise it is not possible to cover this report in five minutes.  It is a pretty comprehensive, impressive report with an awful lot in it, but I am sure we will be able to touch on the main points today.  We will probably revisit some of the points, on and off, to see how things are going.  </p><p>I ask everybody to turn off all mobile phones and other such devices that might interfere with the sound system, or else put them on flight mode.</p><p>I must also draw the attention of witnesses to the situation concerning privilege.  They should note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of any evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are also asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>The same applies to members.  They should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now invite Mr. Olson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Olson" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#B00300"><p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for inviting representatives of the Garda Inspectorate here today.  I wish to introduce the team to the committee.  I am Robert K. Olson, the chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate.  I was appointed to this position in July 2012, having previously served as a deputy chief inspector on the establishment of the inspectorate in 2006.  I have held chief of police and commissioner positions in several large US cities.  In 2004, I retired from active policing after 38 years.</p> <p>  I am joined today by our two deputy chief inspectors, Mark Toland and Debra Kirby.  Mr. Toland, who had the lead on the crime investigation inspection, joined the inspectorate in June 2012, having retired at the rank of chief superintendent from the London Metropolitan Police after 30 years' service.  In 2010, he was awarded the Queen's medal for distinguished police services.</p> <p>  Ms Kirby was appointed as deputy chief inspector in January 2014, having served with the Chicago police department for 27 years.  She retired with the rank of chief having served in a variety of commands, including being the general counsel to the superintendent, which is the commissioner in the city of Chicago.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the crime investigation report.  On 11 November 2014, the Minister for Justice and Equality published the inspectorate's crime investigation report.  For over two years, the inspectorate examined policies, practices and procedures used in the prevention and investigation of crime.  The inspection also included a review of the allocation of Garda resources, the use of technology and the management of case loads.  It also monitored the progress of individual investigations.</p> <p>  The report runs to over 500 pages and contains 11 parts dealing with every aspect of crime investigation from crime prevention, crime recording and the experience of victims, through to crime detection and final disposition.  </p> <p>  Following the appointment of Deputy Frances Fitzgerald as the Minister for Justice and Equality in May 2014, the inspectorate was requested to consider the issues identified in the Guerin report.  It was not within the inspectorate's remit to duplicate Mr. Guerin's work, but rather to review the process issues identified in the report relevant to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's practices and procedures.</p><p>Consequently, the contents of the Guerin report were considered against the backdrop of the inspectorate&rsquo;s ongoing crime investigation inspection.  The report includes an addendum covering same.  The inspectorate references best international practice throughout to inform our national standards and to ensure consistency in victim care and crime investigation practices.<br/><br/>The report identified many areas of good practice in different Garda divisions and in different parts of the country.  These include a new community policing model, a range of crime prevention initiatives, cross-district crime operations, a new approach to integrated briefings and a number of technological initiatives, including a Garda portal for criminal intelligence officers.  Such elements of good practice while used in some divisions and units were not, however, consistent across the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In any organisation of this size, it is important to ensure that good practice is consistently observed.<br/><br/>The report identifies many deficiencies in systems and practices, including serious failures in the recording, classification and reclassification of crime incidents; inconsistencies in the claiming of detections; a lack of oversight of the decision-making process; no standardised crime management process for reviewing, allocating and monitoring of investigations and ensuring each investigation is effective; an absence of intrusive supervision of crime investigations; inexperienced garda&iacute; investigating serious crimes; a new roster that does not adequately support the investigative process; concerns over the timeliness of  investigations; inconsistent approach to updating victims of crime; that foundation training provided pre-2014 for investigating crime does not adequately equip garda&iacute; for the task at hand; a lack of IT and equipment to support the investigation of crime; and deficiencies in offender management practices, particularly in the taking of fingerprints.  <br/><br/>This report should be viewed as a watershed opportunity in Irish policing.  It contains more than 200 significant recommendations to be implemented on an interim, short, medium and long term basis, to ensure that crime investigation in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in line with, and can exceed, international best practice.  Some of these recommendations have been made in previous inspectorate reports but have not been fully implemented and are, as a result, even more urgent today.  The objective of this report is to help make the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a better service for the public, victims of crime, members of the force and the criminal justice system in Ireland.  A victim of crime anywhere in Ireland should receive the same high quality service.<br/><br/>Several of the crime investigation issues in the report are not the sole responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report highlights how other parts of the criminal justice system can influence the investigation of crime.  Inefficiencies in the system must be addressed in a holistic manner by regular collective collaboration between all criminal justice partners<b>.  </b>Twenty-two of the report&rsquo;s recommendations request action from a combination of criminal justice partners to improve the standards of crime investigation in Ireland on a wide variety of issues.  Some of the key recommendations in the report relate to technology, restructuring and improved decision-making and supervision.  Several significant recommendations are made on the crime counting process.  Important recommendations are made on improving the service to victims of crime.  Training is also targeted as an area for improvement.  There are critical process areas, including custody, fingerprinting, bail and warrant management that need to be enhanced.<br/><br/>Many of our recommendations depend on the acquisition of modern technology used by most international police services.  This technology can provide the modern tools the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to inform more efficient and effective operational decisions.  Technology cannot, however, take the place of strong management practices, intrusive supervision and robust governance in the investigation of crime.  The inspectorate welcomes the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald and the Government, to secure funding to upgrade Garda IT systems and for the new police authority and the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to oversee the Garda programme of reforms recommended by the inspectorate.  <br/><br/>It should also be pointed out that the inspectorate was impressed by the hundreds of hard working and dedicated rank and file officers, reserves and support staff it met in every region, who were doing their best to get the job done, notwithstanding these inefficient processes, dated technology and poor management practices identified in the report.</p><p>To date, the inspectorate has received a substantial amount of positive feedback from stakeholders and particularly from Garda rank and file members.  The full report has been downloaded approximately 10,000 times on our website and has also been hosted by other websites.  The inspectorate remains committed to ensuring it recommends those improvements that will advance the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a police service recognised for international best practice.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions the committee members might have.</p></speech>

Each member can ask three questions and get answers and then we will move on to someone else.  We can return to the original member if he or she wants to ask further questions, as there are no limits to the number of questions members can ask.

Despite varied political views on this committee, we share a vision of transforming the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a leading police force, both in Ireland and across the European Union.  My first question relates to the inaccuracies in the PULSE system mentioned in the report, whereby 30% of incidents were examined and were recorded incorrectly and insufficient detail was given for 16%.  How do the witnesses see this hampering crime investigation and crime management?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#D00400"><p>There is a mobile phone interfering with the system.  Could everyone double-check that all their telephones are off or on aeroplane mode?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#D00500"><p>The most important issue we identified was the recording of the incident to start with, before it gets onto the PULSE system and is classified and put in a certain category, which we think is a major deficiency.  When someone dials 999 or goes into a Garda station, they have an expectation that the information they provide is recorded properly.  We found a deficiency in recording some crimes.  The Deputy mentioned that 30% of crimes that went on the system were put in a category we did not agree with.  If a crime is not recorded properly in the first place, or if it goes in the wrong crime category, one will not know one has a problem, one will not know the specifics of that problem and the locations, and one will not deploy resources appropriately to deal with that problem.  It is a major issue.  We have identified technological difficulties.  Some divisions in Ireland have a computerised electronic system called computer-aided dispatch, CAD, which records this, while others are operating on paper.  One of the major deficiencies we found was the IT systems.  Another issue is supervision, the absence of a front-line sergeant or an inspector on duty 24/7, to ensure that when a garda goes to deal with something, it is recorded correctly at the time and the garda is not allowed to go home with a crime in their notebook.  Most garda&iacute; do not come to work thinking "I will not record a crime today", but they are busy dealing with other things, and there is no one to ensure that crime is correctly recorded before they go home.  Once it is recorded, one must ensure it is in the right category and then one can appoint a suitable investigator.  That is a crucial stage - the first recording and ensuring it is in the right category in the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#D00600"><p>The report also found examples of good practice in policing, particularly as it relates to communities, but it stated that this was not consistent across the board throughout the police force.  Why do the witnesses think that was the case?  My second question is particularly about the average garda - I would be particularly interested in Mr. Toland's views on this - who, the witnesses stated when compiling the original report, works eight-hour shifts.  How many of those hours does the Garda actually work in the community, in Mr. Toland's experience?  The reason I direct this question to Mr. Toland is that I visited the London police force a number of years ago as a member of this committee and we met community policemen in inner-city London.  Of their eight-hour shift, at least six to seven hours were spent in the community, which I thought was fantastic.  That does not appear to be the case in Ireland at the moment.</p><p>Has Mr. Toland come across examples of good practice in this issue and how would he see us dealing with this?  The regular complaint we get as politicians is that the broader community wants to see the police officer out on the street in the community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#E00200"><p>I will take two parts and I am sure my colleagues will come in.  I am very passionate about community policing and come from a police environment where they had dedicated resources.  We were very lucky in London because there were additional resources provided on the understanding that, as a chief superintendent, I would not take them away to do other things.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not got that luxury.  Some divisions have good numbers of full-time community officers.  When I say a community officer I am talking about a dedicated officer whose main role it is.  The Dublin divisions have certainly still got pretty good numbers.  Some of the divisions have 20 or 30; in fact, there are 70 in one of the Dublin divisions, but the more rural areas are struggling to maintain the numbers of garda&iacute; dedicated to community policing.  It is a major challenge for them and we recognise that in the report.</p> <p>  We have been to community meetings to find out what the public want from their police, and they want accessibility, to know the individual garda, to have that relationship.  There are some very difficult decisions to make.  We are recommending trying to free up garda&iacute; and sergeants in non-operational, administrative roles to get them back to front-line duties.  Some should be redeployed into community engagement because it is very important to local people.  We recognise that a model for Ireland has to be flexible enough to provide different types of policing for cities like Dublin, Cork or Limerick, but also for counties Donegal, Mayo or Kildare.  There needs to be different approaches.  </p> <p>  London set a target whereby community officers had to spend 80% of their time in their particular areas.  I was not allowed to take them away to do other things.  It was a fantastic commitment to the public, but once those officers are deployed the situation needs to be maintained.  At public meetings, people have told us they are very happy with the service they get from community officers but when they dial 999 they are not getting a community officer, they are getting an officer who is coming to deal with that call and then wants to go off to deal with another one.  There is a clear role for someone to deal with a 24/7 emergency call.  There is also a need for commitment to having a full-time community officer who is there and available to attend community meetings and to support things like neighbourhood watch, text alert and community alert in rural areas.  We need that visible presence of a known face, an individual who can be contacted.</p> <p>  Community policing is the heart of policing.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wants to serve communities - that is its mission statement - and to work to protect communities.  It is very important to have a physical presence and officers should not be taken away to do other things.  At the moment, officers are being taken away to help with other duties, to do response-type policing, and they are being taken away from their community roles.</p></speech>

A short answer is that we do not really know how much time they are spending out of station, out in the community, and neither do they.  That is why we have recommended additional supervision for sure, but also acquiring the technology which will let them know who is on duty, what they are doing, where they have gone, how long they have been there and what they have been doing while they are there.  As of now, the force does not have that capacity unless people try and do it with paper and such.  It is a complex issue and we do not know for sure if garda&iacute; spend more or less time out in the field.  From what we have seen, we suspect they are not out in the field as much as they ought to be.</p></speech>

Are there examples of the garda&iacute; handling these issues in a positive way?  There are many communities, including in my own constituency, where particular gangs dominate whole streets and communities.  Fear is rampant, intimidation is horrific and families and children are being intimidated out of their houses, yet nobody will go to the Garda.</p><p>This is a major problem. </p></speech>

In Limerick, we found some very good practices in policing operations.  Although it was not one of the divisions we looked at, we also went to the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR (North), and to Store Street.  We looked at their new community policing model.  The thing I like about it is that they are knocking on doors, which is something we did in London, and reintroducing themselves to the community.  However, most important, they are finding out what are the local priorities for that particular community rather than telling them what are the policing priorities and that this is what they are going to invest their resources in.  They are going out to find out what the community issues are.  These issues tend to be young people, who are not necessarily committing crime but who are hanging around, anti-social behaviour and drug dealing.  That particular division is focusing on the priorities and reporting to those communities.  The feedback is very good.  It now has a database of 10,000 stakeholders whom it can contact and which it can update.  It is a good example of responding to a community's priorities rather than just assuming one knows what is actually affecting a particular community.</p></speech>

The challenge that we saw, throughout this report, was that pockets of good practice were not being shared throughout the organisation.  When good ideas, such as the ones identified, are coming forward, the ability to take those forward into other areas becomes important.  That idea of oversight and bringing good ideas forward is part of the overall recommendation we have made.</p> <p>  Obviously rural issues and urban issues are somewhat distinct.  However, when one looks at policing internationally, one notes this continues to be the challenge for all police services.  What works in certain places can transfer in part to other places.  This idea of trying to improve and better the service throughout the continuation of a pilot or a project becomes important as well.</p></speech>

Arising from that, will the witnesses comment on a problem we seem to have in Ireland for some time, namely, the amount of crime committed by people out on bail?  How can the PULSE system track this?  Inevitably, most weeks, in some newspaper, we read of what are sometimes horrific crimes committed by people who are out on bail awaiting trial.  These are serious crimes which are being committed, whether it is drug issues, instances of murder or intimidation and so on.</p> <p>  Do we need a new PULSE system which is ultra modern?  How can we ensure the PULSE system, with a 30% fault line, can be improved?  If there is a 30% fault line, that trickles down the whole line as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

If there is a lack of co-ordination perhaps there should be co-ordination.  If someone has committed a crime and is left out on bail, that person should be tracked by PULSE or by someone.</p></speech>

When the Senator mentions PULSE, he must understand that PULSE is a 1990s technology.  It was bought for the purpose of it being a repository for information and not an analytical tool.  It is not a deployment tool.  It is a big repository.  When it was put in, it clearly enhanced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to manage its organisation but it was never intended to do the things the Senator is talking about, namely, tracking people, tracking bail and all that kind of a thing.  That is why we have recommended that it is time to retire PULSE.  We will be furthering this in our Haddington Road review.  It is not possible to retire it right away.  It has to be kept running.  However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs an entirely different platform in order to adequately track the kinds of things the Senator is speaking about.  Currently they have to do it in a somewhat <i>ad hoc</i>manner and create perhaps a PULSE entry level where they can specifically monitor something but it is very cumbersome and very difficult.</p><p>I am aware they are trying to do that but the bottom line is that in the long term they will need a new platform for that and their despatch system.</p></speech>

Police services internationally have tried to restrict the number of people who can sign on in police stations.  It is effective for certain individuals but other jurisdictions are moving towards curfews whereby a police officer checks on an individual at a certain time, perhaps without telling him or her in advance when the check will take place.  Once an individual has signed in at a Garda station, there is no system in place to monitor him or her, whereas an individual on a curfew can be restricted to certain areas and times.</p> <p>  I do not think supervision of bail through PULSE will work.  We recommend a new system for people on bail who are high risk which would involve an offender management integrated multi-agency approach, with the Garda and the Probation Service as key partners focusing on these high risk individuals.  There is a good system for young offenders but we recommend that the agencies responsible for monitoring high-risk individuals should be collocated so that they share information better and ensure such individuals are checked on frequently and, where they breach bail, brought back before the courts.  We have found that not every breach of bail identified in the report was brought before the courts.  Not every court wants the individual concerned brought back on the first breach of bail and garda&iacute; do not have powers of arrest of people in breach of bail.  They have to get a summons or a warrant.  Our recommendations would enhance the power to enforce breach of bail conditions by taking immediate action.</p> <p>  I visited several busy Garda stations in which huge numbers were signing on.  I am not convinced that an individual who did not sign on at a particular time would be noticed immediately.  That represents a risk and the report identifies that concern. </p> <p>  The report's recommendations are not solely aimed at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because other agencies also play a key role in this area.  The various agencies could work together better because the system needs to be managed by more than the Garda.  There is an opportunity to investigate the potential of an integrated offender management, multi-agency team that can deal with people on bail who are high risk.</p></speech>

I may have mixed up PULSE with bail.  The latter is a source of concern for me and I appreciate their comments.  They recommended that information technology graduates and science experts be recruited into the Garda, perhaps at the rank of sergeant or inspector.  That is a good idea because most garda&iacute; who pass through Templemore do not have the necessary skills in science or information technology.  We recently came through a phase in which garda&iacute; were stuck in stations throughout the country doing desk work.  These garda&iacute; have since been deployed onto the streets to the greatest extent possible.  I ask how this recommendation might be implemented.  It looks positive on the face of it but how could it be used to improve the expertise available to the Garda?</p></speech>

The idea of seconding personnel to the Garda as it is currently constituted has some value in terms of being able to recruit talented and skilled people to fulfil duties without requiring them to spend time at Templemore.  When we speak specifically about information technology skills and other skills that are more commonly available in the private sector, we are referring to a workforce modernisation issue.  The inspectorate reviewed certain areas and made recommendations in the report was also prepared in anticipation of a forthcoming report arising from the Haddington Road review which will examine how we can modernise the workforce overall.  Under previous practice in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, individuals who were skilled in certain areas, including IT, were recruited directly.  This practice offered the benefit of recruiting personnel into an organisation that was entirely sworn.  The Garda now has the ability to recruit civilian personnel under a variety of circumstances, including contracts, direct hire and part-time employment.</p><p>Those areas are under review and, considering the police services internationally, we can take them forward here to provide better services overall.  The report took in hiring practices for sworn members and is also starting to signpost upcoming review recommendations around other areas, particularly as it goes to specialist skills.  We want our garda&iacute; serving in the community fighting crime.  Do we need garda&iacute; to provide back-office or mid-office support, or do we need people who have specialised skills?  Those issues will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

Up to ten or 15 years ago it was badly managed.  Some of our judges and garda&iacute; were not properly trained.  Domestic violence is still committed substantially, although not exclusively, against women.  Could the witnesses elaborate on how we can better manage and improve the whole area of domestic violence, which is a festering sore on society?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#H00300"><p>Domestic violence is referred to as a volume crime because of the sheer volume of calls.  Given that most police services would have more domestic violence calls than many other crimes such as burglary, it is a major demand generator.  Research shows that a person who has the guts to come forward and report a domestic violence incident may have been subjected to 30 other incidents of abuse or physical violence.  It is a big step for such a person to make a telephone call or walk into a Garda station to report an incident.</p> <p>  In Ireland, the first officer who turns up at a case is the officer who will investigate it and will continue with the investigation.  Most other policing services have found that this does not always work and have dedicated domestic violence investigation teams.  The first officer does his or her best with the investigation and makes an arrest if there is a crime.  This officer then hands the case over to an investigation unit.  Garda&iacute; do not have this luxury, and given that a young officer who attends a scene to investigate a crime may have another 200 cases under investigation at the same time, there is an issue regarding volume.</p> <p>  We spoke to some victims who had a very good response from empathetic garda&iacute; who turned up, and who called back at a later date to ensure the victim was okay and referred the victim to support services.  We also had bad examples in which victims felt they were discouraged from reporting an incident.  We found many incidents that were not recorded correctly on PULSE, which is a worry.  Some garda&iacute; have admitted their failure to record domestic violence where a person had a physical injury.  They told us they are frustrated with the system and the way crime rates are allocated in Ireland.  They were very honest with us in admitting to a serious discipline offence, namely, the failure to record a crime.</p> <p>  It is often difficult to get victims of domestic violence to come to court.  Sometimes they just want the perpetrators taken away, which I understand.  Although not every domestic violence victim wants to go through a criminal justice service, they need to be reassured that the crime will be recorded.  We found that where a victim was not going to give a written statement, the crime was not always dealt with properly.  Given that the recording of domestic violence on our computer system is not great, we found it very difficult to identify the number of calls received regarding domestic violence across Ireland, the number of incidents in which a physical crime is or is not committed, detection rates and the outcomes of the cases that go through the criminal justice system.  There is an absence of data.  They are not measured.</p> <p>  While there is no risk assessment in place in Ireland, we welcome the news that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to introduce a risk assessment process, so when the first garda turns up, he or she will ask far more questions about the history of offending, whether there are children involved and the vulnerabilities of the victim.  Most other police services have a criminal justice partners' group that looks particularly at men of violence - most domestic violence, unfortunately, involves men committing offences - and the needs of victims, given that violence tends to escalate.</p><p>That is an absence in Ireland and one of our recommendations states there needs to be a criminal justice partners group to actually look at individual cases.</p><p> As for positive action, if an offence has been committed, there is an onus on an individual garda who turns up to take positive action and in my currency, that is an arrest and taking in a person.  We certainly found many occasions where there were opportunities to arrest but those opportunities were not always taken.  We think it is a really important aspect of policing, in that the person concerned has had the guts to pick up a telephone and to ask for help.  The first officer who attends is important.  If the officer is positive, tells the person he or she will support the person and brings in other organisations to help, one will get people who will come forward and help one with a prosecution.  At present, however, it is inconsistent across Ireland with some very good experiences and some very poor experiences.</p></speech>

It contains a great deal that members cannot hope to cover today but the joint committee will try to cover some parts of it.</p> <p>  I noted throughout the report a theme of good practices locally but inconsistency with regard to overall adherence to appropriate standards, whether in respect of crime prevention, recording, detection or dealing with different types of crime such as domestic violence.  That struck me as a really strong overriding theme.  I will focus again on the issue of domestic violence and sexual offences, about which the Inspectorate makes some really clear recommendations.  In respect of rape in particular and serious sexual assault investigations, the inspectorate does not agree with the Garda policy that such investigations can be performed by all front-line garda&iacute; and considers it to be wrong.  Rather than that, the inspectorate recommends there should be dedicated rape investigation units.  I note that while the domestic violence and sexual offences unit is in place, the inspectorate commented on that by stating it appears to focus on sexual offences against children.  Is the inspectorate therefore suggesting this unit should be expanded in order that it has a remit to cover all sorts of serious sexual assault investigations?  Does it propose that a similar model should be used for domestic violence in order to have specialist garda&iacute; dealing with that or is it more that front-line garda&iacute; should be trained because they will be the first responders, particularly in domestic violence cases?  I am not quite clear as to precisely how the inspectorate proposes this should be changed.</p></speech>

While it performs some investigations, it tends to be involved in investigations into pornography or offences against children.  On the domestic violence side, the unit's role is to monitor and to provide support to divisions.  Each division in Ireland, of which there are 28, has a nominated inspector who is supposed to check each domestic violence incident but the volume of those crimes means this is not happening.  I believe the central unit should be checking where there is a serious domestic violence incident or a serious allegation of rape.  The unit should be contacting that division to make sure that everything possible is being done to give it advice and help, and to check that the matter is being investigated thoroughly.</p> <p>  As for what we are recommending, I believe there are 96 district stations in Ireland at present and, effectively, we look at them as being 96 separate units.  They work very much in isolation, have a superintendent in charge of them and one could have four or five districts within a division that could be operating completely differently, whereby they could be doing different things with the same crime.</p> <p>  Our report talks about divisions in Ireland, of which there are 28 at present, and we suggest that those divisions should investigate some serious offences with regard to some of the rape investigations and with regard to domestic violence in particular.  We recommend they should have a divisional unit with experienced detectives to deal with those cases.  Rape is one of the most difficult things to investigate as an investigator, and we have examples of young and inexperienced garda&iacute; who currently are dealing with those cases and when we have spoken to people, they are finding it highly stressful.  No investigation time is built into the current roster for many of those people and were it one of my family, I would want a trained investigator to investigate the crime.  Consequently, we suggest local investigation units.  The first garda will deal with it but a detective will then be called in who will take over that investigation because the attrition rates for serious sexual assaults are very high.  One needs trained people to investigate that crime who are well aware of the criminal justice system and the points to prove for a very serious crime.</p></speech>

Moreover, he or she needs to be providing an adequate level of service across all of Ireland.  Consequently, a lot of our focus is on the follow-up, which is where one can enable and create greater opportunities for follow-through on safety for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p><p>It is not an either-or situation.  One's front-line responders need to be invested in and trained up to a level for their level of response and then the specialised units are able to respond because there might be a time lag or delay and one needs to ensure that the pass-offs are seamless and that victims are supported not only from the initial report but as the investigation is ongoing.</p></speech>

The inspectorate makes the point that this was something it was asked to do pursuant to a request from the Minister.  It does not make any additional recommendations, following this additional inquiry, on the basis that its recommendations cover the issues in the Guerin report.  From my reading of the Guerin report, it seems - as was said - that supervision was a major issue and it has come out in the section on rape and domestic violence as in other sections.  There was a lack of supervision of young and inexperienced garda&iacute; dealing with crime investigation.  What does the inspectorate think is the most significant recommendation it has made on that?  I know it has made recommendations on enhanced supervision at all kinds of levels but where is the key area?  The Guerin report in that small microcosm of cases identified so many difficulties with supervision.</p></speech>

That is where these inconsistencies come up.  It is where I think mistakes are made and the supervision issue that the Senator brought up is also a critical component of that.  We found there was no significant audit of or follow-up to these incidents.  As Mr. Mark Toland said, now they have specific inspectors and people who have specific tasks, which number so many that one could not count them.  We found one person had 29 tasks for which they were responsible and they could not physically do them.  We found - as I said in regard to the fixed charge penalty report - that nobody is watching the store, and that is what went on here.  The sergeants are so busy doing all they are doing and the same applies to the inspectors, that there was no routine checking of every domestic violence call.  As Mr. Mark Toland said, nobody was checking that.  There might have been pockets of it happening but it is not consistently happening across the country.  When the supervisors are not watching, and it does not matter if one is a private secretary or where one is based, the employees will often go off on their tangents and in police work, which is most important, bad things can happen.</p></speech>

Often a sergeant will be on duty but they will doing other administrative functions.  There needs to be a patrol officer, a sergeant and an inspector available to go to the scene of an incident, to make sure a garda, whether experienced or inexperienced, deals with it effectively, and that they check, support, advise and mentor in that respect.  There is an absence of that in some places, particularly in the more rural parts where they have struggled with the number of sergeants and inspectors who are available and some units do not have a sergeant to start with.  There is no sergeant in place so one cannot criticise the sergeant.  In other places they are tied up with all sorts of other supervisory functions, where there is an absence of someone out on patrol available to go to an incident to make sure that one gets it right first time.</p> <p>  Much time in Ireland is wasted having to go back to a scene to do something because the action that should have been taken at the time was not completed.  A sergeant would make sure that those actions are taken, that the CCTV footage is collected and the statement is taken and that they would not have to go back to the scene.  Once one has all the evidence, one can make much better decisions about who is going to investigate it.  If one gets it wrong in the first, two or three hours of a crime incident, it is very hard to recover it.  Mistakes are made very early on and it is due to the absence of a sergeant, a physical presence.  Sergeants want to be present and we have recommended that there be a patrol sergeant.  Many sergeants we met would love to do that role.  Sergeants would be volunteering to go back to the front-line to do a role that meant they were doing what they enjoyed doing, which we all did, which is to be out and about, serving their community and dealing with the public, but also guiding youngsters.</p> <p>  The Garda is recruiting youngsters again and they are in Templemore.  That system needs to be in place when they come out of Templemore to make sure that inexperienced garda&iacute; in particular are well looked after, well mentored and that experience is passed on to them.</p></speech>

Everything is related but one thing that struck me is the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no electronic crime management system which is a major obstacle to consistency.</p> <p>  The reclassification of offences has been mentioned in the study which found that only 13% of reclassifications were correct and often no rationale was provided as an explanation.  The Garda Inspectorate and others identified this issue.  In July 2013 the change was made in the Garda which required that the rationale for reclassification be given.  Did the inspectorate see an improvement?  Has there been any sign that the reclassification of offences, usually to more minor offences, has made an impact or improved the situation?  </p></speech>

They were issued, predominantly, after we had finished most of our PULSE analysis so it is difficult for me to say whether the situation has improved.<br/><br/>We looked at specific crime types.  We found that 71% of the crimes that we looked at were reclassified incorrectly and only 13% were correctly reclassified.  In some of the other cases there was insufficient information.  We looked at particular crimes.  We did not look at every crime type.  It may well be that some other crime types or lesser offences were reclassified from one crime type to another.  We did notice that a lot of crimes were reclassified as a non-crime category or <i>vice versa</i>and suggest that this matter be looked at.<br/><br/>One needs to get the classification right in order to reduce the number of crimes that are reclassified.  Incorrect classification generates a huge amount of work.  Therefore, we recommend a complete change in the way classification is managed.  We also recommend that reclassification only take place once certain factors have been looked at and once the rationale is provided for same.  We found that there may be very good reasons for reclassification but they were not recorded on PULSE.  Therefore, we looked at something that did not explain why a crime was reclassified and there will be occasions where it is appropriate to do so.</p></speech>

When one has 96 different commands making decisions on policies then one gets this problem.</p> <p>  As the committee can see in our report, we have again recommended that the deciding authority for the reclassification of these things is maintained in one specific place and by one specific entity so that there is consistent classification and reclassification.  I am encouraged by the fact that the new Garda Commissioner has begun a process, at the Garda Information Service Centre.  We recommended that the centre was the best place to house one clear authority that will decide whether a crime should be reclassified and its classification category. </p></speech>

Ideally for the inspectorate, particularly in terms of the report on the fixed charge process and because of the new authority we were given to identify areas for review, and because classification and reclassification is such an important area, this is an area the inspectorate would go forward and look at.  In the future we might be better informed, relative to the outcome of the July 2013 action, and based on our anticipated powers.</p></speech>

The report is a comprehensive three-year assessment which could not have come at a more important time when more powers are about to be given to the Garda ombudsman and a new policing authority is being established.  This committee welcome these developments.</p> <p>  We have the report and recommendations but the recommendations need to be implemented.  The inspectorate recommended the establishment of a criminal justice service group comprised of all the relevant stakeholders.  Has a group been established?  Has the group started to implement the recommendations made by the inspectorate?  </p></speech>

I can inform the committee that we have had at least two or three briefings by this high level group who are fixing it and coming up with some really good stuff.  I am pretty much assured that the same process will be happening - a point I should make here is that we are not leaving this big issue sitting around on desks.  </p><p> New legislation was mentioned.  There is also a tiny paragraph 1.17, that people probably did not see in the proposed Bill, that will give us the authority to go out and inspect without having to wait for the Minister's approval.  I can guarantee the committee that the inspectorate will be monitoring this very closely and will be very public about the results of that.  On our website we have a implementation table and will do the same thing here.  We will be coming in, auditing and taking a look at things.</p></speech>

What we want is people who can break through operational barriers, decision makers from the criminal justice partners who can come together and make decisions about the way things are managed, such as the criminal justice service, and a much better service for a victim, much quicker trials and to get through the bureaucracy.  There is a real appetite from the criminal justice partners to come together at the highest level and to make decisions between those organisations.

In its report, the Garda inspectorate refers to the reality that in a number of areas its concerns apply not only to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to other elements of the criminal justice system.  Our committee has recommended a criminal justice inspectorate based on the model in the North.  What are the witnesses' thoughts  about that type of model being in place, given the role of the DPP, the courts system, policing presence, the whole spectrum of the system, and how it joins together so that the victim can see continuity and lessons being learned across the system?</p></speech>

The concern is that due to the crisis in recent years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has faced cutbacks, as have other elements of the public service.  In terms of any criticism of those cutbacks the Garda Commissioner would often have said it was being done for operational or efficiency reasons.  Rosters was one of the examples given that this is about a better police service.  Would the witnesses have concerns, having carried out this report, that some of the measures being implemented, while being presented to the public as efficient and for operational reasons, are really reflecting straight forward cutbacks and perhaps they should be more honest with the public about these matters?  It is a loaded question.  I am an Opposition Deputy and I have my view on this issue.  The witnesses may want to answer as they see fit and might deal with the rostering issue.</p></speech>

Let us set that aside.  We carried out an extensive examination of crime investigation.  The current universal roster being utilised is not fit for purpose for crime investigation.  It is as simple as that.  It hampers work.  Many investigations have not proceeded which perhaps could have proceeded if people were working when they were really needed on the investigation side.  In fact, this has raised such concern that we will include the point in our Haddington Road review as it relates to the entire organisation.  One size does not fit all.  People do so many different things.  We will be taking a good look at what everyone is doing, not only detectives, and whether this kind of work schedule - I am calling it a roster but it is a work schedule - is fit for purpose for whatever those officers are doing.</p></speech>

One of my questions was about rosters but I have no wish to ask Mr. Olson to repeat everything.  Having spoken to garda&iacute;, I gather the rosters they were working were not humane or family-orientated.  Garda&iacute; would do a late shift from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. and then come off a shift at 10 p.m. and go home only to be back in on an early shift the following morning at 6 a.m.  To my mind it is not right for people to work like that and I am unsure how it could have been effective from an investigation point of view.  Can Mr. Olson clarify exactly what is wrong with the times and why it does not work for investigation purposes?</p></speech>

There was a previous report on resource allocation, of which I was the author in a previous life.  In that report we said clearly that the roster had to be changed.  We even brought in a noted PhD on sleep awareness.  The expert was clear that it was killing them and that working that roster over 30 years would take years off their lives.  As a result, we laid out some criteria, not the least of which was the European working time agreement, to change that.</p> <p>  What has happened in this case?  I will try to stay specific to the investigative or detective process.  It was designed initially to try to get a bulge of people working primarily on the weekends at night.  When the study was carried out in 2007 or 2008 public order, particularly in rural areas, was a major issue and the force simply did not have people in place.  Consequently, the Garda designed a roster that would put more people out on the street during that timeframe.  It certainly accomplished that although it had some minuses because on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon when that number of garda&iacute; were not needed, they were tripping over each other.  That was not a good thing either.  There was a balance problem.  Anyway, as far as investigations are concerned, detectives need to be available to do investigative work.  Previously, many of them were not on a roster and were working from Monday through Friday from nine to five when the courts were open.  They had the ability to get warrants and follow-up with people at home.  They would work into the early evening hours to catch certain people, for example, witnesses who they could talk to after work.  Anyway, we do not need detectives sitting around at 1 a.m.  At that time they are not doing anything and they cannot talk to anyone.  They are not going to get CCTV footage and view it.  They cannot do any of that work at that time.  We can take this all the way down to garda&iacute;.  As Mr. Toland mentioned earlier, many garda&iacute; carry minor cases, although others are not so minor.  There are implications for their ability to work on such cases.  For example, a garda may have been working days and then suddenly changed to working nights.  At 2 a.m. he is not going to follow up on a case in those circumstances.</p> <p>  The four days off was a problem because basically they lost track of their cases.  Victims and witnesses did not have access to them.  We identified many problems in the report relative to that.  There is also the issue of working six straight ten-hour days in a row.  Let us suppose there is a court hearing and some hours of overtime as well and so on.</p><p>Every superintendent we talked to said that by the time they get to the fifth or sixth day, they are dragging and are not up to the full level of alertness and productivity that they should have.</p><p> We focus specifically in this report on the case accomplishment.  There would be a victim from whom they might have taken a report on the last day of their work and it is five or six days later before they even get a call in to them.  There is then the question of access to an open store so they can view their CCTV or do whatever else they had to do.  We found a myriad of problems that are identified in this report that indicated that probably was not a good idea for a criminal investigation.  We know the Commissioner has a group that is reviewing again this work schedule.  We will be anxious to see what they come up with but I can tell the Deputy that in the Haddington Road agreement review we will be making some more specific recommendations to the roster.</p></speech>

Small stations were closed down and people were moved into the towns.  Some would argue that was more cost effective than having a garda based in a small village.  Others would argue that a garda based in a village or small town would have local knowledge and therefore would be better from an investigation point of view.  Did Mr. Olson come across that and what were his views on it?</p></speech>

We did not look at it nor is there is anything in this report that would have some impact on the location and the number of Garda stations.  It was not the remit; it was not what we looked at.  We looked at crime investigation and how it was being accomplished, and the report will speak for itself.  I am listening to focus groups and whatnot.  I do not even remember that particular issue being brought up.  Mr. Toland might make some comments because he had a lot of community meetings as well to get citizens' input.  He might have a point on that, but we did not even look at the issue of Garda stations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#O00400"><p>I would make two comments.  I live in rural Ireland and have done for five years, and I have also closed police stations in my previous role.  People have a real emotional attachment to their Garda stations, and the fear of crime can sometimes be much higher than the reality of becoming a victim so I understand that closeness people have and I can understand when that is taken away.</p> <p>  What I found at community meetings is that people were looking for the individual garda to be available.  It was less about the station and more about the access to services.  It was about accessibility and being able to contact someone.  In some places the community Garda would give out their mobile phone number so people were far more reassured when they had access to services.  We make recommendations in here to the effect that if we close a police station or take someone out of a one-Garda station we need to make sure that people know they can have access either through a library, a clinic, a service or that the garda will be available.</p> <p>  Also, it is very hard to measure what a community officer does because quite often they are attending GAA events.  They have done a lot of great work with young children.  They are very good in terms of intelligence.  They know everybody.  They know three and four generations.  What we recommend is that the community officer should be retained but they should also be doing enforcement.  They should be investigating crime.  They should be dealing with a plethora of policing services, not just visiting people the same people.  My own staff used to do it.  They need to be out within the community.  They need to publicise when they will be available and people need access.  It is very important to see a visible presence of a police officer.  Many senior garda&iacute; have a dilemma.  Do they leave a police officer sitting in a Garda station at 1 o'clock in the morning waiting for someone to come in or would it be better to close the front counter service at night, put the garda in a car out on patrol?  It is about achieving a balance between the two.</p></speech>

Their report deals with the inconsistent approach to updating victims of crime, and many of the recommendations in the report relate to technology, restructuring and improved decision-making and supervision.  An issue I raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality in the Seanad recently was the question of whether a system like the TrackMyCrime system being used in several British constabularies could be the way to go.</p><p>I recall from the report that people's initial engagement with the Garda can be very satisfactory but it is after this that the problems can arise.  We all know we are dealing with a period when we have several thousand fewer garda&iacute; than we had.  There is a lot of pressure on garda&iacute; and it is not necessarily a lack of goodwill but a lack of personal availability.</p><p> Does Mr. Toland believe this approach is promising, namely, this idea that people would have an individual PIN or access to an online source of information about how the investigation of the crime they have reported is being pursued?  Are there any pitfalls in terms of the wrong kind of people accessing that information?  Could it prejudice fair trails?  If he does think such a system could work in Ireland, can it be developed and modelled in such a way that any possible pitfalls are avoided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#P00200"><p>The follow-up is very important.  What we have found is that, quite often, a victim is very pleased with the initial garda who comes and the service they get, but all that good work is lost when garda&iacute; do not update a victim.  Certainly, during the first few days after a crime, the victim wants a contact.  There are then key events such as the arrest or charging of a suspect, or a court date, and we have found that, quite often, a victim is not told of these.</p> <p>  We have suggested there are IT solutions which will prompt an investigator.  As an inspectorate, we are very committed to IT solutions.  I do not believe the current PULSE system would allow us to put another IT system onto it, which is one of the reasons we did not recommend it.  However, anything that provides online information to people is a terrific idea.  This has been launched in some forces in the UK.  It allows someone to get a progress report and I believe many of these things can be done just by having a system in place to prompt an investigator.  Many victims I have spoken to want that face-to-face contact or a telephone contact because they want to ask questions behind the information and they want to know what is going happen next.</p> <p>  Many garda&iacute; have spoken to us who are very frustrated because they struggle to keep the number of victims they are currently managing up to date.  If they go off duty for four days and have not updated all of their victims, there is a period where victims are left waiting.  Therefore, we welcome the victims offices.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed itself to rolling out a single point of contact victims office in every division in Ireland, and there are currently three or four operating long-term pilots.  That will allow a victim to pick up a telephone and ring a unit, and not have to try to find when an individual garda is going to be on duty.  We welcome the victims offices because they will give victims a single number they can ring to find out what is happening to their crime.</p> <p>  The IT would be terrific but the Garda needs to invest significantly in technology to allow people to track their crime.  We recommend in the report that crime information should be available to communities.  They should be able to go onto a website to see how many crimes are taking place in their community and where they are taking place.</p> <p>  Those are some of the recommendations we make.  I am very supportive of TrackMyCrime.</p></speech>

Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked about the working group to oversee the implementation of recommendations, and the witnesses answered that.  In part 11 of the recommendations, at recommendation No. 21, the inspectorate also recommends that the Department of Justice and Equality would consider establishing a criminal justice board.  This seems to me a more hands-on model to deal with issues around lapsing of criminal cases and addressing inefficiencies in the processes.  Has that recommendation been adopted or does the inspectorate know if it is being considered?</p></speech>

One is a board at a high level, which would include the Commissioner or a nominated deputy, plus the director of the Probation Service - a criminal justice board comprising the operational decision makers across Ireland.</p><p>Second, under that level we recommend each division has a criminal justice group which brings all the practitioners together.  Therefore, we would have a senior representative from the courts, a senior prosecutor, the senior probation officer and the divisional chief superintendent.  These people can then implement the policies of the criminal justice board.  Their role is to get through the blockages, to get trials through the courts more quickly and to ensure victims receive better services.  </p><p> We recommend that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have a criminal justice prosecutions unit.  Therefore, if a prosecutor wanted to contact somebody about a case, he could contact the criminal justice prosecutions unit.  Also, if a victim wanted to find out what was happening in regard to the case, there would be a central unit within that division to provide for that.  There would be three tiers - criminal justice units, groups and boards to provide for a more seamless criminal justice system.</p></speech>

There is so much in this report that we could probably spend three days discussing it.</p> <p>  I would like to put a few questions.  Mention has been made of the opportunity to develop a single intelligence unit for national support services.  This concerns intelligence matters, such as those issues that have been observed in France recently and major atrocities.  Often, we see a division between State intelligence and security issues and policing issues.  Will the delegates comment on how the issue of intelligence is divided and what changes and approaches are recommended in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert K. Olson" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#Q00400"><p>I will comment on that and Mr. Toland can follow up on what I say afterwards.  We were cognisant of this issue as we conducted that portion of the report.  It was interesting that the national units had never been inspected or audited previously.  It was a bit of a culture shock when we showed up, but they were great and co-operated fully and told us what they were doing.  This included any issues that might touch upon terrorism, national security and so on.  We made some confidential recommendations to the Minister relative to this issue, but that should not be made public.</p> <p>  The short answer is we looked at those kinds of issues and made some recommendations on them.  Perhaps Mr. Toland would like to comment further on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#Q00500"><p>I must be careful not to compromise tactics.  The national support units deal with issues like drugs and fraud and within those units there are a number of operational units that have their own intelligence unit, sometimes within the same building.  There are economies of scale and efficiencies to be made and a better way to manage intelligence within national support services would be to have a single intelligence unit.  Sitting above that, we could have another intelligence unit that would manage the more sensitive issues and security information.</p> <p>  At the level we are talking, which concerns operational investigations into drug smuggling and such issues, we suggest one unit would service those operational units far better and reduce the risk of two operational units looking at the same person and not knowing they were covering the same target.  Our recommendations are to stop those kinds of things from happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Debra Kirby" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#Q00600"><p>Ireland is unique because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na covers both national and local policing.  This creates certain challenges around State security and intelligence.  When we speak about intelligence within that context, this immediately concerns a higher level.  In the United States, we have had what are known as "fusion centres" in place for a number of years.  Basically, these centres bridge the divide relative to local and national intelligence.  The idea is that criminal intelligence sometimes feeds into national security issues and national security issues sometimes look at individuals also.  This is part of what we have seen happening in France.</p> <p>  The idea of collating and creating a single source of intelligence which more easily feeds up and down the chain relative to who needs to know what is more effective, rather than having multiple individual local units of intelligence that might create barriers tothe sharing of information and allowing us know who the real targets are and at what level.</p></speech>

How does the inspectorate see development taking place in this area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015011400002#Q00800"><p>There are some successful schemes.  Some 50% of the neighbourhood watch schemes operate in Dublin.  In rural parts, these schemes tend to be called "community alert" schemes, but they are equivalent.  These schemes are fantastic, because they engage the communities in looking after themselves and in getting involved in policing and looking after vulnerable neighbours.  When I lived in London, I was a co-ordinator of such schemes.  This involved a huge amount of work, probably more work than I did as a police officer, but it was very rewarding.  The community pulled together and became more vigilant and looked after each other's property.</p><p>Therefore, it is a win-win situation for the police service in getting people involved in policing and helping with crime prevention.</p><p> We have seen some excellent successes where the community has rung in with resulting prevention of crime or arrests of suspects.  Many neighbourhood watches start off with great enthusiasm, but if they are successful the enthusiasm tends to wane.  Approximately 30% of neighbourhood watches are described as dormant.  While they are operating in that they have signs up, people may have lost a bit of interest.  One must also ensure that one's neighbourhood watches are in the right area.  Are they in the hot spots for crime?  If not, one should focus on developing new watches or community alert schemes in areas that suffer from crime.  As one needs the police to provide information, attend meetings every so often and encourage people to property mark, there is a key role for local community officers to encourage the starting of schemes.</p><p> I acknowledge that it is a great deal of work, but it is very rewarding.  Internationally, a good neighbourhood watch will impact on crime levels and make the community more alert and aware.  Criminals do not want to operate in an area where people are marking property and are vigilant.  They would rather go where there are less vigilant neighbours.  I am a huge supporter, therefore, but note that it is not a one off.  There are some 4,000 to 5,000 schemes in operation and 30% of them could be working more effectively.  I would develop schemes in areas that are currently being attacked by criminals who feel free to operate in, for example, isolated rural communities.  I am a member of my local community alert scheme.  It is a very important thing to do.</p></speech>

We hear anecdotal complaints from members of the public about how a garda must spend all day in court only to have a case adjourned with resulting time and resource waste and management issues.  Mr. Olson has some things to say on that.  Could he outline his points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-14a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert K.

I remember clearly that resource allocation has always been a problem.  While it may have changed, at one point in time at least 25% of Garda overtime was for cops sitting around in court rooms with people rarely having to get up.  In this crime inspection, we found several areas of issue, particularly where expert witnesses are called and sit there all darned day.  One has just lost a whole day of an expert in ballistics.  They are not checking any guns, but are sitting in court.  That is why we have made recommendations that have to have everybody together.  We are going to try to look at that issue specific to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Haddington Road review.  There will be recommendations relevant to that whole court process.  However, as we have said in this and our previous inspection, one has to bring all of the players to the table.  It is not just An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Something that one agency does can impact on another agency.  If they are not talking to each other, they will not even know they had those impacts.  We are hopeful that will get worked out.</p></speech>

One of the things that is being done in the Circuit Court on the more serious offences is to have pre-trial hearings where parties are brought together a month before the trial date to ensure that the case is ready to go.  Have witnesses been warned, summonses been served, and all information disclosed so that when the parties come to court on the first day of trial everything is ready to go?  It is something that could be rolled out to the District Court - it is used in other jurisdictions - to ensure that cases are trial-ready.</p> <p>  So much time is wasted.  Professional witnesses are brought in and people who have given up a day of work attend to find that a case does not go ahead because a document or a witness has not been served.  If I was a witness, I would be frustrated that I had come to court.  It is not effective.  People should have to come to court on the day to give evidence and be released.  Many trials take place with video evidence, particularly where doctors have to give medical evidence which they can do via video link from their hospitals.  We recommend in our report that technology could reduce much of the time professional witnesses, people who live a long distance away or a garda who works in Kerry and must come to Dublin would have to spend in court.  That could be done through a video conference so that they are lost to policing or other work for an hour or two rather than a day or a day and a half.</p></speech>

At least, we dipped our toe in the water.  There is so much there and it is so comprehensive.  Again, I join with colleagues in congratulating the Garda Inspectorate on the fantastic work it has done on this and thanking the witnesses for their time here today.  I echo the points made by Mr. Olson at the beginning that the rank and file of the garda&iacute; do such good work, work very hard and very often put their lives and bodies on the line for the rest of us.  I saw three garda&iacute; on Grafton Street early this morning and I said that it was great to see garda&iacute; out there.  I take Mr. Olson's point.  One sees garda&iacute; on the beat and it gives us all that good feeling that they are there and looking out for us.  They do so much, not just front-line work.  So much goes on in policing.  It is very comprehensive.  I have no doubt that we will meeting with the Garda Inspectorate again in the future.  There is so much happening in this area.</p></speech>

Is iad sin d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le gear&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anann baill den phobal maidir le heaspa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a bh&iacute;onn ar f&aacute;il &oacute; chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, monat&oacute;ireacht n&oacute; faireach&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mbealach a chuireann comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a gcuid dualgais i bhfeidhm faoin Acht, comhairle a chur ar an bpobal maidir le cearta teanga agus comhairle a chur ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; maidir lena ndualgais faoin Acht.</p> <p>  Sa tr&eacute;imhse 10 mbliana go dt&iacute; deireadh na bliana 2013 bh&iacute; sa bhreis agus 6,000 gear&aacute;n faighte ag m'oifig, 96 imscr&uacute;d&uacute; oifigi&uacute;il seolta againn agus 213 l&eacute;irmheas n&oacute; ini&uacute;chta&iacute; d&eacute;anta ar chur i bhfeidhm sc&eacute;imeanna teanga chomh maith le monat&oacute;ireacht d&eacute;anta ar ghn&eacute;ithe eile den Acht.  Ba cheart dom a r&aacute; &oacute;n t&uacute;s gur oifig bheag &iacute; m'oifigse le s&eacute; st&aacute;tsheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; ar iasacht &oacute;n Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta agus is sol&aacute;thar de &euro;567,000 a bh&iacute; ceadaithe do m'oifig don bhliain 2014 agus ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilti&uacute; roimh an ard&uacute; go &euro;670,000 at&aacute; ceadaithe don oifig don bhliain 2015.  Fi&uacute; leis an ard&uacute; at&aacute; tagtha ar shol&aacute;thar airgid na hoifige f&aacute;gtar f&oacute;s go bhfuil s&iacute; ar cheann de na hoifig&iacute; st&aacute;it is l&uacute; sa t&iacute;r.</p> <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh oifig neamhspl&eacute;ach ann le cumhachta&iacute; faoi mar at&aacute; ag aon oifig Ombudsman eile chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le r&eacute;imse cearta teanga.  Roimh theacht ar an bhf&oacute;d d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la bh&iacute; ar shaor&aacute;naigh go mba ch&aacute;s leo easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge &oacute;n st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras dul i muin&iacute;n na gc&uacute;irteanna chun s&aacute;samh a fh&aacute;il ar &uacute;dar a ngear&aacute;in.  Is cur chuige costasach agus anr&oacute;iteach, &oacute; thaobh an tsaor&aacute;naigh agus an St&aacute;it, a bh&iacute; ag baint le c&aacute;s bunreacht&uacute;il a thionscnaimh chun faoiseamh a fh&aacute;il.  &Oacute; tharla cearta teanga an tsaor&aacute;naigh a bheith ag eascairt &oacute; st&aacute;das na Gaeilge sa Bhunreacht ba iad na c&uacute;irteanna an t-aon bhealach a bh&iacute; ar f&aacute;il chun na cearta sin a chosaint.</p> <p>  Leagan an tAcht amach creat in&aacute;r f&eacute;idir leis an saor&aacute;nach a chuid cearta a &eacute;ileamh ar bhealach at&aacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca &oacute; thaobh an riarach&aacute;in agus an chostais de.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn l&iacute;on na ngear&aacute;in a fhaigheann m'oifig go bhfuil muin&iacute;n ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta as &aacute;r gcumas dul i ngleic le gear&aacute;in a bhaineann le heaspa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a bheith ar f&aacute;il &oacute;n st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Teasta&iacute;onn oifig neamhspl&eacute;ach mar go bhfuil s&eacute; l&eacute;irithe cheana f&eacute;in gurbh &eacute; seo an t-aon bhealach ar f&eacute;idir leis an bpobal a bheith muin&iacute;neach go mbeidh tuiscint ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; cearta teanga agus cumhachta&iacute; cu&iacute; ar f&aacute;il chun dul i ngleic leis na deacrachta&iacute; a thagann chun cinn.</p> <p>  T&aacute; iarrtha ag an gcomhchoiste orm mo chuid tuairim&iacute; a roinnt libh maidir le r&oacute;l, feidhm agus &eacute;ifeacht na gc&oacute;rais ina n-oibr&iacute;onn oifig&iacute; Ombudsman f&uacute;thu.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; sin i gcomhth&eacute;acs m'oifig f&eacute;in.</p> <p>  Tos&oacute;idh m&eacute; leis an Acht f&eacute;in mar is &eacute; sin an bunchloch ar a bhfuil cearta reacht&uacute;il teanga an tsaor&aacute;naigh agus mo chumhachtaigh mar Choimisin&eacute;ara chun na cearta sin a chosaint leagtha amach.  M&uacute;nla&iacute;odh an tAcht ar dh&aacute; ch&oacute;ras a bh&iacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id i ndl&iacute;ns&iacute; eile - c&oacute;ras an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga a bh&iacute; bunaithe i gCeanada agus c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a bh&iacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id sa Bhreatain Bheag.  D&eacute;ile&aacute;lann an tAcht leis na cearta teanga a bhaineann le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la i dTithe an Oireachtais, in Achtanna an Oireachtais, sna c&uacute;irteanna, i measc comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; agus &uacute;s&aacute;id na logainmneacha oifigi&uacute;la.  Go pr&iacute;omha is iad comhl&iacute;onadh na ndualgais at&aacute; leagtha ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; faoin Acht is m&oacute; a bh&iacute;onn m'oifig ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo.  N&iacute; miste liom a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute; gur l&iacute;on teoranta dualgais dh&iacute;reacha a leagtar ar gach comhlacht poibl&iacute; a thagann faoi sc&aacute;th na reachta&iacute;ochta.</p> <p>  Baineann na dualgais sin le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la ar st&aacute;isean&oacute;ireacht, comhartha&iacute;ocht, f&oacute;gairt&iacute; taifeadta b&eacute;il agus cumars&aacute;id scr&iacute;ofa &aacute;irithe.  Chomh maith leis sin t&aacute; dualgas ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; l&iacute;on teoranta doicim&eacute;id a fhoilsi&uacute; sa d&aacute; theanga oifigi&uacute;il.  Ina dhiaidh sin t&aacute; na dualgais at&aacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ag brath ar an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute;onn daingnithe ag an Aire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta in aon sc&eacute;im teanga leis an gcomhlacht poibl&iacute;.  N&iacute; g&aacute; dom a thabhairt le fios in athuair an t-imn&iacute; at&aacute; l&eacute;irithe agam roimhe seo maidir le feidhmi&uacute; ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.</p> <p>  Mar is eol don choiste, t&aacute; ceannteidil an bhille leasaithe d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la foilsithe anois le roinnt m&iacute;onna.  Roimhe sin d'fhoilsigh m'oifig tr&aacute;chtas ar fheidhmi&uacute; an Achta in&aacute;r leagadh amach molta&iacute; ar bheala&iacute; ina bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; cearta teanga an tsaor&aacute;naigh a chosaint ar bhealach n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute;.  Ar aon l&eacute;amh idir an d&aacute; ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is sin is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil bearna&iacute; suntasacha eatarthu.  Baineann na bearna&iacute; sin go pr&iacute;omha leis na cearta teanga a ch&oacute;ir a bheith ar f&aacute;il do phobail ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge f&oacute;s in uachtar iontu mar theanga labhartha laeth&uacute;il agus r&oacute;l na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga sa chreat cearta teanga.  Baineann cearta teanga le gach saor&aacute;nach, cearta at&aacute; cosanta n&iacute; amh&aacute;in i reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in ach freisin i mBunreacht na t&iacute;re.  San Acht leasaithe t&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go leagfa&iacute; amach cur chuige soil&eacute;ir a fhreastal&oacute;idh ar na riachtanais a eascra&iacute;onn &oacute;na cearta sin.  </p> <p>  Tuigim nach scr&uacute;d&uacute; ar na ceannteidil at&aacute; mar &aacute;bhar do sheisi&uacute;n an lae inniu agus d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin n&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist agam d&eacute;ile&aacute;il go mion leis an &aacute;bhar seo.  Ba mhaith liom mar sin f&eacute;in an pointe a dh&eacute;anamh go bhfuil mo chumas cosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar chearta teanga an tsaor&aacute;naigh ag brath n&iacute; h-amh&aacute;in ar na cumhachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il dom ach freisin ar an reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; mar bhonn agus mar thaca do na cearta sin.  Ar an &aacute;bhar sin t&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il gur bhain 28% de na himscr&uacute;duithe a rinneadh go dt&iacute; seo le f&oacute;r&aacute;lacha teanga a bh&iacute; d&eacute;anta i reachta&iacute;ocht seachas Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la - reachta&iacute;ocht ar n&oacute;s an tAcht Oideachais, Acht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agus an tAcht lompair i measc cinn eile.</p> <p>  N&iacute; miste liom a lua freisin nach dtagann gach comhlacht poibl&iacute; faoi sc&aacute;th na reachta&iacute;ochta.  Is iad na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; sin amh&aacute;in at&aacute; ainmnithe faoi sceideal an Achta a thagann faoi sc&aacute;th na reachta&iacute;ochta.  Is don Aire nuashonr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an sceideal sin, gn&iacute;omh n&aacute;r rinneadh ach an t-aon uair amh&aacute;in agus &eacute; sin sa bhliain 2006.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m mar sin roimh an moladh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta sna ceannteidil go dtabharfa&iacute; comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; faoi sc&aacute;th na reachta&iacute;ochta go huathoibr&iacute;och agus t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; an m&eacute;id sin.</p> <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar cheann d'fhor&aacute;lacha an Achta gur oifig neamhsple&aacute;ch &iacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  Is f&eacute;idir liom a dhearbh&uacute; go bhfeidhm&iacute;onn m'oifig ar an mbun&uacute;s sin.  An m&eacute;id sin r&aacute;ite t&aacute; an sol&aacute;thar airgid agus acmhainn&iacute; daonna at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do m'oifig ag brath ar thoil an Aire.  Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam roimhe seo, is oifig an-bheag &iacute; m'oifig agus cos&uacute;il le heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile beidh &eacute;ifeacht agus tionchar &aacute;r gcuid oibre ag brath ar d&oacute;thain foirne a bheith ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn chun &aacute;r gcuid dualgais a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  C&eacute; nach raibh aon tionchar aige ar m'oifig go dt&iacute; seo is &eacute;asca an ceangal a dh&eacute;anamh gur f&eacute;idir tionchar a imirt ar &eacute;ifeacht eagra&iacute;ocht nuair at&aacute;thar ag brath ar shol&aacute;thar airgid agus foirne an mh&aacute;thair eagra&iacute;ocht.  Taca&iacute;m mar sin leis an dearcadh a l&eacute;ir&iacute;odh roimhe seo gur cheart an m&uacute;nla at&aacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id do mhaoini&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Ombudsman a scr&uacute;d&uacute;.</p> <p>  Mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga t&aacute; s&eacute; de chumhacht agam imscr&uacute;d&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh le f&aacute;il amach ar bhf&eacute;adfadh gur sh&aacute;raigh comhlacht poibl&iacute; for&aacute;lacha an Achta n&oacute; for&aacute;lacha aon achtach&aacute;in eile a bhaineann le st&aacute;das n&oacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id teanga oifigi&uacute;il.  Is f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh de thoradh gear&aacute;n, ar mo thionscnamh f&eacute;in n&oacute; ar iarraidh &oacute;n Aire.  Feidhm&iacute;onn m'oifig c&oacute;ras neamhfhoirmi&uacute;il ina r&eacute;it&iacute;tear formh&oacute;r mh&oacute;r na ngear&aacute;in a thagann faoi mo bhr&aacute;id.  I gc&aacute;sanna ina nd&eacute;anaim imscr&uacute;d&uacute; reacht&uacute;il agus a n-eis&iacute;tear tuarasc&aacute;il le fionnachtain agus molta&iacute;, is f&eacute;idir le haon ph&aacute;irt&iacute; n&oacute; duine ina bhf&eacute;adfadh an m&eacute;id sin difear a dh&eacute;anamh d&oacute; n&oacute; di, achomharc a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ard Ch&uacute;irt ar phonc dl&iacute; i gcoinne an chinnidh.</p><p>M&aacute;s amhlaidh nach gcuireann comhlacht poibl&iacute; molta&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn d&eacute;anta i dtuarasc&aacute;il imscr&uacute;duithe i bhfeidhm tar &eacute;is tr&eacute;imhse r&eacute;as&uacute;nach ama a bheith caite, is f&eacute;idir liom an m&eacute;id sin a thuairisci&uacute; chuig Tithe an Oireachtais.  Go dt&iacute; seo t&aacute; s&eacute; thuarasc&aacute;il leagtha againn faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais.</p><p> I bhformh&oacute;r na gc&aacute;sanna a chuir m'oifig faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais go dt&iacute; seo n&iacute;or sh&eacute;an na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; na fionnachtain a bh&iacute; d&eacute;anta sna tuarasc&aacute;lacha imscr&uacute;daithe.  Is &eacute; gur mha&iacute;gh siad nach raibh d&oacute;thain acmhainn&iacute; acu chun na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &aacute;bhartha a bh&iacute; &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il i mB&eacute;arla a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge chomh maith.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach ag an gcoiste seo m&iacute;nithe a lorg &oacute; chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ar na c&uacute;iseanna a roghna&iacute;onn siad gan molta&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn d&eacute;anta i dtuarasc&aacute;il reacht&uacute;il a chur i bhfeidhm i gc&aacute;sanna den chine&aacute;l seo.  Is &eacute; &aacute;r dtaith&iacute; go bhfuil tionchar &eacute;ifeachtach ag an bhfor&aacute;il seo sa chinneadh a dh&eacute;anann comhlacht poibl&iacute; maidir le molta&iacute; reacht&uacute;la a chur i bhfeidhm.</p><p> M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn an comhlacht poibl&iacute; den tuairim &aacute;fach go raibh na fionnachtain a rinneadh sa ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os lochtach t&aacute; an rogha ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh d&uacute;shl&aacute;n an chinneadh sin a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sna c&uacute;irteanna, &aacute;it gur f&eacute;idir l&eacute;irmh&iacute;ni&uacute; dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il a fh&aacute;il.  Feicim mar sin f&eacute;in go bhf&eacute;adfadh comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a easaonta&iacute;onn le cinnt&iacute; imscr&uacute;duithe, ar bhonn l&eacute;irmh&iacute;nithe, a bheith ag roghn&uacute; gan d&uacute;shl&aacute;n c&uacute;irte a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i gcoinne na gcinnt&iacute; sin ach ina ionad sin teacht i l&aacute;thair Coiste Oireachtais chun a gc&aacute;s a chur os a gcomhair.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh gur iarracht a bheadh anseo an d&aacute; thr&aacute; a fhreastal.</p><p> C&eacute; go nd&iacute;r&iacute;tear aird phoibl&iacute; ar thuarasc&aacute;lacha a chuirim faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais ag tr&aacute;th a bhfoilsithe n&iacute;l aon chl&aacute;r l&aacute;rnach poibl&iacute; ann a thugann le fios go h&eacute;asca agus go lean&uacute;nach c&eacute; hiad na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; at&aacute; neamhgh&eacute;illi&uacute;il do reachta&iacute;ocht teanga n&oacute; go deimhin do reachta&iacute;ocht eile.  D'fheicfinn go bhf&eacute;adfadh r&oacute;l a bheith ag a leith&eacute;id de chl&aacute;r mar shl&iacute; le cur ina lu&iacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; clo&iacute; le molta&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn d&eacute;anta in imscr&uacute;duithe reacht&uacute;il.  D'fheicfinn go bhf&eacute;adfadh r&oacute;l a bheith ag coiste Oireachtais comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a chl&aacute;r&uacute; n&oacute; a bhaint den taifead, tar &eacute;is an c&aacute;s a mheas.  Ba ionann a leith&eacute;id de thaifead agus aitheantas an Oireachtais go raibh an s&aacute;r&uacute; suntasach a dh&oacute;thain le bheith aitheanta.</p><p> Is &eacute; bun agus barr an Achta n&aacute; go mbeadh cearta teanga ar f&aacute;il do shaor&aacute;naigh na t&iacute;re seo gur mian leo a &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il ina gcuid gn&oacute;tha&iacute; oifigi&uacute;la leis an St&aacute;t.  Is &eacute; mo r&oacute;l n&aacute; cosaint a thabhairt do na cearta sin.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh leis an gCoiste as an deis labhairt leis inniu agus d'fh&aacute;ilteoinn roimh aon cheisteanna at&aacute; ag na baill.</p></speech>

T&aacute; l&iacute;on na ngearr&aacute;n a fritheadh anuraidh beag&aacute;n n&iacute;os airde n&aacute; an bhliain roimhe sin agus th&aacute;inig ard&uacute; beag chomh maith ar l&iacute;on na ngearr&aacute;n a th&aacute;inig isteach ag an oifig.

T&aacute; an Bhreatain Bheag ag imeacht anois &oacute; ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  An moladh at&aacute; agam do Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la n&aacute; go mbeadh r&oacute;l n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag rialach&aacute;in san Acht - go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; rialach&aacute;n maidir le dualgais a chur ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, seachas ar sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.

Mar shampla, i measc na sc&eacute;imeanna a aonta&iacute;odh anuraidh, 2014, bh&iacute; sc&eacute;im teanga &uacute;dar&aacute;s aerfort na Sionainne.  Deirtear ag an t&uacute;s gur ceann de na modhanna cumars&aacute;ide is m&oacute; at&aacute; acu le d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an bpobal &eacute; an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;on at&aacute; acu, ach nuair a th&eacute;ann duine tr&iacute;d an sc&eacute;im teanga deirtear maidir leis an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;on go bhfoilseoidh siad tuarasc&aacute;ileacha corp&aacute;ideacha bliainti&uacute;il agus mar sin de ar an su&iacute;omh - agus sin &eacute;.  T&aacute; an dualgas sin orthu ar aon n&oacute;s.  Go bun&uacute;sach, s&eacute;ard at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; acu n&aacute; seachas foilseach&aacute;in corpor&aacute;ideach an tuarasc&aacute;la bhliainti&uacute;il agus mar sin de, nach mbeidh aon rud eile i nGaeilge ar an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;on.  T&aacute; seo ag tarl&uacute; tar &eacute;is os cionn deich mbliana den Acht Teanga a bheith againn.  T&aacute; an comhlacht seo ag r&aacute; nach mbeidh an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;on ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge, tar &eacute;is a admh&aacute;il gur sin an modh cumars&aacute;ide at&aacute; acu leis an bpobal.</p> <p>  Sampla eile in ar chuir m&eacute; suntas m&oacute;r, mar gur iar-iriseoir m&eacute;, n&aacute; sc&eacute;im teanga na Roinne Airgeadais.  Deirtear sa sc&eacute;im a aonta&iacute;odh anuraidh go m&eacute;ad&oacute;fa&iacute; l&iacute;on na bpreasr&aacute;iteas a bheidh &aacute; eisi&uacute;int acu, &oacute; 20% go 25%.  Aonta&iacute;m gur ard&uacute; &eacute; sin, ach deirtear chomh maith mura nd&eacute;antar &eacute; ag an am c&eacute;anna, go nd&eacute;anfar &eacute; taobh istigh de 24 uair.  Samhlaigh a bheith mar iriseoir agus d'eagarth&oacute;ir nuachta ag r&aacute; leat go bhfuil s&eacute; ag iarraidh an sc&eacute;il sin a chur amach agus go ndeireann tusa go gcaithfidh t&uacute; fanacht 24 uair go bhfaighidh to an preasr&aacute;iteas mar nach bhfuil s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il f&oacute;s.  T&aacute; seo ag tarl&uacute; tar &eacute;is deich mbliana de reachta&iacute;ocht teanga.  An moladh a bheadh agam n&aacute; go mbeadh dualgais soil&eacute;ara leagtha s&iacute;os sa reachta&iacute;ocht i bhfoirm rialach&aacute;in a leagfadh dualgais &aacute;irithe ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, seachas a bheith ag brath go hioml&aacute;n ar sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, le go mbeadh bealach eile, bealach n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute;, le dul i bhfeidm ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;. </p> <p>  Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir comhlachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha chomh maith.  Sampla amh&aacute;in a fheicim i m'&aacute;it fh&eacute;in i nGaillimh, &aacute;it a bhfuil leith&eacute;id "Gaillimh le Gaeilge" ann a dh&eacute;anann go leor oibre maidir le Gaeilge a chur chun cinn san earn&aacute;il phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach agus i measc lucht gn&oacute;.  Go minic, braitheann s&eacute; le cur ina lu&iacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineann le Gaeilge a bheith ag daoine at&aacute; ag obair leo agus nithe a bheith ar f&aacute;il i gGaeilge agus go gcuid&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin leo go rialta, ach t&aacute; go leor ar &aacute;r bpl&aacute;ta cheana f&eacute;in le comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; gan d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar sin go sonrach.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir ag r&aacute; linn gur mhaith an rud &eacute; na hAchtanna sin - mar shampla, an tAcht Oideachais 1998, Acht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 1924 agus an tAcht Iompair, 1950 - a chl&uacute;dach in aon reachta&iacute;ocht nua a bheadh i gceist.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil deis ann go mbeidh an coiste in ann tac&uacute; leis an moladh sin.</p><p> D&uacute;irt an coimisin&eacute;ir freisin gur mhaith an rud a bheadh ann d&aacute; mbeadh c&oacute;ras uathoibr&iacute;och i gceist amach anseo nuair a bhuna&iacute;tear comhlacht poibl&iacute;.  Mhol s&eacute; go dtiocfadh a leith&eacute;id de chomhlacht go huathoibr&iacute;och faoin reachta&iacute;ocht nua.  An bhfuil deacracht idir an d&aacute; linn leis na comhlachta&iacute; eile nach bhfuil daingnithe n&oacute; ainmnithe ag an Aire go f&oacute;ill, agus comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; eile a buna&iacute;odh &oacute; cuireadh na bunliosta&iacute; le ch&eacute;ile?  An bhfuil g&aacute; le meicn&iacute;ocht &eacute;igin chun na heagrais nua St&aacute;it a buna&iacute;odh &oacute; cuireadh an ch&eacute;ad liosta le ch&eacute;ile, agus nach bhfuil san &aacute;ireamh go f&oacute;ill, a th&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh?</p><p> B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil tuairim ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir ar cheist shonrach amh&aacute;in a th&aacute;inig chun cinn le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; anuas.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Craolach&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann faoi sc&aacute;th Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga, ach tuigtear dom go bhfuil cinneadh d&eacute;anta ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s sin le tamaill&iacute;n anuas maidir le gear&aacute;n a leagadh isteach faoi &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge ar chl&aacute;racha &aacute;irithe a bh&iacute; &aacute; gcraoladh.  Tuigim gur aontaigh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s le leath den ghear&aacute;in, agus n&aacute;r aontaigh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s leis an leath eile.  N&iacute;or ghlac an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s leis gur gr&uacute;pa saini&uacute;il sa tsocha&iacute;, a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; aird faoi leith a thabhairt orthu, iad Gaeilgeoir&iacute;.

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam go bhfuil cumhachta&iacute; faoi leith sna hAchtanna sin a chuireann dualgais&iacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, agus gur maith ann iad.  B&iacute;onn an-tionchar acu ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute;.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; s&eacute; luaite in Acht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 1924 go gcaithfidh Gaeilge a bheith ag garda&iacute; at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Is as sin a d'eascair an imscr&uacute;d&uacute; a rinne Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga faoi l&iacute;on na ngarda&iacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta, agus is as sin a d'eascair an pr&oacute;iseas earca&iacute;ochta at&aacute; ar bun ag an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na chun breis daoine le Gaeilge a earc&uacute;.  B'fhi&uacute; f&eacute;achaint an bhfuil aon rud le foghlaim &oacute; Achtanna mar sin &oacute; thaobh neart agus br&iacute; agus iad a chur faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la chomh maith.</p> <p>  Maidir le comhlachta&iacute; a thabhairt isteach go huathoibr&iacute;och, t&aacute; s&eacute; sin luaite i gcinn an Bhille a fhoils&iacute;odh an bhliain seo caite.  Nuair a fhoils&iacute;tear an reachta&iacute;ocht, t&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh s&eacute; le feice&aacute;il go dtabharfar isteach aon chomhlacht a bhuna&iacute;tear amach anseo go huathoibr&iacute;och faoin Acht.  N&iacute; cheart go mbeimid ag fanacht le ord&uacute; &oacute; Aire Rialtas, &oacute;n D&aacute;il n&oacute; &oacute;n Oireachtas chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba cheart go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; go huathoibr&iacute;och.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, n&iacute;or tharla s&eacute; seo ach uair amh&aacute;in go dt&iacute; seo.  Chonaic muid sampla&iacute; den fhadhb seo i gc&aacute;s Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig s&eacute; go huathoibr&iacute;och faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Da bhr&iacute; sin, n&iacute; raibh dualgais&iacute; ar an gcomhlacht sin &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge.  Is fi&uacute; a lua go ndearna siad roinnt nithe suntasacha agus t&aacute;bhachtacha &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge.  Bh&iacute; deacachta&iacute; f&oacute;s ann &oacute; thaobh foirmeacha iarratais ar l&iacute;ne.</p> <p>  Fuair Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga 115 gear&aacute;n anuraidh ina ioml&aacute;ine nach rabhamar in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo toisc n&aacute;r th&aacute;inig na comhlachta&iacute; sin faoi sc&aacute;th Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la mar gheall nach raibh sceideal ann a bh&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; go huathoibr&iacute;och chun comhlachta&iacute; a thabhairt isteach faoin Acht.  Bhain 40 acu sin leis an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Sh&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht ar Bh&oacute;ithre, 17 acu le Uisce &Eacute;ireann agus tr&iacute; cinn acu leis an tSeirbh&iacute;s N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta T&aacute;st&aacute;la Gluaiste&aacute;n, leis an Comhairle Mh&uacute;inteoireachta agus leis an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s Rial&aacute;la Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Maoine.  D'&eacute;irigh leis na gear&aacute;naigh r&eacute;itigh neamhfhoirmi&uacute;la a fh&aacute;il i gcuid de na c&aacute;sanna sin in ainneoin nach raibh dualgas reacht&uacute;la ar na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is faoi chaibidil.  Cuideodh s&eacute; go m&oacute;r d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; ann go dtabharfar comhlachta&iacute; nua isteach go huathoibr&iacute;och.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag tn&uacute;th go gcuirfear &eacute; sin ar f&aacute;il nuair a fhoilseofar an Bhille nua.  Glacaim leis go mbeidh na comhlachta&iacute; ar fad faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta nuair a bheidh an reachta&iacute;ocht nua i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin go maith, ach c&eacute;ard a tharl&oacute;idh nuair a bheidh comhlacht nua &aacute; bhun&uacute; tar &eacute;is foilsi&uacute; an Achta?  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an dualgas seo ar f&aacute;il go huathoibr&iacute;och.</p> <p>  An chaoi is fearr go bhf&eacute;adfainn an cheist a chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir maidir le tr&aacute;chtas ar an Acht a fhreagairt n&aacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil an chumhacht agam de r&eacute;ir for&aacute;lacha an Achta labhairt ar fheidhmi&uacute; an Achta.  Rinne an oifig tr&aacute;chtas ar fheidhmi&uacute; an Achta p&iacute;osa &oacute; shin.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, t&aacute; bearna idir an m&eacute;id a fheiceann muid at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il &oacute;n bpobal - &oacute; na gear&aacute;in a thagann isteach agus &oacute; bheith ag labhairt leis an bpobal - agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; foilsithe i gcinn an Bhille.  T&aacute; tr&iacute; mh&oacute;r-rud at&aacute; in easnamh, dar liom.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba cheart go mbeadh rang&uacute; i gcatag&oacute;ir&iacute; d&eacute;anta ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ag brath ar an m&eacute;id teagmh&aacute;il a bh&iacute;onn acu leis an bpobal.  Mar shampla, d'fh&eacute;adfadh 40 n&oacute; 50 comhlacht at&aacute; bainteach go pr&iacute;omha leis an bpobal bheith i gcatag&oacute;ir A, le comhlachta&iacute; eile i gcatag&oacute;ir B agus comhlachta&iacute; eile i gcatag&oacute;ir C.  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, is d&oacute;igh linn gur cheart go mbeadh rialach&aacute;in leagtha s&iacute;os go d&iacute;reach sa reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in, gan bheith ag brath ar aon sc&eacute;im teanga, a leagann dualgais&iacute; ar na comhlachta&iacute; sin, ag brath ar c&eacute;n chatag&oacute;ir ina bhfuil siad.  Bheadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; dualgas ar chomhlacht i gcatag&oacute;ir A i gcompar&aacute;id le comhlacht i gcatag&oacute;ir B, mar shampla.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh sc&eacute;im teanga bheith mar chrann taca d&oacute;ibh, seachas bheith mar chro&iacute;l&aacute;r na ndualgais at&aacute; orthu.  Ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, ba cheart go mbeadh for&aacute;il dh&iacute;reach sa reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do mhuintir na Gaeltachta - go mbeadh dualgas ar oifigigh St&aacute;it at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, n&oacute; at&aacute; ag cur seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il sna ceantair aitheanta sin, a leith&eacute;id a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;l na tr&iacute; rud sin i gcinn an Bhille mar at&aacute; siad faoi l&aacute;thair.  Is easnamh at&aacute; ansin.</p> <p>  Chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir ceist orm faoi &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Craolach&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann.  Chuala m&eacute; faoin mh&eacute;id a tharla ar mo bhealach suas go Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar maidin, ach n&iacute; bhfuair m&eacute; deis an rial&uacute; sin a scr&uacute;d&uacute; go f&oacute;ill.
