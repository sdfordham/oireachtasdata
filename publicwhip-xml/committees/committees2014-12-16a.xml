    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paschal Hayes" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014121600005#F00200"><p>As members know, the European Commission, DG MARE, has launched a public consultation on its draft new guidelines for the examination of state aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector.  The consultation runs until 20 January 2015.  The objective of the consultation is to collect stakeholder views on the draft guidelines.  The Commission has previously sought member states' views earlier this autumn through its advisory committee on state aid, on which the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine was represented.<br/>The new guidelines are intended to replace the present guidelines of the same title, which have been in force since 2007.  Under the treaties, the Commission is responsible for considering state aid notifications and as such, the Commission will make the final decision on the wording of these guidelines and on how they will perform that task.  The new guidelines will set out the principles that the Commission will apply when assessing whether proposed aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector can be considered to be compatible with the internal market.  The guidelines apply to all state aid granted by member states to the fishery and aquaculture sector that has been notified, or should have been notified, to the Commission in accordance with the treaties.  The Commission is moving to update the current guidelines in order to regularise references to legal acts mentioned in the guidelines, thereby aligning them with the Commission's state aid modernisation initiative, the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund regulation. <br/>State aid rules for the fisheries and aquaculture sector differ from the rules applying generally to other areas of the food industry.  The Commission's proposed new guidelines should be viewed as part of a broader legal framework for state aid to the fisheries and aquaculture sector.  That broader legal framework includes four elements: the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund regulation; the <i>De Minimis</i>regulation for the fisheries and aquaculture sector; the fisheries block exemption regulation; and these guidelines for the examination of state aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector.  It is important to note that these are essentially a form of cascade where a proposed support measures for the seafood sector will generally only be notified to the Commission through a state aid notification if it is not possible legally to implement that measure through one of the other three options.By way of example, during the last EU funding round from 2007 to the present, it has not been necessary to submit a state aid notification to the Commission for any of the many schemes implemented in Ireland to support the development of the seafood sector.  The guidelines come into play only when it is necessary to submit a state aid notification.<br/>I will very briefly explain the nature of each of the four instruments.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, regulation or is undoubtedly the most important.  The EMFF is one of the four European structural and investment funds together with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  Together, these European Structural and Investment Funds are intended to support measures to address the EU 2020 strategy.  The EMFF is intended in particular to support the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and is considered the financial instrument of the CFP.  <br/>The EMFF is solely concerned with measures that are co-funded by the EU.  It does not have anything to say about measures funded solely by the Irish Exchequer.  The vast majority of measures implemented through the EMFF do not require state aid notification.  They are considered to automatically comply with state aid rules.  There are two exceptions which are not covered by this exemption: support to fishery local action groups and supports under the Integrated Maritime Policy both of which are provided for in the EMFF regulation.  These two measures are excluded from the state aid notification exemption that generally applies to EMFF measures as they are outside the CFP.  However, they may potentially be covered by non-fisheries block exemptions.  That remains to be examined but in any case those measures are also outside the scope of these guidelines, again for the same reason that they are not covered by the CFP.<br/>The Minister is preparing a new seafood development programme, SDP, for the period 2014 to 2020 to implement investment in the seafood sector with co-funding from the EMFF.  The committee will have seen previous announcements from the Minister as part of budget 2015 announcing that the new SDP will have total funds of &euro;241 million, of which &euro;146.7 million is from EU funds and &euro;93.9 million is from the Irish Exchequer.  The new SDP will include a range of investment measures to encourage and foster the further sustainable development and growth of our seafood industry, including aquaculture, processing, the fishing fleet and coastal communities.  Some &euro;142 million of the SDP funds will go towards this core sectoral development purpose, which is more than twice the &euro;66 million available under the previous programme, which was the European Fisheries Fund.  The SDP will also directly fund &euro;46 million in new investments to support our capacity to enforce the rules of the CFP and a further &euro;41 million to fund the science that supports our fisheries management together with &euro;11 million for implementation of the new EU Integrated Maritime Policy and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid supports.  The Government has made available &euro;15 million in 2015 to commence investment measures under the new SDP and this will rise significantly in following years as the programme is fully rolled out.<br/>The second measure is the <i>De Minimis</i>regulation.  A new <i>De Minimis</i>regulation for the seafood sector was adopted by the Commission in June 2014.  The so-called fisheries <i>De Minimis</i>regulation is concerned solely with measures funded by the Exchequer.  Measures implemented through <i>De Minimis</i>are not considered state aid.  The fisheries <i>De Minimis</i>regulation provides wide scope to member states to provide nationally funded supports to enterprises in the seafood sector up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 per beneficiary and up to &euro;20.8 million nationally over a rolling three-year period and subject to certain exclusions specified in the regulation.  While the &euro;30,000 cap restricts its usefulness somewhat, it is a very useful instrument for smaller interventions that are not permitted under instruments such as the EMFF or the fisheries block exemption regulation.<br/>BIM implements its fleet safety grants through <i>De Minimis</i>as these are not eligible under the EMFF or its predecessor, the European Fisheries Fund, nor under the block exemption.  BIM also implemented the pot replacement scheme earlier this year through <i>De Minimis</i>, while Enterprise Ireland uses it to implement its marketing assistance programme for seafood companies.  A separate general <i>De Minimis</i>regulation applies to the food sector generally, excluding seafood, and this has a significantly higher cap of &euro;200,000 per beneficiary.  The significant difference in the cap applying to food companies in different sectors has been highlighted by Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia as a difficulty.  However, the Commission is not open to increases in the cap on the fisheries <i>De Minimis</i>.<br/>The third regulation is the fisheries block exemption regulation.  The fisheries block exemption regulation or so-called FIBER is concerned solely with measures funded by the Exchequer.  </p> <p>Like the guidelines at present and the fisheries <i>de minimis</i>regulation earlier this year, the fisheries block exemption regulation, FIBER, is being revised by the Commission and the new instrument is expected to be adopted before the end of 2014.  The new FIBER closely mirrors the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, regulation.  It allows member states to provide supports to the seafood sector based on the measures included in the EMFF and subject to the rules specified in the EMFF, without EU co-funding.  This is useful where a member state wishes to implement particular EMFF measures, but has insufficient EU co-funding to cover all of the measures it may wish to implement.  Measures implemented through FIBER generally do not require state aid notification.  I say generally because there is an exception where aid exceeds &euro;1 million to an individual beneficiary.  <br/>In a departure from the previous FIBER, the draft new FIBER allows block exemption of measures to assist the seafood sector with the impacts of natural disasters.  The draft regulation defines &quot;natural disaster&quot;, <i>inter alia</i>, as floods, tornadoes and hurricanes.  The Commission&rsquo;s definition is taken from the existing EU legal definition of natural disasters, so while it is a useful addition, it is questionable whether it would have applied to the storm events we experienced earlier this year.However, the draft FIBER mirrors the EMFF provision which allows for a state contribution to a mutual fund for adverse climatic events.  That provision is broad in nature and would cover similar storm events as we experienced this year.<br/>Fourth, I will deal with the guidelines for the examination of state aid to the fishery and the aquaculture sector.  It is when a proposed measure is not covered by the other three instruments that a state aid notification is required.  Only in that situation do we need to have regard to the new proposed Commission guidelines in designing a proposed new scheme and in drafting the state aid notification for it.  The guidelines set out the principles by which the Commission will assess such state aid notifications.  While the guidelines are quite detailed, they can be summarised as setting out certain principles that are common to all economic sectors and additional principles that are specific to the seafood sector.  The general principles common to all sectors include: contribution to a well-defined objective of common interest; need for state intervention; appropriateness of the aid measure; incentive effect; proportionality of the aid; avoidance of undue negative effects on competition and trade between member states; and transparency of the aid.  The additional principles specific to the seafood sector relate to the Common Fisheries Policy and the EMFF.  These include: exclusion of operators who have infringed CFP rules, a similar rule exists in the EMFF regulation; a Commission delegated act will specify the waiting periods appropriate to particular types of infringements; a requirement to repay aid if an infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy rules happens after payment of aid; any aid measure similar to one described in the EMFF regulation must comply with the rules applying under the EMFF; measures ineligible under the EMFF regulation will not be permitted; and a proposed aid measure must identify how exactly it will contribute to the general and specific objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.  <br/>Aside from these principles, which are the core of the guidelines document, the remaining notable element of the proposed new guidelines is the specific recognition they give to natural disasters, to so-called &quot;exceptional occurrences&quot; and to so-called &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;.  Natural disasters or exceptional occurrences must have been formally recognised as such by the member state.  Natural disasters are defined somewhat to include exceptionally severe storms and floods, tornadoes and hurricanes among other things.  Exceptional occurrences are defined somewhat to include war, internal disturbances, strikes, major industrial and nuclear accidents, and fires resulting in widespread loss.  A very widespread outbreak of a new animal disease may be accepted by the Commission as an exceptional occurrence.  Aid related to these natural disasters or exceptional occurrences must relate to the costs of the damage incurred to assets or loss of income arising from destruction of production or means of production.  Separately, the guidelines indicate that the Commission may accept as compatible with the treaties aid to make good the damage caused by &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;.  This separate classification is somewhat defined as including storms, gusts of wind causing exceptionally high waves, heavy and persistent rainfall, floods, and elevated water temperatures over a long period.  The bar is set higher in relation to these types of events in terms of eligible costs.  The damage caused must amount to more than 30% of the average annual turnover of the operator concerned in the preceding three years.  These provisions appear to be useful, particularly<b></b>those relating to adverse climatic events.  Given our experiences earlier this year with a series of exceptionally severe storms, we may potentially need to make use of them in the future.<br/>With regard to the next steps, the Commission proposes to apply the new guidelines from 1 April 2015.  The Commission will be requesting that each member state adapt its existing aid schemes to these guidelines by 30 September 2015 and to give its agreement to this adaptation process within two months of the publication of these guidelines.  At present we cannot foresee any difficulty with giving such an agreement, or in adapting our schemes to the guidelines.  All existing measures are covered by either the European fisheries fund regulation, the fisheries <i>de minimis</i>regulation or the FIBER.  The EMFF, <i>de minimis</i>and FIBER regulations provide sufficient scope for foreseen future measures, with the exception of the measures concerning fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, and the integrated maritime policy, IMP, to which I alluded earlier.  We will be examining the state aid situations of measures relating to the FLAGs and the IMP in the coming months with regard to other non-fisheries block exemptions and, if necessary, we will submit a state aid notification.  We do not foresee those measures having any difficulty in securing Commission state aid approval, given that they are provided for in the EMFF regulation and will likely be implemented in all member states. </p></speech>

He mentioned that 20 January is the deadline for submissions from stakeholders.  I presume the Department has made a submission based on what he said when it was asked for its views from the Commission in the autumn.  Can Mr. Hayes share with us what the Department's opinion was?  Are the submissions from the stakeholders, who would include more than likely those in the industry, being made via the Department or directly to the Commission?  Has Mr. Hayes any idea of the number of submissions made and what they may reflect?  Obviously, they would relate to the de minimis regulation and that affects every element of state aid rules, whether it be funding through the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or any of the funding streams from Europe, and there is nothing new in that.  The new element is the increase in funding from Europe under the seafood development fund and there will be a knock-on consequence to have an increased fund available from the Department as well.  In terms of the economic benefit of the fund over the lifetime of the programme, has any analysis been done of a breakdown of where the money will be spent?  In other words, the sectoral elements of spend and the beneficial consequences of it in terms of the growth of the industry.<br/>The aquaculture sector is one of the strands that can be funded from the programme.  In light of some of the concerns of local communities around the country, how will they fit in with the funding mechanisms?  If there are local concerns, they will have to feed into the mix of funding programmes based on business plans alone.  Will any social cost benefit analysis be carried out on the unintended consequences, given that it is set out in the 2013 public spending code that social benefit analysis must be taken into consideration as well.  Presumably, there would have to be some level of awareness and some way of building the social concerns of communities into whatever funding is made available.<b></b></p> <p>For example, in Galway, Donegal and Mayo, where there are plans to develop salmon-farming facilities off the coast, there have been suggestions, whether scientifically proven or not, that these enterprises could be to the detriment of local communities.  Will those types of social costs be taken into account when it comes to deciding how the funding should be used?  Where investment comes from private sector interests, including multinational organisations, the main concern, at the end of the day, is their own stakeholders, who are the shareholders of the company.  Their bottom line is profit.</p><p> There are issues to be addressed in terms of how these proposals can be implemented in a beneficial way while ensuring the concerns of local communities are not diminished.  There are genuine concerns about how this money will be spent if it does go towards aquaculture.  The State, which should have the best interests of citizens and local communities at heart, needs to be very much aware of this.  There is a lot of money to be made in the sector.  Salmon farming is one of the cornerstones of what the Minister is driving in terms of the seafood element of Food Harvest 2020 and his efforts to develop outputs.  At the same time, we must be very much aware of the consequences that go along with that.  I might be going off on a tangent, but it is very much related to how the money is spent.  Europe will have an eye on that and we may well see complaints from local communities to the European Commission in regard to how the money is carved up.  Perhaps the delegates might enlighten us as to whether or not there has been any discussion with the Commission on these matters, particularly regarding the aquaculture element of the seafood development programme.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about the availability of funding for that sector.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes referred to the pots replacement scheme.  According to my information, that scheme turned out to be an absolute disaster because the criteria attaching to it were too strict.  People were required, for example, to produce receipts for lost pots that may have been purchased several years previously, which was impossible for some to do.  Applicants also had to produce evidence they were selling fish during the relevant period.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes mentioned that in the case of damage caused by natural disasters, these provisions will apply only where the damage amounts to more than 30% of the average annual turnover of the operator concerned in the preceding three years.  Do the delegates consider this a high threshold in order to claim any type of compensation or support?  I know small operators who lost everything as a result of storm damage earlier this year.  I am afraid 30% of their turnover for the previous three years would go no way toward getting them up and running again.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes indicated that the proposal is for &euro;142 million of the seafood development programme funds to go towards sectoral development, with &euro;46 million going to new investments to support the enforcement of the rules.  How is it envisaged that this funding will be allocated?  Will an existing body such as the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority be given a remit in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014121600007#H00500"><p>I thank Mr. Hayes for his presentation.  I am trying to get my head around these guidelines in terms of how and to which types of funding they will apply.  It seems from the presentation that anything under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the fisheries block exemption regulation is not covered by these state aid guidelines.  Therefore, I presume it is only state funding outside any of those regulations to which these particular proposals would apply.  Under the previous guidelines, no applications were made by the State to waive the state aid rules in this regard.  Do the delegates foresee any such applications being made in the future under these guidelines?<br/>Deputy Ferris referred to compensation for operators impacted by storm damage.  Mr. Hayes referred to various terms contained in the proposals such as &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;, &quot;natural disasters&quot; and &quot;exceptional occurrences&quot;.  I understand that natural disasters are already mentioned in the treaties.  Is the notion of &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;something new that is being added?  I am wondering what the rationale is for setting two different qualifications separate from the treaty element.  Does Mr. Hayes see an opening to ease these criteria in some way to make them more beneficial for fishermen?  In the light of the effects of adverse weather earlier this year, it would be helpful if the State could make better provision for those affected rather than having to keep it under the <i>de minimis </i>rules.<br/>Mr. Hayes also referred to &quot;elevated water temperatures over a long period&quot; in the context of the proposals regarding adverse climatic events.  Might these provisions cover fish farmers whose stock is affected by amoebic gill disease, which is caused by high water temperatures, thereby making them eligible for some degree of state aid?<br/>My final question concerns what will actually constitute the state aid.  In the case, for instance, of studies that have taken place on the proposed fish farm off the Aran Islands, would that constitute state aid and would it come in under these guidelines?</p></speech>

In the case of the exception concerning fishery local action groups and the integrated marine policy, does that apply only where there is a co-funding element as opposed to exclusively state-funded initiatives?</p></speech>

Regarding the pots replacement scheme, could that scheme have gone further under the previous rules?  Did the Government have scope, for example, to cover loss of earnings, damage to vessels and so on?  Or is that what is envisaged under the new guidelines such that, if we had a similar occurrence this winter, a scheme could be put in place which would look at those elements?</p> <p>A number of fishermen informed us that the replacement of pots was only one element of the support they required.  </p><p> One of the sub-committees has been studying the potential for multitrophic aquaculture development, which involves shellfish, seaweed and fish farms working in tandem in an integrated manner.  We have been told that while the technology required to achieve this type of set-up is still a little way off, it is a possibility.  A pilot study on the issue has been mooted.  How would multitrophic aquaculture sit within the draft guidelines, which appear to cover different types of investment from different areas?  </p><p> There is a significant backlog in aquaculture license applications because the bays are still being surveyed.  Notwithstanding the various regulations, resolving this backlog will be necessary before much of the potential investment in these areas can proceed.  How do these two competing forces, which are stifling the development of the industry, sit together?</p></speech>

As the issue with FLAGs is not a Common Fisheries Policy initiative, it is not automatically exempt from state aid.  That is not to say that we will need to make a notification or that there will be any difficulty in funding FLAGS.  However, we must examine other regulations in place to ascertain whether FLAGs can be funded without a state aid notification.  In the event that we find a difficulty in this respect, we will submit an application for state aid to funding FLAGs.  We do not envisage any difficulty arising in allowing FLAGs to be funded.</p><p>  The Department was involved in committees at which this draft was initially discussed.  We have asked the agencies that deal with grant aid to the fishing industry, for example, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and Enterprise Ireland, for their opinions on the draft and requested that they revert to us by early January.  We will make a decision at that stage on whether the Department needs to make a submission as part of the consultation.  </p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked about stakeholder submissions.  As the consultation is public, anyone can make a submission, including individual fishermen, producer organisations and anyone else.  Everyone is entitled to make a submission on foot of the call for submissions made by the European Commission.  </p><p>  The Senator discussed the funding options in respect of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  While that is probably a different discussion, I will provide an update on the EMFF programme and the process involved in it.  We had a number of consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, namely, the stakeholders we had in place for the current programme, the European Fisheries Fund, with some additions.  We also had a number of bilateral meetings with other State agencies on their requirements.  An operational programme is being drafted and will set out priorities for spending this money and the measures that will be implemented under the programme.  It must go through a series of steps, including a public consultation, which will take place early next year, at which point everyone will have an opportunity to feed into the process and make their views known.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked about the recommendation of the committee in respect of his report.  I hope my response on the FLAGs addressed his concern. </p><p>  I will provide some figures on the pot replacement scheme which may not have been available heretofore.  The current position is that a total of &euro;308,000 has been paid to 128 claimants by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the organisation administering the scheme.  BIM has recognised there is a difficulty with people accessing funding to buy pots and is giving them an opportunity to get to that stage.  It is anticipated that the number of pots replaced may increase, with an estimated 13,000 lobster and crab pots and 2,700 shrimp pots being replaced by the time the scheme finishes.  </p></speech>

The call was put out for applications from anyone who had suffered losses of pots in the adverse weather conditions.  We can only assume that anyone who suffered losses submitted an application.</p><p>  The threshold of 30% turnover seems to be causing a little confusion.  This is a bar that applicants must get over, which means that losses must be greater than 30% of average turnover in the preceding three years.  It does not mean that grant aid will be limited to 30% of their turnover in the past three years.  The thinking behind the threshold is that the loss must be significant and preclude people from seeking compensation for a small loss suffered.  The test for significant loss is that it should be greater than 30% of average turnover in the previous three years.  </p><p>  On control and enforcement, the funding in this area is for our control and enforcement services, namely, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Naval Service and Air Corps.  These are the agencies that already carry out this activity and it is not intended that a new organisation would be established.  The funding is to finance the activities of the control and enforcement authorities.  </p><p>  I hope I answered Deputy Pringle's question on the 30% threshold.</p><p>  As to whether we foresee any applications, while we do not expect applications at this stage, we are still in listening mode.  As I indicated, we are consulting our agencies to ascertain whether they foresee any difficulties with it.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, we did not make an application under the previous programme, which ran from 2007 until the present day.  At this point, we do not foresee circumstances arising in which we would have to make an application.  That said, we are still open to any scenario that people may wish to highlight.  </p></speech>

One sees a pattern running through the different state aid instruments to which Mr. Hayes referred.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund includes references to adverse climatic events and tools that are in place to deal with that specific scenario.  Similarly, the block exemption includes both the adverse climatic events and natural disasters categories.  The latter are defined by reference to existing instruments such as the general de minimus and block exemption regulations in which they are defined, as well as European Union case law.  The adverse climatic events category is of much more interest to us as it is much more likely to be useful to us.  Natural disasters refer to events such as tornados or hurricanes.  God forbid, that we will ever have those types of events in Ireland.  The adverse climatic events category is much more relevant, for example, in respect of the storms we experienced earlier this year.  The Commission's thinking appears to be that because these types of climatic events are much more likely to occur, the bar should be set higher.  The obvious reason for imposing a 30% loss threshold is that one cannot have claims being submitted annually or as a matter of routine because the intervention would cease to be for exceptional events.</p> <p>It does seem to be a high loss threshold and it is an issue we raised ourselves in previous discussions with the Commission.  Many member states would have liked to have seen it perhaps a little bit lower.  However, the Commission's view on that was that it could not legislate or make new legislation.  It is there to implement it.  It is looking to what the co-legislators have already said in the Environmental Management and Monitoring Framework, EMMF, and that 30% threshold is built into the EMMF by the co-legislators.  For that reason, the Commission are essentially implementing the same policy in these guidelines.  </p></speech>

It is there for when people suffer very significant losses.  Our thinking is that we are much more likely to use the mutual fund approach, which is set out in the EMMF regulation.  The Minister is already on record as being minded to make allowance for that in the new programme.  It is a much more flexible instrument that could potentially deal with the kind of storms we saw earlier this year.</p></speech>

These are the Commission's guidelines so, like the committee, we are trying to interpret them.  Potentially that is something at which they are aiming.  There are also existing provisions in the EMMF for aquaculture stock insurance and so on - measures which are specifically designed to deal with disease outbreaks, compensation for bio-toxin outbreaks and so on.  There are, therefore, a number of potential tools in the EMMF.  It is probably unlikely, for that reason, that we would ever need to resort to the guidelines and a State aid notification for that kind of event.</p></speech>

As things stand at the moment, we do not really see a need to put in a submission.  However, this will depend on what our agencies say to us.  The &euro;30,000 cap is in the de minimis regulation rather than in the one that is out for consultation at the moment.  The de minimis regulation has already been adopted.  Even though we put forward a case on behalf of Ireland, as did other member states, that the cap should be higher - that was in the spring of this year at the meetings on the de minimis rule - the Commission was not for moving on it.  In answer to the Chairman's question on this particular consultation, the &euro;30,000 de minimis cap would not be part of it.</p></speech>

The total land area affected by this designation is 169,000 hectares which affects over 4,400 farmers.  The aim of IFDL is to restore the value of designated land to the same value as neighbouring non-designated land and that of similar type land elsewhere and an equal payment on every designated hectare to be paid to farmers.  We have attended several meetings throughout the regions affected by the designation.  At these meetings, farmers have expressed their real concerns at the realisation that their land value has been completely decimated.  We have very solid examples of financial stress that this designation has put on farmers within these regions.  Prospective buyers have indicated that it was too risky to purchase lands designated for hen harrier SPA.  Some farmers, wanting to sell their lands, could not get a bid.  The main reasons for the devaluation include the suspension of the national parks and wildlife hen harrier farm plan scheme, which means that farmers who own land affected by the designation were not compensated.  This will result in farmers abandoning some of these lands and moving from these communities.</p> <p>At meetings we have attended in the past two months at which this issue was discussed and considered, it was very clear that communities are devastated by the realisation that the value of their land has disappeared.  A resolution which is satisfactory to the farmers who own land in these regions must be found.</p><p> There is now a general blanket ban on the planting of trees for forestation purposes in hen harrier SPA regions.  There is also a restriction on forestry planting on lands adjoining these regions.  The 2010 hen harrier survey indicates that the hen harrier population decreased by 18% in SPA designated areas.  This led to the ban on afforestation being introduced, despite the fact that the national population appears to be stable.</p><p> Farmers are being fined in respect of their single farm payments as a result of the fact that their SPA designated land does not qualify under the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, criteria.  In 2007, farmers with land in these regions were offered compensation through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This amounted to compensation of &euro;350 per hectare for the first 40 hectares, &euro;25 per hectare for land between 41 to 120 hectares and &euro;5 per hectare thereafter.  At that time, farmers in the main accepted this compensation on the understanding that new afforestation would generally be permitted on these lands.  However, this has not proven to be the case and the compensation to which I refer would not be adequate to compensate farmers who own land with the SPA hen harrier designation.</p><p> In the context of resolutions, a proper level of compensation must be put in place and this must be guaranteed to remain in effect during the designation period.  The amount of compensation should be reviewed every five years.  The payment must be made on every designated hectare in view of the fact that every hectare is devalued and affected by the designation.  All farmers with designated land must be exempt from GAEC criteria when claiming their single farm payments.  Afforestation must be reintroduced and restrictions on non-designated land adjoining SPA hen harrier regions should be removed.  Non-intensive viable farming needs to be central to the formation of a new hen harrier scheme, which needs to be flexible, workable and reasonable.</p><p> Until such time as the Commission decides on a mechanism to remove land from designation, farmers must be compensated adequately.  A long-term, viable scheme must be put in place to ensure that farming in these regions is as viable as forestry.  Our aim is to protect the value of the lands which are designated for the protection of the hen harrier.</p></speech>

I read their submission with interest.  We need to move forward and find solutions.  We must consider those solutions in the context of both European and national law.  IFDL makes a case for compensation.  The latter can mean different things to different people.  If a payment were to be put in place in the long term to maintain our guests' system of farming in such a way as to maximise the chances of the hen harrier not only surviving but also propagating, would this be acceptable as a way forward?  I do not mind how many hectares of land a farmer owns but if one of those hectares is useful to the hen harrier, then all other hectares are also useful.  I do not understand the logic of paying a certain amount in respect of the first 40 hectares.  If the land is designated, then all of it is designated and if the relevant action must be taken in respect of every hectare, then farmers should get the requisite payment.  I would make the case that farmers who are affected should receive payment in respect of every hectare of designated land they own.  Rather than putting in place a scheme such as those relating to compensation for not obtaining planning permission for windmills or for not receiving grants, I am of the view that a payment would be made in respect of farmers who follow a prescription plan to maximise the hen harrier population.  I am also of the view that this would take into account the losses or costs farmers will incur as a result of not having the freedom to farm in the way they want.</p><p>  On the GAEC criteria, is Mr. Fitzgerald saying - this would be a sensible proposition - that if it is good for the hen harrier, then, by definition, it should be eligible for the single farm payment.  In other words, if it is necessary to provide certain kinds of cover, scrub land or ecological focus areas - whatever the powers that be may wish to call them - then the land involved should not be excluded from the calculations relating to the single farm payment scheme.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald stating that it cannot be the case that the National Parks and Wildlife Services, NPWS, may state that it wants the land to be maintained in a particular way and then those responsible for administering the single farm payment scheme saying the land in question does not qualify because it does not meet the criteria relating to forage areas?</p><p>  On the reintroduction of afforestation, I understand that some work is being done at present to assess whether forestry is good or bad for hen harriers.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald saying that afforestation should be allowed even if it is detrimental to hen harriers or is he stating that where it is proven to be neutral or favourable to them, then it should be allowed?  Perhaps he will clarify the position in this regard.</p><p>  I am fascinated by the restrictions which apply in respect of undesignated land.  When land is designated, anything one proposes to do on adjacent lands is going to have an impact on the former.  For example, if one were going to do work on an adjacent plot of land which might result in a designated bog being drained, this can be taken into account when a decision in respect of planning permission is being made.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald stating that there should be no restrictions on what can be done on adjacent lands even if this might affect the designated land?  Is he stating that if there are restrictions, then farmers should be paid compensation?  Clarity is required in respect of that matter.  As already stated, I am of the view that it is time to move on and find a resolution.</p><p>  The key sentence in Mr. Fitzgerald's presentation is that which reads "Non-intensive viable farming needs to be central to the formation of a new hen harrier scheme, which needs to be flexible, workable and reasonable."  I have travelled widely and attended many farmers' meetings throughout the country.  As our guests are aware, I criticised the Government roundly for its handling of the single farm payment issue and its refusal to level the playing pitch in respect of high nature value farming.  Europe will not pay single farm payments to people if we do not protect high nature value farming.  One of the best ways in which we could have helped farmers such as those represented at this meeting would have been to increase the single farm payment to a fair level.  In fairness to the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MLA, this has been done in Northern Ireland and farming there has not fallen apart.  What is Mr. Fitzgerald's view in respect of the lead-in review of the CAP in the context of ensuring that the single farm payment will take into account that our guests would farm more intensively if they were permitted to do so?  Of course, the Government and the EU are telling them that they cannot farm more intensively.</p><p>  Does Mr. Fitzgerald believe that the payment in respect of areas of natural constraint - our guests probably know this as the disadvantaged areas payment - should actually relate to natural constraint?</p> <p>If the land can only produce half of what it could because most of it is moorland and because of its designation, should the payment for the areas of natural constraint be bigger to take the natural constraint into account?</p><p> There must be a payment.  I am a bit shy of the word "compensation" because I have a funny feeling if it is included we will get a bang on the head and be told to go home, that we cannot pay compensation.  In a legal sense, special area of conservation designation does not provide for compensation for the refusal to get a grant or planning permission, if this is what we are discussing.  However, a substantial payment for carrying out actions which are good for the hen harrier would be perfectly doable and it is only a matter of political will and the need to put up the money.  We need to be clear about what we are seeking because we are more likely to be successful with one approach rather than the other.</p><p> As farmers the witnesses probably have more knowledge of the hen harrier than most.  In their view, allowing that hen harrier numbers are small, how long do they think it would take and how long a programme would we require to ensure not only the survival of the hen harrier but its re-propagation to an adequate level?  This is the key question.  My experience is that four or five year programmes are far too short for nature.  Nature does not work in five year cycles.  Do the witnesses have any knowledge on how long they think it will take?  How long does the scheme need to be to ensure it has the impact on the hen harrier which everybody desires?  I am sure the witnesses are not against the hen harrier as long as the hen harrier does not take away their living.  How long a cycle would be required before we see a significant improvement in the hen harrier situation?  Do the witnesses wish the grant to be available throughout this cycle?  Would it be ten or 15 years?  Bringing back the corncrake is a long-term project and it will not happen overnight.</p></speech>

He suggests farmers would be willing to accept &euro;698 per hectare from the National Parks and Wildlife Service for a period of 15 years as compensation for the devaluation of land as a consequence of what has happened.  Has this been negotiated with the Department of the Minister?  I understand the witnesses were recently in Europe.

According to Article 34(2) of Regulation No. 73/2009 defines eligible hectares for the purposes of the single farm payment.<br/>For the purposes of this Title, &lsquo;eligible hectare&rsquo; shall mean:<blockquote>(a) any agricultural area of the holding, and any area planted with short rotation coppice (CN code ex 0602 90 41) that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is used as well for non-agricultural activities, predominantly used for agricultural activities;and<br />(b) any area which gave a right to payments under the single payment scheme or the single area payment scheme in 2008 and which:(i) no longer complies with the definition of &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; as a result of the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds.</blockquote>Paragraph (b) is the most important part with regard to this discussion, as it was pursuant to the birds directive that the special protection areas were created.  In the experience of the witnesses, when departmental officials state areas are not eligible for the single farm payment because they do not qualify as an agricultural area or holding are they aware of the second limb of the test in paragraph (b) and that the reason they do not comply is because of the implementation of the birds directive?  Is paragraph (a) the only test which is applied, with regard to whether they are agriculturally productive areas?<br/>What contours of a scheme would the witnesses like to see?  Is a five-year scheme realistic or is a longer scheme needed, based on what they know about hen harrier rejuvenation and with regard to farm families being able to plan their futures and make economic decisions?</p> <p>If one has to answer the question, one has to consider the consequences of the designation and the serious concern around it.  The main concern is that farmers are not able to make an income from their lands.  The other issue is that farmers cannot sell their land; it is completely worthless.  Those issues have to be addressed.  A viable long-term scheme has to be introduced.  Certainty on the value of land and the future of farming in these areas must be reintroduced.  If farmers cannot survive in these areas, hen harriers will not either.</p><p> In terms of a long-term scheme, realistically one would want a commitment that as long as a designation will remain in place, funding will be put in place to incentivise farmers to provide a habitat and protect the hen harrier to a level that will cover the costs of farming and the losses as a result of the designation. </p><p> The issue of adjoining designated lands has arisen when farmers have been turned down for forestry planting because their land adjoins a designated area.  The payments for disadvantaged areas should be larger, but we would prefer if the scheme to deal with the hen harrier issue was properly funded and covered all farmers in the area.  The funding has decreased in recent years.  The payment sought to make good land equal to bad land, but the payments have been too small for many farmers.  </p><p> Farmers are probably the best people to protect the hen harrier in these areas because they have lived with them for years and understand their needs.  I do not think farmers get credit for the knowledge they have of the bird.  Many people want to tell them what to do, order them around and impose designations and restrictions on their land which is causing havoc.  The hen harrier population prior to the designation was better.  The designated areas were selected for a reason.  </p><p> I understand about 9% of the people who applied were approved for the scheme.  It was impossible for many people to be approved for the scheme.  Many people were involved in REPS.  Others were renting land and there was a requirement that land was rented for five years previous to the designation.  Land had to be purchased three years prior to the designation.  People on commonage were not allowed to take part in the scheme.  The scheme was designed to be very difficult to get into, but it should have encouraged as many people as possible to participate.  </p><p> The end goal is to protect the hen harrier.  It is very important that farmers are encouraged to do that and are not out of pocket as a result.  Most farmers love to farm their land and protect the nature around them.  They have been squeezed into a situation whereby they have to ask to plant or sell their land or realise its value.  It is devastating communities.  Some farmers in these areas are farming the most challenging arable land in the country.  If their only alternative is to plant their land, they will want to do that.  A long-term scheme has to be put in place to make farming as attractive and viable as forestry so they are not out of pocket.</p><p> The GLAS scheme was mentioned.  The biggest problem with the scheme is that it is a five year scheme.  A farmer who has no designation could be farming some of the best land in the country, and could be entitled to a maximum GLAS payment of &euro;5,000.  With a free and clear deed, he or she can sell his or her land when he or she wants to; he or she simply has to comply with the restrictions of the GLAS.  </p><p> Our situation is completely different.  In 2007 farmers were offered a scheme and were to be incentivised to protect the hen harrier.  Land was redesignated on the back of that agreement in EU law.  It was wrong to pull money from the scheme.  It was not like REPS or similar schemes because they do not affect land values.  Farmers were dependent on this scheme to underpin the value of their land and their future on the land.  </p><p> Many farmers are suffering from severe mental stress and depression as a result of this designation.  Farmers do not know where to go and have been offered no support.  This has gone on for four years and they are at their wits' end.  They are abandoning the land and, in many cases, have given up hope.  There is nobody for these people to go to.  </p></speech>

One might say that farmers did not know where to go for four years.  I have seen parts of Ireland which did not know where to go for the past 17 years because of designations.  We know that down through the years farmers and nature lived hand-in-hand.  Fundamental environmentalism and ridiculous legislation now mean that a farmer or bird can live in an area, but both will not survive.  It is a sad statement to have to make about bad legislation and people who did not know what they were talking about making decisions.</p><p>  Compensation was mentioned.  If people want to sell their land, it is valueless.  The witnesses and other groups have heard from auctioneers how land is being devalued in different parts of Ireland because of designations.  </p><p>  In Sligo a farmer on designated land, like that to which the witnesses referred, who was required to fence land where stakes were rotten had to get an appropriate environmental assessment and planning permission.  A farmer in another field in Ireland can fence his or her land any day of the year.  What is compensation?  I have dealt with this issue for many years.  Promises from organisations such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service will be made, but they will not deliver, as has been proven down through the years.  </p><p>  The sad reality is that in different parts of Ireland people's survival is now under threat.  Unless politicians and the legislators in Europe wake up to this, we will face a revolt.  I have heard farmers near me, as well as around the country, say it is a sad day when people decide to get rid of a bird because either they or the bird can stay, but not both.  That never happened when I was younger.  We need to rectify the situation very quickly.</p><p>  The witnesses are 100% correct.  I have seen it right around the country.  People not in designated areas do not realise the type of impositions that are being put on people.  If one agrees with it, that is fine.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will say the agreement with farming organisations in 1997 was not worth the paper it was written on.  It was agreed that while a designation was in place, people would be compensated for it.  I have read the agreement and can show it to the committee.</p> <p>However, it has never been adhered to.</p><p> I urge the delegation to keep at it.  In parts of Ireland, there is trouble over the single farm payment.  I was in a field one day and one person from a Department was telling me to pull a furze bush and another person was telling me not to.  The farmer was in the middle and did not know where to go.  This demonstrates the bureaucracy that has featured.  Politicians need to sort something out for the delegates and others who have designated land throughout the country.  What is happening must not continue.</p></speech>

I live in the middle of a hen harrier designated area.  All of west Limerick is designated.  I have heard about this in chapter and verse for many years.  It is not today or yesterday that this issue has become a problem but it is now coming to a head.  To be fair, most landowners do not really have a difficulty with the designation and understand the reasons for it and the requirement for habitat protection.  The latter is a given.  What they have difficulty with, however, is land valuation and farm practices.  I refer to what farmers can and cannot do with their own land and how their land is adversely affected by virtue of the designation.</p><p>  The delegates might respond to the threat response plan of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is very focused on the bird.  In my part of the world, we are talking about 20 birds.  This is a very small number considering that parts of west Limerick, north Cork and east Kerry have been converted to virtual wilderness.  The number of birds is depleting year on year and nobody can say definitively whether intensive agriculture, farm practices, wind energy development or scrub affects their population.  Is the bird just dying out because such things happen?  No one seems to know.</p><p>  Could I get the delegation's opinion on how this could be brought to a head?  The designation will not be lifted &mdash; we know that &mdash; and this is very clear from the birds directive.  In fact, some elements of the threat response plan suggest that even more land might be designated, which would cause its own problem.  Could the delegates give some practical suggestions as to what could be done in the short term to make life easier for the landowners under the threat response plan, bearing in mind habitat protection?</p><p>  Reference was made to GLAS.  The delegates might give an example of what a farmer whose land has been designated must go through by comparison with a farmer whose land has not been designated.  What payments would be made to them if the only scheme were the GLAS?  Those who do not really have the grasp of this matter that the delegates have might argue that if the farmers get a GLAS payment, they will be fine.  Could we have a practical example of what designation has meant to the delegates as landowners, even in terms of what auctioneers are saying about what the land is worth?</p><p>  This issue has featured for a long time and successive Governments have not dealt with.  It needs to be dealt with now out of fairness.  The committee's deliberations will be a matter for itself.  In the context of the new rural development programme being drafted, all I ask for is that, if the committee is satisfied based on representations made to it by those present, we question whether it is fair that one landowner is subject to very onerous requirements regarding the protection of a habitat while a neighbouring landowner is subject to no such requirements.  If the system is not fair, something should be done about it.  Having travelled around west and east Limerick on a road trip of public meetings about this issue, I realise people are just seeking acknowledgement of the fact that designation imposes responsibility on a landowner that would not be imposed on him otherwise.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman for his time and patience.</p></speech>

The delegates mentioned that they were in Brussels.  What response did they receive there?  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the designation of land and that it is very unlikely that it will be lifted.  I would like to see it being lifted but that could be a dream that will not be realised.  The concern is over the solution.  Even in south Galway and north Clare, which are heavily designated, a number of individuals &mdash; I am not saying they are representative of everybody else &mdash; would love the opportunity to plant their land and get an income from it in that way.  What was the response in Brussels?</p><p>  Responsibility for the problem falls between two departments, which have very different outlooks.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is more concerned with the farmer and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is more concerned with the restrictions.  Both cannot keep handing responsibility to each other to solve it.  Ultimately, the delegates are squeezed in the middle and unfortunately cannot farm the land they want to farm.  It is not a question of farmers who want something for nothing.  The farmers want to have the opportunity to farm the land in the way they know how or to be compensated properly.  I would like a body to have sole responsibility for this because we cannot continue to have circumstances year on year in which one Department says it is the problem of another.  If we do not resolve this, we will be at this again in 20 years' time.  How did the delegates get on in Europe?</p></speech>

What have they done to take up the cause on their behalf?  Representative bodies should be fighting this.  I am from the midlands and am familiar with callows and wetlands, which are the equivalent of the designated areas in question.  I have been deeply involved with cases in this regard and fought the odd one fairly successfully.</p><p>  On the sterilisation of land by the ESB without appropriate compensation, I refer to a basic principle decided by the Supreme Court.  Designation seems to be the equivalent in that one does not get compensation.  As far as I can gather from the presentation, fewer than 1% of the affected farmers have gained compensation.  That statistic is horrendous and frightening.  The matter arises owing to environmental restrictions linked to the protection of the hen harrier bird of prey.  The population of the bird seems to be declining according to the recent study of 2010, as referred to by the delegates.  It would be interesting to learn what a study from 2014 or 2015 would state.  The delegates are basically being left in limbo.  In terms of securing fairness, justice and equity, this is an absolute disgrace.  To have been left in limbo for some years is pretty appalling for anybody.</p><p>  The delegates' case is well made.  They seek the payment of fair and proper compensation for landowners due to losses likely to arise as a result of their lands being included for designation as a special protection area.</p><p>  Documentary evidence has been provided on the negative impact of designation on the sale value of land.  One cannot even plant forests in the designated area.  The significant evaluation amounts to sterilisation.</p><p>  Have the delegates sought any legal advice on the impact?  I would be interested in seeing where that will go.  If the potential of the land to be utilised is severely affected, this surely must be taken into account.  One cannot carry on reseeding or with normal improvements because of the sensitivities at play.</p><p>  I am not very familiar with the threat response plan to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.  He indicated there could be further restrictions.  That is a frightening scenario.  Somebody in the midlands is not affected but could be.  It is important that we fight for everybody across the country, irrespective of their location.  That is why I am here.</p> <p>What support has IFDL got from the wider farming community?  Just because only 4,000 farmers are affected does not mean that this cannot reach out  in various ways to the 100,000 or so farmers out there.  Before Deputy Fitzmaurice came in here I was always a strong advocate for rural people because many of these measures are imposed by people who have no knowledge of the impact or consequences they have on people in rural Ireland who are trying to eke out a living in difficult circumstances, often not of their own making.  Many are isolated too.  I support any measure but it has to be done within the context of this special protected area, SPA, with respect to European as well as national law.</p><p> There is a negative impact on the witnesses&rsquo; legal rights.  That may have its own consequences for the implementation of any plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jason Fitzgerald" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014121600014#P00200"><p>I refer back to the response plan.  This is a consultative committee being formed to discuss the threat to the hen harrier from forestry, intensive agriculture and wind energy.  We will participate in that committee&rsquo;s work but the farmer is being left out again.  The farmer has to be looked after if the bird is to be looked after.  We hope to participate in the response consultative committee and inform people of the needs of farmers in these areas.</p><p>  We need a long-term scheme to match the value of forestry because the majority of farmers want to farm their land.  They want to plant it because it is the easiest way out.  They have been told they are entitled to nothing and that is why they want forestry.  We understand that a limited amount of forestry, if any, will be accepted on the response plan.  For the people who really need to plant their land that is their best chance and the people who just want to farm their land but find that is the only way out, should be compensated properly for a new scheme.  The scheme has to match forestry in every way to take the heat away from the demand to plant the land.  That is why it has to be long term.  It has to equal the demand for forestry in monetary terms. </p><p>  In respect of the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS, if one farm in an area is designated and another is not, that farmer can still draw the &euro;5,000 under GLAS, like the person on the hen harrier scheme.  If a farmer has 100 or 200 acres under GLAS it all has to be farmed to the same level even though the farmer is only being compensated for the first 13.5ha.  The restrictions in that scheme would reduce productivity on the farm by between 75% and 80%.  The farmer is allowed only 40 units of nitrogen, artificial and natural, organic.  That ground will only do for rough grazing for cattle.  There will be no nice lush green grass to feed them.  They will be fed on stemmy, coarse grass.  The cattle are used to provide the habitat for the hen harriers as opposed to the land&rsquo;s being used to produce livestock.  The farmer&rsquo;s stocking rate will be significantly reduced to 0.6 of a livestock unit per hectare and in some cases 0.01 livestock unit per hectare.</p><p>  When we went to Europe one regulation stood out, EC73/2009, Article 34(2)(b)(i) which states that if a farmer&rsquo;s land qualified for single farm payment in 2008 and has lost eligibility since then, as a result of scrub and does not qualify for the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition, GAEC, it should qualify for payments under the single farm payment scheme.  That makes sense to us, that farmers cannot be penalised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because there is scrub growing on the land while the National Parks and Wildlife Service will not allow them to take the scrub out.  It is a ridiculous situation. </p><p>  We have considered legal advice but 4,000 farmers are affected.  They would need a substantial sum of money to take a case on this.  Surely a government could see sense in protecting these farmers and rural areas rather than forcing farmers down the legal road to get value from their land and to continue their existence in these areas.  Surely people on the sides of hill and on some of the most challenging agricultural land in the country cannot be forced down these roads because these farmers have not been represented over the past four years, despite what people say.  We were told bluntly there was no more money under GLAS and we were to be left in this situation for another four to six years until the next round.  We had no choice but to bring this to people&rsquo;s attention to get some justice for these farmers, otherwise there is a strong possibility they will not be there in six years&rsquo; time. </p></speech>

There are farmers who are down &euro;70,000 from the time the scheme was introduced because they did not get into it.  Many of them are very angry about this.  They have tried writing to the Bar Council and to everyone they could think of but got no response.  Many of these farmers, big, small or medium, had designated 20% or 25% of their land which they would have used as an insurance policy to sell or plant to put someone through college or if someone got sick or needed to go into a home.  Now that is gone and that has upset many people.  In the documentation we received it was made clear that the Government is committed to payment of a fair and proper level of compensation to landowners and land users who are at a financial loss as a result of the designation of this SPA.  Land within the SPA or proposed SPA constitutes a Natura 2000 site.  People did not object to the designation because they presumed that what they were being told would be honoured.  It was not and that is why we are here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014121600015#Q00100"><p>I am probably the only person at the table who opposed actively entry into the European Union, which I always thought would come to a sticky end.  However, we are where we are.  Going back to 1997, we should read the small print.  What was there in 1997, which S&iacute;le de Valera and I inherited when we came into the Department, was that a person would be compensated for any loss of income arising from a change from current practice.  That always excluded and always will the inability to get a grant or a planning permission which was clear from the legislation passed in the very beginning, which the IFA knew.  In other words, if a person was cutting turf at that time in a bog and was stopped, he or she had to be compensated.  It was black and white because that was a current activity.  On the other hand, if there was a loss of potential value into the future due to windmills or whatever needed planning permission, it was not compensable.  I say this because it is not just a problem here, but is one in Europe.  Much as I hate a lot of European law which is destroying the environment instead of helping it, I learned one hard lesson in all of this which is that one must study the book or one will get no answer.  Prescription farming has done more damage to the wildlife it purports to protect than good.</p><p>  If tomorrow those with with responsibility for the OPW and natural heritage were totally on one's side and wanted to bring in a scheme and give one money, but had to do it legally, it would pose significant problems.  I found that when I tried to do it.  I remember when we destocked the hills the first time and wanted to pay farmers for the sheep we were taking down out of Exchequer funds, S&iacute;le de Valera and I went over to Europe.  I will not bore the committee with the details, but the conversation was very interesting and basically boiled down to us being told we could not pay the farmers.  I asked why not given that it was our money and was told that we could not pay farmers as they were polluting the hills.  In other words, overstocking was equivalent to polluting.  Under the polluter-pays principle, one cannot compensate people for farming according to good practice.  What I came around to when I was in government, if Deputy O'Donovan wishes to listen, was to say let us pretend that the hills are 20% overstocked on average and that therefore we will only compensate farmers for 80 of every 100 sheep we take away.  I managed to persuade a good official in Teagasc, God rest his soul, to give me a good price for the sheep and 80% of the price he gave me was &pound;3 more per euro - and it was punts at the time - than the IFA had sought in compensation.  In that little slight of hand, I worked around the stupid and bizarre rules of the time.  I could not go straight at it even though I was the Minister because of what they were telling me.  We did not have permission to do it and it took six years to get permission for the scheme.  We just went off and paid for six years without approval and eventually the permission came through on that formulation.  The reality is that talking about potential value will lead one to hit the wall.  One will not get compensation.</p><p>  I happened to be travelling one day with a certain MEP from the north west who is still a member of the European Parliament.  I said that something had to happen in Europe given the way designation and environmental policy was decimating our country.  I said the MEP would have to go over, bang the table and get some change.  I received a very short answer and was told to forget it as most countries liked it the way it was as most of their designated areas were well away from habitation.  They do not have it our way.  I was told we would not get any sympathy over there for that, which closed off that door.  If the one wanted to do it at this stage, the only legal approach would be to bring in a scheme and take certain actions.  I would be very interested to hear if anyone has told the witnesses otherwise.  We could not call it compensation but would price up the actions.  Europe would insist on each action being priced.  As long as those actions were carried out, we would agree to pay so much per hectare which we reckoned to be the economic cost of income foregone and the cost of carrying out the actions, including labour and time.  A scheme could be brought in on that basis by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The second thing that would put Europe and the Government on the back foot would be to provide that if 15 or 20 years is required for hen harriers as the minimum timescale, a scheme should last for that period.  It should be a National Parks and Wildlife Service scheme, should not have rules on commonages and should allow everybody in.  If they are serious about the hen harrier, everybody should be in the gig and there is no point in not having it.</p><p>  Unless the IFDL bends what it is looking for - and I know what that is - it will not get it in its current form.  If it bends what it is looking for in accordance with the realities of the law and in a way that could be done by a sympathetic Minister, it might get damn near in cash terms what it wants.  We should be honest and acknowledge that a rose by any other name is still a rose.  Money is still money no matter how it is given.  There is a need for everyone to move into a space as to what is legally possible.  Some of the things I have been asked about do not seem legally possible.</p><p>  Finally, my dream is that we take a leaf out of David Cameron's book and renegotiate certain terms of our membership of the European Union, in which case, this issue should be on the agenda.</p></speech>

First, I thank the witnesses for attending.  In the context of the steps they are trying to take, all members here have a concern that justice is seen to be done.  That is what we are looking for.  If we can assist in that, we are willing to do so.  This is a public forum where the people affected have an opportunity to present their cases before the Houses of Parliament and to put matters on the public record.  We must be careful that what we say here, we mean.<br/>While I tend to agree with the last point that was made, it strikes me that in many ways this is a National Parks and Wildlife Service problem for which agriculture is being asked, possibly, to compensate.  I note that Mr. Fitzgerald is quoted in<i>The Corkman</i>as saying that in 2007 the Irish Government was given &euro;528 million which was ringfenced for natural amenities such as natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation and special protection areas, but only &euro;93 million of the money was applied to these areas and not 1 cent went to the hen harrier scheme.  If that was the case, my understanding is that it is a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as opposed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<br/>When we looked at commonages over 18 months ago, one presentation made to us was from the BurrenLIFE project.  The end product there was species-rich grassland in the same way that other farmers' product is milk or beef.  In respect of the matter before us, the end product is a healthy hen harrier population.  It seems then that a BurrenLIFE type scheme would compensate farmers on the basis of the number of years a scheme must remain in place and deal with a lot of the problems.  I may be wrong.  We should get officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to come on foot of the presentation made here today.  We have been given great deal of information of which I, certainly, was not aware on the historical situation, where we are now and where we should be going.</p> <p>This is not over yet by any means.  We have a role to play.  As a farmer, it would appear to me that what has been does is an injustice.  It is unfair.  Much has been said about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Rural Development Programme.  Under future CAP programmes public good is an important factor.  As such, this issue also crosses over into the CAP.  We will need to examine the rural development programme from the point of view of the agricultural aspect of this and to also look at other areas such as the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that might have responsibility for this area. </p></speech>

We can talk all we want about irrelevant issues such as whether or not we remain in Europe but that does not really matter.</p></speech>

The people concerned are now living with the decision of the then Government which signed them up to this and also withdrew the compensation package.</p><p>  I would like to outline the reason it is important this committee review this matter.  In regard to the eligibility criteria for the single farm payment the European Commission has clearly stated that eligibility for this payment should not be in any way adversely impacted by virtue of the transposition of part or all of any EU directive, including the habitats directive.  The documentation provided demonstrates that farmers have been adversely impacted by virtue of the fact that they have had to take on different elements of farm practices and as such eligibility has been affected.  </p><p>  The suggestion that officials of both agencies be brought before the committee is an excellent one of which I am supportive.</p></speech>

As stated by Mr. Fitzgerald the best people to look after this are the people who have been curators of it for generations.  The same baseline should apply in terms of our work on this scheme.  We can end this discussion today by offering some hope.  We must see this through.  I would like to assure the delegates that this committee will work on this issue.  There is a willingness among members to come up with a commonsense proposal that is practical and can work.  At the end of the day the hen harrier still exists.  It has been around for many generations and farming practices.  Without wishing to be patronising, the people who understand it best are the people who always have stood side by side with it.  The aspiration must be that man and the relevant species of the area can co-exist.  There is no point one making the other extinct.</p><p>  Is the committee agreed on what has been proposed?</p></speech>

This will require a change in the narrative of the proposal put before us.  The narrative of the current proposal does not fit with a possible solution to the problem.  Many people will not say that to the IFDL.  The Chairman has set out the type of terms we will need to work with if we are to get on cash on the table for the IFDL.  It is important we go forward on that basis.</p></speech>

Farmers would be generally very happy to work on a scheme that would provide a habitat for the hen harrier.  We also see as the way forward that farmers be incentivised to provide a habitat for the hen harrier.  It is important that farmers are central in the drawing up of any scheme in these areas.  It is not good enough that the three traditional farming organisations be central in the drawing up of a new scheme.  Farmers in the designated areas are aware of the problems and pitfalls of previous schemes and they should be central in drawing up a new hen harrier scheme.</p></speech>

I think that would be a much better model of negotiation.  In this case and to get the overall scheme in place in the first instance, there would be one liaison committee for all of the hen harrier areas.  The delegates should highlight that liaison committees were put in place in 1998, that these were set up by the Department and their remit was to negotiate directly with the farmers involved rather than the farming organisations.</p></speech>

It is only in the past 12 months that there has been any impetus in terms of trying to move this issue forward.  I agree with Mr. Fitzgerald that the farmers involved and not abstract farming organisations who have not served them well up to now should be centrally involved in any new scheme.</p></speech>

It is important to put our resourcing in the context of the operating priorities we have had since 2011.  The statement of strategy for the Department from 2012 to 2014 set out a mission and key goals for the Department on the taking of office by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.</p> <p>The mission the Minister set was to support the creation of good jobs by promoting the development of a competitive business environment in which enterprises will operate to high standards and grow in sustainable markets.  Our Department was structured to meet this mission, and resources in a resource-constrained environment were allocated accordingly.  Our strategy sought to clearly articulate the challenges facing the organisation, identify the options for meeting those challenges and plot the milestones towards delivering solutions.  In framing our mission in 2011, the Department had particular regard for the Programme for Government priorities, especially employment creation, against a backdrop of a very challenging economic context framed by acute financial and human resource constraints.  In summary, our mission was centred on a strategy for jobs, with an ambitious vision of Ireland having 2 million people in work by 2020.</p><p> The key supporting goals for that jobs mission were framed around getting the business environment right and helping enterprises to develop their own potential.  Those goals, and therefore priority areas for the allocation of resources, both financial and staffing, were set as championing enterprise through making Ireland the best small country in which to do business and enlisting the widest possible support within and outside Government for this goal and, secondly, improving competitiveness and access to finance to regain the competitive edge necessary to underpin a successful small open economy.  The third goal focused on enterprise development and jobs and maximising jobs growth, especially through the development of a strong indigenous enterprise base, the attraction of foreign direct investment and the development of cross-enterprise networks.  The fourth goal was to increase exports and to support enterprises achieve challenging export targets. The fifth goal focused on regulation and making markets, including the labour markets, work more efficiently through smart regulation which encouraged innovation, keen competition, high standards of compliance and consumer protection, but without unnecessary regulatory costs.  A further goal focused on innovation and developing a broad based innovation strategy to make our enterprises more competitive and developing sectors with potential so as to prioritise sectors of opportunity and systematically remove obstacles and develop enabling policies. </p><p> That jobs mission and those key supporting goals informed decisions, since 2011, and resource allocation across the Department and our agencies.  Such resource prioritisation was a key management challenge for the Department, and for our individual agencies, at a time when resources were being reduced as the national finances were being brought into better shape.  Since the economic downturn in 2008, the Department has had to operate, as have all publicly-funded agencies, in an environment of reduced resources.</p><p> The well known phrase of "doing more with less" was a goal.  Our Department saw its resources reduced from approximately &euro;2 billion, which included the budget for F&Aacute;S and related activity, to &euro;804 million in 2014 and from 1,075 posts to 802 by the end of 2014.  Some 200 posts were lost separate to the F&Aacute;S related Departmental transfers.  It is on record that the Department advised the Minister that it had, in its view, reached the limit of its capacity to downsize while delivering the Government's ambitious agenda on the jobs, regulatory, enforcement activity and related fronts.  On the reduction of posts, the net loss of 200 staff, since the moratorium on recruitment was introduced in 2009, is a decrease of over 20%.  Naturally, as a result of that decrease in staffing, pressure points have developed in the Department as well as in some of our agencies.  This has required careful workforce planning responses such as, for example, the assignment of additional resources to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement at the height of its work in the Anglo and related investigations.  In addition, we proactively prioritised tasks to match the reduced staffing levels as well as working with staff to work smarter and more efficiently, including, for example, streamlining business processes for the workplace relations bodies and merging various activities in the employment permit application process.  Also, on foot of Government decisions and at the request of the Minister, Forf&aacute;s was reorganised and its core policy staff integrated into the Department.</p> <p>That decision was taken to streamline policy-making on the enterprise, science, technology and innovation and broad competitiveness agenda and to enhance the Department's capacity to directly influence those key areas of policy across other Departments and agencies which would be crucial to the delivery of the action plan for jobs and fostering economic recovery.</p><p> The priority since 2011 has centred on the jobs agenda in particular and ever more scarce resources have been allocated accordingly in the context of aggregate resources reducing significantly.  We have taken steps to address that shortage of resources and have worked with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to obtain sanctions to fill critical posts because now that we have come below the employment control framework target that was set for us we are in a position to do that.  We have received sanction to fill several critical vacancies.  We are in the process of doing that at principal and assistant principal level and at other grades.  We will also, for the first time in five years, recruit at the recruitment grade levels in the new year.</p></speech>

It is one of the facts of post-crisis Ireland and every Department has had to ensure that it delivers but had to do more with less.  Against the backdrop of the objectives we set ourselves, which the Secretary General read out, we have delivered very strongly with diminishing resources on championing enterprise and seeking to make this a good business environment.  We have gone up in all the rankings for ease of doing business, recorded by the World Bank and the various competitiveness bodies and even the National Competitiveness Council has recorded very significant improvements in key areas.</p><p>  There is also a strong resurgence in start-ups.  Many of the policies we have pursued, such as the establishment of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, have helped deliver that.  Our most recent initiative was the Young Entrepreneur of the Year competition, which was massively oversubscribed.  More than 1,000 young entrepreneurs applied and we announced the winner last week.  This resurgence is due in no small part to the efforts of the Department.</p><p>  The harmonised competitiveness index has improved and for access to finance we have put out a large number of new non-bank financial sources that were not there before, some administered through our Department such as the micro-finance, the loan guarantee, the development capital fund, the seed and venture capital funds and the innovation funds.  They have shown significant take-up and impact in filling what all Members recognise as a gap in access to finance.  Most recently the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is being developed and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, has put money into that.</p><p>  The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, has had a record performance in each of the past three years, each one better than the one before, the best in over a decade.  We have protected the IDA from any diminution in resources.  Even though we have cut staff numbers we have protected the IDA because in the teeth of the crash we believed that winning new external investment was an absolute priority. </p><p>  On the other front, Enterprise Ireland had a record year last year.  It has battled back from a tougher environment.</p> <p>Enterprise Ireland companies hit their target for 2015 exports in 2013.  They well exceeded the targets set by the previous Government and are now setting themselves more ambitious targets.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will be publishing their strategies for the coming years within the next month or two, in which they will set out their ambition to continue this high level of performance and address some of the issues that the committees have frequently raised around regional enterprise.</p><p> In terms of regulation, we have undertaken a lot of rationalisation to deliver, as stated by the Secretary General, more effectively in a constrained environment.  There has been a number of elements to this, including the merger of the Competition Authority with the National Consumer Agency into a single market focused agency and the reorganisation, by way of legislation currently before the Houses, of the five employment rights bodies to create a single first point of access and a single appellant body.  The performance of those bodies is already showing great improvement.</p><p> In regard to work permits for Irish based and overseas companies, for which there is considerable demand, the legislation in this regard has been rationalised to ensure more efficient procedures and delivery of the current service in a much more effective manner.  A major amendment to our company law structure was recently passed, in respect of which I thank committee members for their support.  As a result of this more streamlined legislation it is now easier for businesses to understand their obligations to comply in terms of the management of their businesses.</p><p> Our objective throughout all of this is to maintain the highest standards in terms of observation of competition law, observation of employment rights, observation of health and safety standards and so on, while at the same time creating a back office that is more efficient and allows us to deliver in these areas with fewer resources.  Much of the same has been done in the area of innovation.  Members will be aware of the research prioritisation exercise which examined how our resource budget was being deployed.  We sought to focus in that exercise on areas where we could sustain a long-term competitive advantage while having world-class science.  We are delivering that reprioritisation of our resources.  A measure of this is that all of our science budget allocation now requires a 30% non-Exchequer element as standard.  In other words, companies must show they can leverage additional resources to those that we put in.</p><p> On developing sectors, we have looked hard at what sectors have a long term and sustainable future and have sought to create an environment within which we can build on them.  We have looked at sectors such as the big data initiative, innovation health hub and so on where we can grow long-term competitive advantage and have sought to deploy our resources within those sectors.  In terms of resourcing, there will always be a need for more resources and more things we could do if allocated more.  To be fair to Government colleagues, they have recognised the importance of enterprise and employment and while we have suffered constraints on the manpower side, we have been able to maintain our capital budgets, which most other Departments were not permitted to do.  This has allowed us to support the type of employment expansion we are enjoying.  We are determined to continue to support this area.  This relates to our central mission, which is a balanced mission that puts employment at the heart of what we do but in enterprises that work in sustainable ways to high standards, protecting employment rights and environmental standards and observing competition and health and safety.  That is our mandate.  I hope that we are delivering it effectively.</p></speech>

The Minister will be politically aware that we want to focus on one specific issue - to which neither the Minister nor the Secretary General referred - that of the management of correspondence within the Department from the authorised officer.  He has said that the correspondence was sent to the Minister's home address and office by registered post in 2012 and that no action was seen to have been taken on that correspondence until earlier this year.  The Minister has avoided any comment on specifically his role in managing that correspondence and in forwarding it on to the relevant authorities.</p></speech>

As the Minister is the political head of the Department, I assume he has a role in answering that complaint.</p></speech>

Did the Secretary General receive from the Minister correspondence that was purportedly sent to him in 2012 by registered post?  Was that correspondence passed on to him as Secretary General and what subsequently happened that correspondence or information within the Department?  What processes were in place within the Department?  The Minister has previously publicly said, and I referring to his statement on this, that there was an issue about a retirement around the management of this information.  Within the constraints that have been pointed out to me, I ask the Secretary General did he receive from the Minister correspondence or information that was sent to him in 2012 and, as the head of the Department, what he do with that correspondence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Murphy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014121600007#H00600"><p>I think the Deputy was conflating a couple of different things when he mentioned correspondence sent by registered post and he mentioned an earlier date.  I think the document to which he is referring in 2012 is a substantial witness statement which was forwarded at the beginning of December 2012 to the Minister, which we received and which was accompanied by a very large volume of supporting documentation, over 5,000 pages of supporting documentation.  That material was examined in the Department but the Deputy needs to understand the context in which this was being provided.  The investigations we referring to about are those by an authorised officer under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990 and they go back to 1997.  They have their roots in the McCracken tribunal which reported in August 1997.  At that time the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appointed the authorised officer to examine books and documents of Celtic Helicopters and subsequently over the following two years the authorised officer was authorised to conduct a total of seven investigations.  Of those, four were completed and three have continued since then and are not yet complete.</p><p>  The witness statement that was forwarded in December 2012 had originally been requested back in 2004 and 2005 by the Garda in order to complete the documentation that had been made available to it.  Over that period of time in the early 2000s, on a number of occasions large amounts of material that had been identified by the authorised officer were forwarded to all the relevant authorities.  The Minister is on record as confirming that.</p> <p>The witness statement that was forwarded in December 2012 was not new.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014121600008#J00200"><p>Was it September or December?</p></speech>

It was actually the last day of November and we received it in early December.  It was not a new statement and it was not new material.  All of the material had been with all of the relevant bodies, including the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Revenue Commissioners, the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  It is a substantial body of material which requires to be carefully examined.  There was an issue about a shortage of people, not just of officers in the Department, but of somebody with exactly the right background and skills that knew the context in which the material had been provided and would be in a position to review it.  It is a matter of regret that it was not processed as quickly as it might have been or should have been.  I have no difficulty in saying that.</p><p>  One must also understand the volume and complexity of what we were trying to deliver in that particular part of the Department.  The receipt of the statement and supporting documentation exactly coincided with finalising the Companies Bill.  We had to put together a large team, for example, just to proofread the document, which contained more than 1,000 sections.  It coincided with the beginning of a very busy EU Presidency.  Our Department had the largest role in the 2013 EU Presidency, because we directly service Council formations across a number of areas including competitiveness, research and employment.  We had an extremely busy workload at that time, not just in the immediate division but also across the rest of the Department.  Ms Breda Power is from the division and can confirm that.  The Minister referred to a number of the things we have been seeking to deliver in that period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014121600008#J00400"><p>I am on record as acknowledging the huge input of the Department in the Presidency.  As recently as last Wednesday I acknowledged in the Minister's presence the huge input and co-operation of departmental officials in the Companies Bill.  However, as the Secretary General said, the matter had been the subject of previous investigations and it was one of great importance to the State.  The Secretary General spoke about the highest standards of compliance being an aim of the Department.  The Minister spoke about maintaining the highest standards.  Surely, when a new dossier arrived in December 2012, alarm bells should have gone off immediately and an attempt should have been made to get the proper skills, as had been done previously?  I point to the recruitment of a Queen's Counsel previously from outside the jurisdiction to examine some of the issues involved.  Surely given the political importance that attached to the matter, that should have been done.</p><p>  When did the examination to which the Secretary General referred take place and when was it completed?  The gap that has arisen and the lack of information in that regard has allowed the situation to arise, and is partially responsible for it arising, where people who are named in the report and who may not be guilty of an offence have had their names bandied about in Parliament.  The Department received the material in December 2012.  At what stage did the examination of the information that was provided get under way?  Has the examination concluded or is it still under way?  During the examination, were parties outside of the Department involved?  I include the Garda in that regard, but I also include agents of the Department such as the ODCE or other body.  I need a timeline from the Secretary General on the investigation throughout 2013 and into 2014.</p></speech>

The job of examining the witness statement supporting document could really only have been done by a very few officers, including my colleague here, Ms Breda Power, who would have had the main responsibility as the head of that division and who was sufficiently familiar with the background.  There were very few others upon whom one could call to do this piece of work.  I do not know whether Ms Power wishes to add to that.</p></speech>

When the witness statement was submitted in December 2012, it was, as outlined earlier, in the context of us processing the companies Bill prior to its publication.  It was also in the context of a considerable legislative programme and EU agenda.  Since 2012 we have processed five Bills and, if one includes the Companies Bill 2012, that is six Bills in that period of time, and almost 40 pieces of secondary legislation.</p><p>  To go back to the question about when it was processed, it was processed during the course of 2013 and 2014.  There was no other official in the division at the time who was familiar with the section 19 investigation.  The officials who had been dealing with it prior to that had all since retired for a number of years.  The work on enforcement had transferred to the ODCE when that body was established in 2001 and there was very little expertise in the division on enforcement and on this particular piece of work but it has to be considered in the context of the wider agenda that we were facing in the division.</p></speech>

While I do not want to impinge on the committee, other Departments, including, I am sure, this Department, have brought in retired staff for specific jobs given their experience.  Was any consideration given to that?</p><p>  I am on record as acknowledging the work of the Department, but I want to know, specifically, from Ms Power, in what month in 2013 was an inquiry into this dossier activated?</p></speech>

I could not devote a month or two months on it, which would be required to process it because there were so many other issues with which we were dealing with it.</p></speech>

Did she seek support from the Secretary General?  Ms Power will be aware of the importance of the document.  She will be aware of the Department's history in dealing with the document.

I am sure Ms Power must have had a sense of the importance of the document and of the seriousness of the allegations.</p></speech>

The Garda made that clear.

It is the responsibility of the management of a Department, which usually comes down to the Minister at some stage.  Why was this resource not prioritised, given that we are talking about a report on tax evasion and the damage that would be done to the resources of the State?</p><p>  It seems the Minister advises that all matters contained in the statement are covered by the document already submitted to relevant authorities.  We know there was a delay in the research of the document, so that judgment of content could not have been made before the document was researched.  Even at that stage, surely it is up to a court and judge to decide the relevance of a document sought by the Garda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014121600010#L01100"><p>The context has been outlined by officials.  When this statement was presented to me, I took advice from the officials and it was decided that the witness statement should be issued to the Garda.  It was pointed out very clearly that provisions were very particular and not, as the Deputy suggested, a case of bundling this up and sending it to the Garda.  The Department can only release information in accordance with companies legislation.  It was made very clear that this research would have to be undertaken as to whether the witness statement and information could comply with a release process.</p> <p>As the Deputy knows, to wrongfully release information under that Act would be a criminal offence so this was something that had to be done.  I think the officials have explained the position.  This was an inquiry that started back in 1997.  It had run over a long number of years through a number of Ministers.  A number of documents were produced.  Every one of those documents was furnished to the authorities with the power to prosecute or proceed depending on their context.  It went to the Revenue Commissioners, the ICDE, the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal.  All of that information had already been released to bodies that had the power.<br/>The powers under section 19 as I understand it - the officials can explain it more fully - are preliminary investigation powers.  The intention always is that where a <i>prima facie</i>case is found it would be forwarded to the authorities; that had all been done.  However, clearly when this witness statement, which had been requested in 2006, arrived in 2012, it had to be examined by the Department and, as I said, that took longer than expected.  However, there are understandable reasons for that taking longer than expected - the very detailed work that had to be put into investigating the matters going back through the history of this and the requirement to ensure it was complaint with the terms of release under the Companies Act coupled with the fact of retirement.<br/>There are obviously extenuating circumstances here.  It took longer than expected.  However, I remind the Deputy that every piece of information on which the witness statement was based was released to the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Moriarty tribunal, the Mahon tribunal and the ODCE.  The Revenue Commissioners have already signalled that they dealt with the matter.  The Garda has also signalled that it dealt with the matter and reported to the DPP as appropriate.<br/>I understand one of the issues was to ensure that the material was furnished to the Moriarty tribunal in time and it was furnished to that tribunal.  The Moriarty tribunal also had full access to the material.  That is the backdrop.  As the Secretary General has indicated, it would have been better if this could have been processed more quickly, but nothing fundamentally hinged on it, in that all the evidence on which it was based had already been furnished to the various authorities.</p></speech>

Under the Minister's management, the Department seems to have decided before the document was researched that there was nothing in it worth delivering and that it did not deserve the resources to expedite it and give it to the Garda.  How could any of those decisions have been made at the start?  Give that there are allegations that all of this was part of political obstruction, surely it would have been part of the prioritisation of a Minister to ensure that, first, it was researched and, second, it was passed on as soon as possible.</p><p>  While there has been a reduction in staff at the Department, there were still 800 people in the Department carrying out a range of responsibilities.  Why did the Minister not prioritise it at the start?  How could any determination regarding prioritisation or relevance be determined before it was researched?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that under the protected disclosure, an official of my Department has raised issues about how this was handled by previous Ministers and various bodies.

You also received advice on what can and cannot be asked.  It is nothing to do with anybody deciding what can and cannot be asked.  It has to do with what legally can or cannot be asked.  While it might be frustrating, the Committee of Public Accounts is already dealing with this matter and this committee can only deal with one element today.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is awaiting a response from the Minister, so I will ask for that response and I will then invite Deputy Conaghan to pose his question.</p></speech>

When I met the officials concerned, we decided the best course of action was to release the witness statement as requested and then the work had to be done to prepare for that release.  That is a complex piece of work because this is an investigation that has been ongoing since 1997 and which has a large volume of material appended to it, all of which material had been released to the relevant authorities - the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of the evidence had been released but the witness statement had to be assessed to see whether it could be released under the terms of the Companies Acts.  There was no deprioritisation of that work.  I requested that it would be done and, as the assistant secretary said, it was undertaken during 2013 and 2014.  I do not have responsibility for allocating resources but it has been acknowledged that retirements occurred in that time and that delayed the speed at which it was done.  That is the context.</p></speech>

I am not an expert in the assessment, but it has been acknowledged by the officials that there were resourcing constraints due to the retirement of individuals, which put a strain on the Department such that only one official was in a position to deal with this issue and who had the corporate memory and the knowledge of the history of this, which dates back many years.  The Secretary General has acknowledged that was a constraint, which resulted in this taking longer than expected.</p><p>  We would make every effort that should such a request be made, it would be handled expeditiously.  The Department is managing resources to the best effect across a range of issues.  That is what we were invited here to discuss.  We have had much work to do across a range of issues and we have managed those.  It has been acknowledged by officials that, because of a combination of events, this took longer than expected.  The Secretary General indicated that it took longer than it should.  We recognise that, but the deployment of resources is a matter not for the Minister, who sets the policy objectives, but for the Secretary General, who seeks to deploy the resources to the best effect.  That has been done.  I do not know whether Mr. Murphy wishes to comment.</p></speech>

It is not as simple as that.  There were very few people who could be assigned to this for a range of reasons, including in particular the expertise and the corporate memory plus the sensitivity of this matter.  This is not a responsibility I could just give to someone else and tell them to sort it out in a few weeks.  The Deputy asked whether if another file of that nature landed, we would deal with it more quickly.  I hope we would, but I would not want to do it in a way that involved cutting corners in order to be seen to have done it as quickly as possible.  It had to be done correctly and properly.  That was very important.</p> <p>It has to be borne in mind that it took a long time for the authorised officer to produce the witness statement in the first place.  It was not likely to be possible therefore to review it in a couple of weeks or a month or two.  That is not the nature of the task.</p></speech>

Surely, given the importance of the issue - if it was thought to be important, which is subject to debate - and given their familiarity with the information, that would have been the way to deal with it?  Were the resource issues around this particular file ever discussed at management meetings?</p></speech>

That would have been the practice of my predecessors as well.  If there were any discussions, they would have involved the assistant secretary, Ms Breda Power, and myself, or with the Minister as appropriate, but not with the management board or generally.</p><p>  We did not decide to bring anybody back from retirement to deal with this, although we did in some other areas that were particularly relevant to the EU Presidency.</p></speech>

It is proposed that the committee consider the merit of the submission of a political contribution on this proposal.  The political contribution would focus on the following: the committee's concern regarding the lack of clarity in the scope of the agreement from a sufficiently early stage; the fact that an exemption was not carved out for Ireland and other member states, as had been done previously; the issue of proportionality; and that the committee recommends in future proposals which relate to sector policy areas within which certain member states have traditionally been exempted should indicate clearly from the beginning the intended scope of application, and this would allow member states the full opportunity to scrutinise the proposal and submit a reasoned opinion within the allowed 56 day timeframe.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  On Schedule B, it is proposed that the proposals and notices listed in Schedule B, other than COM (2014) 585 and COM (2014) 693, do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I thank committee members for attending today.  The committee will adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 January 2015.

A number of Senators were obliged to attend in the Upper House for a vote.  I will begin by reminding members, our guests and those in the Gallery to switch off their mobile phones completely.  It is not sufficient to put them on silent because they can still interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>  Our first session today relates to the work of the European Court of Auditors, its annual report for 2013 and landscape reviews it has carried out.  As I informed members, we will then have an informal briefing session with representatives from D&oacute;chas on the European year for development 2015.</p> <p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome the current Irish member of the European Court of Auditors, Mr. Kevin Cardiff, and his colleagues, Mr. Ned Fennessy and Ms Mary Kerrigan.  The European Court of Auditors is the independent external audit institution of the European Union.  In its annual reports on the EU budget, the court gives its opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the legality of the transactions underlying them.  The committee also will be briefed on landscape reports undertaken by the court, which is a very interesting development.  We are starting late and there is limited time for discussion.  If we could manage to conclude this section of our business by 3.30 p.m., it would be helpful to Mr. Cardiff.<br/>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privileged in respect of the evidence they give.  Witnesses are further directed that only evidence connected with today's proceedings is to be given.  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>I invite Mr. Cardiff to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is very kind of the committee to have Mr. Fennessy, Ms Kerrigan and me before it for the second time.  The European Court of Auditors publishes its annual report every year and, in accordance with the Lisbon treaty, sends that report not just to the European Parliament, but also to national parliaments.  Our attendance here is to show that we exist, have some information to convey that may be of interest to the committee and are available today and at other times to inform members if we can.</p><p>  In regard to the 2013 report, the first point to make is that the accounts of the European Union are proper.  That is to say, we have not found any significant failings in the accounts themselves.  They are, in other words, a fair representation of the Union's balance sheets, inflows and outgoings.  There is always some confusion every year in that the claim is made that we do not actually sign off on the accounts.  In fact, we do sign off on them, as well signing off as on the EU's revenue.  We are saying, in effect, that the funds it raised were raised in a legal and proper way.  What we do not do in any year is say the accounts are entirely legal and regular, or at least that spending is entirely legal and regular.  This is because when we investigate individual payments on a random basis, as we are required to do by the treaty, we find that some of them are made without any appropriate sanction or, more likely, with small, medium or large errors in the transactions.  The accounts are fine, in other words, but some of the spending is done in an irregular fashion.  In fairness to the European Commission, which is in charge of most of this, it makes a real effort to keep that level of errors low, and we give an estimation of the impact of that effort in our annual report.  Were it not for its efforts both to make corrections in a given year and claw back moneys that should not have been spent, the 4.7% figure referred to on page 3 of our submission would have been nearly 6.5%.  That effort by the Commission makes a real difference.</p> <p> The key messages of the 2013 annual report will seem quite similar to last year but a few items are worth noting from an Irish point of view.  First, as for last year and indeed for quite a few years, the most error prone spending areas were regional policy, energy and transport, and rural development, environment and fisheries, most of that being in the rural development area.  As I said, the Commission makes real efforts to make corrections and recoveries, as do the member states.  Without those efforts the estimated error rate would have been 6.3%.</p><p> While we measure individual transactions on a random basis and sample basis, and estimate the level of error in those, we also look at the supervisory and control systems member states and the Commission use in maintaining control over the spend.  Some 80% of the EU spend happens at the member state level so it is important that member state systems are quite good.  </p><p> In this year's report there were some investigations of Irish systems in the agricultural area, particularly on direct payments, and we had some criticisms.  I suspect that if we did the same audit in two years' time things would be different because perhaps we would have caught the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the change of the system.  It had been updating its systems for mapping agricultural land and evaluating whether the land involved is properly claimed for but at the time we did the audit we found that those systems were not fully compliant.  We also found there was a backlog of corrections in that some individuals who had perhaps over-claimed were only being approached some years later in terms of recoveries and so forth.  To put it in perspective, we did not say that the systems were ineffective but that they were partially effective and we pointed out where improvements could be made and, I suspect, are already being made.</p><p> Unfortunately, from the Irish point of view, although it is not really a function of our work, the European Commission also did an audit and made some similar discoveries.  There is a discussion between the Irish authorities and the European Commission about whether and how much the European Commission should recover funds from Ireland in respect of those errors.  That is not my business.  I cannot tell the members about it because it is between the Commission and the member state.  There is a system called the conciliation process where the member state and the Commission engage about this, and I understand there were meetings under that conciliation process even last week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014121600005#F00300"><p>I suspect tens of millions at least.  I imagine what happens is that the Commission sets a very high number and the Irish authorities set what they would see as the realistic number, and there is a discussion on that.</p><p>  Last year we noted to the members that the commitments in the budget were growing.  In other words, in every year, as with anybody, certain cash payments are made but certain commitments for the future are made also.  The European Court of Auditors has a concern that over time the future commitments are growing.  We regularly recommend that the European Commission should produce more focused, extensive cash flow projections so that it can keep control of this small risk.</p><p>  We also know that this year, spending in the 2007 to 2013 programming period - this report was in respect of the last year of that - tended to be focused on absorption.  In other words, when member states receive money the last thing they want to do is hand it back to the EU so they could find a way to spend it but sometimes there is pressure to spend it even where the rules are not fully followed or, more likely, where the actual objectives of the particular scheme will not be fully met by the particular spending.</p><p>  I will show the members the trajectory over the years.  In the mid-2000s the figure was very high at 6.9%.  In fact, in 2006 it would have been even higher.  It has been relatively stable in the past few years at 4.7%, 4.8% and 3.9%.  We give a point estimate but as with an opinion poll it is this number plus or minus an amount, and the upper and lower level lines show that.</p> <p>Therefore, it could be said that the rate has been relatively stable for the past two or three years.</p><p> In regard to the 2% rate, which is what we say is material, we do not decide what is acceptable.  It is the European Parliament and the Council which are the discharge authorities and they decide whether they accept that or not.  Whether a 5% level is either a good achievement or a bad achievement probably depends on the particular scheme.  In other words, some schemes are very difficult to control while other schemes are less difficult to control.</p><p> I will move on to the issues that tend to be of more importance in Ireland because we are net receivers.  In the rural development area, most issues come from non-compliance with eligibility requirements for particular schemes or projects, especially in regard to agri-environment commitments.  When one receives money in the rural development area, there is very often a commitment to particular agricultural practices which have to be met, and there may be specific requirements for investment projects which are sometimes not met or there are procurement rules which are sometimes not met.  Some people ask whether that means there is a lot of waste.  In fact, in many cases it means that the money is not wasted in that the particular project the money is being paid over for may be carried through, but some of the conditions of that project, for example, that the member state will do X, Y and Z, may not be fully met.</p><p> We regularly find that if the member states had used all the information available to them, the error rate could have been maintained at a much lower rate - in theory, at 2% instead of at 6.7%.  In practice, that would probably be very difficult to achieve but, nonetheless, it does show there is a scope for improvement at the member state level.</p><p> We are often asked whether this is all about fraud.  It is not.  Most of the errors we find are mistakes or failures to comply with conditions.  We report some 14 suspected fraud cases to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, every year.  In addition to those 14 cases, we would also pass on some cases that are referred to us in error by members of the public which were more appropriate for OLAF.  After that, while we keep an eye on them, those cases are really for OLAF to follow up on from that point on, and sometimes also for the national authorities, which might also start a criminal case.</p><p> Those are the basics on the annual report.  This year, we have been making a real effort to produce some other products.  The year 2013 was the end of a seven-year programme period so we were trying to do a little bit more strategic thinking.  We produced three or four projects this year that are aimed at looking back over the past few years and looking into the future with regard to what ought to be addressed by policymakers and what might be useful to policymakers from our work, by bringing together various aspects of our work.</p><p> Two of these products are called landscape reviews, which are overview studies that are not audits but are based on the experience and evidence we have collected in the course of audit work.  The first of these, for which I was the reporting member, concerns accountability and public audit arrangements.  In other words, we looked at the way the European Union accounts for its spending and activities, whether that meets reasonable standards and also whether the audit arrangements in place are reasonable.  It turns out this is quite a big question.</p> <p>In a way the system is quite simple, the European Commission spends most of the money and accounts for its activities to the European Parliament and Council, and the European Court of Auditors steps in to inform the process with our studies and work.  It should be relatively simple, but although the European Commission is the principal spender, many bodies use European money and European legal frameworks to progress the European agenda.  Approximately 40 separate agencies, banks and funds, including the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the ECB and the Court of Auditors, and the European Court of Justice spend European money.</p><p> Much of the European effort is done in partnership, with many types of international bodies or through PPP arrangements.  A total of 80% of the spend is managed through national, regional and local authorities.  The beneficiaries themselves have reporting obligations.  I believe there are 12 million farmers and &euro;8 million for the Common Agricultural Policy alone.  The number of people who must account for their activities with European money is pretty substantial.  The number of people to whom they must account is also substantial.  We have 750 MEPs and ten different configurations of the European Council.  There are also obligations to be accountable to national parliaments and we are all supposed to account to our people, who amount to 500 million.  As with everything else, there are quite a few auditors in the mix, including ourselves and national audit officers.  Some of the institutions have their own audit boards and committees or hire private external auditors and the Commission has internal auditors.  There is a lot going on in this.</p><p> European Union accountability is itself a complex and very large industry.  It would be no surprise to hear there are gaps and overlaps in the system.  Many of these come from how the work of the EU is done.  The EU co-ordinates activities happening at member state level, such as the Lisbon agenda and Europe 2020.  Many of the actions under these are supposed to happen at member state level but the co-ordination and initiative is at European level.  How does one account for this and who audits it?  It is very fragmented.  Similarly we have arrangements whereby some member states are involved and others are not, and Schengen and the eurozone are classic examples.  Not all member states are involved, but the eurozone institutions go to the European Parliament to account for themselves.  Many MEPs are not even in the eurozone or Schengen area.  It creates a certain amount of complication.  One can say it is fine and it works, but in the past year ten or 11 Ministers from various member states have said that perhaps eurozone accountability should be to a subset of the European Parliament.  It sounds like it would be very difficult to organise, but the question is out there in the ether.</p><p> As I stated, much work is done through partnerships, through PPPs and with international institutions.  The problem here is that audit tends to stop at the point where the funds are paid over to the project, but the partnership continues and does its work and it may not be as accountable to the European polity as if the Commission or a member state were spending the funds directly.  There is a need, especially now with the big Juncker initiative, to ask whether, if we are to have these big partnerships, we will have ways in which parliaments can scrutinise them, and not necessarily just the European Parliament.</p><p> In the European Union institutional set-up there are inconsistencies and various levels of audit and parliamentary scrutiny according to the bodies.  The ECB and EIB each have different arrangements based on their particular nature.  The EIB the accounts to the European Parliament but does not have a formal obligation to do so.</p> <p>However, it may not in all cases consider that it has an obligation to account nationally.  Some agencies have audit arrangements that are different because they have their own cashflows and so forth.  Those inconsistencies are not wrong but their continued existence ought to be at least considered and justified. </p><p> A big problem for audit and accountability, as we have seen, is that there are often errors and weaknesses in front-line governance of the moneys.  If the governance is not right then obviously the information flow backwards will not be correct so there is an accountability deficit.</p><p>  A lot of scrutiny and audit is about following the money which is reasonable but the impact of the EU is, very often, not about money at all but regulation, legislation, co-operation and so forth.  All of those things are not easily audited or accounted for.</p><p>  The system has got even more complicated with the financial crisis.  We have more new bodies and structures with different arrangements, some of them outside the European Union framework altogether like the ESM.  There are new uses being made of  existing structures and new sets of rules.  The public perception of the EU systems is damaged and is in need of repair.</p><p> Since national parliaments, European parliamentary scrutiny, national auditors and European auditors are all in this mix then there may be a need for at least a consideration of whether there should be more collaboration between those bodies.  We need more consistent arrangements and where there are inconsistencies they ought to be justifiable.  We need better member state level scrutiny to ensure that governance is done well close to the point where the money is spent.  We need a better focus on results for the EU spend.  That is a job for the auditors to work together to reduce the level of duplication of audit work.  I mention some of that in part because the committee's work programme includes looking at the accountability of some of these EU institutions.  We have done some work on the subject and it might be of some use to the committee.  We might be able to guide the committee as to some of our sources if that is also of use.  </p><p> One of my colleagues, along with a team, has done a landscape review on the risk framework for the financial management of the EU budget.  He is looking at what are the big drivers of risks to the financial management.  It is not that risks are being unnecessarily entered into, it is that in every financial system there is a set of risks which ought to be addressed and considered.  Based on our audit work of the past several years, we have produced a survey of risks for financial management.  The work provides a high level overview and these four risks, which Members can see before them, are the four key aspects.  The document goes through each of the policy areas of the European Union spend and in the case of each of those policy areas it examines what are the key issues that might arise.</p><p> The project amounts to a financial management risk register for the EU which ought to act as an agenda for action for policy makers for the next several years.  As legislation is being prepared and as the mid-term review of the next financial framework arises, policy makers should be able to take account of this very extensive document in order to guide their work to improve the governance systems.</p><p> Some of the factors leading to risks, eligibility rules and other conditions for receiving EU support are often not applied correctly.  A huge issue is that public procurement rules and procedures are not applied correctly.</p> <p>European public procurement systems are a terrible nuisance.  They are complicated and it is sometimes difficult for bodies which are spending EU money to apply them.  On the other hand, they serve a particular purpose, namely, to ensure that the free market operates, that national discrimination does not occur, that there is no inappropriate discrimination between the large and the small, and that there is no collusion on practices.  If one stated that 25,000 bodies were engaged in applying these public procurement practices, one would reach the conclusion that the system is very complex.  The number of organisations involved is not 25,000, it is actually 250,000.  This means that literally millions of public procurement processes, which involve the use of EU money, are in train each year.  The capacity for a system as complex as this to get things wrong is, therefore, large.  However, getting it right also becomes a very important mechanism for driving the Single Market.</p><p> We discuss in our document to quite a degree the capacity of member state authorities to manage and spend EU moneys, and we also refer to the impact of the EU's budget on activities, cashflows and the commitments that are outstanding.  It is a 100-page document and it would take some time to go through it.  I do not plan to take the committee through it.  However, I suggest that members take the opportunity to peruse it because they might find some matters of interest to them.  The other document we provided contains a few tables and interesting facts at the end but I do not believe members need to read them for the moment.</p></speech>

It appears the rate is holding steady at approximately 5%, albeit it has risen slightly in four of the past five years.  However, it falls within the margin for error.  Are there sufficient mechanisms in place to force a reduction in the error rate?  What is outlined is not a great result.  One of the purposes of measurement is to try to force improvements and drive the rate downward.  I previously worked in the private sector and I would have expected that, in light of the amount of monitoring taking place, we would have been able to drive down the error rate.  I do not think the result is brilliant.  Is Mr. Cardiff of the view that achieving a better result would prove too costly?  The law of diminishing returns can apply.  Are we just going to be obliged to be satisfied with a figure of 5% or does Mr. Cardiff believe that member states can do more?  Is there a need to use more carrots and sticks?  Is it the case that the system is too complex and that achieving a better result would just prove too costly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014121600009#K00300"><p>There are diminishing returns and the control system is very expensive.  Within the existing control system, the auditors who do the work find errors which ought to have been noticed by the national authorities when they were making their inspections.  There is considerable room for improvement simply by means of a greater amount of attentiveness at member state level.  I do not wish to oversimplify matters because it is not as easy as that.  The auditors who do the work find opportunities that were missed in the context of keeping the rate down.  We say that the error is material if it reaches 2%.  As already stated, 2% is not an acceptability threshold.  Rather, it is a materiality threshold - it is big enough to be of importance and to be noted.  There is a mix of issues to be considered.  There is a possibility that member states could - in some cases, they should - improve their systems and their levels of attentiveness.</p> <p>Sometimes we say we need more control, but we also say we need more simplicity in the systems, because some of the errors arise from complexity.  They do not all arise from breaches of EU rules.  Some arise from breaches of national rules, because the EU rule is that one must also comply with national environmental standards, for example, so one might be meeting the EU regulation but not meeting the national standard and still be in error.  A combination of looking at the simplicity of the schemes, improving the governance at the national level and greater attentiveness could drive it down somewhat.  Whether it could be reduced to 2%, I do not know, but it could certainly be reduced.</p></speech>

The report is not country-specific and it is general under the different headings of expenditure, but would Mr. Cardiff respond to what is said to us at all our respective advice clinics and when we meet people on the street - that Ireland is far too compliant and we are far too much the good boy of Europe, that we are the best pupil in the class, to the detriment of our people and their interests, and that we over-adhere to rules and are overly oppressed by them?  Could he respond to that?</p><p>  In a similar vein, Mr. Cardiff said the over-declaration of land area is the most frequent error.  I find in my clinic work that many farmers experience huge hardship in the area of maps.  My experience from clinic work - I do not know if this is replicated in other agricultural constituencies - is that the farmers produce their maps in good faith, as per their own understanding of their holdings, and because of something from the digitised maps or whatever, they are alleged to be non-compliant, to have over-declared, perhaps because of a bog bank or old land ownership structures.  It causes immense hardship for a number of individuals and we spend a great deal of time unravelling this for people in our constituency office.  I presume that if we do this, so do many agricultural planners and professional people.  I would like Mr. Cardiff's response to that.</p><p>  There is another issue around procurement.  I would be interested if Mr. Cardiff would elaborate on what he means by non-compliance in the area of procurement.  An issue that affects a Border constituency in a big way is that many small jobs up our way in Cavan, Monaghan and along the Border must, under strict interpretation of EU laws, go to open tender, which means they must be cross-national.  This means they must have tenders from Northern Ireland, and because of various considerations, such as wages, social welfare and other matters, it is possible for many small contractors on the northern side of the Border to do jobs much more cheaply in the Republic.  Consequently, under EU regulations and as per the rules, they get the contracts.  Is it the case that derogations are given in other states for small contracts and for a situation like ours?  Is there potential for our Government to seek derogations for contracts under a certain level from the rule of international tendering or procurement?  If there is not such a potential, am I wrong in thinking that it happens in other countries?  It has been said to me - and truthfully I do not have the detail and I would be interested in Mr. Cardiff's response - that in France, for example, and other countries, the state has negotiated a situation where public procurements up to a certain value can be domestically sourced within EU law, by virtue of a concession granted.</p> <p>From my practical interaction with the agricultural spend, I find that farmers go through awful hardship around the maps issue - the digitisation of maps, the lands, occasionally bog banks, old rights of way, etc. - and it costs them a great deal of angst and professional fees to sort it out.  Sometimes the fees are a high proportion of the grant in the first case.</p><p> My second issue is around procurement in a Border area, where people across the Border in Northern Ireland can get a small job in the Republic of Ireland.  They may have cheaper labour, there are all sorts of issues around social welfare and the black market economy, etc., which would be a breach of procurement, but a number of issues arise that might make it easy for competitors to come in and get a contract in the Republic.  Many small contractors in my Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, and I presume also in Donegal and Louth, are greatly hampered by the rule that dictates that procurement must be offered into Northern Ireland.  Is there potential for a derogation for a certain level of contract?  I would be interested in Mr. Cardiff's response to all of that.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to absent myself.  I was trying to cover two headings at the same time.  It is a very difficult thing to do.  Those of us who are familiar with urban and rural areas would always be quick to point out that the qualification guidelines for European-based or European-assisted payments to farmers or anybody else are very rigid.  They are much more rigid than they were.  It makes great copy to put out the word in some quarters that there is huge scope for abuse in a particular area.  It suffices to say that everything is now guided by satellite.  All measurements are governed by satellite.  On my way in this morning, I saw one of these mapping planes overhead.  There is a revision taking place at present.  It comes down to the last 5 ft. or 10 ft.  It is even closer than that.  They are down to the last foot.  The same grids are used for sowing corn, cereals and all this kind of stuff.  It is unbelievably minute in terms of its determination of area and space.  The sowing of corn and cereal is done with the assistance of satellites at present.  All one has to do is follow the GPS map and away one goes.</p><p>  The degree to which severe penalties are applied to the overlooking of guidelines, which could be accidental or deliberate, is another issue.  No really fair method of assessing why they were overlooked has been identified.  The penalties are very severe.  In some cases, a penalty of three years of non-payment or non-qualification can be applied.  My view is that this system is overly bureaucratised at present.  Simplicity has gone out the window for a long time.  With modern technology, it should not be as difficult to deal with areas as it was in the past.  The farmer does not need to be the owner of the property.  He is quite entitled to the same thing if he has the property leased.  If one sows a garden on the corner of the property one has leased, that will be spotted by the aerial sector.  The general rule is that the farmer, businessperson or whoever he is should over-estimate and err on the side of safety in order to ensure he is covered if he digs up a cabbage plot or something and takes it out of the area aid area and he will not be penalised for loss of supports over a wide area.  We spoke before the meeting started about the protection of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

We now live in a time when it is a sacrilege to drain areas of wetlands on the basis that some little slug who is living there and worming his way into infinity needs to be protected at all costs.  Some years ago, &euro;20 million had to be spent to divert a motorway after one of these slugs was discovered.  His name was vertigo angustior.</p></speech>

To what extent has the court seen such situations?  How does it examine and deal with them?  My colleagues have rightly referred to what happens in the agriculture sector.  How we can eliminate the issuing by one Department of a directive that is in violation of another Department's objectives, for want of a better description?  If the two of them are in conflict with each other, the only way this can be resolved, even if it leads to massive losses, is to get massive input from legal experts and bring all kinds of consultants on board.</p><p> I asked earlier for an identification of the issues that create Euroscepticism.  What are the issues that create Euroscepticism in this country?  The one that comes immediately to mind is the habitats directive.  The issue of turf cutting was a major issue in the most recent European elections.  It does not affect urban areas, but it certainly affected vast tracts of rural areas.  Aircraft were sent to monitor the activities of some guy who was cutting turf in a small area where his grandfather and his grandfather's grandfather had cut turf previously.  To my mind, it is utterly and totally ridiculous for that kind of thing to happen.  It has to be possible to find an alternative way of doing things, other than by spending money on heavy-handed activity to ensure a directive is complied with.  If the directive cannot be complied with, it should not be there in the first place.  The degree to which we contribute to the debate beforehand is limited to say the least.  We do not normally get a chance to contribute.  When I was serving as Chairman of this committee, I was told at a meeting in Brussels by a number of people that they represented millions of people all over Europe.  None of them were politicians at all.  They had no such function at all.  They were never elected by anybody anywhere.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the degree of duplication and the cost involved.  The famous case of the hen harrier would be another example.  The designation of special areas of conservation certainly caused the generation of a great deal of antipathy towards Europe, towards politics in general and towards the European institutions.</p><p>  I would like to make a final point in this whole area.  If we do not identify the issues that are causing antipathy towards Europe, we are walking lemming-like towards the cliffs.  In such circumstances, we will not solve our problems here or across Europe.  It is up to ourselves.  Simplification is one of the issues we must consider.  Reason is another.  I will give a classical example of a contradiction we must not forget.  In order to qualify for a particular payment in some special areas of conservation, one can get a grant for fencing from the relevant Government Department.  Under another directive, one is not allowed to create a fence in the same area.  One cannot create a fence and, at the same time, one must create a fence and one gets a grant to provide the fencing necessary to keep livestock in off the roads and the special areas.  It is utterly crazy when we go down that road.  Large columns of what we are doing are totally and absolutely in conflict with itself.</p></speech>

Deputies Eric Byrne and O'Reilly want to get back in as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014121600013#O00700"><p>I will run through the questions in order.  I was asked whether the schemes are overly complicated.  We think they are.  That is what we are saying.  At other times, we point out that certain schemes are capable of being abused and therefore require extra complications here and there.  As a general principle, the European Court of Auditors regularly suggests that simplification would lead to less error.</p> <p> On the area of maps, our job is to indicate problems and maps are used by all the control systems, both in terms of deciding how much a person can claim but also in terms of deciding when something has been over-claimed.  Of course, while it is a problem, I do not know whether we could manage without them at any level of the control system, whether it is the European Court of Auditors or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  At least, as they improve, we will have the benefit of some additional precision, as Deputy Durkan said.</p><p> On the question of whether we are worse or better than anybody else, we have produced some national data this year to cover the 2007-13 period.   We work on a sample basis and small countries get sampled less, so we do not have enough information on Ireland to come to definitive conclusions.  However, while there is no evidence to say we are wonderful, nor is there anything to suggest we are a lot worse than anybody else.  We are not immune from errors, at the least.  As I said earlier, we reported 14 suspected cases of fraud to OLAF this year, not 100, 200 or 300.  Our auditors are not arriving at the farm gate, the factory gate or the sites of European spending and saying there is a lot of clear, out-and-out fraud afoot.  While some of the errors are egregious, and are out-and-out, pull-the-other-one stuff, most of the errors we find are smallish relative to the spend involved.  Of course, with small things, it is always very difficult to say whether it is deliberate or not.  Perhaps I have solved the urban-rural divide by saying there is a little truth in everything but that we should not exaggerate this.</p><p> On the culture in existence in agriculture, I am from Santry and I do not know.  We certainly see some small number of cases in every country across Europe that suggest people are simply not attending to their obligations, but not all by any means.  The auditors on the ground do come across the cases that other people were talking about, where people simply under-claim to avoid getting it wrong.  Of course, we never report an under-claim.</p><p> Are over-payments recouped by the Commission?  Yes, they are, and also by the member state.  One of the issues is that if something is caught late - for example, if an over-claim is noticed four or five years on - is one statute-barred from chasing back?  By the time it is found, investigated, reported to the Commission and brought back, it can take quite a long time.  It is clear that member states in general do not recoup anything like the amount the Commission might demand from them as a recovery but they certainly do have a practice of going back and doing that.</p><p> With regard to Ukraine, Moldova and so forth, we have a division of the court that looks at external actions, and it does go into those places where European money is spent.  There is an audit ongoing on Ukraine and some of my colleagues came back two weeks ago and hung up their flak jackets after a visit to Afghanistan.  Where European money is spent, one might find a Court of Auditors person there, unless it is really very hot, in which case discretion might be the better part.</p><p> I was asked whether member states and the Commission take sufficient interest in our findings.  We live in hope.  The world is not changing as rapidly as we would have liked, so the answer may be that things could be better.  However, we find that the Commission at least makes an effort to address our recommendations, and it is usually a fairly honest effort, even if it does not always go as far as we would have hoped.  An auditor's job is a dream one in the sense that one can make all the recommendations one likes; one does not have to be responsible for carrying them out.  It is perhaps a bit hard on the Commission sometimes because our job is to criticise, not to implement.</p> <p>For example, we published a report yesterday about good practice.  We went looking for good practice in countries in terms of ensuring the reasonableness of costs in rural development with a view to helping the Commission and the member states to identify what other countries do that works and to spread that message around.  In a sense, we have access rights that others do not have so that was an attempt to be positive.</p><p> On the question of what issues create euroscepticism in Ireland, such as the habitats directive, the lack of accountability is one issue we are trying to address.  I have relatives in the same part of the country as the Deputy's slug, or was it a snail?</p></speech>

However, I was at a conference some six months ago where members of the European Parliament were discussing precisely that issue of how representative these people are, whether they are too influential or not influential enough, and whether the Commission gives them too much money in order to lobby.  Those kinds of questions are at least in the European Parliament if not in our organisation.</p></speech>

The Commission says that these groups represent people and topics that would not otherwise get represented and, if it did not, industry would have too much of a say in things.</p><p>  With regard to internal conflicts, we do what we call special reports or performance reports where we pick a topic and we look through how European policy works in that area.  We did one recently on the interaction of water policy in the environmental part of the Commission and the Common Agricultural Policy, and whether the two are well aligned or not.  The answer is that the situation could clearly be better.  A full list of these special reports is available.  More than occasionally, we look at how different types of EU policy are interacting with each other to find whether there are these overlaps and so forth.  It is probably inevitable in a very complex world that these issues will sometimes arise.  I do not know about the specific issue of the fencing except that, if people are in a special area of conservation, they are probably not allowed a fence, even if they can get a grant for it.</p><p>  That deals with most of the questions.  I might ask Mr. Fennessy to deal with the issue of public procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Fennessy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014121600015#Q00600"><p>First, on the Chairman's comment on controllability and so forth, we were asked whether 5% is a reasonable achievement and whether 2% is impossible.  There has been a lot of debate over time about the tolerable rate of error.  In dealing with that, it was proposed that, for certain policy areas, the tolerable rate of error should be higher, perhaps up to 5%.  The consensus was that this was a licence to tolerate too much error, so it was rejected at the time.</p><p>  With regard to public procurement, while I am not expert in the domain, from my experience, the requirements are graduated depending on the amount of money involved.  For instance, if it is less than &euro;50,000, the obligations are a lot less than if it is more.  The business of opening up the tender procedure to a wider audience is very much dependent on the amounts involved.  The Deputy made a comment about some possible derogations for France.  I am not aware of any such derogations for any individual country, and I would be surprised if that were the case.</p> <p>Maybe there is a derogation in the sense that not everybody speaks French, so it is a natural constraint.  I would also say that price is only one element in public procurement.  It does not necessarily have to be the primordial element.  It does not have to be the cheapest price that prevails.  If there is reason to justify another tender it is perfectly feasible and correct to do so.</p></speech>

Apologies I am late, I was at another committee meeting and missed the witnesses' presentation.  I head the end of the interaction between the two colleagues concerning the agricultural side of things and I know the Department of Agriculture has received notice of a fine of &euro;180 million which they actively challenging.  They are confident they will be able to get that reduced.</p><p>  As Deputy Durkan has explained, there have been huge inroads made on satellite inspections.  Because of the increasing use of technology over the last years, retrospective penalties have been applied to farmers.  One might say this is somewhat unfair, but the EU has stated that this money has gone out and must be recouped.  The increased and better use of technology has enabled these penalties to be applied.  A lot of this comes across my desk as a rural Deputy and often it is a case of farmers applying for the same thing every year and not changing it rather than intending to apply for things erroneously.  They have declared the same areas of land every year without updating them, rather than going out of their way to do something incorrectly.  In the future, I imagine, the impact on agricultural payments will be reduced as the technology improves because there will be certainty about what farmers can apply for.</p><p>  Regarding the rural development side of things, I imagine the leader programme is a big part of that.  Is there any scrutiny of it or of its comparable programmes across the EU?  I know in some cases there are groups applying for monies.  I would imagine there have been very few problems but I have come across some issues.  For example, a group has maybe been approved for funding by the Department, and has not done anything wrong, but subsequently through audits and investigations the Department  decides they should not have been approved under the rules.  The leader company, for example, may have sanctioned funding and misinterpreted the rules in concluding that it fell under a category which was eligible for funding.  Is that something the witnesses have come across?</p></speech>

I want to admire the farming community, the farmers who farm properly and in accordance with the directives, be it the Habitat Directive or whatever, because biodiversity is a hugely important thing.

He insulted the snails by calling them slugs, but both have a very important role to play in biodiversity.  I praise the directives that have now managed to allow us to reintroduce species that had been eradicated in the past by incorrect application of agricultural methods.  I praise the grant assistance to the farming community to reintroduce the corncrakes.  I praise the reintroduction of the hen harriers in Wicklow, and the eagles we bring in from Scotland.  However, the negative of that is that we are losing disproportionate numbers of our wildlife by incorrect agricultural processes, i.e. the cyanide poisoning of carcasses to kill off foxes, which in turn is killing off these rare species.</p> <p>In the past, DDT was one of the major agricultural killers.  There is a balance to be struck.  Farmers have got to be praised when they are operating to the rules.  Farmers who put the cyanide on the carcasses, which is illegal, should never be praised.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Cardiff, Ms Kerrigan and Mr. Fennessy to our meeting.  I get very little representation from people who have difficulties.  Farmers are terribly compliant and have always shown great respect for the European Union.  We have our own organic farm so I know.  I suppose there is really, quite frankly, an over-supervision of Irish farming from the Department's point of view.  Maybe at times they just want to send people out.  Farmers love their land and their stock.</p><p>  Are the witnesses averse to anyone making representations to them if there are problems for any particular individual, or are they completely aloof and not responsive to anyone that might have a very good case?  I have not got one by the way, I am just wondering if they would respond if they saw a case and saw that it concerned an honest, decent genuine person living on a small farm.  I fill out some of these forms, Chairman, and you would not believe them.  They were unreal.</p></speech>

Regarding leader programmes, we did an audit on it some years ago now.  In fact it was picked up on a little in debate here.  We were quite positive about the community nature of how leaders worked here but there were some negatives in the leader system more generally.  We can certainly send that to Deputy Kyne, though it is now a little bit out of date.</p><p>  On the question of responding to individual representations, there is not much point because we do not audit the farmer.  We might turn up at a farm but we are really auditing the member state, the Commission and the work they do.  We never impose a penalty.  In our training we do make a certain amount of effort to ensure that when auditors turn up at a farm, they understand that this is a stress and a strain on the farmer concerned and that they must deal properly, respectfully and reasonably with people.  We would expect the same standards from other auditors.  It is a problem for us that when we turn up at a farm there may be two of us and the paying agencies or the Department of Agriculture might come along as well.  In some countries, the national audit office would come along as well, so there might be ten people turning up because we have turned up.</p></speech>

On whether people should have known a banking crisis was looming, we know that globally there is strong potential for an environmental crisis in the next ten, 20 or 30 years.  The European Union and everybody else should at least be engaged on that issue which we should not avoid because it is unpleasant to deal with.  The question of how one deals with it is much more complex and, of course, as auditors, when we are compiling special reports in particular, we look at how they will be implemented.  When somebody has received funding on condition that some environmental measure will be adhered to, we check that there is cross-compliance.  That is part of the audit process.</p></speech>

As I assume they heard our notice on privilege as it was being read, we can take it as read.  The committee is keen to be briefed on the European Year for Development initiative in 2015.  It is my understanding that our guests will share time.  We will start with Ms Kelly who will be followed by Ms Towey.  All three of our guests will answer questions.</p></speech>

I know that it has been a very busy period and that the committee has had a full agenda today.  Therefore, we thank it for fitting us in.</p><p>  Members are aware that 2015 will be European Year for Development.  Given the committee's role in European Union affairs, we would like to explore some of the opportunities that will arise.  Since the early 1980s, the European Union has been designating thematic European years to highlight specific issues of relevance.  This designation is very important for us in that the Union is taking external action in looking at the European Year for Development initiative.</p><p>  The year 2015 is important in terms of the future of humanity.  During it there will be two United Nations summit meetings which will effectively define the parameters for international policy making.  In September the United Nations will agree new goals in the sustainable development framework in looking at tackling poverty, inequality and environmental destruction.  We look to the European Union affairs committee to consider how it would like to be involved in this process in terms of scrutinising policy and ensuring it is proofed and how Ireland will respond in that context.</p><p>  In December the climate change summit to be held in Paris will set new climate action targets.  Again, we would like to bring this to the committee's notice and ask for its input in terms of how it can be involved in that context.  </p><p>  All people in Ireland should be aware of the importance of these decision-making processes.  More public debate is needed on Ireland's role in building and implementing a new global consensus on how we can ensure justice, equality and prosperity for all, without destroying the planet's resources and excluding anybody from the benefits of global trade and co-operation.  The European Year for Development initiative in 2015 will present an opportunity to celebrate the many ways in which people in Ireland are already working towards a better and more sustainable future in the world. </p><p>  Ireland has a rich and diverse civil society and every day hundreds of thousands of people donate, volunteer, advocate and campaign for a better world.  We believe 2015 is the year in which to celebrate the power of ordinary people to make a real difference and be more involved.  It will not be a European year of conferences; rather, it will be a year of citizen action to have a better world.  We have some very exciting events planned, an outline of which was provided for the secretariat before the meeting.  On 22 January the President will launch an event on our behalf as part as his ethics initiative.  I take the opportunity to invite the Chairman and members to come and support the event.  It will be a year in which to honour and encourage people to continue to stand up for what is right and a year of active citizenship as it relates to global issues.  We will be connecting what is happening in Ireland with what is happening across the world.  We are here to explore these options with members.  My colleague, Ms Towey, will outline in greater detail what they might look like.</p><p>  We very much welcome the members of the committee in being involved and engaged in this activity next year and I hope they will take up the opportunity.  In particular, we would like the committee to be involved in scrutinising policy as it relates to a different era ahead us in terms of the new sustainable development framework and in terms of the impact of what we do here, as well as of what is happening across the globe.</p><p>  I again thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to appear before them.</p></speech>

The committee can help to shape the Union's position on these key issues.  The core message coming from the preparatory processes is that business as usual is not an option in a world which is effectively trying to manage extreme poverty, growing inequality, increased climate volatility and environmental degradation and bold choices must be made.  This is far from impossible, but such choices require leadership, bravery and courage to tackle some of the issues head on.  We are aware of some of the challenges following the Lima event last week, at which the international community struggled to find a consensus which would be strong enough to get us to where we needed to be in dealing with the environmental challenges and, equally, the development challenges.</p><p>  The committee could play a number of particular roles and we are keen to hear members' perspectives and how they believe these roles could be played next year.  We see it as a potential focal point in dealing with the issues arising from the negotiations with regard to what will happen post-2015 in dealing with climate change.  It could promote public debate on the hot topics in these two areas.  It could also provide a place for Members of the Oireachtas to receive updates on how international thinking was evolving.</p><p>  Another potential role is to act as a sounding board.  The committee could provide a feedback mechanism for Members of the Oireachtas on the European Union's internal decision-making.  Its discussions could help to strengthen the understanding of the Oireachtas of the issues at stake and help it to reach out to those specialist voices in Irish civil society who should be part of the discussions.</p></speech>

The committee has a remit to scrutinise legislation.  The agreements to be reached in 2015 will have far-reaching consequences for the policy options open to the Government and the Oireachtas.  They need to be discussed and assessed before they are set in stone.  </p><p>  A further role for the committee is to act as a facilitator.  The European Year for Development initiative is expected to generate much public attention and will provide an opportunity for members to use the increased awareness of international co-operation to highlight some of its work.  Any event or hearing organised by the committee during 2015 could be considered as part of its contribution to the European Year for Development.  The annual Europe Day celebrations could form part of this contribution.  This could provide for a degree of cohesion and also a sense of urgency about the work of Ireland's development NGOs and the committee.</p><p>  The committee could also be an inspiration.  It has been a strong and understanding supporter of active citizenship, which is at the heart of our plans for the European Year for Development.  It could, therefore, use the year as a reason to engage with inspirational people and organisations that have broken new ground when it comes to taking real action which will have an impact on European integration and international solidarity.</p><p>  During the year members of D&oacute;chas will organise a large range of initiatives and events, on which we will communicate information to the committee via our website and social media.  We hope that by the end of the year it will have inspired thousands of people to believe they have more power and influence to bring to bear on the decisions being made on big global issues.  We hope to encourage people to recognise their potential as agents of change and to address the sense of powerlessness they sometimes feel when it comes to decisions made at European level.</p><p>  We believe 2015 will be a very important year and are convinced the people of Ireland should be given a chance to engage in some of these discussions and make their views and opinions heard.  For this reason, the European Year for Development initiative is very important for us and we hope it will be inspiring.  We look forward to working with the committee.  We particularly look forward to hearing the views of members on what the role of the committee should be.  We will be delighted to work with them to tease out some concrete initiatives in which we could engage with the committee during the 12 months ahead.</p></speech>

They have asked us to consider a number of points, which we certainly will do.  The witnesses are aware we operate a system of mainstreaming, so when it comes to the scrutiny of legislation from Europe, it goes to the relevant sectoral committee.  Climate change will go to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade will deal with development.  I suggest that after this meeting we will write to the various Chairmen of these committees to let them know we have been speaking to the witnesses and what they are seeking with regard to engagement from various committees.  I would see it as not only this committee playing a role but other committees being involved as well.  We can certainly be a focal point in the public debate, and we can be a sounding board, but we will have to involve other committees.  We will take away what Ms Kelly and Ms Towey have said and discuss in private session how we can move forward on it.</p></speech>

It is 30 years since the famine in Ethiopia and Band Aid.  I watched a documentary recently which examined the improvements in the country, and much of it was focused on agriculture, soil erosion, using the correct type of plants and the terracing of mountain slopes and hills.  It was very interesting, and from what I saw, things have greatly improved in this area which was particularly problematic.  It comes back to the concept of teaching somebody to fish rather than just giving them food.  Is this the model D&oacute;chas uses?  I know it works with Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, Gorta, GOAL and other bodies.  Is it involved in particular areas?  Will the witnesses elaborate on the role D&oacute;chas plays?  Does it go to particular areas suffering famine or does it take a world view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-16a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014121600021#W00300"><p>I apologise for being late as I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber for Leaders' Questions.  Yesterday I returned from Tanzania.  I was there with AWEPA, the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa.  It was a real eye-opener.  We saw some of the positive work which is taking place and some of the challenges facing various aid agencies.  I congratulate Irish Aid.  Many of the projects we visited were excellent.  Through a particular programme, rice yields are six times that of neighbouring areas and this was down to Irish Aid involvement.</p><p>  The witnesses spoke of a Europe-wide approach to many of these problems.  The road infrastructure in that part of Africa often means one road leads to, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia or Uganda, and this road has one lane in each direction.  If there is a crash, which occurred when we were there, traffic backs up.  Some areas have very good roads, but if investment was made in roads in Africa, people would be able to get their goods to market.  It is a simple example.</p><p>  We have examples and comparisons in Ireland about which we could speak to people in Africa.  Some of them are historical, for example, hunger, colonisation, rural inequality, rural resettlement and forced emigration.</p> <p>One can talk on all those issues and the positive thing is that we do not have any hidden agenda, unlike some in the region who are involved in this.  I think that went down well.  It has had a huge impact on any of those countries in which we are involved, and we have been involved in the poorest of the poor.</p><p> Ireland has been made co-facilitator, with Kenya, on the negotiations leading up to the September sustainable development summit.  Could the witnesses expand on what they think the priorities should be in that area?  When one sees these things being designated, big development summits planned and series of conferences and so on, the big problem is that in many cases ordinary people are left out.  What are their plans to include ordinary people in these discussions in Ireland, and more generally to include voices from the global south in the discussions?  Over 80% of people support Irish Aid, even right through the recession.  That says a great deal.  People have inherent memory and they remember the difficulties we went through ourselves.  Inequality has increased in Ireland due to austerity and other factors.  Are there any plans to link development and inequality in Europe with other regions and to look at the areas of focus of overseas aid and how some of it can end up being abused?</p><p> When we were in Tanzania the big issue was that funds had gone missing from the equivalent of the ESB and money ended up in some of the ministers' accounts, similar to what happened in Uganda that time.  The message from that was that where we were supporting the public accounts committee and the budget committee, they were the ones who stepped up to the plate when asked, as happened in Uganda with the auditor general's office.  They are things that are happening.  That is the positive message for development and some of the work we are doing.  I congratulate the workers we met on all those projects.  We certainly had criticisms of some of the things we saw.  We went to one sunflower milling plant where there are buildings and machinery, but it is in the middle of nowhere and there is no electricity.  How did that happen?</p></speech>

We went to another that had enough sunflower seed for the factory to operate for six months.  What are they to do for the other six months?  It is about looking at the broader picture.  These are just some examples.  The sixfold increase in rice yields is one thing but the miller gets four times the price  from the next middle man that the farmer got.  When one arrives with the rice still in its hulls, there is no weighing machine for the rice, so a guess is made, but lo and behold, when the miller is selling it on to the next middle man, there is a weighing scales.  These are some of the issues we must focus on.  We start off development with the rice farmer, and then we need to look at the next stage and the one after that and complete the circle.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  Frankly, I did not know next year was the European Year for Development.  Having heard the witnesses' contributions, I am still not quite sure what is the lead agency.  I hear the witnesses presenting a number of jobs for this committee to do, so I hope the Chairman was listening, but I do not know that questions are being posed to the witnesses as representatives of the NGO sector.  Is D&oacute;chas the lead sector?  Has Europe nominated it to be the lead sector?</p><p>  I lived in Africa for four years, and I know Tanzania very well, but where do we start?  The witnesses gave us a great deal of material regarding environmental challenges.  The Lima conference has just concluded and we had a debate here in the witnesses' absence, unfortunately, about hen harriers, slugs, snails and bats and the conflict.  Some of us recognise how proper farming can actually enhance the environment and one can reintroduce hen harriers and sustain the peregrine falcons, among other things.</p> <p>There is obviously conflict with the agricultural sector, because the two speakers were arguing very strongly about the rights of the farmers and how there is too much bureaucracy and implementation of law.  It is a thematic year, but it seems to be a very vast theme.  We heard about the rice farmer and all the rest in Tanzania.  Are we talking about the pastoralists in Africa, for example the Maasai or the other pastoralists, whose livelihood has been threatened for various reasons, some political but many climactic, including desertification?  The nomadic people are becoming less and less nomadic.  Lake Tanganyika is shrinking in volume.  There are islands about to disappear.  Members may have heard the emotive speech by a woman who had her baby with her and was pregnant about how if we do not do something, her whole island will go under because of the melting ice caps.  I am begging for direction from the witnesses.  They listed a great deal and they said they made some submission to the committee, which I do not have here but would be very helpful-----</p></speech>

Yes, it is the European Year for Development, but why and who is in charge?  D&oacute;chas is the co-ordinator in Ireland for the 2015 plan of action.  There are similar co-ordinators in the other member states.  In most countries they are government gepartments, but in Ireland and a few other countries it is the NGO umbrella group that has been tasked to be the co-ordinator.</p></speech>

This is important and binds the three questions together.  My colleagues have talked about the sustainable development goals that will be agreed in September next year.  This will be a new global framework, with the priorities for sustainable development, whatever that means, for the next 15 years.  If this agreement is reached in September, every member of the United Nations will have to come up with an action plan on what sustainable development means for that country.  Unlike the millennium development goals, which have been the framework for the work of aid agencies over the past 15 years, this new set of goals will be universal.  It will be for rich as well as poor countries, so there is a significant difference.  We have come to the committee because we think the committee needs to be aware of this significant shift.</p><p>  When Deputy Crowe asks how we link issues of inequality and development overseas with issues at home, this is the answer.  The UN  framework for sustainable development binds us all.  It is then up to each country to decide what that means in practice and what it will prioritise.  That is the key issue for us.  This is an important discussion, which is much wider than just the aid agencies that are working together in D&oacute;chas.  Deputy Kyne asked how we worked together and whether there were different approaches.  D&oacute;chas has 61 member organisations and they all have a different answer, but what binds us together is a very simple philosophy.  We say that in order for poor people in poor communities to change their fate, they must organise.  They must come together as a community, understand what their situation is and where their weaknesses are, where they are being exploited or where they are losing the fight.  That is the key thing that all our members are convinced of.  It is about community mobilisation.</p> <p>That is a key factor about which all our members are convinced.  It is about community mobilisation.  If the members of a community come to us with an analysis of their situation, it is about facilitating and supporting them in developing and implementing a strategy to change the situation.  That can be a technical solution at times.  It can be about a road or a mill but it can also be more in the social or political area.  It depends on the local situation and the local community.  </p><p> We try to celebrate many of these differences.  Deputy Crowe is right in that enormous progress is being made in developing countries, including Ethiopia.  We know that the way we work works.  We as non-governmental organisations know what we are good at and what we are not good at.  There is a division of labour between the United Nations, agencies, governments and so on, but together we have a coherent approach through the millennium development goals and for the next 15 years through the next framework that will be agreed in September.  That is why I want to emphasise the importance of the international negotiation process that is currently ongoing and, as the Deputy said, that is being chaired by Ireland.  It is a phenomenal responsibility and honour for our country.  For that reason alone, we need to look at it.</p><p> A question was asked about corruption.  That comes back to my answer to Deputy Kyne's question.  It is about organising people.  Technology is helping us in this regard.  If I, as an individual, am confronted by a corrupt policeman asking me to pay a bribe to use a road, there is very little I can do, although I can report it.  In countries such as India and Kenya there are apps that people have on their phones - a smartphone is not required; it can be a dumb phone - that people can use to register that they were asked for a bribe by a policemen on a certain street at a certain time.  If everybody reports this, a pattern emerges; it can be traced to an individual policeman and action can be taken.  Amazing possibilities are being opened to us and our members are using these.</p><p> Ms Sharan Kelly mentioned the launch event we have on 22 January, where President Higgins will formally launch the European Year for Development and all the members' questions will be answered.  We will have a high-level conference around innovation in development co-operation on 7 May, which I hope the members will attend.</p></speech>

The European Union announced Council conclusions today.  Basically, the European Union has a common position on what is to happen post-2015.  There has been a great deal of negotiation already and Ireland was part of those negotiations within the UN around what the next set of goals should look like.  As Mr. Zomer said, the difference between the last set and next set is hopefully that the next set will be universal.  Whether it is around health, education, HIV or social protection, we as a country will need to set a bar for ourselves.  It is not just about Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia; it is about Ireland, France and Italy.  The idea is that these are goals that we internalise.  It is important that the next set of goals be universal and that we take them as seriously as developing countries.</p><p>  The second point is that the next set of goals must recognise that some countries have come a huge distance but the levels of inequality within countries have grown enormously as well.  That goes for our own country as well as the countries we work in.  Inequality, and measures to address and redress levels of inequality, are important in the new framework.  </p><p>  Third, we talk about the importance of rights.  The European Union and Ireland are very committed to a rights approach and recognising the right to education and  the right to health.</p> <p>All of these rights are important, and that is always a bone of contention at international negotiations.</p><p> There is a need for these next set of goals to have strong accountability structures.  There is already a proposed set of 17 goals on the table around broad areas.  It is trying to pull together the development agenda with the environment agenda, so it is fairly big, but between now and September next year they will have to get into the nitty-gritty around targets and indicators, and those targets and indicators have to be ambitious.  They have to be clear and they must build on existing commitments.  Those are some of the broad principles that should be included in the next set of frameworks.</p><p> Ireland has been very strong in promoting the equality agenda and the hunger agenda in terms of food and nutrition security and in focusing on gender.  There are a number of areas where Ireland has been strong, reflecting our national commitment to those areas.  We would want to see that continued, but obviously, as a co-chair, Ireland will also have a different responsibility to facilitate a process.  We want it to be as ambitious an outcome as possible and we believe it is appropriate for the committee, and many other committees, to debate the substance of these positions as they continue.</p></speech>

I am still trying to be in three or four places at the one time in terms of work.</p><p>  The definition of sustainable development is hugely important.  Who decides what is sustainable development?  For instance, who decided on the targets?  Was it decided by the United Nations centrally or by NGOs or politicians, remembering that politicians are accountable to the electorate and must stand before the electorate, and stand over whatever is agreed?  To what extent has there been an examination of the degree to which economic change may take place that may be difficult to sell to the electorate?  That is a crucial question.  It applies to everyone in this country and in every other European country because, whether we like it or not, we may have the best motives in the world and may be the best inclined in the world to do the right thing, but if it does not fall into some line or area that will receive support from the electorate in the respective countries affected by the agreement or the arrangement, it is doomed.</p></speech>

Something we would very much welcome is for the European affairs committee to look to us in terms of how we can assist in this process.  That is a good question for us to go back with in terms of the meaning of sustainable development, for us to feed into that process and have a conversation.  We would welcome an opportunity to do that with the Chairman and a number of members next year.  Another request we would have is if the committee would like to be part of our calendar of events.  We ask them to consider what that would look like for them.</p><p>  To add to what Ms Towey said in terms of our role in co-facilitating, the members probably heard about the report last week from the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, peer review and how Ireland has made a huge impact on development.  That is something of which we are proud.  As an Irish person I have a strong affinity with our heritage, and that whole engagement at grassroots level is something that D&oacute;chas pursues across all our membership.  Ordinary people in Ireland having a say about their lives and the lives of people in the global south is a big priority for D&oacute;chas and is one of the strategic directions in which we are going.  I add that to the comments from my colleagues.</p></speech>
