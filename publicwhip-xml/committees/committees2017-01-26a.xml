He is accompanied by Mr. Malachy Quinn, senior auditor.  </p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Josepha Madigan and Catherine Murphy.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 19 January.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received since the last meeting.  Item No. 268A is correspondence received from Mr. Tom Hussey at the Department of Defence about today's meeting.  Item No. 269A is also correspondence from him containing further briefing material for today's meeting.  Item No. 273A is correspondence received from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General, Department of Defence, enclosing his opening statement.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received from private individuals and other correspondence.  Item No. 257C is correspondence received from Dr. Matt Crowe, director, Environmental Protection Agency, in response to our correspondence on the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office and issues related to salmon stocks.  The correspondence states the office is funded by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, not the EPA.  As such, we will have to write to that Department directly, as suggested by the EPA.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  Item No. 263 is correspondence received from Monaghan County Council requesting the committee to investigate EirGrid expenditure.  Concerns have been raised elsewhere about EirGrid.  Does the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit its accounts?  Is there direct funding by the Exchequer of EirGrid's capital expenditure programme?</p></speech>

The views expressed by members of Monaghan County Council have been repeated by council members in counties Meath and Cavan about the manner and the conduct of EirGrid during a very flawed process.  At an oral hearing I attended, as pointed out last week at a massive rally which was covered by RTE, the views and considerations of Oireachtas Members and councillors were not recorded in a decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The points raised in the correspondence are legitimate.  I have examples of weekly advertisements across all print media platforms.  EirGrid sponsors radio shows on LMFM and expends significant moneys in sponsoring local and national GAA events.  However, that will not be much good when there are 400 pylons running across the three counties that will be impacted on, devastating the lives of the people living in them.  It is opportune and only right that Monaghan County Council is posing these questions.  Can we identify if there are direct subventions from the taxpayer to fund EirGrid&rsquo;s activities?</p></speech>

Is its debt included in the national debt?</p></speech>

The debt of commercial semi-State bodies is not part of the national debt.</p></speech>

I do not want to summarily dismiss it.  It might not strictly be within our remit, but I would not like to be glib and dismiss it without at least getting a response from the Minister on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00600"><p>I agree with that suggestion.  Does the sectoral committee have any responsibility in this regard?  EirGrid representatives were before the communications committee to discuss its policy.  Would it be appropriate for us to refer the matter to the sectoral committee and ask it to have a look at it?  That is another avenue which could be used to get answers, if it is not strictly within our remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00700"><p>We will do both.  Obviously, being a commercial semi-State body, EirGrid representatives attend the other committee.  In the meantime, we will write directly to the Minister to get a response to the letter to the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 264C is correspondence received from an anonymous source on unneeded expenditure in parts of the HSE when the moneys could clearly be better utilised.  This is a copy of a letter sent to the director general of the HSE.  I propose that we note the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 265C is correspondence received from an individual alleging the waste of public moneys on a school building in Rathnew, County Wicklow, and that there is a possible conflict of interest.  It concerns Gaelscoil Chill Mhant&aacute;in in Wicklow town and the proposal that it be relocated to Rathnew two miles away.  Concerns have been raised about the site and the costs involved.  We will forward the correspondence to the Department and request a detailed response to the issues raised.  Is that agreed? Agreed</p></speech>

Someone has gone to the trouble of drawing attention to various matters.  It takes a big effort for somebody to write a letter.  Will it be responded to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00900"><p>The letter is to Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, from an anonymous source who signs himself as being a whistleblower.  A copy of the letter was sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

There is no name, no address and no mention of any part of the country.  When HSE representatives are before the committee, members will be free to raise the issues referred to in the correspondence.</p> <p>  Item Nos. 266C, i to iv, and 267C, i and ii, are correspondence received from an individual, enclosing various newspaper articles on the payment of public moneys by Dublin City Council for the Ballymun regeneration programme.  The clerk has been in touch with the individual concerned to seek clarification which we have just received.  It will be circulated to all members shortly.  I suggest we delay consideration of this item and return to it next week.  Officials of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will attend the committee shortly.  I suggest we consider the matter next week and put the Department on notice that we will specifically raise it when we deal with the Ballymun regeneration programme.  It involves the use of pyrite.  The Comptroller and Auditor General dealt with the programme several years ago, but this is a specific issue.  The programme is also funded by the Department, not just by Dublin City Council.  The Department is the paymaster for everything involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B01200"><p>There was a special report, but our remit does not directly cover an audit of the Ballymun regeneration programme.  It was on moneys emanating from the Department and the accountability of the Accounting Officer for these funds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B01300"><p>We will put the Accounting Officer on notice that the committee will deal specifically with that funding.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 271C is a copy of an email sent to Mr. Dara Connolly, president of the Irish Pharmacy Union, regarding deficiencies in the legal system.  I propose that we note it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 272C, i and ii, is correspondence received from Deputy Catherine Murphy regarding a report from the Garda internal audit section which uncovered several financial irregularities.  An article from <i>The Sunday Times</i>is attached.  The report has not been published.  I propose that we write to the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer, asking her to indicate when the report will be published and to forward a copy to the committee.  We will not publish the report on the website once received.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 274C is correspondence received from an individual on the Courts Service review of the management and performance of the spectrum growth fund.  It is about the wards of court issue which was dealt with extensively by the previous committee.  At one of our first meetings last year we received a minute from the Department on the previous committee&rsquo;s report on wards of court.  The Department explained that it was looking at how the fund was being looked at.  I propose that we write to it to look at developments in the light of the minute given to us.  I also propose that we forward a copy of the latest correspondence on the review that has taken place and look for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It should be noted that the fund is managed by the President of the High Court and that the Judiciary is not answerable to the Oireachtas.  However, we can still try to be as constructive as possible in the matter.</p><p>I return item No. 125C.  It was agreed at our meeting of 11 November to return to this item which concerns a letter received from an individual about Horse Racing Ireland.  This and the previous committee, as well as several politicians and committees, have been approached by the person in question on several occasions.  We also agreed to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Legal Adviser&rsquo;s office, with all of the correspondence received from the individual since the start of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, to make a decision on if and how we could progress it further.</p><p>The clerk has been in touch with the Parliamentary Legal Adviser whose advice is that Horse Racing Ireland as a body audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General is accountable to this committee in respect only of its audited financial accounts.  It is not the role of the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the handling of complaints by such a body in respect of a specific individual or to become involved in resolving individual complaints between citizens and the body concerned.  </p><p> In addition, and perhaps more importantly,  the individual refers in correspondence that letters exhibited by him will be used in High Court case number 2015/10553/P.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has checked the court listings and it appears that the person initiated proceedings on 16 December 2015 against Ireland, the Attorney General, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner and that his case is listed for hearing on 23 March 2017.  Therefore, it would also be in breach of Standing Order 59 of the Standing Orders for this committee to engage with any party to live proceedings.  A copy of a draft letter is on members' screens.</p><p> I propose we write to the individual in question informing him of same and that we will be returning any future correspondence in relation to the matter to him.  Could members take a moment to look at the letter we are proposing which has, essentially, been drafted by the Parliamentary Legal Adviser?  There are live court proceedings on the matter and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser is telling us that we should not be dealing with it.  Does anyone wish to comment on the letter or can we agree?  I will give members a moment to look at it.  There has been extensive correspondence.  It is the person's right to write to us and bring these matters to our attention but after considering the matter since December, the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has recommended that we do not deal with it.  We gave a commitment that we would try to deal with it before the end of January.  Do members have any comments or do they agree or disagree with the contents?  Can we get approval for the clerk to issue that letter on behalf of the committee?</p></speech>

Are there any queries on it?  The unanimous view of the meeting is that the clerk should issue the attached letter to the individual concerned.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda concerns statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  They will come up on the screen.  The first item is No. 4.1, University College Cork, regarding a qualified audit opinion relating to recognition by the university of expected future Exchequer funding and the non-consolidation of the UCC Trust Fund.  Attention is drawn to the non-consolidation of Cork University Foundation and disclosure in the statement of governance of instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is working on a document to summarise all these qualifications in the audit report and matters that have been brought to our attention.  The issue of third level institutions is coming up in our work programme.  We will note it and deal with it as part of our work programme.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 4.2., the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which regulates estate agents and maintains the residential property sales price register.  We note a clear audit opinion.  No. 4.3-----</p></speech>

Obviously, there are common members involving senior people in the college and the trust.  It means that it is a stand-alone fund that is not included in the accounts of University College Cork.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can clarify it if the Deputy wishes to discuss it further.</p></speech>

It is important that the committee in looking at the consolidated financial statements would be aware that there are other sums as well that are outside that which are expected to be available to the universities.</p></speech>

They are normally given for a particular capital development.  In respect of looking at the balance sheet of the university without understanding that these other funds are also available, these funds are a reserve that is available for capital developments.</p></speech>

A company called Campus Services Limited was brought in regarding the governance of the board so this seems to be a problem in these institutes.  I accept that we are coming back to it.</p> <p>  We see non-compliance with national procurement guidelines far too often with many of these organisations, be they colleges or the HSE.  I am uncomfortable that we just note it and move on.  It is incredible that over and over, we see non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  Did we agree that we would come back to that as an issue because it is unacceptable that we just note these issues and there is no further scrutiny of what is happening.  </p></speech>

Again, there was a clear audit opinion but matters drawn to our attention include the fact that the board was late in preparing its accounts and the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the period of account.  That will come up in the summary to which I referred.  </p> <p>  No. 4.4 concerns Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board, No. 4.5 concerns Tipperary Education and Training Board, No. 4.6 concerns Donegal Education and Training Board, No. 4.7 concerns Cavan Monaghan Education and Training Board,  No. 4.8 concerns Kerry Education and Training Board and No. 4.9 concerns Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  All have clear audit opinions.  Any member is free to follow up any matter in those accounts which have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. </p> <p>  Nos. 4.10 and 4.11 concern The Gathering Project 2013 Limited.  We have the accounts for 2014 and 2015 for which there are clear audit opinions.  Nos. 4.12 and 4.13 concern the 2014 and 2015 accounts of the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation Limited for which there is a clear audit opinion.  Are those organisations still alive?  There was zero turnover in some years.</p></speech>

We will write to the Accounting Officer.</p><p> Item 4.12 concerns the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation - that is the one we have just mentioned.  We will note it even though there was no activity during the course of the year.  Item 4.14 concerns the Marine Institute, which has a clear audit opinion for its 2015 accounts.  That completes the review today of the accounts received since the last meeting.</p><p> The next item on the agenda is our work programme.  This takes into account some of the items discussed the last day.  The Department of Defence will be here today and next Thursday the Department of Justice and Equality will be before us to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding annual hours in the Irish Prison Service.  Savings were expected but did not fully materialise.  We will have the appropriation account for the Irish Prison Service.  The following Thursday we have nothing specific.  We had hoped to have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but it cannot come in so that may be a very useful week to complete our work on Project Eagle if we have no scheduled meeting.  We might have to have more than one meeting that week to clear our report.  We will hold that meeting open for the time being.</p><p> On Thursday, 16 February I am suggesting we deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a special chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about levies in the agricultural sector and refunds from the EU.  The following Thursday, 23 February, we will invite the Health Service Executive, HSE, in to deal with two items, the fair deal scheme and patient private property accounts.  We will come back to the HSE on bigger issues but various members have asked to consider these two issues. </p><p> On Thursday, 2 March, we will have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before us to deal with its annual accounts and the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about central government's funding of local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme.  I know members will want to talk about that issue.  On Thursday, 9 March, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will be here to discuss all the chapters in the report highlighting different issues, including the review of medical consultants' tax affairs and tax consultants' affairs.  Many names were published in respect of unpaid tax.  There was a chapter on research and development tax credit and deferral of stamp duty liability and the activities of the Revenue in general.  We will skip a week because the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  On Thursday, 23 March, and the following week we will discuss third level institutions.  Will members contact the clerk to the committee on how we will structure that?  We will deal with each institution separately, allocating an hour or two for each one and then move to the next one.  We cannot have six different institutions here at once because some will be skipped.  We will probably have to bring in the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in the opening slot and we will try to structure a work programme with the third level institutions over those two weeks.  Many people have mentioned that.  </p><p> On 6 April, we will meet the Department of Finance to discuss the Exchequer financial return, the Government and Department's accounts.  It is normal that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the Department of Finance in to deal with the national debt and financial position.  The Department of Justice and Equality will be here on Thursday, 13 April, to deal with the normal Vote plus the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.  </p><p> I have a note of further items listed that we will give dates for in due course, for example, HSE section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Procurement issues come up every week.  We will have to have a session or two on that area.  There are some other outstanding chapters regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's report but many of them will have been dealt with.  We may have some space after Easter to pick a few topics between then and summer.  People may want to bring in some Departments not covered in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to discuss their appropriation accounts.  Is there general agreement on that schedule?  Agreed.  If anyone has comments on it, they can contact the secretariat because it is only a draft schedule and it can move a little as time goes on.</p></speech>

It is estimated the cost could be as high as &euro;700 million which will be very significant in terms of the overall spend and as a one-off payment.

Salaries and allowances for Defence Force personnel, including civilian support staff serving with the military, accounted for 67% of the expenditure.  At the end of the year, just under 10,000 full-time equivalent personnel were employed and remunerated from Vote 36, including just under 9,200 Defence Force personnel.  Expenditure of just over &euro;176 million was incurred on equipment, supplies and other operational costs of the Defence Forces.  Administration costs for the Department of just over &euro;21 million were incurred in the year.  The diagram which members can see now on the screen gives an indication of the relative amounts of expenditure in 2015.  In contrast to other large Votes, the Defence Vote is presented as a single programme.  The detail of spending in note 3 of the account is much the same as that always presented in the past, with the focus on spending by input type.  Most other Votes have moved to output-based accounting, reporting costs for output programmes.  As a result, the Vote account does not give a picture of the costs of particular services provided by the Defence Forces, such as peacekeeping or aid to the civil power.</p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 35, Army Pensions, recorded gross expenditure of &euro;227 million in 2015.  Over 99% of the expenditure related to payment of pensions and gratuities to former members of the Defence Forces or to surviving dependants.  At the end of the year, just over 12,000 pensions were in payment.  The two appropriation accounts associated with the Defence Forces received clear audit opinions in respect of 2015.</p> <p>  Chapter 8 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 concerns the circumstances that gave rise to a decision in August 2014 to dispose of the Air Corps' Gulfstream IV jet.  The 14-seater jet was used in the past to provide air transport for the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials undertaking official engagements at home and abroad.  The Air Corps now provides a more limited service using its remaining seven-seater Learjet 45 aircraft.  The Gulfstream jet had been in service since 1992.  The total cost of acquiring the aircraft was approximately &euro;45 million.  It was sold in January 2015 for &euro;418,000.  I asked for an examination of the transaction because of the unusual circumstances in which it occurred and the accounting adjustments it entailed.  </p> <p>  Following a ministerial direction in 2010, an annual total maintenance cost of &euro;400,000 was deemed by the Department to represent the upper limit that should be incurred on the Gulfstream jet.  Costs significantly in excess of this threshold were incurred in 2013 due to necessary repairs and to treat corrosion.  A memorandum to Government in July 2014 noted that the aircraft would require an overhaul of both engines by 2018-2019 at an estimated cost of &euro;2.5 million and that retention of the aircraft beyond that date would be unsustainable given its age.  Government approval was obtained for increased maintenance expenditure in 2014, up to a total of &euro;750,000, including a provision of &euro;250,000 for an overhaul of the landing gear during the annual maintenance to be carried out by Gulfstream in the USA.</p> <p>  Significant additional repairs were identified during the inspection in July-early August 2014, which increased the total estimated cost for repairs and maintenance on the jet to &euro;1.34 million.  On foot of the escalating costs, the Department sought the views of senior officials within the Air Corps who, while noting the age of the aircraft and the risk of further corrosion or fatigue issues, recommended that it should be repaired and returned to service.  Informal contact was also made by the Department with an Irish aviation consultant company at this time, which advised that an immediate sale of the jet would probably yield less than &euro;750,000 at the prevailing exchange rates.  Gulfstream advised the Department that estimated additional costs to put the aircraft into a serviceable condition prior to a sale would bring the maintenance bill for the year to &euro;1.8 million.  In mid-August 2014, the Minister directed that no further work should be carried out on the aircraft and it should be disposed of for the best possible price.  The Department considered the most viable option at that point was to dispose of the aircraft for salvage and that a public tender competition or auction was not possible because the jet was in a stripped down state in the Gulfstream facility where very high standards of security apply.  Prospective buyers in a sales competition would not have been allowed access to view the aircraft at those premises. </p> <p>  In early December 2014, the Department received a letter, via Gulfstream, from a USA based company who offered &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft "as seen".  This offer was accepted by the Department in January 2015.  The Air Corps also had 87 spare parts for the jet in stock with an original acquisition cost of &euro;1.4 million.  At the end of October 2014, the Air Corps estimated the value of the parts was &euro;405,000.  Ultimately, the parts were sold to the purchaser of the aircraft for &euro;53,000 in February 2015.  The amounts received and the losses on disposal were reflected in the 2015 appropriation account.  I understand the purchaser has further invested in the jet and has returned it to use.  In the absence of a competitive sales process for the Gulfstream jet and the spare parts, it is difficult to conclude whether best value was obtained by the Department.</p> <p>  An inter-departmental group has been charged with preparing a report for submission to Government on the future provision of the ministerial air transport service.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

The Defence sector is made up of two Votes,  Vote 35, Army Pensions, and Vote 36, Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  This is achieved across three strategic dimensions: defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces operational outputs.  The Government's defence policy for the next decade has been set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.</p> <p>  Some 68% of the Defence Vote in 2015 provided for the pay and allowances of the Permanent Defence Force, civilian employees and civil servants, as well as the Reserve Defence Force.  The non-pay allocation provided addresses capability development and operational outputs and includes both current and capital elements.  Non-pay current expenditure of &euro;123 million in 2015 provided mainly for essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.  Capital expenditure of &euro;89 million provided for equipment purchase and renewal and the ongoing upgrade and refurbishment of military barracks and facilities across the country.  Significant operational outputs include Ireland's contribution to international peace and security, and at home, aid to the civil power.  The commitment of personnel to the international domain comprehends peace support operations, under a UN mandate, principally the UNIFIL and UNDOF missions in Lebanon and the Golan Heights, respectively.  Ireland now holds the position of Force Commander of UNIFIL. </p><p>Deputies will also be familiar with the humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Operation Pontus, undertaken by the Naval Service.</p><p> At home and on a daily basis, the Defence Forces provide a range of supports to the civil power, mainly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to assistance to the principal response agencies in dealing with major emergencies, including the severe weather response, missing persons, fishery protection by the Naval Service and emergency aeromedical support missions by the Air Corps.</p><p> The Reserve Defence Force, RDF, plays an important role in supporting the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, mainly through the provision of a capability to be able to augment the PDF in crisis situations.  The 2015 White Paper acknowledged the excellent levels of voluntary service provided by members of the Army and Naval Service reserves.</p><p> The Defence Vote contributes funding to the Civil Defence, channelled to local authorities.  Throughout 2015, the Civil Defence was involved in a wide range of activities throughout the country, including a prominent support role in dealing with the flooding in December 2015.  In response to the impact of severe flooding on businesses in late 2015, the Government established a one-off humanitarian payment arrangement for small businesses that could not obtain flood insurance but subsequently suffered flood damage to their premises in the period from December 2015 to January 2016.  An allocation of &euro;5 million was provided to the Irish Red Cross from the Defence Vote to administer the scheme in 2015.</p><p> Vote 35 - Army Pensions - provides for pensions benefits for former members of the Defence Forces and the dependants of deceased members.  The expenditure, in its nature, is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  It has increased considerably over recent years, principally in line with the increase in the number of pensioners.  In 2015, 12,128 army pensioners were paid from Vote 35, compared with 11,322 in 2010, an increase of 806 or 7%.  This Vote also provides pensions to widows of veterans of the War of Independence.</p><p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million required in 2015 was met by savings on the Defence Vote.  A distinctive aspect of Army pension administration is that military personnel can retire voluntarily at a time of their own choosing rather than at the normal retirement age.  This is usually with pension benefits that are payable immediately.  This is in contrast to most pensions in the public service which are payable on retirement which, in itself, is normally highly predictable at ages over 60 and for which the cost and timing of liabilities can be estimated with much greater accuracy.</p><p> I would now like to refer to Chapter 8 of Volume 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report which deals with the disposal of the Government jet.  As recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is the normal practice of the Department to carry out a formal cost-benefit analysis and a discounted cashflow analysis of life cycle costs which are part of the decision-making process.  It is also established practice to dispose of State assets through a competitive sales process.  In the case of the Government jet, the circumstances were entirely exceptional and decisive action was necessary to assess the relevant options quickly and proceed on the most cost-effective and prudent approach.  The Gulfstream GIV aircraft had been in service since 1992 and was fully depreciated by 2012.  An overhaul of both engines by 2018 or 2019 at an estimate of &euro;2.5 million was going to be required.  The Government noted in July 2014 that retention of the aircraft beyond that would not be sustainable, given its age.  The decision in July 2014 that the jet should be disposed of for the best possible price was triggered by the unexpected estimate for repair and maintenance of &euro;1.34 million.  Disposal for salvage was considered to be the only viable option, given the estimated cost of &euro;1.34 million to repair to a serviceable condition, the absence of any guarantee of future serviceability even after incurring repair costs, the depressed executive jet market conditions and the charges that were accumulating on the service line in the US.</p><p> There is no disagreement with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor that an assessment of costs was necessary.  This was undertaken but conditioned in its approach by the exceptional circumstances.  The assessment, governed by the policy approach limiting further financial outlay, together with the uncertainty relating to future serviceability of the aircraft, meant that there was only one course of action available rather than a set of options.  The decision to dispose of the aircraft flowed from this assessment.  The approach to the disposal of the aircraft was necessarily heavily constrained by the circumstances whereby the aircraft was in a stripped-down state in Gulfstream&rsquo;s facility in Savannah, Georgia in the US.  The normal circumstances in which an asset is under the control of the Department and Defence Forces did not apply and additional costs could only arise the longer disposal took.  In January 2015, the Department accepted an offer of &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft "as seen" from Journey Aviation, a US-based company.  In February, the spare parts which were now redundant were sold to the company for &euro;53,000.  While this differs from their historical value on inventory, it was considered reasonable given that, for the Air Corps, these parts were now redundant and taking account of the nature and age of the parts and the "as seen" sales condition.</p><p> As Accounting Officer for the Department of Defence, I am satisfied with the value achieved in the sale of the aircraft and spares, given the policy parameters set and the exceptional circumstances involved.  There was considerable risk of additional Exchequer costs if appropriate and timely action was not taken.  Our priority at all times is the best use of the funds available and application of these to provide necessary defence capabilities having regard to Government policy, business requirements and safety considerations.</p></speech>

My first questions will relate to the disposal of the Government jet.  I will then ask about Vote 36, to be followed by questions on Vote 35.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the sale of the Government jet points out that since 1992 the jet had been maintained in accordance with the original manufacturer's recommended maintenance and overhaul cycle.  Why then, in July 2014, did it become apparent that the servicing and repair costs would be significantly higher, at &euro;1.34 million, than originally anticipated?  Was this a sudden shock?</p></speech>

We knew, for example, that in 2018 or 2019 we would have a major job to do on the engines.  There are certain jobs that have to be done every year and certain jobs that come up to be done, on a timely basis, based on things like the number of landings, number of flight hours and so on.  One knows the jobs that have to be done and therefore, one can cast ahead.  Unanticipated maintenance costs emerge when something arises with the aircraft which would not, in the normal course, arise through general use.  We knew that the amount of unanticipated maintenance work required would increase the older the jet got and that is what transpired in terms of the corrosion and so forth.</p></speech>

Those costs were growing.  Was that not something that would be scoped?  How did the Department arrive at the figure of &euro;400,000 that was allowed for?  It had to be surpassed on one occasion.  Was there any point in having that figure in the first place if it had to be surpassed and the Department knew it had to be surpassed?</p></speech>

The &euro;400,000 was based on our assessment of the costs that had arisen in the previous period.  We worked out what the anticipated costs arising were going to be and we set that in consultation with the Minister at that time in 2010.  On a monthly and yearly basis, we kept track of what the expenditure was against that.  Obviously, all of the estimates are indicative.  An interesting thing is that in the year in which it was exceeded, if one added the two years together, 2012 and 2013, it evened out.  It it a question of movement in the costs as well.</p></speech>

What Gulfstream does there is strip the jet down quite considerably in order to conduct all of the maintenance necessary.  In effect, the jet was spread out on the workshop floor.  Only at that time when the jet was in that stripped-down state was the further work that was required identified.  We had an ongoing conversation with Gulfstream about the likely cost arising from that.  We bottomed out on the extra cost that it was going to be.</p> <p>  We then had a situation in which we had contracted quite considerable costs with Gulfstream.  Those costs were potentially going to continue to accrue.  We then put together the case and received the decision from the Minister that no further costs were to be incurred.  We then dispatched a team over to Savannah to discuss and negotiate this with Gulfstream.  The team succeeded in limiting the costs that were accruing to us to around &euro;73,000, which was a very good piece of work.  It gave us the space to work out very quickly what the best option for the disposal of the jet was.  Once the decision was taken that no further money was going to be spent on it, the next question was what were the most effective means to dispose of the jet.</p></speech>

How was it marketed and put out there?  How do we know that all possible purchasers were made aware of its availability?

We have the biggest inventory stockholding in the public service.  When one thinks about what it is - weapons, ammunition as well as a lot of military equipment - the priority for us all along always was that I could be assured that we had systems in place where we knew where everything was, how much we had and that we minded it properly.  However, going back four or five years, we started focusing very seriously on driving out inefficiencies from within our inventory.  We tried to prioritise funding into our equipment replacement programmes and so forth to fully equip the Defence Forces.  We got an external review done of our systems around inventory management and stock control.  That is why one can see a gradual reduction in inventory levels.  We also had some recoding to do when our management information system was implemented in 2005.  We have done a huge amount of work on that and it is reflected in the gradual reduction.</p></speech>

Is there a trend or was 2015 a unique year?  Has the Department a work programme for the next number of years to conduct a similar amount of work that took place in 2015 due to the state of the inherited stock and lack of funding down through the years?  It is fair enough if the work is necessary.  Was there a spike in 2015 or is it a trend?  It is fine if it is a trend.</p></speech>

We have had a higher level of turnover than previously, which one can see from the trend in numbers.  We are fully funded for Defence Forces of 9,500 personnel.  We are putting a huge amount of work, with the Chief of Staff, at getting to 9,500 personnel.  That is the one on the Defence Forces side.</p> <p>  I will give the Deputy some statistics on the turnover rates.  We certainly have a higher level of retirements than anticipated.  On the civilian employee side, one loses a lot of people on retirement and age grounds.  At the same time we are looking at how we provide some of the services and capabilities that those civilian employees had in the past through outsourcing.  What one is talking about are State industrial employees, such as plumbers and so forth, who keep our military installations right.  There is a move towards a bit more outsourcing as well.  That partially explains the underspend on civilian employees.</p></speech>

I have a question on PDF allowances, a subject that the public will be very interested in.  Border duty allowances worth a total of &euro;2.8 million were paid to 710 recipients.  In 2017 why in the name of God are we paying Border duty allowances to 710 recipients?  Unfortunately, with Brexit there may be a requirement for us to pay these allowances in the future.  The allowance is an historical one.  Paying the allowance will seem like madness to the general public.</p></speech>

An arbitration report was done at the time, which said that people should hold this on a personal to holder basis so that as these people left the Defence Forces the payment would work its way through.  Nobody, since 2009, has gone on to or is in receipt of the Border duty allowance.  As part of the Haddington Road agreement, we made another approach on the Border duty allowance.</p><p>There is a formula in the Haddington Road agreement to buy out such allowances and that process is ongoing.

Following the changes made in 2004, minimum pension age was 50 years, regardless of rank.  If a person retired before the age of 50 years, the preserved benefits came into play at 60 years.

It was part of the diplomatic mission when the jet arrived at the apron to transport the Head of Government or Head of State.  In his statement the General Officer Commanding, GOC, of the Air Corps references the fact that there would be increased overheads for servicing and so forth.  This was trumped by the financial decision at the end of the day.</p></speech>

Anytime there was an exception, we signed off on it on an annual basis.  We were driven by the policy imperative that the service be kept going.  There was no formal process of evaluation at that stage.</p></speech>

Typically repair costs tend to be in a range such that one would carry out repairs to have a further two or five years of flying time?  What further flying time would one expect to have in spending &euro;2.5 million on repairs?</p></speech>

In spending &euro;2.5 million on repairs the Department would have achieved no more than the continued certification of the engines to enable the aircraft to continue flying.  Technically, they are stripped down and put back together with updates and spare parts.  It is flying time, mileage and landing issues that drive the need for a full service.</p></speech>

I understand the person who bought it has a number of Gulf Stream jets and could cannibalise parts.

From the figures I have, the parts were sold at 3.7% of the acquisition cost, but, of course, that value would have been downgraded over time.  Even at the estimated value at the time, they were sold at a figure that equated to 12.5% of their value.  Was putting them out to tender ever considered to enable people to bid for them?</p></speech>

When we sell a major platform - for example, during the years we have sold helicopters and so on - the parts are included.  Parts are only valuable to us if they are in the aircraft.  The parts were held in an inventory at the original purchase price; some of them were 20 years old.  They are not a normal part of the inventory in the commercial sense which is turned over in the course of a year.  It was very important for us to have these parts.  Many of them were second hand, while some were new.</p><p>It would be fairly normal practice to include the spares.  Additionally, there was no guarantee of any market abroad for those from Ireland.  There was no certification with them that that was where they came from.  Every single nut and bolt in an aircraft must be certified either by a military or civil authority, depending on where the aircraft is.  There was none of that.  This was a block of parts in the Air Corps.  Unfortunately, they had that original cost but they were redundant and have no value to us.  It was a question of moving those on as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It was very expensive.  We can go back to the jet in the US getting to &euro;1.8 million to get it back on the road.  Part of that is certifying all the individual bits and parts.</p></speech>

That accounts for the discrepancy between the cost of acquiring the parts versus the cost at which the parts were sold.  It does not necessarily explain the difference between the estimated value one would receive for the parts and the ultimate value received for the parts.  There is still a major discrepancy between those two figures not necessarily explained by the witness's accounting of residual value.  How is residual value calculated in this case?  Was the &euro;400,000 as calculated way too high or is there simply no expertise in calculating residual value, which is understandable given that we do not sell aircraft parts regularly?  Did we receive below what we should have received for those parts?</p></speech>

These are &euro;1.4 million, &euro;400,000 and the &euro;53,000 that was realised.  The &euro;1.4 million was the original cost and that is how they were held on inventory.  The &euro;400,000 was an Air Corps estimate of putting those parts into use on the aircraft, so there was an assumption of the aircraft flying at that stage.  The third figure is what was realised on the sale.  None of these is necessarily a valuation of the parts.</p></speech>

Going back to the engines, they would not have suddenly started to corrode.  What kind of maintenance programme would they have been on?  Normally airplanes would have semi-annual checks, I suppose, for eight or 12 years.  This theoretical potential cost would not have come out of the blue.  Were measures ever put in place for preventative maintenance?  Military aircraft rules may be a little more loose than civil aircraft rules, as I understand it.  Generally, there would be compliance with international aviation safety assessment programme standards to preserve value if the plane had to be sold, as it was in this case, for example.  What kind of maintenance programme was their to preserve the value?</p></speech>

It is only in certain military aviation cases, where there are no civil aviation standards, that they cannot or would not apply.  We get as close to it as possible and we follow civil aviation standards.  The Air Corps put much work into that.</p> <p>  With regard to the engines issue, the corrosion issue was in the superstructure of the aircraft rather than the engines.  There is a Rolls-Royce maintenance cycle and if the engines are on a jet, tight records are kept of flight hours, landings and so forth.  There is a set cycle and we knew that was coming.  The timing of it could move, depending on the extent of use of the jet.  In other words, once the jet tipped over a certain number of hours, the engines had to go for the service.</p></speech>

It affords the capacity to get off the island and back under one's own steam.  This flexibility would factor into any future decision.</p></speech>

What happens if we need to do a transatlantic flight?  How many of the forthcoming EU presidencies do not have a direct commercial service from Dublin?  We are taking into account the tempo of international business with which the Government is involved and the places one might need to go, as well as the regularity of trips.  We also consider other uses of the jet, such as use as an air ambulance.  We are looking to capture that scope of usage in order that when we go to the market, we can overlay the various options, from leasing to outright purchase.  There are a range of them that we have not got into.  We know what they are but we certainly have not got into expressing preferences on them.  I have statistics on the use of the jet.  The number of ministerial air transport missions has fallen off since the GIV is no longer available.  It is between 60 and 70 for the past three years.</p></speech>

We are very careful to ensure the landbank we have is fully developed and appropriate for use by our military colleagues.</p><p> We have been selling former RDF barracks - a lot of small properties we had that were a drain on us and that we were no longer using.  We have one or two other larger barracks or larger properties that may come on the market in due course.</p></speech>

I will confine my remarks to the sale of the Government jet.  I want to deal, not in policy because the merits of the Government jet are not what we are here to examine, with the policy on value for money.

Stripping away the middle part of it, in terms of Mr. Quinn's response to the sale of the Government jet it is somewhat extraordinary.  Mr. Quinn states that, "There is no disagreement with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that an assessment of costs was necessary.", but goes on to state at the end, "As Accounting Officer for the Department of Defence, I am satisfied with the value achieved in the sale of the aircraft and spares ...".  Essentially, Mr. Quinn is saying that the end justifies the means.  Could Mr. Quinn comment on that first?</p></speech>

The value that was arrived at is not the issue here.  In terms of process, Mr. Quinn states in his opening speech that he accepts the point made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report "that an assessment of costs was necessary".  Is Mr. Quinn accepting that it was wrong not to carry out an assessment?</p></speech>

We assessed costs in terms of the costs arising.  We did not assess costs in terms of an alternative service.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is clear.  It is very simple.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states that in process terms, an assessment of costs should have been carried out.  Mr. Quinn accepts that it was necessary, but there was no assessment of costs carried out.  I am asking Mr. Quinn whether he accepts that he did not do what was required of him.  I do not want to hear about extenuating circumstances.  I am talking about the process here.  If Mr. Quinn accepts what the Comptroller and Auditor General states on which Mr. Quinn states there is no disagreement, that, to me, is accepting that what should have been done was not done.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Is Mr. Quinn essentially saying here that we should not plan for the unexpected in case the unexpected happens?</p></speech>

In any sale, one should do a cost analysis.  I would imagine the company, Journey Aviation, that bought the jet carried out a cost analysis because it was prudent for it to do so.  There were basic requirements here to conduct a full cost analysis and that was not done.</p><p>I will come to the decision-making process, on page 101 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  This refers back to an earlier question that was asked where the general officer commanding of the Air Corps recommended that the aircraft should be repaired.  The report states:</p><blockquote>He recommended that the aircraft should be repaired.  The Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) also recommended that the aircraft be returned to service.</blockquote> <p>That was on 8 August 2014.</p><p>I also ask Mr. Quinn to clarify the following because it is remarkable.  Paragraph 8.15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states: &quot;The Department made informal contact with an Irish aviation consultant company .. .&quot;  What does &quot;informal&quot; mean and how is informal contact different from formal contact?  Will Mr. Quinn explain what exactly this informal contact was, who from the Department contacted whom, who this person was and what level of expertise the person had?</p></speech>

He said an immediate sale would likely be to a parts dealer, which conjures up the thought that the aircraft would be sold for scrap.  Mr. Quinn described the aircraft in the Savannah plant, broken down into parts and that image is in my head.  The contact also stated the likely sale value would be approximately $1 million, or &euro;750,000, but a decision was made to sell for &euro;416,000.  Is that what happened?</p></speech>

We have an image of a jet stripped down in a hangar in Savannah and are being told that an informal contact who was paid just &euro;900 and whose expertise in this area we know nothing about advised that it should be sold for scrap because it had had its day.  It is still flying.  On 23 November 2016 it flew from Paris to New York; on 28 November it flew from Allentown to New York; and on 3 December it flew from New York to Barbados.  It is being advertised here and can be leased.  The advert mentions its amenities - a split cabin for privacy, a full service gallery, a full lavatory, a flight phone, an SAT phone, video monitors and stereo system speakers.  There are nice pictures of the inside of the jet.  I was in contact with the company which had bought it and I am waiting for it to get back to me, but I received a copy of the insurance certificate which I have given to the clerk.  It was reregistered as N297PJ and is insured at a value of $5 million.  That seems to be a far cry from the image of a jet in pieces and which had had its day in a hangar in Savannah.  It is being flown around the world making money for a company which did make a cost-benefit analysis.  That is why I say I have a problem with the lack of due process on the part of the Department.</p></speech>

The minimum cost of repair was &euro;1.34 million.  It is an aged jet and while I will not comment on the service provided by an independent party, we have to deal with the requirements of serviceability for a Government jet.  There were known accumulated costs as it was sitting on the production line, although they were to be negotiated downwards.  It was going to cost a minimum of &euro;1.34 million to keep it flying.  In addition, we would have to spend &euro;2.5 million in 2018 and 2019 on the engines.  We had to take all of these factors into account.  I am not aware of the commercial operation which is flying the aircraft.</p></speech>

As the Accounting Officer who signed off on the sale for &euro;418,000, Mr. Quinn should be aware of it.  The same company that bought the parts that were worth &euro;800,000 bought them for &euro;40,000 and used them to get the aircraft back into circulation.  I imagine that it is making money because the jet is travelling all over the world.  How can Mr. Quinn say we can just put aside proper process and what we need to do - make a proper cost analysis of the disposal of very significant pieces of equipment and assets - on the basis of exceptional circumstances?  Will he talk us through the question of who makes these decisions?  On what basis are they made and can the Department cast aside proper accountancy processes?  Did Mr. Quinn make the decision in the first instance?</p></speech>

The question thereafter was how we could get the best value in the disposal of the jet.  We knew that it would cost &euro;1.34 million to repair it and that we were accumulating costs up to a potential &euro;500,000 to Gulfstream for the work that was ongoing at that stage.  In those circumstances and with the advice we had received-----</p></speech>

His report is very clear and there is no disagreement about it, yet Mr. Quinn is now justifying why these things were not done.  That is completely unsatisfactory.  It has happened on a number of occasions and there are shades of a different process on which we held very lengthy meetings to determine whether we had obtained value for money for something.  In the end we got what we had looked for, but what we have heard today is not good enough from the point of view of ensuring proper due process.</p></speech>

One is the money given to the Red Cross for flood defence.  Is there a breakdown of how much of it went to the Red Cross for administration expenses or did all that money go for flood victims?</p> <p>  My second specific question is on the spare parts.  Mr. Quinn will forgive me for thinking that somebody had to be flying high - excuse the bad pun - with public money.  On spare parts there has been a valuation of &euro;1.4 million.  Mr. Quinn mentioned three figures - &euro;405,000 and then within a few months it is down to &euro;53,000.  I do not think he flippantly said it, but he said that a lot of them were second-hand.  Actually almost half of the spare parts were not second-hand.  Why was no analysis done of the spare parts to see which were not second-hand, which were new?  There is a question about no certification for the parts.  I will leave questions about the jet, as it has been asked by other people.  On the spare parts, how can we go from a valuation of &euro;1.4 million down to &euro;410,000 and within a matter of months to &euro;53,000 and a flippant comment that they are second-hand, when practically 50% are not?</p></speech>

Five million euro was allocated to our Vote and we passed that on to the Red Cross.  A lot of this will come up in the 2016 account because that is when a lot of that was paid out.  A total of &euro;3.1 million was paid to 357 successful applicants.  That is broken down between businesses and community-----</p></speech>

It is poor value for money to think that we only realised &euro;471,000, particularly in view of the fact that it originally cost &euro;48 million.  It is poor management to say that it was sold to the one buyer left.  It was stripped down in Savannah and the only option was to sell it to one person, but that does not seem right to me.  It was not value for money.  If the jet had been repaired at whatever cost and put back into commission, would it have realised more money?  As my colleague said, it is now being used for commercial purposes, so I presume they would not have spent the money unless it was of commercial value.  Did taxpayers here lose money as a result of the jet not being repaired and then sold off?  If so, we could have had several different bidders from all over the world.</p></speech>

If one is selling weapons, one has to go back.  If it is a State sale, one can sell weapons, otherwise one has to go back to the original equipment manufacturer.  The bulk of ours go to Hammond Lane to be cut down.  We are reluctant to sell clothing, much of which will be used as rags.  There are different ways of moving obsolete stock.  One of the challenges we have in the military world is that because we operate in a contingent capacity, there will always be something on the inventory that is never used, but it has to be there if required.  Therefore, the challenge is always to get the right stock policy statements and levels, so that everything the Defence Forces need for whatever reason is available to them.  However, one does not have too much or too little.</p></speech>

I will refer to the Government jet given that everyone else has spoken about it.  Deputy Cullinane referred to its new owners, Journey Aviation, its destinations, including Paris, and its home base of Palm Beach.  I wish the new owners well.  I looked at the flight history of the Government jet, in particular, the number of times it broke down.  Deputy Cullinane stated the jet flew from New York to Paris under Journey Aviation.  In 1997, only five years after it commenced operations for the State, the Government jet broke down en route to Paris leaving the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, on the tarmac.  It also famously broke down in Mexico and the United States where it blocked Air Force One on one occasion and had to be taxied out of the way.  In 2003, it failed to get off the tarmac at Baldonnel Aerodrome when the then Taoiseach was about to fly to Prague for a meeting and an air taxi had to be hired at short notice at a cost of &euro;36,000.  I wish Journey Aviation the best and wish its customers well.  Deputy Cullinane referred to various fancy paraphernalia.  I wonder if the number of times the Government jet broke down was advertised because we are as well shot of that particular aircraft.  As an aside, I know Donald is selling Air Force One and buying a new one.  Perhaps we may avail of that opportunity at a knock-down price.</p><p>To address Vote 36 of the appropriation accounts, there was a slight excess in the outturn for the purchase of military transport.  I note the excess arose due to requirements to purchase additional military vehicles.  I also note that the replacement of heavy armoured cars and troop transporters is planned by the Department.  Before Christmas, I asked the Taoiseach a question on this matter.  Will Mr. Quinn take me through this process because there is disenchantment with the tender competitions run by the Department?  Timoney Technology, an Irish company, is one of the world's leading companies in designing and developing light armoured vehicles, yet it cannot secure a simple engagement with the Department to enable it to illustrate how it could serve our armed forces and the nation.  It is a leading manufacturer and I mention it because we are a small nation and this Irish company is engaged by the Australian military and other military forces elsewhere.  I would appreciate if Mr. Quinn could make a statement on a tender process that would allow for simple engagement to have this company illustrate how it could best serve our nation.  </p><p><b>Mr. Maurice Quinn:</b>The normal process that we follow in the Department of Defence for procurement is open tender.  That is standard practice.  We are also doing a lot of work on supporting enterprise arising out of the White Paper and decisions that were taken earlier.  There is a whole range of vehicles that we are procuring in the period ahead.  I will come to the Mowags.  There are the armoured logistical vehicles and armoured utility vehicles.  Not to labour the point, but the nature of our overseas deployments is such that where troops are deployed in armoured personnel carriers, the vehicles supporting them also need to be armoured so we are doing a lot of work on that at the moment. </p><p>With regard to the upgrade of the 80 armoured personnel carriers we have, which is original equipment provided by Mowag, there was a very long process followed within the organisation to bottom out on what was the most appropriate way of ensuring that armoured capability was available to the Defence Forces into the future.  We had 80 of these vehicles starting back in 2003 I think and the outcome of all of that was that the nature of the work that was required to be done on the vehicles meant that we needed to deal, on a sole source basis, with the original equipment provider.  That was the contract that we awarded shortly before Christmas to GDELS for the work to be done on our armoured personnel carriers. </p></speech>

As Ireland is a small country there are not many companies of this type engaged here in these particular services.  Mr. Quinn referenced the White Paper on Defence.  Deputy Coveney, when Minister for Defence, visited the company I mentioned, as did Deputy Bruton in his then capacity as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is recognised as a world leader in the supply of the suspension systems for armoured vehicles.  What I am asking Mr. Quinn is how a company can illustrate and demonstrate to the Department of Defence that it is capable of meeting the criteria set out.  In a previous response to me on this issue the Taoiseach said that there is constant monitoring to ensure the availability of proper equipment for the Defence Forces, that he had discussed the issue of resources with the Department of Defence and that it had been agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the matter would be carefully examined.  He also said that he hoped the Defence Forces would never be sent out with inadequate or inferior equipment.  That was a hell of a statement by the Taoiseach.  As I said, the company based in Navan in County Meath is supplying hundreds of vehicles to the Australian Army, the US Army and to other armies across the Continent.  I should point out that the Taoiseach later clarified his statement.  Perhaps Mr. Quinn would comment on the willingness of the Department to engage with Irish companies on the process surrounding the purchase of equipment.</p></speech>

There is also the general campaign to get people to join the Defence Forces.  Recruitment is a factor of turnover in terms of the increased rate of loss of members of the Defence Forces, both officers and enlisted, that we are experiencing.  Some 690 people were inducted in 2016.  Recruitment has been ongoing since 2008.  While the numbers have adjusted we are still at the stage of having to run to keep pace with the losses in order to retain the coherence of the force.</p></speech>

A huge amount of work, in terms of best practice and recruitment, has been done to attract more women into the Defence Forces.  It is important in the Irish Defence Forces that every promotion option and so forth is open to everybody equally.  That has not always been the case.  In this regard, the Chief of Staff has appointed a gender adviser.  As I said, there is a huge amount of work being done in that area.  Also, 15% of applications for 2016 were from women.  It is a question of increasing the number of applicants such that more women are recruited.</p></speech>

The bulk of the members are front-line troops.  We also have an Army nursing service but they are not service personnel, they are separate.  There are also a range of professionals across the Defence Forces engaged in other roles.  I would have to reflect on whether or not there is scope to specialise particular roles.</p></speech>

In Mr. Quinn's opinion - I appreciate he may not have expertise in this area - are any of the existing barracks or land banks in the trust of the Defence Forces on behalf of the State in areas that he would deem appropriate for the development of housing.</p><p>That is, are they sufficiently close to urban centres to be used for such purposes, or are they still in active use by the Defence Forces for training, ordnance or other purposes?</p></speech>

We prioritise military training and accommodation.  We would always maintain ongoing oversight of our land bank.  We do not wish to have any extra because it is an overhead for us.  In those circumstances I would not draw a conclusion that there is any land that is more suitable for other use.</p></speech>

I lived in Balbriggan for a number of years and it is close to Gormanston.  Balbriggan is an enlarging community and over the next generation it is likely to expand beyond the boundary of Dublin and encroach in the direction of Gormanston, so at that point it will become unlikely that the Defence Forces will continue to use it for its current purposes.  That is the type of land bank I mean.  To be fair, the area between Balbriggan and Gormanston might be a little too far, but I am sure there are other examples in the country, not known to me as a Dubliner, that might possibly be considered in the future as lands that are not being utilised to their full potential by the Defence Forces.  That is the origin of the question.</p></speech>

I have a serious problem regarding the parts.  It is a fraction of a fraction of the total cost.  I understand the parts going with the aircraft which was sold for parts, and thus one disposes of the parts.  However, the total cost versus the estimated value versus the disposal cost receipt is quite poor, certainly from a casual observation.  Was there a market for the items that were unused?  Mr. Quinn mentioned that some of the parts were used but could be re-used in that aircraft.  The estimated value of the parts in October 2014 was &euro;405,000.  Is that figure correct?</p></speech>

I will take it on trust because I do not know what these parts are worth.  The estimate was &euro;405,000 in 2014 and they were sold for &euro;53,000, as well documented in both the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the Secretary General's response.  Is there a market for the items that were unused, that is, still in the packaging?  Is Mr. Quinn aware of the total number of these parts and whether there is a market for them?  For example, if the Defence Forces had simply disposed of the items that had been used and retained the ones that were still in their packaging, is there a market for those items?  Given the Department's research and the employment of relevant aviation experts, did Mr. Quinn ask that question?  Could he determine for the committee whether better value might have been achieved for the unused parts?</p></speech>

It would be done on that basis where something was sold from within our own property.  It would be included.  As I explained, the spare parts had no certification on them.  They were sold as seen, so there was no come back on them.  It was very important for us when they were sold that there was no liability or come back on the State from the sale.  It was also important that, as they were redundant for us, they were not part of the Air Corps' inventory.  It was done on those bases.  Due to the nature of the way the thing evolved, we did not discuss spare parts with the external expert.  He was focusing on the jet itself.  The spare parts did not, and would not, enter into the conversation because they are after the fact.</p></speech>

I have two further questions.  It is easy to ask this question but, retrospectively, is there regret in the Defence Forces about the Gulfstream IV inventory items they had in stock, which potentially had a value greater than the &euro;53,000 or whatever proportion of the &euro;53,000 that might have been attributable to them, and whether the Defence Forces should have, in making reasonable efforts to achieve the ministerial directive which was to get the best possible value, which included the parts, withheld those from disposal with the jet for the purpose of attempting to realise their greater value?  Let us be honest, we are talking about &euro;53,000.  It is not a vast amount of money.  If the &euro;53,000 figure was not there and the parts were sold with the aircraft, I doubt that the committee would have spent a great deal of time querying the point.  It would have queried the value of the disposal but not necessarily the &euro;53,000, because it is a very small amount.  However, if it was &euro;20,000 and the Defence Forces made &euro;100,000 on new, unused parts because there is a market for them in the Gulfstream IV market, retrospectively, and particularly when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report came across his desk, did Mr. Quinn not sit back and say that perhaps they should have considered this a little more carefully?</p></speech>

There was also the prospect of having a cost of disposal of spare parts.</p><p>All of this was factored in as well.</p></speech>

My final question is on the storage costs, or potential storage costs, in Savannah, Georgia.  Does Mr. Quinn have any idea, or could he estimate, the storage costs for the aircraft in the condition it was in, which he outlined quite clearly and illustrated earlier in response to Deputy Kelly's questions?  The aircraft was in pieces on the floor, of a hangar presumably, in Savannah, Georgia.  The Department found there were excessive expected costs and the decision was made not to exceed &euro;400,000 and a decision was made to dispose of the aircraft.  Clearly the Irish State was going to have costs associated with storage, but I am not sure Mr. Quinn attributed an approximate cost to this process.  Were any other options available to the Defence Forces to return the aircraft to the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

I will confirm the exact amount, but it was between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  This was the contracted amount for work accumulating.  It continued to accumulate.  It was not a storage cost, it was actually the cost of the work that we were dealing with.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#S01900"><p>Clarification is needed on the process, notwithstanding the answers we have received from Mr. Quinn.  Will Mr. Quinn give us the name of the person who gave the informal advice?  Who in the Department made contact with this person who worked in the aviation industry?  What is the name of the company for which the person worked?  Was the person a board member, a CEO or a director?  What level of expertise did this person have?  Mr. Quinn stated e-mails were exchanged with this informal contact and adviser, which underpinned the decision made.  I go back to the earlier exchanges where we had on differences of opinion between the GOC and the person who gave the conflicting advice, which is this informal contact.</p> <p>  There seems to be a more fundamental question, and to restate it for Mr. Quinn so he knows exactly and understands exactly what the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, a cost-benefit analysis is important in the disposal of any asset or equipment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in the case of the Gulfstream jet the Department did not formally appraise the economic case for increased maintenance costs in 2013 or 2014 nor the cost of returning the jet to a serviceable position against the benefits that would accrue from this use.  In response to earlier questions on why the Department did not cost getting the jet back to a workable position and getting it flying again, Mr. Quinn stated a decision had been made by the Minister to sell it.  It strikes me there is a possibility the narrative here is that the exceptional circumstances spoken about by Mr. Quinn are political, whereby a decision was made by a Minister to sell and get rid of the jet and the Department then sought to get whatever information or scrap of paper it possibly could from somebody to justify selling it.  A political decision was made to sell it and get what we could for it.  The Department then sought whatever justification it could from an expert, which is what it got, and it seems the advice previously given by people in the Air Corps was dismissed.  This is something that worries me.  Will Mr. Quinn to respond to this potential narrative?  Will he provide the committee with the specific information I have sought?</p></speech>

On the point about an apparent contradiction between Mr. Fitzpatrick's advice and that of the Air Corps, in fact they are quite similar.  The advice of the Air Corps, which I do not have in front of me to quote, was that given the age of the aircraft and the mileage on it, there was an increased likelihood that further significant maintenance would be required.  Notwithstanding this, it made the request that the jet be retained.</p></speech>

It is the biggest in the State.  Our main objective is to ensure that we have the right inventory for the Defence Forces at hand when they need it in an appropriate quantity, which means not too much and not too little.  We have done a huge amount of work on that.  Senior management resources and teams work on how we are managing our inventory to drive as many savings as we can to get the right levels.  One will always have a situation in the military where there is inventory that is never used.  That is because we are a contingent capacity on behalf of the State.  There is a whole range of scenarios to which the military must be in a position to respond.  As such, inventory is not managed like stocks in a commercial process where one is trying to move stuff off and make a return on it.  We come at inventory from a very different space.  Because of all the work we have been doing on that in recent years, one can see a spike in the inventory for 2015 in the amount of write-offs where we have had obsolete or slow-moving stock.  That is an overhead on us.</p></speech>

I do not wish to prejudge anything we are going to say about Project Eagle, but it seems to be the same lack of analysis.  I do not know whether there is something in the air in that we have Project Eagle and are now talking about a jet.  The Department was under pressure and it sold the jet off.  It had no other option.  Separate from that we have a parallel issue.  There is an interdepartmental group set up with no meetings since last February.  I understand that Mr. Quinn says the Department was under pressure and that other things were happening last year, but it does not strike me that somebody is taking this seriously, learning from it and coming in to say "Sorry".  In fact, Mr. Quinn is not quite saying "Sorry" because the Department disagrees with the Comptroller and Auditor General although it agrees it should have recorded this better.  I appreciate that acknowledgement.  In circumstances where there was no meeting since last February, however, we are not giving the person out there listening a sense that we have looked at this, we were under pressure, we have learned from it and we are changing.  That is what people just want.</p></speech>

I want to take a walk through the figures to give balance to the sensationalist insurance figure that is being presented to the committee with a flourish.  Mr. Quinn might walk through them with me if he does not mind.  The amount received is &euro;418,000, plus the &euro;53,000 for parts.  That in itself comes to &euro;471,000.  The immediate maintenance cost was &euro;1.34 million, and if I am not mistaken, it was &euro;1.8 million with the relevant certifications to get it back out of there and up in the air again.  Am I correct there?</p></speech>

Then we have the engine repair in 2018 and 2019.  The figure given to <i>The Irish Times</i>was &euro;2.5 million or thereabouts, so we will add that to the &euro;2.271.  We come to &euro;4.771 at this point.  If we were to add the annual maintenance costs for 2015 and 2016, which comes to an average of about &euro;300,000 to &euro;350,000, but with a ceiling of &euro;400,000 generally - let us take the &euro;400,000 for the sake of fairness - that would come to a figure of &euro;5.57 million.  Compare and contrast that with the insurance certificate which was presented here with a flourish.  The cost for that was $5 million, and we will subtract about 5% since the exchange rate is not great right now, so that is about &euro;4.75 million.  I have spoken to people in the aviation industry, and there would be two things in the insurance that would inflate the value of insurance on the certificate to take into account.  One would be the lost profit element to the company and the other would be the slight inflation between the list price received for the aircraft and the insure price to the aircraft.  Much like with insurance on a car there would be a discrepancy there.  It tends to be about 5% as well.  Ultimately, if I am not mistaken, the course of action that Mr. Quinn took saved the State money.  Would that be a fair assessment?</p></speech>

We definitely deflected further cost from the State.</p></speech>

That insurance certificate, which was presented to the committee, was designed to generate an unfair headline in terms of financial figures.  If one was to take a listed aircraft of the same specification - a newer aircraft from 1994 currently advertised online for example - with new engines, it would still come to below $5 million in sale price.  Therefore, we need to be very careful in the comparisons and fair to Mr. Quinn in the comparisons, in that there were extremely extenuating circumstances, and he took a decision in real time, and I think that it should be reflected on the record that decision was fair and beneficial to the State.  Would Mr. Quinn agree with that?</p></speech>

I want to pose some questions, if Mr. Quinn will bear with me.  I have a few topics for the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says that on 15 August 2014, the Minister directed that no further work should be carried out on the aircraft, and that it should be disposed of for the best possible price.  Mr. Quinn is saying that a political decision was made.  As the Accounting Officer, what information was provided by Mr. Quinn to the Minister to inform and assist him in coming to that decision?  He did not make that up on his own without some note or memo from Mr. Quinn.</p></speech>

If it is not, it would be good to circulate it here to see Mr. Quinn's rationale as to why he arrived at that decision.</p> <p>  I refer to chapter 8, paragraphs 12 and 13, which trouble me a little bit.  Mr. Quinn spoke about having spare equipment in stock for all contingencies and how it is the job of the Army to always be vigilant, plan ahead and plan for unforeseen circumstances.  The essence of paragraphs 12 and 13 is that the Department, and Mr. Quinn, as the Accounting Officer, were of the view that it would have been highly speculative to produce contingency cost projection that may arise for unidentified or unforeseen problems.  Even the boy scouts have a motto, b&iacute; ullamh, be ready.  Mr. Quinn is saying that the Defence Forces were not preparing for unidentified, unforeseen problems.  What kind of an Army would we have if it was not planning for unforeseen developments?  The Department should always have a note in the event of problems.  That jet could have crashed anywhere in the last 22 years.  There should have been a note on the options to consider but Mr. Quinn is saying that there was no point.  The essence of that is there is no point in speculating or drawing up a contingency plan for an event that we are not sure might ever happen.  The essence of the Defence Forces is to be ready and prepared.  A crash or anything could have happened.</p><p>I understand that when the issue arose you had to make the best fist of it but not enough advance planning had been done.  The Department was caught on the hop when it happened.  It was always a possibility that some fine day the aircraft would run into a problem.  The Department seemed to have zero contingency planning in place.  I am speaking about the lack of a contingency plan.  To put it simply, if the current aircraft, the Learjet, ran into a problem tomorrow morning I would hope Mr. Quinn had a contingency plan in place and would not be stating that the Department did not get into providing contingencies for unforeseen problems.  It is the Department's job to do that.  Do you take the point?  Have you a plan in place if something happened to the Learjet tomorrow?</p></speech>

Let us say it is parked on a runway in any airport tomorrow and some other vehicle hits it, causing damage, and it is out of commission for a day, a week, a month or six months.  What is in place today to deal with that eventuality?  Surely the Department has some options as things can happen.</p> <p>  There was a problem with the first jet and there was no contingency plan in place.  Has the Department not learned anything from that event?  Mr. Quinn should have told himself that the options for a decision would be ready if the Department was ever caught in a situation like that again.  I am not asking you to have made that decision but you are telling me that you are equally as unprepared if something happened to that jet on some runway tomorrow as you were when it happened on that workshop floor over in Georgia.  I am disappointed if that is the response from your Department.</p></speech>

If we lose the jet completely we do not have an arrangement in place to procure an alternative.  If the jet goes out of service we have alternative means of transport available to its users.  We have the standard maintenance plan for the Lear, as we had for the Gulfstream IV in its turn, which is to maximise and optimise the serviceability of the aircraft.  We have that kind of matrix of services available.  We do not have a procurement process for an alternative jet.</p></speech>

Obviously you can lease aircraft, as has been mentioned here, for a day, a month, three months or six months.  Surely somewhere on your desk you have what could be done if you were told the jet was hit by something it in London or wherever and that it was going to be out of action for six months. It is the job of the Defence Forces to have contingencies, that is what armies are meant to do.  I am surprised to hear that you do not have the options at the tip of your fingers to look at.  It sounds to me as if you would go scratching your head if that problem arose.</p></speech>

I ask the Secretary General, when it is appropriate and after the Department has closed its tenders, to send us an information note in respect of what it was seeking as part of this procurement process.

The Secretary General might forward that note.  While he has read it into the record, it was hard for us to catch all that.  Given the fact that the original jet is no longer in commission, what has happened to the people who were involved in piloting and maintaining it?  How are those pilots keeping their hours up?  In other words, following on from what the Deputy asked a moment ago, are some of the planes flying for no other purpose than for pilots to keep their hours up?</p></speech>

The PBN Defender is flown as required by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Cessnas are used for training, as are the Pilatus.  The challenge in the Air Corps is primarily around having a sufficient supply of pilots.  That is the pinch point we have.  Rather than having pilots not fully occupied in their hours, we do not have enough pilots.</p></speech>

I just want ask one last question on the jet.  I have other questions for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the last paragraph of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, paragraph 8.42, he states "In the absence of a competitive sales process, it is difficult to conclude on whether best value was obtained."  That is effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General's final word.  What is the response of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to that conclusion by the Comptroller and Auditor General?  It cannot be happy with a conclusion like that from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

We would also recognise that exceptional circumstances can come to the fore that militate against what we would call normal forensic analysis being undertaken.</p><p>The Minister and Department of Defence deemed that exceptional circumstances arose, for the various policy reasons which the Secretary General, Mr. Quinn, spoke about and the jet being up without wheels in Georgia.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have considered that the Department of Defence's approach appeared reasonable.  Looking back, we can appreciate that there was scope for other approaches.  However, the Minister and Department determined that exceptional circumstances existed and we have to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

The last thing I want to ask about concerns legal costs.  It would not be a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts if we did not hone in on them.  Table 6.5 on page 730 of the Appropriation Account 2015 concerns legal costs.  There were 215 legal cases involving employees and the cost of compensation was &euro;1.783 million.  The legal costs paid by the Department and the costs awarded in that case amounted to &euro;1.475 million giving a total cost of &euro;3.258 million.  The amount paid to employees was &euro;1.783 million and in addition to that, legal costs on top of that came to 83%.  That is very high.  There were 39 claims from members of the public and compensation awarded amounted to &euro;431,000.  The legal costs associated with those awards amounted to &euro;175,000 when the two are added together with the figure being 58%.  Why are legal costs 83% on top of the actual compensation paid when members of the Defence Forces take cases against the Department when they are only 58% when members of the public take cases against the Department?  Does the Department contest cases brought against it by its own employees more vigorously and incur more legal costs than it does when it contests claims brought by members of the public?  Logically, it incurs more legal costs.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  Why does the Department incur more legal costs in cases where it is fighting against Defence Forces personnel compared to, say, traffic accidents involving members of the public?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Quinn" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#X02200"><p>As the Chairman knows, we do not have any direct control over the amount of time and legal costs.  The Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency agree bills of costs and their tax default agreement if necessary.  My analysis of the situation would be that much of that depends on the nature and complexity of the issue being dealt with.  When the State Claims Agency is dealing with claims by members of the public, these claims are, in general, reasonably straightforward whereas when you go through some of the more intractable cases we have had with employees where there are very specific and difficult points of law and the rights of a particular individual are being dealt, they are more complex, take more time and, therefore, incur more costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#X02300"><p>That is an inadequate answer.  I accept that during the course of the year, you can have one, two, ten or 20 complicated cases but we are talking about over 200 here.  The pattern is that we are looking at nearly 300 cases during the year.  It is not a question of some individual cases being more complicated.  There is a clear pattern of legal costs being higher when the Department is dealing with members of the Defence Forces.  Does the Department contest these cases more?  It brings me to the issue of Baldonnel.  A whistleblower produced a report in 2015 regarding the difficulties members of the Defence Forces had in respect of dealing with hazardous waste and chemicals out there.  Mr. Quinn is aware that the Department is responsible and that according to the Health and Safety Authority, the Defence Forces did not have proper health monitoring for its members and did not provide proper personal protection equipment and adequate staff training.  The Health and Safety Authority had to visit Baldonnel three times last year and issued a report in 2016.  Can Mr. Quinn give us a copy of that report?  I know six of these cases are before the courts.  In light of all that, is Mr. Quinn telling me that the Department is going contest liability?  Surely it should be saying "hands up, let's settle this and let's get rid of the 83% top-up cost for the legal profession for wheeling the thing in and out court?"  In how many of these cases does the Department accept liability and avoid the avoidable and unnecessary costs that the State Claims Agency incurs on the Department's behalf?  Many of these costs could be obviated if the Department put its hands up and accepted liability where it is the appropriate thing to do.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  The Health and Safety Authority is telling the Department this.</p></speech>

The first concerns the Health and Safety Authority and the Air Corps.  As the Chairman knows, we have litigation and people who have availed of the protected disclosures legislation so we must be careful in the way we deal with that.  To clarify, the Chairman is correct in that protected disclosures were received in December 2015 and January 2016.  The Health and Safety Authority visited the Air Corps quite soon thereafter.  There was an ongoing conversation between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority, particularly about how hazardous chemicals were being managed.  The final sign off with the Health and Safety Authority was in October 2016.  Quite a comprehensive plan has been signed off on between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority that will be implemented over a number of years so that is all up and running.</p> <p>  Where liability is not contested or where there is shared liability, it is our practice with the State Claims Agency that an effort is made to resolve cases as expediently as possible.  However, when it comes to litigation against the State, there is an obligation to ensure the correct treatment of all cases, which is, as the committee knows, to go into a process of establishing loss or damage and its extent along with cause and so forth.  That process must still be gone through.  </p></speech>

In how many cases did the Department accept liability and avoid going to court?  What were the legal costs associated with the cases in which the Department accepted liability versus the ones where it did not accept liability and went to court?  In some cases, the Department might be defending the indefensible.</p></speech>

From what we see, the State Claims Agency turns over hundreds of millions every year and some of the cases should not have to go to the High Court for settlement.  If there were earlier admissions of liability across the board, we could avoid having the taxpayer pay unnecessary legal fees.  I worry that sometimes a Department might know there is a liability but not want to settle a figure in case the Comptroller and Auditor General says it should not have done so.  Instead, it might decide to let the High Court or the Supreme Court settle the figure.  Whether it is higher or lower, it does not matter because the Department will have covered itself because it did not settle the figure.  The taxpayer is not being well protected in that process.  Does Mr. Quinn understand where I am coming from?</p></speech>
